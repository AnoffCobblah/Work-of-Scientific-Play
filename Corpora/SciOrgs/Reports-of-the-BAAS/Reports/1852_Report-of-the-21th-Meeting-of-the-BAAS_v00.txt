          REPORT OP THE COUNCIIi.                      XXIU

Report OF THE Proceedings of the Council in 1850-51, as presented
   TO THE General Committee at Ipswich, Wednesday, July 2,

    1851.

I. With reference to the subjects referred to the Council by the General

Committee assembled in Edinburgh, the Council have to report as follows : .
   1. Having communicated with Dr. Robinson, on whose suggestion the

General Committee directed that application sliould be made to the Admi-
ralty for the publication of the Reports of their Committee on Metals, and

--having also communicated with the Admiralty, the Council have requested

Mr. James Nasmyth, who was himself one of the members of the Metal

Committee, to undertake the task of drawing up an abstract of the principal

matters contained in its reports, to be presented to the British Association

at Ipswich, or at the Meeting in 1852 ; and the Admiralty, at the request
of the Council, have consented to place the three volumes of the Reports in

Mr. Nasmyth's hands for this purpose.

2. In compliance with the direction that a Committee should be appointed

for the purpose of waiting on Her Majesty's Government, to request that

some means be taken to ensure to the science of Natural History an effect-
ive representation in the Trusteeship of the British Museum, the Council

proceeded to name a Committee ; but in consequence of one of two recent
vacancies in the Trusteeship of the British Museum having been filled up

by the appointment of a distinguished Naturalist, Sir Piiilip Grey Egerton,
Bart., the Committee have not deemed it requisite to make the application

to Government contemplated by the General Committee.

   3. On the subject of an application to Government to institute a Statisti-

cal Survey relative to the extent and prevalence of Infantile Idiotcy, the

Council having ascertained that the importance of such an inquiry had already

been pressed on the attention of Government by the Statistical Society of

London, and that the representation had been very favourably received, have

forborne to take any further step for the present.

4. The Committee appointed at Edinburgh, for the purpose of urging on

Government the completion of the Geographical Survey of Scotland, recom-

mended by the British Association at their former meeting at Edinburgh in

1834, have presented a Memorial to Lord John Russell, showing that, in the

interval of IG years elapsed since the foi-mer meeting of the Association in

Edinburgh, but a single county, namely, Wigtonshire (less than a sixtieth

part of Scotland), has been mapped ; that the surveying force employed in
Scotland, and the funds allotted to that portion of the United Kingdom, have

been very much less than that allotted to either England or Ireland ; and

that on the present scale of procedure upwards of 50 years must elapse be-

fore the map of Scotland can be completed. The Memorial further solicits

Her Majesty's Government to endeavour to obtain from Parliament an
annual grant adequate to the completion of the map in the next 10
years. The Memorial was courteously received by the First Lord of the

Treasury, and has been followed by the appointment of a Committee of the

House of Commons to inquire into the whole subject of the survey of North

Britain.

II. Since the last report of the Council to the General Committee was

presented at Edinburgh, the reply of Her Majesty's Government has been

received to the Memorial drawn up by Dr. Robinson, President of the British

Association, with the concurrence of the Earl of Rosse, President of the

1851.                                               e

Royal Society, and presented to Lord John Russell, recommending the esta-

blishment of a Reflecting Telescope of large optical power, at a suitable

station, for the systematic observation of the Nebulae of the Southern Hemi-
sphere. The reply is as follows :

                                                                           " Treasury Chambers, 14th August, 1850.

  --"Sir, I am commanded by the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's

Treasury to acquaint you, that your Memorial of the 3rd ult., addressed to
Lord John Russell, applying on behalf of the British Association for the

Advancement of Science for the 'establishment, in some fitting part of Her

Majesty's dominions, of a powerful reflecting telescope, and for the appoint-

ment of an observer charged with the duty of employing it in a review of

the Nebulae of the Southern Hemisphere,' has been referred by his Lordship

to this Board                                                           and I am directed to inform you, with reference thereto, that
                                                                     ;

Mywhile  Lords entertain the same views as those expressed by you as to

the interest attaching to such observations, yet it appears to their Lordships

that there is so much difficulty attending on the arrangements which alone

could render any scheme of this kind really beneficial to the purposes of

science, tliat they are not prepared to take any steps without much further

consideration.

                                                                        " I am. Sir, &c.,
                                                                                      " Your obedient Servant,

                                                                                        "G. CORNEWALL LeWIS."

   The Council have communicated a copy of this reply to the President and
Council of the Royal Society, who had concurred in the recommendation

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

accompanying the communication with an assurance that the British Associ-

ation will not lose sight of this important object, and requesting the con-

tinued co-operation of the Royal Society. The specific difficulties alluded

to in this letter have not been communicated by the Government ; but the
Council entertain the hope that they are not of such a nature that time and
further consideration may not remove them. The Council will now conclude
the duty entrusted to them with the expression of their belief that the time

is not far distant when the subject may be again, and successfully, brought
under the consideration of Her Majesty's Ministers.

   in. For the purpose of obtaining from the Authorities of the Ordnance
Department replies which might be satisfactory to the General Committee,

relative to the progress which had been made towards the publication, re-
commended in the year 1846, of the meteorological observations made since

--1834, at the Ordnance Survey Office, at Mountjoy, near Dublin, and also

towards the publication, recommended by the British Association in 1849,
and sanctioned by the Treasury in February, 1850, of the principal geodetic

--results of the Trigonometrical Survey of the British Islands, the Council

requested two of their members, Lord Wrottesley and Sir Charles Lemon,
who are also members of the Legislature, to make the necessary inquiries ;
and the Council are in consequence enabled to state on the authority of replies

received from the Inspector-General of Fortifications :-- 1st. In respect to the

Mountjoy Observations, that " the whole of the observations have been copied

into tables for publication, and the monthly means taken, and that consider-
able progress has been made in abstracting the results; and that the Director
of the Ordnance Survey will shortly have to make application to the Board
of Ordnance to obtain the necessary sanction for the Stationery Office, in

Dublin, to commence the printing of this work " And 2nd, in respect to
REPORT OP THE COUNCIL.  XXV

 the British Arc of the Meridian, that " during the past season (1850) the
 large theodolites have been on two stations in Scotland that required addi-
tional observations to be made from them, so as to perfect the chain of tri-
 angulation ; and other observations are now being made at two other sta-
 tions, at which those made in 1809 and 1841, under unfavourable circurn-
 stances, have proved to be insufficient ; but the Director of the Survey is in
 great hopes that no others will require to be done. The Zenith Sector has
 also been employed during the past season in extending to its utmost limits
 the second largest Arc of the Meridian in the British Islands, viz. from North
 Rona Island to St. Agnes in the Scilly Islands, and in establishing, by direct
 observations, at a station near Peterhead, what had previously been imagined
 to be the case, that a deflection of the plumb line, to the extent of 8 seconds,
 existed at Cowhythe Station, near Portsoy in Banffshire, and that in conse-
 quence, its resulting latitude must be exceptionable. These observations

 and others, including those made at 26 stations, are almost entirely printed,
 and far advanced towards publication. In the office, the reduction and
 examination of the observations, so as to fit them for publication, has been
' steadily proceeded with, but the pressure for the Survey, under the Public
 Health Act, has prevented as much progress being made as could be wished.
 The Director of the Survey trusts, however, that he shall be enabled to
  furnish, for communication to the British Association that will probably
  assemble in 1852, the principal results obtainable from the Geodetic opera-
 tions in Great Britain and Ireland. The Master-General and Board's
  Order, of the 30th of March, 1850, also contemplates the publication of
 the levels in the United Kingdom : this work is also in preparation, and the

  first volume of it is nearly ready for the press."

     IV. Having thus noticed, in the preceding paragraphs of this report, vari-
  ous subjects involving applications to Government, which have been referred
  by the General Committee to the care of the Council, the Council deem it
  their duty to bear testimony to the courtesy with which applications on the
  part of the British Association have been invariably received by the Members
  of Her Majesty's Government, and to their general readiness to comply with
  recommendations so made. The recommendation of a Survey of the South-
  ern Nebulae is the only instance in which there has not been an immediate
  compliance ; and even in this exceptional case, the postponement is accom-

  panied by a full admission of the interest of the proposed investigation.
     V. The General Committee have directed the Council to consider and re-

  port upon such further steps as may appear desirable to be taken in reference
  to the Committee of Members of the Association, also Members of the

  Legislature, appointed to watch over the interests of Science, and to inspect
  the various measures which might from time to time be introduced into Par-

  liament likely to affect such interest. By the original constitution of that
  Committee, as appointed at Birmingham in 1849, it comprised all the Mem-
  bers of the Association who were also Members of the Legislature, and it
  has been found practically that the number of the Members of the Com-
  mittee so constituted, is too large for combined or permanent action. The

   Council therefore recommend to the General Committee at Ipswich, to
  appoint a Committee, consisting of a limited number of Members of the

  Legislature, who are also Members of the Association, for the purposes con-

   templated in the original appointment of the Committee on the 19th of

   September, 1849 ; and they further suggest that the following noblemen

  and gentlemen, being twelve in number, of whom six are Members of the
                                                                                 c2

House of Peers, and six of the House of Commons, be requested to fonn
the Committee, viz.

   VI. A Memorial presented to the meeting at Edinburgh, by M. Kupffer,

Corresponding Member of the British Association, entitled " Projet d'une

Association pour I'Avancement des Sciences Meteorologiques," having been
referred by the General Committee to the Officers of the Association, the
following reply, prepared by the officers, was approved by the Council, and

--transmitted, by their direction, to M. Kupffer:

-- We" Sin,                                     " London, November 29, 1850.

                      are directed by the Council of the British Association to

acquaint you that your Memorial, entitled ' Projet d'une Association pout

I'Avancement des Sciences Meteorologiques,' was duly received, and was

laid before the General Committee of the Association at their meeting at

Edinburgh. The General Committee, hov.ever, feeling their inability to

decide immediately on a subject of such extent and importance, directed that

the Memorial should be printed for the perusal of the Officers of the Associa-

tion                  and, the officers having thus had opportunity of maturely considering
                   ;

the proposal, and having stated to the Council their views upon it, we are

directed by the Council to transmit to you their reply, as follows :
   " ' The Council are very strongly impressed with the advantages that must

result to the science of Meteorology from the prosecution of regular series

of observations conducted on a uniform plan, and extending over a con-

siderable portion of Europe and perhaps of Asia. But the Council perceive

also that there are at present serious difficulties in tiie way of carrying out

such a plan. It would, as they think, be difficult at any time to nominate

for each of the associated countries a Director possessing tlie requisite zeal

and knowledge and leisure ; and the periodical meetings of the Directors

would be found to be a source of extreme trouble. On the other hand, it

would be difficult to induce the various Directors to agree to defer to the

judgement of one Arch-Director. At the present time, when the construction

of some of the most important meteorological instruments is a subject of

active criticism, it would not be easy to establish uniformity of plan. And

it would be difficult to provide the funds which establishments of such extent

must require.

    " и These considerations, in the opinion of the Council, are sufficient to
show that the establishment of the proposed Association must at all times

be difficult. But they cannot omit to add that in the present disturbed state
of Europe the difficulty must be greatly increased. It is known to members

of the Council that state necessities, produced by convulsions which are not

yet allayed, have already caused the withdrawal of some grants for scientific

purposes of which the amount is small in comparison with those which would

be required for the proposed Association, and the Council therefore have not

the least hope that the Association could be established in an effective form
for some considerable time.

" The Council are aware that in France, the construction of some of the
                      REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                                        XXVU

principal meteorological instruments, and the investigation of the theories

applying  to  their  use, have  undergone careful experimental                      investigation
                                                                                                                                       ;

that these investigations are now in the course of being repeated and extended

in England, and that they are probably carried on also in other countries.

For the successful establishment therefore of such an Association, the Council

are disposed to look to some future time, when the construction of instru-

ments shall be better understood, when the purposes of observation shall be

more distinctly fixed, and when the political condition of Europe shall be

more favourable to the co-operation of nations for a scientific object.

   VII. The Council have been informed by a Committee of the inhabitants
of Belfast, appointed in 1848 to make arrangements for inviting the British

Association to hold an early meeting in that town, that all the public bodies
of Belfast, and the Grand Jury of the County of Antrim, are prepared to
renew their invitation for the year 1852, and that a deputation will attend at
Ipswich for that purpose.

   VIII. The Council are glad to havejt in their power to report to the Gene-
ral Committee, and through them to the Members of the Association at large,
that the conduct of the experimental researches proceeding at the Physical Ob-
servatory of the British Association at Kew, has received the most assiduous
and unremitting attention from the Committee of Superintendence, continued
by the General Committee at Edinburgh, and re-appointed by the Council
at their first meeting in November last ; and that the number, variety, and
importance of the researches in progress and in preparation, are such as to

give full promise of the Kew Observatory becoming a most valuable esta-

blishment for the advancement of the Physical Sciences. In such a brief
notice of these researches as appears most suitable for this Report, it is the
purpose of the Council to indicate the objects rather than to explain or discuss
them, for which the meetings of the Sections will afford more appropriate
occasions ; and in this view the Council have requested that the Members of

the Kew Committee who have attended to particular branches of the expe-

riments in progress, will prepare Reports concerning them specially designed
for communication to the Sections, in addition to the Report annually pre-
sented by Mr. Ronalds, whose valuable and gratuitous services are still
continued. In reference to the instruction of the General Committee to the
Council at the Edinburgh Meeting, to communicate with the Government,
if necessary, respecting the possibility of relieving the Association from the
expense of maintaining the establishment at Kew, the Council have not
thought it desirable to make such direct application to the Government, but
they have to report that considerable additions have been obtained to the
pecuniary resources by which the experimental researches are carried on
1st, from the Donation Fund of the Royal Society, and 2nd, from the Go-
vernment Grant, placed annually at the disposal of the President and Council
of the Royal Society, the particulars of which will now be stated.

    1. Б100 was allotted from the Government Grant of 1850 for the purchase
of magnetical and meteorological instruments of a new construction, for a

--trial of their merits at the Kew Observatory. This sum has been expended

' 1st, in the construction of a Vertical Force Magnetograph, for the self-
registry on Mr. Ronalds's principle of the variations of the Vertical Force
jQjyjii  REPORT--1851.

2nd, in the purchase and improvement of M. Regnault's modification of
Daniell's Hydrometer ; and, 3rd, in the purchase of a Standard Thermometer,
in which the accuracy of the temperatures indicated by all the divisions of
the scale has been examined, and is guaranteed by the well-known skill and
care of M. Regnault ; which instrument it is intended to employ in the
verification of thermometers made by artists in this country.

    2. The difficultv in respect to funds for the completion of Mr. Ronalds's

instruments for the self-registry of magnetical observations having thus been
surmounted, the Royal Society have granted to Mr. Ronalds, from the do-
nation fund at their disposal, Б100, to be applied in an experimental trial of
 those instruments for a period of six months ; during which they are to be
worked precisely as in an Observatory, and a minute account kept of every
 item of expense incurred in carrying on the self-registry for that period. This

 experimental trial is now in progress, having been commenced in April.
    3. Б150 has been allotted from the Government Grant of 1851, for the

 construction and verification of standard Meteorological Instruments at Kew,
 and for the purchase of apparatus required for that purpose. The notifica-
 tion of this grant has been but just received, but, by its aid, M. Regnault's
 apparatus for calibrating and graduating Thermometer Tubes has already

 been procured, and steps have been taken for the examination of the different
  kinds of glass which are likely to be best adapted for thermometers.

     4. Б175 has been allotted from the Government Grant of 1851, to Pro-
 fessor Stokes, of Cambridge, for Experiments to be made at Kew, to de-
 termine the Index of Friction in different Gases. The notification of this
  grant is also very recent ; but apparatus has been ordered, and the expe-

  riments will be commenced forthwith.
      With this assistance, the expenditure for the maintenance of the Obser-

  vatory has not exceeded the sum placed at the disposal of the Council for

  that purpose ; and there are no debts.
      In the various experimental researches which have been thus enumerated,

  conducted as they severally are by Members of the British Association,
  whose services are gratuitous, the Council are glad to be able to report, on

  the authority of the Kew Committee, that great advantage is derived from

  the zeal, assiduity and intelligence with which they are assisted by Mr.
  Welsh, late Assistant in Sir Thomas Brisbane's Observatory at Makerstoun,
  whose services the Council have engaged at a salary of Б100 a year (with
  residence), payable out of the Б300 placed at their disposal by the General

   Committee, but not guaranteed of course beyond the current year, which

   terminates with the Ipswich Meeting.

     In concluding this notice of the present state and prospects of the Kew

   Observatory, the Council take occasion to remark, that the liberality with

   which the British Association has nursed the infancy of an establishment,
   novel in its purposes, and not therefore perhaps duly appreciated by

   all at first, has already produced contributions towards its objects from other
   sources, and which in the present year considerably exceed the sum granted

   by the Association itself; and taking into account that the institution works

    well under its present arrangements and on its present footing, and believing

    that its continuance will be conducive alike to the advancement of science

    and to the credit of the British Association, they recommend that the grant

   of Б300 to the Kew Observatory should be continued for the next year.

 or two small vessels to trace the course of the Tides in the Atlantic, with an
 especial view to ascertain the points of divergence and of convergence of
 the tidal wave on the West Coast of Africa and on the East Coast of South
 America, the progress of the diurnal inequality and of the semi-mensual in-
 equality on those coasts, tiie relation of the tides at islands remote from the
 coasts with the tides on the coasts, and the direction and degree of the
 streams of ebb and flow in the various regions of the Ocean.

    The Committee having had brought to their notice the zoological and
 anatomical investigations made by Mr. T. H. Huxley, Assistant Surgeon oF
Her Majesty's Ship Rattlesnake, during the Surveying Voyages conducted

by the late Captain Owen Stanley on the Coasts of Australia and New

 Guinea, and believing those researches to be of the greatest value and to
 throw new light on the structure and history of tribes of animals hitherto
 imperfectly understood,

--Resolved, That application be made to Her Majesty's Government for a

    grant towards their publication, since without such aid the materials col-
    lected and researches made during the Expedition in question cannot be
     placed before the public.

    The Committee, having had brought to their notice the extent and im-
portance of the Botanical Collections and observations made by Dr. J. D.
Hooker and Dr. T. Thomson in the Himalaya Mountains and other parts
of India where they have lately been employed on Botanical missions nnder
Her Majesty's Government and the East India Company, and to which special
attention was directed in the opening address of the President of the Asso-
ciation; and having further learned that other vajuable collections have
lately been made in the Himalaya by Major Madden, Captain R. Strachey
and Mr. J. E. Winterbottom, which are now available; also taking into con-
sideration tiie amount of unpublished materials from the same country still
deposited in our Museums; and knowing that Drs. Hooker and Thomson,
who are both accomplished Botanists, are willing to undertake the arrange-
ment of all these materials with the intention of combining them with former

publications into a general Indian Flora,

--Resolved, That Her Majesty's Government and the Court of Directors of

   the East India Company be requested to give the aid essential for the speedy
    publication of such a work, which they conceive would be a most valuable
    addition to our Botanical knowledge, but which is manifestly beyond the
   means of private individuals. They would further add, that it appears to
   them most important that immediate steps should be taken in this matter
    while the great mass of the Collections is still uninjured by time, and while

 --their description can be undertaken by the very persons who made them,
       a combination of advantages which must soon be lost.

   The Committee of the British Association having had brought before
them the explorations of Captain Richard Strachey of the Bengal Engineers
in the Himalaya Mountains and Thibet, and the desirableness of the speedy

publication of these researches,

Resolved,--Tliat a request be made to the Court of Directors of the East
   India Company to afford to Captain Strachey such aid as will enable hina to
   lay them before the public with such illustrations in Maps and Plates as

    are essential for their proper elucidation.

--Gentlemen of the British Association, I cannot take the Chair

at this meeting, even after the cordial invitation of your General Com-

mittee, without a painful feeling, not only of the general responsibilities of

the position, but also of the difficulties which are peculiar to myself. En-

gaged officially in a science the pursuit of which leaves little leisure for the

employment of time and little freedom for the range of thought, I follow

a philosopher whose investigations have been dispersed through almost

Myevery branch of physical science.  own attendance at the meetings of

the Association has been limited, and my acquaintance with its forms of

proceedings small : and I feel the disadvantage of succeeding in this Chair

one who may justly be regarded as the Founder of the Association. Still,

I have judged it incumbent on me to accede to the honourable invitation

which was pressed upon me ; and to endeavour, by attention to the busi-
ness of the meeting, to render such services to the Association as it may
be in my power to offer, and such as may in some degree compensate for the

Wepartial disabilities to which I have alluded.  meet, not as a body of ac-

complished philosophers, but as a number of individuals, each of us anxious

for the advance of science, each of us sensible that he cannot urge every part

of it by his own personal contributions, but each of us desirous of assisting

it in any direction in which his knowledge or his talents, whether scientific

or administrative, enable him to give efficient aid. Permit me, on this occa-

sion, to meet you on the same terms ; and let me offer you my assurance that,

tliough the title of President may not be connected with the highest talent

or the most universal knowledge in this great assembly, you shall neverthe-

less find that it is not attached to the least industrious or the least ardent of

its members.

It is required by the custom of the Association that at the opening of each

of its meetings the President should lay before the Association such remarks

on the state of those sciences which are included in its objects, and especially

such an account of their progress in the past year, as he may judge suitable

to the time and serviceable for the guidance of the Association in the conduct

of the commencing meeting. I find it impossible to give even the most sum-

mary statement of this nature without alluding to the acts of the Association,

and to the establishment or modification of other institutions connected with

Science or Art ; and 1 propose, therefore, to submit to you the mingled hi-

--story of the progress of Science, of the efforts, the successes, and the failures

of the Association in reference to it,-^and of the state of some other insti-

tutions. In some departments I fear that my account will be extremely de-
fective : ,1 trust, however, that those of my hearers who may be sufficiently

interested in this Address to notice its omissions will not fail to use the op-

portunities of various kinds which the discussions in the Sectional meetings

afford for supplying them.

Commencing, then, with the subject which stands first in the Reports of

the Association, and on which the funds of the Association have been most

generously expended and its influence very energetically employed, I remark
that the progress of Astronomy in the last year has been very great. The

Earl of Rosse has been much engaged in experiments on the best methods

of supporting and using his large mirrors. The construction adopted some

time since is still retained                                                                                                namely, a system  of levers distributing their
                                                                                                                         ;

pressures uniformly over eighty-one points, each pressure being transmitted

through a small ball which permits to the mirror perfect freedom of slipping
in its own plane, so as to take proper bearing in the chain or hoop which

supports it edgeways. To Lord Rosse's critical eye the effect even of this

imounting, though greatly superior to that of any preceding, is not quite

perfect. In the progress of the experiments, some singular results have been

obtained as to the set which a metal so hard as Lord Rosse's composition

Amay receive from an unequal pressure of very short duration.                                                                                 surface of

silver, I believe, has now been successfully used for the small reflector. Of

the character of the discoveries in nebulae made with this instrument I can-
not briefly give any very correct idea. The most remarkable is, the disco-
very of new instances of spirally-arranged nebulae : but there are also some

striking examples of dark holes in bright matter, dark clefts in bright rays,
ADDRESS.  xli

and resolvability of apparently nebulous matter into stars. I do not deny
the importance of the last observation ; but as it might be predicted before-
hand that the increase in the dimensions of telescopes would lead to more
extensive resolution of nebulae, I do not hold the inference* to be by any
means certain that all nebulae are resolvable. Mr. Lassell exhibited at the
last meeting of the Association a plan for supporting his two-feet mirrors
without flexure. This plan, slightly modified, has been adopted in use : and

I am assured that the improvement in what before seemed almost perfect
definition is very great. The removal of the vexatious fiscal interferences

with the manufacture of glass, and the enterprise with which Mr. Chance as
manufacturer and Mr. Simms and Mr. Ross as opticians, have taken up the
construction of large object-glasses, promise to lead to the most gratifying
results. Already Mr. Simms has partially tested object-glasses of 13 inches
aperture ; and one of 1 6 inches is waiting not for the flint but for the crown
lens. Mr. Ross, it is understood, has ground an object-glass of 2 feet
aperture ; but it has not been tested. The facility of procuring large object-
glasses will undoubtedly lead to the extensive construction of graduated in-
struments on a larger scale than before ; and it is in this view that I contem-
plate as a matter of no small importance the erection (this year) of the large
transit-circle at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. It is known to many
members of the Association that this instrument was constructed in this town,

by Messrs. Ransomes and May ; and for the admirable proportions of its

various parts, for the firmness of fitting of the few portions of which it is

composed, and for the accuracy of the external forms of pivots, &c., it may

well be considered as one of the finest specimens of engineering that has ever

been produced. As an example of an excellent mechanical structure carry-
ing a large object-glass, I think it probable that this Greenwich transit-circle
may have a great influence on the construction of future instruments. I had
hoped to be able by this time to report to the Association on the American
method of recording transits, by a puncture or dot produced by a galvanic

--agency whose circuit is closed by a touch of the observer's finger, and espe-

cially on its fitness for the wants of a really active observatory ; but the de-

lays of construction have prevented me from doing so. Shortly before the

last meeting of the Association, the President for the time (Dr. Robinson)
transmitted to the Government, on the part of the Association, a general
request that a large reflecting telescope might be sent to some of the British
possessions in the southern hemisphere, for the purpose of observing the
southern nebulse ; and shortly after that meeting an answer was received
from the Lords of the Treasury, to the effect that their Lordships entirely
recognised the importance of the object, but that there appeared to be prac-

                                                                          d2

tical difficulties in the immediate execution of the design. I cannot doubt
that when a more explicit plan has been formed, another representation will
be accompanied with the same success which has attended every application
made by the Association for aid in a carefully arranged design. It will be
interesting to the Association to learn that the continuation of the observa-

tions on a Centauri at the Cape of Good Hope has fully confirmed the result

--first obtained, namely, that the parallax of that star exceeds nine-tenths of

a second, or that its distance from the sun is about twenty billions of miles.
So far as we have the means of judging, this star is our nearest neighbour in
the sidereal spaces. The attention of foreign astronomers is still directed to
the irregularities in tlie proper motions of stars, and the opinion seems to be

gaining ground that many of them are accompanied by non-luminous com-
panions. In our own solar system, the most remarkable discovery is that
(made independently, though on different days, in America and in England)
of a dusky ring interior to the well-known rings of Saturn. It now appears
that it had been seen several years before ; but it then attracted no attention.

How such a ring is composed, and how sustained, are questions upon which

perhaps the physical astronomer may long employ himself. But the disco-

very for which the year will be most frequently cited is that of tliree addiФ

--tional planets, included in the same planetary space between Mars and Ju-
--piter in which eleven others had been previously found. The last of these

(Irene) discovered by Mr. Hind, observer in the private observatory of Mr.

--Bishop, forms the fourth of his list, and makes his number the greatest

that any one man has ever discovered. Some time since, a grant was made
by the British Government for the perfection of the Lunar Theory and Lunar
Tables on which Prof. Hansen, of Gotha, had been engaged, but whose pro-
gress was stopped by the interruption of funds in consequence of the unhappy

Schleswig-Holstein war. I understand, that with the aid of this grant,
equally honourable to the British Government and to the foreign philo-

sopher, the work is now rapidly advancing. I have reason to believe that
the theories of Uranus and Neptune are now undergoing careful revision
and I trust that one of the elements most urgently required, namely, the
mass of Neptune, will be supplied from observations of Neptune's satellite
made with the large telescopes to which I have alluded.

   At the Edinburgh meeting, the attention of the Mathematical and Physical
Section was called by M. O. Struve (there present) to the total eclipse of
the sun which is to occur on the 28th day of the present month ; and the
General Committee appointed a Committee of members of the Association
to draw up Suggestions for the observation of the eclipse. These Suggestions
have been extensively distributed both at home and abroad : and I am happy
ADDRESS.  Xliii

 to announce one of the results. After consideration of the singular appear-
ances observed in the eclipse of 1842, it was determined by the Committee
to recommend (among other things) that observing stations should be se-
lected, if possible, in triplets : the three stations of each triplet having rela-
tion to the north boundary, the centre, and the south boundary of the shadow.
The Russian Government has fully adopted this suggestion ; and has actually
equipped six triplets, including in all eighteen stations, with observers and
instruments for the observation of the eclipse. Russian officers in the Sea
of Azov and the Black Sea will also observe it. Since the issue of the Sug-
gestions, the observations made last year on an eclipse visible at Honolulu
in the Sandwich Islands have been received ; and they make us, if possible,
still more desirous that the spirit of the Suggestions should be complied
with, as far as possible. There is only one subject of regret connected with

--this remarkable eclipse, namely, that it will deprive us of the assistance of

several astronomers who would undoubtedly have joined this meeting but

for the necessity of being ready, at definite points, for the observation of the
phsenomena.

   Among subjects related in some measure to astronomy, I may first allude
to M. Foucault's experiment on the rotation of the plane of a simple pen-

dulum's vibration ; an experiment which has excited very great attention
both in France and in England, as visibly proving, if proof were necessary,

the rotation of the earth. It is certain that M. Foucault's theory is correct,

but it is also certain that careful adjustments, or measures of defect of ad-
justment, are necessary to justify the deduction of any valid inference. For

want of these, the experiment has sometimes failed. The Council of the

Association have long regretted the very great delay which has occurred in
the publication of the geodetic results of our great National Survey ; and
they were prepared some time since to represent strongly to the Government
the expediency of taking immediate steps for completing the few calculations
which yet remained to be made, and for publishing the whole in a form

Onwhich should be available for discussions of the figure of the earth.

communicating with the Royal Society they learned that that body had made
an urgent recommendation to the same tenor, and that in consequence
Government had consented to place on the Estimates a sum of money ex-
pressly for the purpose of completing and publishing the scientific portions
of the survey. I have received official information that this work is now in
active progress ; and I cannot but remark on it as a striking instance of how
much may be sometimes effected for the purposes of science by simply com-
pleting what i^ nearly complete. The great Swedish and Russian Arc of
Meridian, from the North Cape to the Danube, is so far advanced that its

completion is expected in the present year.

REPORT. 1851.

   At the last meeting of the Association, a Committee was appointed ex-
pressly to urge on the Government, what had long excited the attention of

the Association, the defective state of the Survey as regards Scotland. I am
happy in stating that there is strong reason to hope that a large sum will in

future be appropriated to the Scotch Survey. Whether this be considered
as giving to the country the advantages of an accurate territorial map or as

--aiding in a most peculiar degree in geological inquiries, in either point of

view it is a matter of interest to the Association, and it will be a matter of
satisfaction to them that, mainly through their representation, this object has

been attained.

    The next subject to which the influence of the Association was ener-
getically directed is. Terrestrial Magnetism ; with which Meteorology has
usually been associated. Although the active employment of several of the

Colonial Magnetic and Meteorological Observatories has terminated (those

only of Toronto, Hobartown, Cape of Good Hope, Madras and Bombay
being retained, and only in partial activity), the work connected with them
has not yet ceased. Much has yet to be done in the printing and discussion

--of the observations : a work going on under the care of Col. Sabine. In

 tacit association with the representative of the Government, the agents of the

 Association are employed at the Kew Observatory, under the superintend-
ence of Mr. Ronalds, in devising or examining new instruments. The Da-

 guerreotype method of self-registration (which is perhaps liable to this ob-

jection, that the original records are destroyed) has been extended to the

 vertical-force instrument. Apparatus has been arranged for the graduation

--of original thermometers a subject to which the attention of M. Regnault

 and Mr. Sheepshanks had been advantageously directed. And, with the
 assistance of a portion of the sum placed by the Government at the disposal
 of the Royal Society (to which I shall hereafter refer), it is hoped by the

 officers of the Association that the Kew Observatory will be made really

 efficient for the testing of new instruments. Dr. Robinson's very instructive

 account of his new anemometer has lately been received : this instrument,

 however, has not yet been used in many places. Among the immediate de-
 ductions from magnetic observations, I may specially mention Col. Sabine's

 remarks on the periodical laws discoverable in disturbances apparently of the

 most irregular kind, and M. Kamtz's corrections of the Gaussian constants.

 Among the more distant results, there is nothing comparable to the experi-

 mental inquiries into the magnetic properties of oxygen, and especially into

--the variation of its power, made by Messrs. Faraday and Becquerel, and

 the application of these results to the explanation of the phsenomena, in

 almost all their varied forms, of so-called terrestrial magnetism. It is to the

 former of these philosophers that this great step in the explanation of obscure
ADDRESS.                                               Xlv

natural phaenomena by inference from delicate experiments, is mainly or
entirely due. Much, of course, remains to be done, before we can pronounce

accurately how far this principle enables us to account, without reference to

any other cause, for the regular changes, as well as for the capricious disturb-

ances, in ordinary magnetism. I ought not to omit stating that such general

explanation had long ago been suggested in a very remarkable paper by

Mr. Christie; but the experiments actually applying to the magnetic pro-

perties of oxygen were unknown, and perhaps impossible, at that time. In

the science of abstract magnetism, the distinction between paramagnetic and

diamagnetic substances has been thoroughly worked out by Mr. Faraday,

and is now received as one of the most remarkable laws of nature. In the
related subject of Galvanism, although much of detailed law has been esta-

blished by the labours of the same great man and of others, it is difficult to

fix upon any new law of general character. Experiments made in America

seem to establish that the velocity of the galvanic current in iron wires of a

certain size does not exceed fifteen or eighteen thousand miles per second

a much greater speed, however, is inferred by M. Fizeau, from the same ex-

periments. The first part of an elaborate mathematical theory of Magnetism,

by Prof. Thomson, has been published. In Meteorology, some striking facts

have been collected and arranged by Col. Sykes in regard to India, by

Messrs. Schlagintweit in regard to the Alps, and by M. Plantamour in the

comparison of observations at Geneva and the Great St. Bernard ; and some
very unexpected facts have been extracted by M. Arago from the obser-

vations in a balloon ascent at Paris. The systematic collection of observa-

tions of luminous meteors, in Reports by Prof. Powell, printed in the volumes

of the Association for the last two years, can scarcely fail to lead to some

discovery of the origin and nature of those mysterious bodies. An extensive

series of meteorological observations had been made at the Ordnance Survey

Office at Mountjoy, near Dublin, and the Association some years since re-

commended to the Government the early printing of those observations. I

have the gratification of stating that considerable progress has now been

made in preparing them for the press.

At the last meeting of the Association a project was laid before the Ge-

neral Committee by M. KupfTer, for the formation of a Meteorological Con-

Afederation, to be extended over the whole of Europe.  very extensive

organization, covering almost the whole Russian Empire, has already been

created. The Council, to whom this project was referred, after very careful

consideration, deemed it inexpedient to join in the proposed Confederation.

They were deterred by various practical difficulties, of which some may per-

haps always exist, while others are felt with unusual force at the present

time. It was with extreme unwillingness that the Council adopted this reso-
xlvi                                                     REPORT. 1851.

lution, and with the full hope that at some future time a confederation similar

to that proposed by M. Kupffer may be firmly established.

Under the auspices of the Board of Ordnance, the officers of the corps of

Royal Engineers are making arrangements for the establishment of a uniform

system of meteorological observations, of a simple kind, at the principal en-

gineers' stations in every part of the earth. If with these could be combined

occasional trustworthy observations at sea, we should probably have the most

complete system of Terrestrial Meteorology that we can hope to obtain.

   Among systematic observations of less ostentatious character, I cannot

omit referring to the daily report of the state of the wind at 9 o'clock every

morning, which is supplied by the superintendents of railway stations, over a

great portion of the British Isles, and printed in the Daily News newspaper.

  A new Meteorological Society has been formed, which (I believe) is at

--least in this respect superior to those which have preceded it that the in-

struments used by the various amateur members are strictly comparable

great attention having been given to the adjustments of the instruments, by

the Secretary, Mr. Glaisher.

In Optics, two or three investigations of rather important character have,

since the last meeting of the Association, attracted public attention. Expe-

MM.rimental measures of the velocity of light in air and in water, made by

Foucault, Fizeau and Breguet, with apparatus nearly similar to that em-

ployed long ago for analogous purposes by Mr. Whealstone, appear to leave

--no doubt tliat the velocity in water is less than that in air, a most import-

Aant, and indeed critical, result in regard to theories of light.       remarkable

investigation by Prof. Stokes, when compared with experiment, seems to

establish that the vibrations constituting polarized light are, as for other

reasons was supposed by Fresnel, perpendicular to what is usually called the

plane of polarization. Some optical theories which admitted formerly of

very imperfect mathematical treatment have been brought under the domi-

Anion of analysis by Prof. Stokes's powerful methods of investigation.

curious series of experiments on diffraction has been i^ublished by Lord

Brougham                                                 but they have at present no bearing on theory, as the theoretical
                                                      ;

calculations with which they must be confronted appear to be too difficult

or too complicated for the present state of pure mathematics. The experi-

ments of Jamin regarding the reflexion of polarized light under peculiar

circumstances appear to give support to the theoretical calculations of Cauchy,

founded on a molecular hypothesis applied to the undulatory theory. And

lastly, some curious experiments by Masson, Jamin, Prevostaye, and Desains,

appear to show more fully, what had partially been shown by Prof. Forbes,

that radiant heat admits of polarization in all respects similar to that of light.

I hope that we shall receive at this meeting, or shortly, two Reports on
                                                                          ADDRESS.                          xlvii

subjects connected in some measure with those which I have just mentioned.

One is from Prof. Stokes, ' On our knowledge of the Theory of vibratory

--Motions of Bodies in general,'                                          Onthe other from Prof. Willis, '  Acoustics.'

Our volume of Reports lately published contains a very complete account,

by Mr. Hunt, of the present state of our knowledge in regard to the chemical

effects of solar radiation.

   In the subject of Chemistry, I am not aware that any gi-eat step has been

made ; although there have been numerous small advances in establishing

chemical relations and in inventing chemical processes.

   The subject of Geology has always excited much interest in this Associa-
tion. It is a matter of congratulation that the Museum of Economic Geo-

logy is now established in a habitation as well as in a form which guarantee

its permanent and useful existence. Among subjects bordering on Practical

Geology, I may allude to the late inquiries respecting the supply of water

from the chalk and Bagshot sand districts as likely to give valuable information.

In Speculative Geology, the labours of European as well as American geo-

logists have been continued with their usual ardour, and there are now com-

paratively few parts of the world which have not been in some degree geolo-

gically examined. Far be it from me to pretend to assign with exactness

specific discoveries (in observation or in inference) to specific persons ; to

say precisely what has been done by Sedgwick, what by Murchison, what by

--Lyeli, what by Verneuil, or even to state with accuracy what discoveries in

the aggregate have been made by all. So far, however, as I can gather, the

principal step made (not in the last year but in the last few years) has been

of this kind. The line between the chalk group and the lowest tertiary or

Eocene group has been drawn principally by Sir R. Murchison with great

distinctness                                           and this has been  done  rather  by palaeontological criteria than
                                                    ;

Aby reasonings from order of superposition, &c.                                         very great step has been

made in the classification of the geology of Asia Minor, with the aid of this

new light, by a foreign geologist, M. Tchihatchef, now present. In the

course of these investigations, attention has been drawn to the magnitude of

--the disturbances exhibited in these comparatively modern beds, and the

question has again been raised in the minds of geologists, whether these

disturbances can be referred to causes now in action. It would be wrong,

however, even in this hasty glance, to omit to notice the discovery of traces

of the tortoise in beds so low as the lowest Silurian rocks, affording (appa-

rently) evidence of the existence of this animal at a much earlier time than

had usually been ascribed to it. I should be sorry also to make no reference

to Sir C. Lyell's calculation of the time of formation of the delta of the Mis-

--sissippi or to Prof. J. Forbes's paper on the modern extinct volcanos of the
xlviii  --REPORT. 1851.

Vivarais. I may refer with satisfaction to Mr, Mallet's elaborate 'First

Report on Earthquake Phsenomena' (lately published in our annual volume),

--shortly to be followed, I trust, by a second ; and I may also remind my

hearers that the Association have supplied funds for the construction of a
machine for earthquake registration, of which the superintendence is entrusted

to the same gentleman.

   On Zoology and Animal Physiology I can scarcely venture to offer you a

report, beyond a reference to the three papers on Marine Zoology in our last

--volume, which I conceive to possess the very highest value. I cannot,

however, omit all notice of the last Electro-physiological investigations of
Signor Matteucci : investigations which seem to draw more closely the rela-
tions of inorganic matter with organic and animated structure than any others

with which I am acquainted.
   In Vegetable Physiology I must speak in a manner equally undecided.

But I need scarcely allude to the interest excited among botanists by the
return of Dr. Hooker from his botanical expedition of some years' duration
into Upper India and Thibet : an expedition accompanied with great personal
danger (for the botanist was for some time detained as captive by one of the
native princes), and in which, moreover, the physical geography of a large
and hitherto unknown region has been established. In the course of this
expedition, a peak 28,000 feet high was partially climbed. In European
Botany the inquiries into the reproduction of cryptogamous plants appear to
have occupied the most prominent place. I would call your attention to the
continuation of the Report on the Growth and Vitality of Seeds, which forms

--part of our last volume, and to the Report, which I trust we may soon

receive, on the probable effects of the destruction of Tropical forests.

   Before quitting the subject of Natural History, I am bound to allude to

one subject of great interest to natural philosophers in every branch. It

had long been matter of regret to many of the most active members of this
Association that the constitution of the immediate ruling body in the British
Museum appeared scarcely to offer to them sufficient security for the due
support of those natural sciences for which, in a great measure, the Museum
was originally founded. So strongly had this been felt, that the Council
were prepared to solicit the immediate attention of Government to that point.
I am happy now to state that, without the exercise of this interference, the
principal ground of alarm has been removed by the appointment of Sir Philip
Egerton as one of the Trustees of the British Museum.

    I must omit allusion to Geography, Ethnology and Statistics, and proceed

myto final subject.

    Engineering and Manufacturing Science have always commanded a great
ADDRESS.  xlix

$hare of the attention of this Association. The former, indeed, when it is
made to include experiments on Tides and analogous pheenomena, becomes

almost one of the cosmical instead of one of the constructive sciences. It
would be an endless task for the most accomplished mechanic to attempt to

describe to you the inventions which are constantly made in every part of
manufacturing science. Confining myself to engineering science, I may
state, that in the present partial suspension of railway works, and since the
great achievement of the raising of the Britannia Bridge, there appears to be
little which has strongly fixed public attention. Considerable importance,
however, is attached by engineers to some of the processes lately introduced,

--especially that of thrusting down an air-tight tube or elongated diving-

bell, supplied with air at the proper pressure, by which men are enabled to
perform any kind of work under almost any circumstances, and in which
men or materials may be transferred without disturbance of the apparatus,
by a contrivance bearing the same relation to air which a common canal-lock
does to water. Improvements have also been made in the application of
water-pressure to various mechanical purposes. Some years ago, an exten-
sive inquiry into the practical uses and properties of various metals was
made by a Committee appointed by the Board of Admiralty. It appeared
to the Association a matter of great interest that the Reports of this Com-

mittee should be published ; and, on their applying to the Admiralty, in-
structions were immediately given for placing the original Reports in the
hands of the Council of the Association. The Council have requested Mr.
James Nasmyth to draw up an abstract of the principal contents of these
Reports ; and this abstract, I hope, will be presented to the present meeting
of the Association. Other Reports on important engineering subjects, for
which requests were made by the General Committee at the Edinburgh
meeting, will, I trust, be communicated to the present meeting. In treating

of Practical Mechanics, I may perhaps with propriety allude to the investi-
gations which have lately been made by able engineers regarding the Me-
chanical Equivalent of Heat. The subject, in this form, is yet new ; but I

think that the importance of an accurate determination cannot be overrated.
This also appears the proper place for alluding to a subject which has at-

--tracted the attention of the Association from its very first formation namely,

the simplification of our Patent Laws. The measures of the Government on
more than one occasion have shown that they are desirous of removing the
inipediment which, in this country (strange to say) more than in any other
in the world, have been placed in the way of mechanical inventions.

   I cannot quit the subject of Manufactures without alluding to a thing
which is, so far as I know, perfectly unique in the history of the world,--
--1 REPORT. 1851.

mean the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations. On

the present occasion I can do little more than respectfully refer to the interest
taken in its establishment by His Hoyal Highness Prince Albert, without
whose zealous support and continued superintendence the undertaking never
could have been brought to maturity. I am, however, compelled to cite the
labours of His Royal Highness in the cause of the Exhibition, as well as the
visit witli which in a few hours we hope to be honoured, as a proof how
much is common to his desires and to ours. The ultimate effects of an en-
terprise so vast, so novel, must yet be matter of vague conjecture ; but one

--thing can scarcely be doubted and in the presence of the many distinguished

--foreitrners near me I see an incontrovertible argument for it, that the Exhi-

bition will have the effect of uniting more closely than ever the separate
nations of the earth by the ties of commerce, of hospitality, and of mutual

esteem.
    There are two matters, applying generally to the whole of the subjects of

which I have spoken, that require notice on the present occasion. The

first which I have very great pleasure in stating, is, that in this year, for the
second time, the First Lord of the Treasury has spontaneously placed at the
disposal of the Royal Society the sum of 1000/., to be employed at their dis-
cretion in assisting private scientific enterprise. The second is, that it is
proposed by the Council of the Association so to modify the organization of

the Committee of members of Legislature who are also members of the As-
sociation as to make it a really efficient body for the purpose of watching
the course of legislative measures which may affect the progress of science.

    From this very imperfect sketch of the progress of science and of the

--Association, two things, I think, will be perfectly clear : first, that there

has been no slackness in the progress of science during the last year or the
last few years, as compared with that in preceding years ; secondly, that in
 this progress the British Association has taken a most active and efficient
 part, in all the ways in which it is possible for it lo act, by the private labours
 of its members, by the discussions in its Sections, by the preparation of
 Reports, by the corporate action of the Association in granting money for
 purchase of instruments and expense of experiments, by its co-operation with
 other scientific bodies, and by its immediate influence on the Government.
 It would not be easy to compare the values of the different results produced

 in these different ways. Those persons who enter actively into the pro-

 ceedings of the meetings will set a very high estimate on the personal inter-

--course and oral discussion of the Sections ; those who purchase its publica-

 tions are unanimous in regarding its series of Reports as one of the most
 precious collections of documents ever given to the public ; while others
                              ADDRESS.                       11

regard as one of its most beneficial effects its influence on the Legislature

and on the Executive.

   Perhaps this may be a proper opportunity for remarking on the constitu-
tion of the Association, and on the mode in which its influence has been
acquired and the rules which its structure imposes on its actions. By con-
sidering it in relation to other institutions of our country, we shall discover

the fitness of its arrangements for the purposes contemplated in its institution

and by studying on the broad scale the history of the past, we shall learn to

guide ourselves for the future.

   One of the strongly-marked distinctions between Britain and the other
states of civilized Europe is this, tliat we have no Academy of Sciences sup-
ported by the State for the express purpose of advancing Science. Even

our Universities do not, in their institution, possess this character ; they are

--essentially places of education only, although, incidentally, they have ren-

dered inestimable service to Science. And this absence of Government-

Science harmonizes well with the peculiarities of our social institutions. In

Science, as well as in almost everything else, our national genius inclines us

to prefer voluntary associations of private persons to organizations of any

kind dependent on the State.

It is not to be expected that this condition of things will be perfectly

satisfactory to every individual ; and, indeed, a wish has sometimes been

expressed that an Academy of Sciences were established in Britain. In this

Awish I, personally, do not join.  great German poet and historian, who

was also a profound and practical thinker, has ascribed the boldness and the

originality of German literature to the circumstance that it was not encouraged

by the most distinguished German princes. He regarded the tendency of
such patronage as enfeebling and almost calamitous. I am inclined to apply

the same remark, at least to some extent, to Science. I gratefully acknow-

ledge the services which Government has rendered to Science by acceding
to the recommendations of this and other bodies who have indisputably esta-
blished claims to their attention ; I think it is honourable and advantageous
to every party that the Government should occasionally grant personal rewards

for important discoveries ; I am of opinion that when any branch of Science

has been put in such a form that it admits of continued improvement under

a continued administrative routine, that administration should be undertaken

by the Government. But I trust that in all cases the initiative of Science

will be left to individuals or to independent associations.

In no country, I apprehend, is so much done for Science in private observa-

tories and private laboratories as in this. The future historian of Astronomy

will tell of the enormous catalogues of stars observed and the numerous
--lii REPORT. 1851.

planets discovered by the telescopes of private observers. The historian
of Chemistry will tell that those splendid discoveries which have made a
radical change in the science have been made in institutions supported by
private subscriptions. The institution of the British Association is an em-
bodiment of the same principle in a different form. To facilitate the inter-
course of individuals ardent in the private pursuit of science, it was necessary

that its assemblies should be large, and almost unrestricted in admission of
members ; and this condition necessarily carried with it another, that its

meetings should follow at wide intervals. To enable the nation to learn

from the provinces and the provinces from the nation, its wandering character

is essential.

That in the course of these meetings there has been ample evidence of

that stimulation which rarely fails to accompany the assemblage of a great

number of persons engaged in singleness of heart on the same general object,

can hardly be doubted. In nothing is it more conspicuous than in the pro-

duction of those elaborate Reports upon which no small portion of our repu-

tation and our utility is founded. It has been remarkable also in the direction

of the labours of our members, who have in many instances eagerly taken up

the trains of subjects indicated by the Association in its meetings.

   But there is another thing into which it is highly important for us (o inquire.

We communicate with other scientific bodies, British and foreign, and our

communications are respected. We ofter suggestions to the Government,

--sometimes implying the outlay of large sums of money, and our suggestions

Howare never lightly received.  is it that the Association has acquired this

external influence?

  I answer, that we have bought it. We have bought it by our own personal
Welabours in the same cause for which we solicit the aid of Government.

have bought it by the expenditure of our money in a way which shows that
Science alone is our object in soliciting contributions from our members.
But, more than all, we have bought it by the care and the caution with which
our applications to Government have been made. In no instance, I believe,
has a request been urged for the aid of the State in things beyond our power
until we had expended our own money on things of the same class within
our power. Scarcely can an instance be picked out in which we have not

manifested our full acquaintance with every detail of the object to be attained
and the ways of attaining it before bringing the matter before the nation for

its general assistance. And if I were called on to advise the Association as
to the means by which this important external power may be best preserved,

T would above all things insist on the most studious caution and the most

minute preparation before making application to the Government.
                         ADDRESS.                 liii

This power of stimulating our own members and this influence on external

bodies, as I have stated, are, in my opinion, connected in a great measure

with the independent character of our body, as consisting of a mass of inde-

pendent elements. But with this consideration we must connect another.

If we possess the freedom of private persons, we are also under the same

--restraints as private persons : and nothing could be more injurious to us

than any step which seemed to imply our belief that we, an unauthorized

body, could venture to interfere in any matter in which any other company

--of private persons acting publicly could not interfere. For instance : I can

scarcely imagine a case in which we should be justified in offensively ex-

pressing our disapprobation of the course followed by any other person or

--Society. Again : The past history of science or invention is matter of

myinnocent interest to us as to others ; but, in  opinion, nothing will justify

us in entering on the consideration of claims to priority or superiority in

which the reputation or the pecuniary interests of the living are concerned.

And now. Gentlemen, I have only to express my hope that the Meeting at

Ipswich may be as fortunate as those which have preceded it. I trust that

on the present occasion we may have unusual opportunities of enjoying and

profiting by the society of the distinguished foreigners now in England. I

trust that the subjects in our Sections may be numerous and interesting, and

the discussions on them animated and courteous. I trust that the important

Reports which we expect may most fully maintain the character of our annual

--volume, and that well-chosen subjects will be proposed for Reports on the

experimental investigations of our members for the next year. I trust that

your governing body will be bold, yet cautious, in urging on the attention of

the Government, or of other bodies, those things which appear necessary for

the good of Science. With these wishes, I now commend you to the daily

labours of the Meeting.

Oa Observations of Luminous Meteors ; continued from the Report of
   1850. By the Rev. Badem Powell, M.A., F.R.S. ^c, Savilian

   Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
In presenting a fourth report in continuation of a collection of observations
of Luminous Meteors, I have merely to observe that in the present instance,
for this first time, the tabular form of arrangement agreed upon by a Com-
mittee of the British Association last year, has been adopted by most of the
observers : and in connexion with the use of it, I would wish to suggest to
those who favour the Association with their contributions, the desirableness
of allowing a more distinct space to each individual observation ; as it is often
necessary to separate them in order to arrange them with others in chronolo-

gical order.

   Besides the assistance of several other friends, I have to acknowledge more
especially, as heretofore, the aid of Mr. E. J. Lowe, of Dr. Buist, and the
Rev. J. Slatter. Some of the results collected by the British Meteorological

Society have also been sent to me ; and it is much to be wished that that
Society would co-operate with the British Association by regularly furnishing

copies of their Meteor Observations for this Report.

   As on former occasions many meteors have been communicated to me of

a date earlier than the conclusion of the last catalogue : these are here
prefixed. It would tend materially to the unity and arrangement of the
catalogue if this could be avoided.

 A --Meteor seen at Ventnor, Isle of Wight, Monday, September 4, 1848, about

9 o'clock P.M. " I was sitting out of doors when the whole view was sud-

denly illuminated as brightly as by the full moon, the light being rather lurid.

On looking S.W. by W. at the altitude of about 50░, I saw a vivid ball of fire

about two-thirds the diameter of the moon, just bursting vertically in half,

scattering bright sparks of various sizes in all directions, and one large body,

about one-third the size of the whole meteor, fell rapidly towards the earth,"

bearing a little south, leaving a luminous track. As it fell it became less

bright and defined ; when it had fallen about 25░ it again burst, scattered

itself, and was dissipated : three minutes at least must have elapsed before
the luminous track and ail the bright sparks had disappeared. I heard much

the same account of the meteor as seen in Hampshire, nearly forty miles to

the west, and in Sussex, forty miles to the east of Ventnor.

" On the same evening there were several falling stars in other parts of the

heavens, more (as far as I remember) to the south, but I have no memoran-

dum of the point of the compass.                              ,, . Oixon "

  My --" dear Sir, Mr. Lawson has been kind enougli to forward the follow-

ing account of a meteor seen by W. H. Weekes, Esq., at Sandwich, in Kent,

of which I send you these particulars.

                                        " Yours truly,

                                                              " E. J. LowK.

  " ' 1850, February 5, C" 50TM (clock time). My attention being fixed upon

Orion (a greyish liaze jirevailing at the time), I observed a speck of dull light
commence at a point little west of that splendid group of stars, at an altitude
of 28░ 30' above the horizon. The light went on increasing rapidly in mag-
nitude and intensity, continuing stationary the while, and glowing through
the thin grey mist like a moderatelj"^ red-hot iron ball, until it had acquired
an apparent diameter equal to at least one-third that of the full moon, when,
without any noise of an explosion being heard, it suddenly burst, the main
body taking a slow rectilineal motion parallel to the horizon and to the east-

ward; the instant when the motion of the meteorolite commenced many large,
glowing, red fragments were thrown off in various directions from the centre,
and a brilliant shower of variegated fire descended perpendicularly towards the
earth. So beautiful was it that it resembled the coloured rain from a sky-rocket.

    " 'The following cliaracteristics are remarkable :
    " ' 1st. It formed, or at least appeared gradually, at a stationary point in the
sky, and from the moment it first became visible, until it burst and took
motion, the period was 1 minute 45 seconds.
   " ' 2nd. The motion of its main body was so deliberate that it lasted 45 sees.
    " ' 3rd. At the place of its gradual formation the appearance of a luminous
disc, equal to 1░ in the heavens, was left after it took flight, which luminous
disc, with the line of its flight to the eastward, and also the course of its de-

scending coloured rain, though all of them, gradually decreasing, continued
visible fully 3 minutes after the primary body had disappeared.'

   " Perfect reliance may be placed on these observations, and especially on
the duration of time elapsed between each feature, as Mr. Weekes has been

accustomed to count seconds in his astronomical observations."

" Sir,-- In reply to j-our communication, I beg to say that the shower of

shooting stars I saw on the night of the 12th of August, at about 20 minutes

before 12, was not in the south-western, as misprinted in the ' Times/ but in

the south-eastern horizon, a little to the eastward of south. I was walking;
home with some friends on that night, and our attention was attracted by

the beauty and brilliancy of several of these meteors, which we observed,

Howeach exclaiming '  beautiful !  I never saw  anything  like                                        ;  but, a

the period I have mentioned, there was a perfect shower of them, all issuing

as it seemed, from the same tract, and taking nearly the same direction to

wards the horizon, above which they were but a very few degrees, I cannot

state with accuracy how many. It seemed to us something like the finale

of a display of fireworks, if one could conceive them taking the same direc

tion instead of diverging at aU points.

  --" Rev. Sir, On Friday evening, November 23, about half-past seven

o'clock, I was on the Woodstock road, a little north of the Observatory,
when I saw a very beautiful meteor in the westward ; it descended at a
moderate pace, through about 15░ of space, alm.ost in a perpendicular direc-

tion, but a little towards the north. It appeared about double the diameter

of Venus when at her brightest, was of a bright white or bluish colour, and

left behind it a brilliant train which was distinctly visible throughout the
whole space through which the meteor had passed, for full six seconds. The

meteor did not seem to explode, but disappeared at a point exactly between
the two stars n and y Aquilse.

    " The same evening, about nine o'clock, a large meteor was seen descend-

ing also nearly perpendicular in the west. This was observed by a person

in the Town Hall during the lecture, and must have been bright to attract

the attention from a room so lighted.

   " Again, about half-past eleven o'clock the same night, my wife was sitting

by the fire with a lighted candle, when she was startled by a bright light,
and, looking up, saw a very brilliant meteor pass the window from west to
east, almost in a horizontal direction, but rather downwards. This meteor
was seen bj' a very intelliger.t person in St. Clement's, who noticed its course
with respect to certain stars, and can point out the direction. It was also
noticed by several of the night-police men, and all describe it as having the
appearance of a Roman candle of a bright bluish tint.

   " Aly wife had, previously to this evening, told me of a very bright meteor

about a quarter past ten o'clock on the night before, i.e. the 26th, not so
large as the one on the 2E)th, but very much more so than usual.

" I take the liberty of troubling you with these particulars, as it seems

extraordinary that so many large meteors should appear, when, at the same

time, very few shooting stars were to be seen, as I was watching one or other

part of the heavens on Friday evening, from seven to nine o'clock, and, ex-

cepting the one described, did not catch sight of any other, although the

night was veiy clesr.

--и' Rev. Sir, Last night I saw another bright white-coloured meteor, about

=Venus ; it descended from somewhere about 6░ or 8░ east of Saturn, in a

straight line a little towards the east of the perpendicular ; its pace was

Mymoderate, and it left very little train.  view of it was rather imperfect,

but I think, from the point at which it stai'ted to that of its disappearance, it

could not be less than 25░. There were very few shooting stars last night

I only saw one, at about half-past nine o'clock ; it was small, and passed

with great velocity,

" There was not the slightest appearance of an aurora during both even-

ings, and I have only seen the aurora twice for some months past, and on

both occasions I could not see one shooting star. I beg to suggest that it

would be well if parties noting their appearance would notice whether there

be an aurora during the time when there are many shooting stars, or during

an aurora if there be many meteors.

--" Dear Sir, On the evening of Monday, the 9th, when coming home

from a neighbouring village, with Ursa Major directly before me, shining

with great splendour, a large luminous meteor made its appearance in the tail

of Ursa, and moved nearly parallel with the body, then made a curved motion

below the pointers, and disappeared about 10░ above the horizon. The ap-

pearance was most brilliant ; the tail was fan-shaped, about double the length

or size of the body, which might be four times the size of either of the

pointers. Before it disappeared the tail separated in a number of scintillse.

The evening was very clear, but a thick haze of about 10" edged the horizon.

The day had also been calm and clear. At the time of the appearance the

thermometer stood at 31░; barometer, 30'12; wet bulb of the hygrometer

--" Brilliant Meteor. An unusually bright meteor was seen at Durham, and

in the neighbourhood, on the evening of Sunday, April 27, at 10^ 5TM p.m.,

mean Greenwich time. It was j^articularly noticed at Durham, at Bishop-

wearmouth, and at Esh, six miles west of Durham, and no doubt will have

been seen over a large district of country. The following account is given by

a gentleman of Durham, who observed the meteor from the cross road which

leads from the London road, south of Durham, towards the Grammar School

--and South Street :

   " ' It was a clear starlight night, when suddenly a blaze of soft yellow

light oversjjread the country for some distance. The light seemed to fall

gently on the ground and to run along it. It was so intense, and came on

so suddenly, that I was startled by it. One or two seconds must have elapsed

before I discovered the cause. This proved to be a beautiful meteor, which

seemed to be about a quarter as large as the moon at the full. It was sur-

rounded   by a  rich  purple  light,  fading  into  blue ;  then  a good  deal of orange
                                                                                                                                                  ;

and lastly, a light yellow, which was the colour of a considerable train which

followed the meteor. It moved with considerable rapidity, and was visible

for four or five seconds after I first discovered it. I could not tell whether it

vanished into the air, or was hidden by some intervening object ; but the

impression on my mind was that it had fallen to the ground. It did not

appear at any very great height ; and, indeed, I listened for the sound of it

falling, which I thought would most likely be heard very shortly after it dis-

appeared.'

" Upon revisiting the place where this observation was made, and comparing

the direction in which the meteor passed with the surrounding objects, it ap-

pears that the meteor, when first seen (which was some seconds after its light

was first noticed), was at an altitude of about 70░, in the W.N.W. direction,

and moved gradually towards the north, disappearing very nearly due north.
   " The appeai-ance of the meteor, as seen at Bishopwearmouth, was very

similar.

" At Esh, the meteor was seen very favourably, the jjerson who noticed it

being on the side of a hill quite open towards the north. The light was so

brilliant, that distant objects were seen as distinctly as in daylight. The

meteor was estimated to be about half as large as the full moon ; it appeared

near the zenith in the north-west, and moved towards the north. When

the meteor burst, sparks were distinctly observed to drip from it ; but no

noise was heard, either at the instant or within a few minutes afterwards.
   " From the first description it appears, probably, that the meteor appeared

somewhat nearer to the zenith at Esh than at Durham.
   " Near Alden Grange, two miles west of Durham, the sparks falling from

the meteor, when it burst, were distinctly observed, and appeared of a bright

blue colour, compared to that of a lucifer match. One person there observed
the meteor first in the S.E., moving gradually to the N.W.

    " If this meteor should have been noticed in other parts of Great Britain,

a comparison of different accounts may lead to a knowledge of its real course.

--No. 10. Extract from a letter from Dr. Buist to Prof. Powell.

"Meteors seen in India from June 1850 to May 1851.
             By Dr. Buist, F.R.S., Bombay.

" The following notices contain amongst them a list of meteors which have

been seen in India, in so far as I have been able to observe or to hear from

correspondents. The list does not in all likelihood contain a hundredth part

of those that have been noticed by Europeans, or a thousandth part of those

that have been visible in the sky ; nor is there any reason to suppose that

those which have been described have been by any means the most notable

or conspicuous. In India we have probably not one man, at an average, for

every thousand square miles, who thinks of making a note of, or of writing

about such things ; and all that can be done therefore is to accejjt of such

--notices as we receive, drawing, no conclusion from the number of meteors

described as to the number or magnitude of those that have been visible.

As the attention bestov/ed on such matters is every year on the inci'ease

amongst us, I am disposed to ascribe the scantiness of the list to a deficiency

of meteors visible in our sky rather than to any defect in the number of ex-

ertions of the observers. I have myself not been able to see one-tenth of

what I have been accustomed to notice, though my opportunities of observa-

tion have been as good as usual. There is a peculiarity in a large number of

the meteors I have observed in India, which I do not recollect to have seen

noticed. As they approach the termination of their course, they begin to

shine out and disappear at intervals of about a quarter of a second, present-

ing the appearance closely allied to that of a disc or quoit thrown up in the

air, and presenting alternately its edge and its face to the spectator. This

occurs in general two or three, occasionally four or five times, before the ex-

tinction of the meteor, and does so equally whether it explodes or not.

" Of this list one aerolite has fallen to the ground, and been found, and for-

Awarded to the Asiatic Society's Museum.  second has without doubt im-

pinged upon the earth, but has not yet been discovered. It was seen in

bright sunshine ; the fragments thrown off alone appeared in a state of igni-

tion ; the central mass appeared black as it fell towards the earth, as if not
heated to redness ; and this most likely is the case almost always. But then
at night when meteors are generally observed, it is the ignited portions that

alone are visible. One meteor left a long train of hazy light behind it,

which was visible for nearly twenty minutes, and was mistaken for a comet

by those who had witnessed the train without observing the fireball itself.

We have four remarkable instances on record in India of meteors vanishing

gradually or leaving trains of light behind them after they had vanished :.

that seen in Palmacottah in 1838; it was the size of the full moon, and

Seemed to remain in one place for twenty minutes, when it grew gradually

fainter and fainter, and then disappeared ; that described by Capt. Shortrede

as seen from Charka in 1842, which, with its train, was nearly five minutes

visible ; that seen from Calcutta on the 2nd December 1825, first visible as

a ball of fire, then in the shape of a comet, in which form it remained for

several minutes, when it vanished ; and that described by Mr. Orlebar in the
Bombay Observatory Report for 1846, seen on the 7th of December, and

which left a luminous train behind it, visible for several seconds. The most

notable instance of this sort is that of Jenny Lind's meteor seen from Boston

Aon the 30th of September 1850, and which was visible for an hour.       very

men to be roused from their slumbers. Were officers in command of Euro-

in a short time and with very little trouble be placed in our possession."

record was a most extraordinary one, I hope you may receive further notices
of it. Last night I was sitting in the open air with two other gentlemen at
about twelve or thirteen minutes after ten o'clock, when a most beautiful
brilliant meteor appeared, which we all saw. It issued from the heavens
near a star of second magnitude about midway between Scorpio and a planet
to the west ; its direction was very nearly from south-west to north-east ; it

did not drop, but shot rapidly across the heavens, appearing to increase in
size and brightness, and after proceeding a considerable distance (gaining
rather than losing its splendid brilliancy) it burst and numerous luminous
particles were discharged from it. About a quarter of a minute after it had

so disappeared, and while we were expressing our wonder and admiration, a
distant though loud rumbling sound commenced and reminded us of regi-
mental file firing. At first we thought it might be thunder, though there
were very few clouds, and they were only near the horizon. The sound
continued for certainly half a minute, and we had time to receive the impres-
sion that it followed in the track of the meteor, when the sky was perfectly
clear and bright. It was also seen by natives and described exactly.--

   --" Sir, I know not whether you have received any account of a shooting

 star which I saw last evening ; if not, you are welcome to the following de-
 scription of it. I was walking in company with a friend on the terrace of
 his bungalow, situated on Malabar-hill, about seven o'clock last evening,
 when our attention was directed towards that part of the sky from whence
 proceeded a sudden emission of intensely bright light, and we found it was
 caused by a large meteor which shot with inconceivable velocity across the
 heavens. Its course was from north-west to south-east, leaving in its track
 a luminous train. It was visible about three seconds, and then burst into
 innumerable stars of the most brilliant colours, very much resembling a large

and beautiful rocket. When first seen it was about 60░ above the horizon,

and passed within 10░ to the north of Venus : it appeared a great distance
ofi^, and was doubtless traversing the remote regions of our atmosphere, as it
exploded without any perceptible noise in the direction of Caranja, and at
that time it could not have been more than 18░ or so above the horizon.
The most singular part of this phsenomenon was, that after the meteor had

burst into fragments, it left a stream of light behind about 10░ or 12░ in
length, and for a time it strongly resembled the tail of a comet, with a

nucleus of its own appended to it. Hooked at it through an inverting tele-
scope, and could plainly perceive a small bright spot like a star of the second
magnitude, surrounded as it were by a luminous vapour or cloud. This ne-

bulous appearance continued visible for full twenty minutes, wlien it gradu-
ally diminished in size, became more and more indistinct, and at last vanished

altogether. The earth, it is well known, is at this moment travelling through
the region of meteors in its annual orbit round the sun, and now is the period
in fact when our globe incurs the liability of encountering streams of these
ehooting stars ; and Sir John Herschel informs us in his ' Outlines of Astro-
nomy,' that the meteors of the 12th to 14th of November, or at least the

vast majority of them, describe apparently arcs of great circles passing through

or near y Leonis. No matter what the situation of that star with respect to

the horizon, or to its east or west points, may be at the time of observation,

the paths of the meteors all appear to diverge from it. I was unable last

evening to prove the correctness of this theorj', as I had no celestial map,

and unfortunately I know not the exact position in the heavens of y Leonis,

nor the constellation in which it is placed, but this could be easily ascertained,

and I shall therefore look again tonight at the quarter from whence this

meteor came and see if the star alluded to is anywhere near, as I have no

Wedoubt Herschel is right.  should now be on the qui vive every evening

for these interesting phsenomena, as by a more extended series of observations
a greater knowledge might be gained as to the real nature of these singular

--though beautiful periodical visitors. With hopes that you will excuse this

hasty and imperfect sketch. Astkr." Bombay Times, Nov. 8.

   " 7th November, 1850."

 --A" Correspondent sends us the following : A' meteor was observed

from the Esplanade a few minutes before 7 p.m. on Wednesday evening,
leaving an extraordinary train, traced one-third its flight midway from start-
ing-point, and continuing in view all the time we remained there, say 15 mi-
nutes. Had our attention been drawn thereto accidentally, after the explo-
sion of the meteor, we must have taken it for the comet expected in July last.
Its course was from about 15░ S.W. above Jupiter to 15░ due south above
the horizon ; most brilliant and rapid in its descent, when it burst into
numerous minor lights, much in the style of artificial meteors or sky-rockets,
observed before from the same position.' " Telegraph and Courier, Nov. 8,

 --No. 1 6, "Novemher Meteors. The attention of several observers has lately

been directed to the heavens, in hopes of seeing some indications of those

annual ' showers of falling stars ' which are noticed in November. Most of

--them appear to have been disappointed in their expectations, lost their sleep

and watched in vain. Sublunary affairs, unsought things, often fall in our

way, while we pui-sue others to no purpose. By chance we found ourselves
on the morning of the 14th toiling, not up, we are thankful to say, but down
the * many-winding way ' of the Bhore Ghaut (the mountain pass betwixt
--46 BEPORT 1851.

Bombay and Poonah), when we remarked numerous shooting stars, and, re-

collecting the period of the year, we determined to count them.

    " In the course of one hour, from 5 to 6 a.m., thirty-eight of these aerolites

passed across that part of the sky within the scope of our vision, and one

bright comet-like meteor, almost at day-break, was alone worth the devotion

of a whole night's watch had we been so philosophically inclined. But as
we were walking, and only looking in one direction, it is probable that little

more than an eighth of the celestial vault was under observation : it is not

unreasonable to suppose that if the whole had been embraced at least 200 of

these bodies might have been noticed. It is also probable that several escaped

our attention, which was now and then required for other purposes than star-

gazing when the precipices of Khandalla were near.
   " There was nothing very remarkable in these aerolites, unless from their

numbers. Their light, or, if you please, combustion, seemed to increase

rapidly as they dived into the lower strata of the atmosphere, and finally dis-

appeared with a faint explosion, or what looked like it, for it was not audible.

Several of these must have been very near to the earth, as by their light they

were distinctly seen to traverse the dark shade of the ravine below the sum-

mits of the mountains. The wind was easterly at the time, and appeared to

influence the course of these astral travellers, which was generally from east

to west.

   " The most interesting object, however, Avas a large and brilliant meteor,

which showed itself about a quarter before six, rushing from north-west to

south-east, almost in an opposite direction to that followed by the smaller

Aasteroids.  sudden blaze of light illumined the sides and very depths of

the ravine, and, attracting our notice, we turned round and the cause was

Avisible enough.  dazzling nucleus, about twice the apparent diameter of

Jupiter when free from refraction, with a tail about 3░ in length, and nearly

as luminous as the head, was seen sinking behind the crest of the Ghauts on

the Khandalla side; or rather I should say it inclined downwards, for it was

evidently moving rapidly to the south-east, and, gradually fading into a pale

reddish light, became invisible, not by a sudden coruscation or sign of ex-

plosion, for during the whole time that it was visible, about six seconds, the

nucleus and its tail retained their original relative proportions, and became

indistinct by loss of their luminousness, or from entering the beds of aqueous

vaj)our in the lower part of our atmosphere.

   "About an hour afterwards, on meeting a fellow-traveller who had also been

descending the Ehore Ghaut at the same early hour, and inquiring if he had

seen the meteor, he said 'no !' but he was surprised to find the inside of his

palanquin suddenly lighted up by a bright but transient gleam.
   " Even the brightness of Aurora's ' golden hair,' rising in the east, was

thrown into the shade by this brilliant stranger darting across the sky.

Whether there was a ' close current ' or an ' isolated cloud of sulphur
resting on the Khandalla Ghaut we cannot pretend to say ; neither are we
bound to show from whence either originated, assuming their presence at
the time. Certainly the dismal gloom before dawn which pervaded the deep

chasm among the Ghauts, into which the road wends, reminded us of the

entrance to that nameless region once visited by .^neas and a few others,

the exact time, when a bright yellowish glare suddenly illumined the tele-

scope, and looking up I was in time to follow the course of a very fine me-

teor, which probably appeared somewhere in Leo, and had passed not far

from the field of the telescope. There was a strong glare on the ground as

the meteor passed on in the direction nearly of Arcturus, a little below which

it burst into a number of brilliant balls and sparks. It was a little larger ap-

parently than Venus at her greatest brilliancy, but the light was very vivid

while it lasted. The most curious thing connected with it was, after the

burst, the sparks or dust remained apparent^ in the same spot, or, falling

into a spiral form, preserved a bright light not unlike that of the great ne-

bula in Orion as seen through a telescope. I put the telescope on the spot

instantly, and could see the sparks or dust slowly descending, some sparks
being very bright indeed. This appearance lasted several seconds, and when

I had taken my eye from the instrument, there was still a nebulous appear-

ance in the sky, which however gradually faded. It is probable that this me-

teor burst not very far from the earth. The telescope was a 44-inch DoUond,

with a power of 120. This is the most remarkable meteor I have seen this

year, and though I have noted several others of remarkable appearance and

brilliancy, yet there was nothing which required any particular mention to

you. I think there have been quite as many small meteors or falling stars

from the horizon, it broke into a thousand brilliant and glittering particles

of light, from amongst which a darker mass was seen to fall towards the

earth, the glittering particles disappearing and reappearing as they fell ; or

to use a terrestrial simile, the numerous particles of light looked like a shower

of broken glass, or a highly polished metallic surface glittering in a bright

sunshine : the shower lasted a few seconds only. The sky was cloudless,

We" have been favoured with the following from a correspondent, who

dates Cawnpore, 5th May, in reference to the meteoric showers seen from
Mazagon and Kolapore on the 19th April. The phaenomena agree so closely

in all respects save date, that we should greatly wish our two previous in-

Weformants to refer to their notes, and refresh their memories.  should like

the other notes of meteors and hail-storms that have been forwarded to us, as

well as the valuable paper on the meteorology of Futtegurh, just received,

will be forwarded to the British Association. An account of them will, we

Sirius downward as far as I could see, a bungalow being close by. This was
the only vertical one, all the others shooting off at various degrees in a ho-
rizontal direction, but all from N.E. up to N.W., not towards, as all had a

southerly direction. Your expressed wish to have information from those

who may have seen the phsenomenon induced me to take up my pen. Since
my list of hail-storms, I have only had to record one under my own observa-

tion, and which occurred about three p.m. at a place called Oomree, seven

miles west of Rewah, on the 7th February last, the hailstones fully as big as

pigeons' eggs. It did not last long, but was very violent, and tore my tent

sadly. This village, Oomree, must have been about the centre, as it did not

extend to Rewah east, and only about four miles to the westward, as my

camels were about that distance, and had only rain.' "

  We" feel greatly indebted to a Poona correspondent for the following ac-

count of the meteors of the 20th ultimo, of which we have already published
several notices ; we trust that we shall be able to secure a few more ; those

that have hitherto reached us are all perfectly consonant with each other :

* In your issue of the 15th you wish for further information regarding the
shower and meteors seen last month. I can speak positively that it was seen

here on Sunday the 20th about ten o'clock. I was sitting outside my house

with a friend, and we observed two or three in a minute. One was of sur-
passing brilliancy ; it left a tail (if I may so express myself) which lasted at
least a minute. With one exception in the north, which fell, they all went

from east to south-west.' "

  We" find that the shower of meteors, mentioned in our paper of the 24th

as having been seen from Mazagon on the evening of the 19th, was in reality

observed on the 20th ; we have no doubt that a similar error will be found
to have occurred in reference to the date on which they were visible at Ko-
lapore, so as to identify the display with that observed from Cawnpore on
Easter Sunday. At any rate, we have the matter now established in refer-
ence to the exhibition as witnessed from two extreme stations, and this is
the most striking point of the whole."

served a large ball of a whitish red appearing north-west from where I was,
and I think about one mile from me, and about half a mile from the surface
of the earth ; it seemed at first enveloped in a cloud or haze, but upon
emerging out it showed about the size of the full moon, travelling slowly from
west, and taking an easterly direction ; after having travelled about 100
yards, it began to throw out small ball-like comets in every direction, and
the balls had a greater velocity than the main body, and preceded it for a
short distance ; and before each ball exploded, it became scarlet-red, and
threw out small shocks of matter ; and after the ball had travelled 400 or
500 yards, it then appeared to be totally exhausted, and as it were dissolved,
without showing any remnant of matter. After this, the whole length that
the large ball travelled had the appearance as if the space were filled with a
reddish-white matter, and remained so for seven minutes, and then became
to get disordered and irregular, and in three minutes got spread, or flattened,
and ultimately dispersed, ai)parently by contrary currents of air. I might

mention, that from my residence adjoining New Court House, the first ap-

pearance I observed of the ball was over Mr. Reid's farm, west of Old Park,

In the spring of the present year the allotted portions of each kind of seed ga-

   So few additions have lately been made to the Depot at Oxford, that it
becomes a duty on our part, to request that persons interested in these expe-
riments, will lend their aid by contributing seeds of known date, and where

possible, in quantities sufficient for distribution, especially those of genera

not included in the list given in the Report for 1848.

Remarks on the Climate of Southampton, founded on Barometrical
   Thermometrical and Hygrometrical Tables, deduced from observa-
   tions taken three times daily during the years 1848, 1849 and 1850.

   By John Drew, F.R.A.S., Ph.D. University of Bale.

Shortly after the Meeting of the British Association in Southampton, I de-
termined upon commencing a series of meteorological observations in that
town : its position in the centre of the southern line of coast appeared to me
an important one, and in this view I was confirmed by those whose authority
stands high on meteorological science. I entered therefore on an unbroken
series, with the hope of suppljdng data for the determination of the climate
of the place, towards which object no systematic efforts had as yet been di-

rected.

    With this view I consulted Mr. Birt, as to the instruments best adapted
to the purpose, and he kindly undertook to superintend the construction of a
Barometer by Mr. Newman, from whom, at his recommendation, I procured

 the greater part of the instruments emploj'ed in the observations, the results

--from which I am about to lay before the Section for the most part in a

 tabular form. I have spared no pains in arriving, as near as possible, at ab-
 solute mean values in the instrumental readings ; and for the purpose of satis-

fying those who may hereafter consult the Tables, I shall accompany them
 with a few remarks on the plans adopted and the instruments employed.

    The observations have been taken three times daily, viz. at 9 a.m., 3 p.m.,
 and 9 p.m., local mean time, for a period of three years, extending from
 Feb. 1, 1848 to January 31, 1851. The barometer, with its attached ther-
 mometer and the wet and dry-bulb thermometers, have been read at these
 hours ; the force and direction of the wind and the amount of cloud recorded :
 in addition to these, at 9 a.m. daily, the readings of the maximum and mini-

mum thermometers, and the amount of rain during the previous 24 hours,

 have been registered. The system pursued has been as nearly as possible in
 accordance with that followed in the Greenwich observations.

              The Latitude of my Observatory is 50░ 54' 34" North.
                The Longitude in Time 0"^ 5TM 37-7= West.

    The height of the barometer cistern above the mean level of the sea is
 60 feet; and of the rain-gauge above the surface of the ground 9 feet

 6 inches.

    Table I. shows the mean height of the barometer for every month, with
 the highest and lowest readings, and their difference, or monthly range.
 These have been corrected for capacity and capillary action, and have been

 reduced to the temperature of 32░ Fahrenheit.

    To determine the zero correction, Mr. Birt undertook to compare the in-
 strument, before it came into my hands, directly with the Royal Society's
 Standard, and indirectly with a mountain barometer of Col. Sabine's, whose

 index correction had been previously ascertained : the result of the whole
 series of comparisons was the necessity of applying -(-0036 in. to the read-

 ings of my barometer to bring them up to those of the standard : this has

 been applied in every case ; although when on a late occasion I carefully
 compared it with others whose correction was thought to have been known
 I found it somewhat too great, yet the differences were not so consistent as
 to induce me to alter the index-error as originally determined.

     The barometrical readings have not been corrected for daily range, as I

 have reason to believe that the daily periods of atmospheric pressure do not
      REMARKS ON THE CLIMATE OF SOUTHAMPTON.                   55

coincide with those at Greenwich. On frequent occasions I have applied

separately to the monthly means of the 9 a.m., 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. observa-

tions, the corrections given by Mr. Glaisher in the Phil. Trans, part 1, 1848,

and the results were in no case consistent : nor is this surprising, when we

regard the situation of Southampton at the head of an estuary which is di-
vided into two arms by the Isle of Wight. Most probably the local varia-
tions of atmospheric pressure are peculiar, but what these may be can only
be determined by a far more extensive series of observations than I have had

the leisure to undertake : one on the plan of photographic registration would
admirably answer the purpose.

   Mr. Glaisher on one occasion expressed himself to me unfavourably with

regard to barometers to which it was necessary to apply the capacity correc-
tion. His reason was, that as the mercury descends in the tube and the
cistern becomes fuller, a portion of the hollow cylinder of glass composing

the tube is enclosed, and the mercury rises higher than the capacity correc-

tion would indicate, by a quantity dependent on the volume of the section of

the tube vvhich it had enclosed. After having carefully considered the sub-

ject, I entered upon an investigation which should result in leading me to
reject the observations I had taken, or to confirm my confidence in them.

                              =Let a the area of the hollow part of the

                                        tube.

                                       tern.

                         =h the area of the annulus or section

                                      of the glass tube,

                         =c the ascent or descent of the mercury

                               from the neutral point.
                         = +X the correction required, in the
                               --former case, in the latter.

                         Then

       Supposed height.

                         Substituting the values of these quantities

                         measured from my barometer, the internal

                         diameter of the tube being 0'283 in., the ex-

                         ternal 0'41 in., and the proportion between

the area of the section of the tube and that of the cistern as 1 to 42, we

have  = = =a 0-0629, r -. 42, b -0691 ; let c 1 inch,

then      -- =и0629

      2-535 -069 и0248;

but the correction for capacity, as applied in the usual way,

                               ^ФБ= 1-0238;

                                              ra 42

it follows therefore that when the mercury has ascended or descended from
the neutral point one inch, the diiference caused by the enclosure of the tube

--will be exactly -001 ; a quantity less than that read by the vernier proba-
--bly less than the error of observation and therefore one which may fairly

be neglected in practice. If therefore the exact proportion between the areas

of the tube and cistern be carefully -ascertained by the maker, we are able to
arrive at sufficient correctness with a barometer to whose readings it is neces-

sary to apply the capacity correction; the trouble of reading otf is less. I
have tabulated the capacity correction and the index error ; so that by taking
--56 REPORT 1851.

the algebraic sum of one quantity and the conection for temperature, I get

the true reading directly, and with little labour ; while there is a great ad-
vantage in the cistern being of iron, and in getting rid of the leathern bag

which accompanies some barometers of a certain construction.

   On comparing the pressure at Southampton with that at Greenwich

monthly, I find a difference varying between 0' 1 1 in. and 0" 1 45 ; the height

of Greenwich observatory above my station, measured from the level of the

sea, is 100 feet.

The consistent results, arising from reducing the readings to the sea-level and
deducting such portion of the pressure as is due to the aqueous vapour in the

atmosphere, tend to give considerable confidence in the barometrical obser-

vations.

   Table II. Determination of the mean temperature The dry and wet-
bulb thermometers were compared by Mr. Glaisher and myself with a stand-
ard by immersion in water of a high temperature, which was allowed to cool

gradually, simultaneous readings being taken from time to time : the result

was that the dry-bulb was found to read too high by ---4 in., and the wet-
bulb by ---2: to the means of the monthly observations these corrections
have been applied ; and by an extended series of simultaneous readings, the
indications of the maximum and minimum thermometers have been corrected
and reduced to the same standard.

    Mr. Glaisher's corrections for daily range h'dve been applied to the 9 a.m.,
3 P.M. and 9 p.m. observations, and the mean monthly temperature thus de-
duced ; the quantities given by him have also been subtracted from the arith-
metical means of the maxima and minima, to obtain an independent mean
temperature : although these two results, as may be seen by inspection, are
not absolutely identical in every case, they are sufficiently near to show that
the variations in the rise and fall of the temperature occur at Southampton
at nearly, if not quite, the same local time as at Greenwich. Mr. Glaisher
considers that these corrections might not apply to localities on the coast,
and that the agreement is nearer than might have been expected. Taking

the entire series, the following is the result :

Mr. Glaisher's corrections ; the dew-point deduced by the factors given in
the Greenwich observations ; the degree of humidity, and the mean amount
of cloud, considering a cloudy sky to be represented by 10, and a cloudless

sky by 0.

  From this table I find, as my experience had told me, that the atmosphere

of Southampton is moist compared with places farther inland ; nor will this
be a matter of surprise when we regard its situation between two rivers (one

of which is a mile in breadth for a considerable distance above the town),

and on an arm of the sea, from which the prevalent winds are constantly

wafting the over-laden clouds.

   The degree of humidity as compared with Greenwich, situated inland and

on a considerable elevation, approaches, as might be expected, nearer the

point of saturation.

Table IV. shows the prevalent winds for each month during the three

years ; it has been formed by inserting under each head the number of times
the direction has been recorded at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.

In the year 1848, the south, south-west, and westerly winds were largely

in the ascendant, and the consequence was an exceedingly wet season, as

these  winds  were  usually  accompanied with rain                                                                                                                 they  are,  for  the  most  part,
                                                                                                                                                                ;

warmer than those from the northward and eastward, and hence we find the

mean temperature of that year higher by 2 degrees than 1849, and by 3 than

1850.

In 1 849, the northerly and north-easterly winds were frequent ; the pro-

portion between those winds from the quarters north to east inclusive, and

those between south and west, being as 254 to 321. The difference in the

fall of rain during this year and the preceding, amounted to upwards of 10

inches : the loss of the January observations prevents my stating the exact

amount.

In 1850, the south-west winds predominated over the north-east in the

proportion of 372 to 252 ; the amount of rain collected was as nearly as
possible the same as in 1849. The mean temperature was low, especially in
the months of January, March and October, when the wind set frequently

from the north and north-east, as the tables will show. During the month

of March especially, the low degree of humidity shows the dry nature of the

air on the prevalence of the northerly wind. In the month of March, gene-

rally the north and north-east winds prevail, while winds from the south and

south-west are about equally distributed throughout the other months of the

year.

   Table V. requires but little exjilanation or remark. It exhibits the
monthly mean of the readings of two thermometers, one near the surface of

the soil protected from the sun's rays, the other sunk 1 foot below : they
have been read oiF simultaneously at 3 p.m. daily during the year 1850.

   Table VI. is a contribution towards the comparison of the climate of
different localities, and exhibits certain conditions of the atmosphere, as in-
stanced at Southampton and three other places ; viz. Falmouth, which is
Xiear the most southern and western point of England; Stone, between

Aylesbury and Oxford, a central situation ; and York, a northern position, and

also inland. By the courtesy of the gentlemen who have kept constant

meteorological registers at those places, I have been supplied with the parti-
culars on which the table is based : these are,

   3. The amount of rain in inches during each month of the three years.
   4. The number of days on which rain fell.
   5. The mean temperature of each month for each of the four places men-

tioned.

   Confessedly imperfect as this table is, we ma}' nevertheless deduce from it
some interesting facts. It is imperfect from the construction of the rain-
gauges employed, which would give more satisfactory results did they record

the duration of showers of rain as they fell on the principle of Osier's rain-
gauge. They are imperfect indicators, moreover, of the mean amount of rain
for their localities, from the varying height at which they are placed above
the ground. I apprehend that to obtain the due amount of rain we should
plant several gauges in different parts of a town, and the mean of the quantity
received would give a much fairer estimate. Till, however, the number of

those who take an interest in the subject of meteorology is greatly increased,
we must be satisfied with such imperfect means as we possess for acquiring
a knowledge of the atmospheric variations and the laws which regulate them,
of even so small a portion of the world as our own country.

   The following are a few particulars deduced from the table under consi-

deration :

    1 During the course of the year, the number of days on which the freezing-
point is reached at Falmouth is about ^ of that at Southampton, at Stone
11^. at York If.

    2. With regard to the number of falls of rain beyond ^ an inch in 24 hours,
Southampton and Falmouth are about equal ; at Stone and York the number
of such days is i of those at the former places.

    3. The entire quantity of rain at Falmouth during the three years is some-
what more than y'^th beyond that at Southampton ; at Stone and York
somewhat more than half the quantity at Falmouth ; York having received
77-6 in., and Stone 683.

    4. The number of days on which rain is stated to have fallen is less at
Southampton than at any other place ; being 474 to 577 at Falmouth, 502 at
 Stone, and 519 at York. This result is consistent with that just mentioned
and with the table that follows, and leads us to the conclusion that the rain
falls in larger quantities at Southampton than at any of those places with
which I am comparing it.

   The days and amounts of falls of rain exceeding one inch in 24 hours
during the time through which these observations have extended, are as

 follow :

             Southampton.
REMARKS ON THE CLIMATE OP SOUTHAMPTON.  59

   It would appear, then, in conclusion, that the climate of Southampton is
mild, differing but little from that of the most southern town in England ;
that the air is more generally laden with moisture than that of inland towns,
arising from its proximity to the sea and freshwater, and from the prevalence
of winds from the points between south and west and those inclusive, which
are laden with aqueous vapour from the sea : that this moisture falls in
copious showers on a fewer number of days than the less quantity in the in-
land towns with which it has been compared ; occasionally in large quantities
at a time, as on June 27*, 1850, when nearly tjyo inches of rain, accompa-
nied with thunder and lightning, fell in 12 hours : that severe cold is less
prevalent than at places inland, but the quantity of rain is greater ; while
the average amount of cloud appears, from comparison with about forty other
places, to be a mean between the more and less cloudy skies. Though the
air may be less bracing than places higher and more inland, we have the ad-
vantage comparatively in mild winters, and the absence of that severity which

is so trying to the invalid.

    I avail myself of a high medical authority to subjoin the following enume-
ration of the prevalent diseases, and of those which are unusual in the
neighbourhood ; which, being written entirely independently of -my observa-
tions, will, I apprehend, be yet found to harmonize with the opinions which
I have founded on the meteorological observations.

    " Inflammatory diseases of an active kind are not at all common, nor do
they require or bear active depletion when they occur. The town is quite

free from ague : the mud lands do not produce it, as the water upon them is never
stagnant. Intermittent neuralgias are not met with. Fever is not common.
Twenty years ago it was very rare, but since the town has increased greatly

in numbers it is more prevalent, though not of a malignant type. There is
a considerable amount of complaint from uneasiness, discomfort, indisposition
and local pains produced by indigestion of an atonic kind, or the result of
want of general power. The system is not so vigorous as in a more bracing
climate, and therefore not so able to digest the same quantity of food ; and
unless much greater attention is paid to quantity especially, and also quality
as well as to habits, headache, distension, constipation and general debility are
not uncommon. Young and vigorous persons who come here from a colder
 and drier air, usually complain at first of sleepiness, and an inability to per-

form the same amount of muscular or mental exertion. On the other hand,
rather delicate and susceptible people (especially women), who are never well
in colder parts of England, enjoy much more bodily comfort here. For the

 same reason it suits children and elderly people, especially if they have been
 subject to inflammatory diseases of the air-passages in colder or drier places.

 Gouty and rheumatic diseases are not common here, as might be expected,

 from the inability to digest' a large quantity of food; in short, there is a
 greater amount of indisposition from indigestion, and a less than an average
 amount of active secondary diseases, such as fever and violent inflamma-

--tion." Dr. J. Bullar.

    Looking at what private observers like myself have been able to accomplish
 in the science of meteorology, we must arrive at the conclusion that com-
 paratively slow progress will be made until our number is greatly increased,
 and till we embrace in our observation a more extensive range. In addition
 to the pressure, temperature, and hygrometric state of the air, it would be
 highly advantageous, could we, for all localities, ascertain in addition the ra-

--pidity of evaporation ; the range and intensity of solar radiation ; and the

 state of electric tension, all which in their varied combinations go to make
 up that general result which we call climate, and which unitedly produce
 effects upon the natural world and the human frame, according to the pre-

 ponderance in the atmosphere of one or the other element.

--66 REPORT 1851.

On the Air and Water of Towns. Action of Porous Strata, Water and
    Organic Matter. By Dr. Robert Angus Smith, Manchester.

It is becoming daily more important to find out from what source it is best
to obtain water for great towns, and by what means it is to be collected. It
is probably true that a mode of supply suited to the conditions of all parts of
the country is not to be our direct aim, as every town must have its supply
modified by its own peculiarities of position, but it has still to be settled what
water is preferable when there is a choice before us. I have here put together
a few facts and reasonings which seem to me to deserve prominence, and

which have not, as far as I know, been sufficiently' dwelt on.
    Water has been got from rivers and small streams, sometimes from the

surface drainage of ground, and from deep wells and springs. The use of

well-water is the first that is resorted to where there is no stream or spring,
and where the inhabitants are not too many to be satisfied with such a source.
The water from this mode of supply is often exceedingly pure and brilliant,
according to the nature of the filtering-bed; but as most soils have a good

filtering-bed underneath, want of cleanness is not a common fault of wells.

There is in fact a proverbial purity about springs and wells ; and mountain
streams frequently share in receiving the same character from, the literary and
poetic observers of nature. It is interesting to know how this purity is attained.
There are many springs which never become muddy, which possess a con-

stant brilliancy, which never become cool in winter and never warm in sum-
mer. They seem to be unaSected by what is going on at the surface of the
ground. From this it appears that there is a purifying heat-regulating
action going on beneath. The surface-water from the same place, even if
filtered so as to become clear, has not the same purity, i. e. the same freedom
from organic matter or the same brilliancy ; neither has it the same amount
of carbonic acid or the same quantity of oxygen in it. There are influences
therefore at work, under ground, which are not at work on the surface.

   The rain which falls has not the same purity, although it comes directly from
the clouds ; it may even be wanting in cleanness, as is often the case ; it may
be nauseous to the taste, and be wanting in carbonic acid and in oxygen. It
never has the brilliancy of the spring water, nor is it so free from organic
matter. For these reasons all the world has admired spring water. The
mountain streams have had their share of admiration, and sometimes they
equal the spring water. Spring water and well water are of course essen-
tially the same ; both have passed through a considerable depth of soil. The
well has been dug in order to convert a portion of the surrounding ground
into a filter, and" in order to make a depositing place for the water which
trickles through. The spring has made its way through similar passages,
sometimes easily traced, and has the advantage of coming to the surface clear,
without any such accidents as may occur to disturb the purity of a well. In
many parts of the country these springs are hard ; they often go through a
great extent of soil and collect a considerable amount of inorganic salts,
varying, from the strong solutions found at celebrated watering-places, to the
milder form of a few degrees of hardness. Whilst the inorganic matter in-
creases with the depth of the flow of water, the organic matter decreases, and
may be said entirely to disappear. This is accomplished even at a depth not
very great. It always happens, except when the well is not sufficiently
sheltered from the surface-water, either from the soil being too porous in
proportion to the depth, or from the surface-water having in some way a too

readv passage into the well.
    In" examining this matter, I have been struck with the numerous cases
              ON THE AIR AND WATER OF TOWNS.                             6f

of this kind which happen in country places ; the well is put in a garden or

back yard.and often verylittle defended. The number of cases of sickness from

these causes  amis, I  inclined  to think, greater than  is believed.  Although

it is not my province to examine the matter in a medical point of view, I have

had opportunities of perceiving, partly alone, partly in conjunction with me-

dical men, that there are constantly occurring cases which seem to be brought

on or aggravated by the state of the wells. The impurities which occur in

the country wells are chiefly organic matter. This is known by its decom-

position, a small amount producing a disagreeable smell and taste, and at the

same time a dullness in the water, so that it makes itself known to us by three

of our senses. If it is merely surface-water somewhat cleared by standing still,

it will make itself known by depositing a great amount of green vegetation,

when a little is allowed to stand in a clear bottle. The remedy for this evil

is not difficult, and probably very well known. It consists in defending the

entrance of water into the well in such a manner that the Avater shall be fil-

tered. If a well be badly supplied with filtering material, the use of sand will

make a good filter, placed round the well so that the water may pass down

and bubble up like a spring from the bottom. In the country the organic

impurity may be easily removed in this manner ; but in the town, or near

cesspools and similar places, the impurity, if removed, leaves behind it an

--unfortunate result, the formation of nitrates and increase of chlorides, and

often of other salts, chiefly of lime. This water may be perfectly clear and

often is brilliant ; and some people do not discover a nauseous taste until the

solution of salts becomes so strong as to give the water the sluggish flow of

oil. So little is the taste of good water known in a town, that water, which

to an ordinary taste was nauseous and almost painful, has been in use for

years by people who might rationally have been expected to know better.

This complete nitrification and thorough removal of the organic matter

occurs chiefly in town wells, the complete change being much less frequent

in the country; the cause of this lies, no doubt, in the slower and more

thorough filtration, and therefore the more elaborate cleansing when passed

through a hard soil, and in the removal of the rain-water by surface-drainage

or by sewers before it is allowed to weaken the solutions by being absorbed

into the soil. The amount of organic matter which is removed or altered in

this way is surprising, and the power of efi'ecting this transformation is a

most important and valuable part of the functions of a soil. Of course

the same change takes place in country places, in gardens, for example, well

ornamented and not well drained, where the water has much organic matter

in solution and stands long on the soil. This change takes place very close

to the cesspool or to the source of the flow of organic matter, and at a very

short distance water may be found containing very little besides inorganic

salts. Very near a sewer, in one of the worst streets in Manchester, I found

sand which was almost free from organic matter, although the drain had given
way and was allowing the sand to absorb whatever it could. The same ob-

servation was made on the sand of a churchyard in which burials Avere very

frequent, showing the great advantage of a porous soil in removing offensive

materials by an agency within itself, preventing the corruption of the atmo-

sphere to an extent greater or less, according as the powers of the soil are

 under- or over- taxed.

    As an agent for purifying towns this oxidation of organic matter is one of

I

I the most marvellous, we might almost say, and necessary. If the impure

organic matter were taken underground by the natural flow of Avater, the

, state of the subsoil would become pestilential in the extreme, and towns could

 not be inhabited without such careful drainage as we have never yet seen

;I

' f2
--68 REPORT 1851.

in fact the soil would require to be impenetrable. To inhabit a place for a
few months would be to make it unhealthy. Instead of such a result, we

have the soil of towns, which have been inhabited for centuries, for a time
longer than history can tell us of, in a better state than the soil round many

a country-house. St. Paul's churchyard may he looked on as one of the

oldest parts of London, I suppose ; the water there is remarkably free from

organic matter, and the drainage of the soil is such that there is very little if

Aany salts of nitric acid in it.  well at Tower Hill was in a similar condi-

tion, but not so thoroughly nitrated. Of course there are parts of a town

Avhere the matter becomes too great to be managed well, and being combined

with bad drainage, even the active state of the subsoil, which seems to do

its utmost to destroy all the elements of disease which enter into it, is not

sufficient to remove the amount continually supplied to it from some hundred
acres of closely-built ground. Even in these cases however we are more
surprised at the comparative purity of the subsoil than at the impurity. As

it is, the impurity of the subsoil in certain parts of towns requires proof; and

although proof can be got and is got, without this action of the soil the

proof would stare us all painfully in the face and hunt us out of its vicinity.

It has become necessary to prove the great amount of evil resulting from

burial in towns, whilst the enormous amount of organic matter has disap-

peared rapidly from our view, and the evil seems only to become distinct to

us when the mould of the churchyard has become in a great measure the

remains of organized beings.

   If soil has such a power to decompose by oxidation, we want to know how it
gets so much of its oxygen, and here there appears a difficulty ; we must,
however, look at once to the air as the only source, and see how it can furnish
the supply. When water becomes deprived of its oxygen, it very soon takes

it up again. If watei' be deprived of its oxygen by the use of sulphate of

iron, so as to make a white precipitate of protoxide of iron, or if it be de-

prived of it by boiling, and a little white precipitated protoxide of iron placed

at the bottom, it will be found that a few minutes will give some colour to the

iron. It will pass through the blue and almost black stages to the yellowish

brown, taking the oxygen from the water, which again supplies itself from the

air, and is in fact a kind of porous medium for the gas. This shows us readily

how the soil may be oxidized, how the nitric acid may be formed under the

Wesurface of town soil.  do not in fact find it formed at great depths, but we

find it formed in undrained places which have no other source of oxygen.

It may seem a trifling matter to explain this, but it was a difficulty to me to
see how the oxygen could be collected in some of the almost subterranean

circumstances in which it accumulated. Water from wells in a soil like this,

continually obliged to force oxidation, is sufficiently objectionable, and it
requires no eloquence to deter people from using it when they once know it.

Perhaps, however, when the nitrates are in not very large quantities, M'hen

they cannot be tasted, the water may be reasonably considered much better

than any water with matter in it liable to putrefactive decomposition, and

the general testimony of tradition is to consider it so.

It appears, in fact, that organic matter is incapable of passing deep into a

soil ; by conversion into soluble salts it becomes soluble, and by that means it

is easily washed away in an inorganic state. When this occurs in the country,
the use of it is not so apparent as when it occurs in a town. When there is

a great excess of organic matter on the surface of the ground, it does of
course decompose, and the results are bad for health ; and if ammonia is

formed too rapidly, bad also for the soil, which loses its food for plants. The

formation of nitrates prevents the passage of nitrogen into the atmosphere, it
ON THE AIR AND WATER OF TOWNS.                    69

subjects the soil however to a loss by drainage. The use of nitrates as a

manure has long been known to be valuable ; our old English philosophers

have been well-aware of it, for example, Boyle and Bacon. Before the nitre

can be formed in the soil, the ammonia must be oxidized ; and before it can

be used as food for plants, the process must be reversed and it must become

deoxidized. The oxygen thus stored up may then readily be applied for rapid

oxidation when this is wanted, and in this way it becomes a kind of concen-

trated atmosphere, a source of air by which to form carbonic acid from the

Wemould of the soil.  can readily view it as a great stimulator of vegetable

life, besides being a source of nitrogen to feed the plants. In dry climates,

perhaps it might be viewed as a supply of water, as we might readily consider

it formed by the union of the oxygen with the hydrogen of substances in the

ground. The organic matter in a soil may be supposed to decompose in

two methods, by the formation of ammonia and of nitric acid. If the soil is
very alkaline and moist, the conversion of the organic matter into ammo-

niacal compounds is very rapid. I put some soil, not very rich in organic
matter, into this condition by the assistance of a little ammonia so as to make

it alkaline, and the consequence was the rapid occurrence of a very intense

putrefactive decomposition, not in any Avay differing, as far as could be per-

ceived, from that of ordinary putrefaction of animal and vegetable matter.

These nauseous and unwholesome odours are therefore possible from the

ordinary soil of our fields ; but any occurrence such as this on a large scale

would be disastrous, and the ground is protected from it by an almost con-

stant acidity, whicli sometimes increases so as to be injurious, forming what

is called sour land. This very acid state generally occurs in wet land, where
it is probable that alkalinity would be most injurious, but the soil may be

found alkaline in a well-manured garden and where the ground is dry without

apparent injury. The other mode in which the organic matter may decom-

pose is by the formation of nitric acid, the nitrogen obtaining oxygen indi-

rectly from the air, and so providing against the excess of ammonia which

might readily occur in certain soils, producing results which would be fatal

to animal life, if not provided for by an enormous vegetation. At the same time
it does seem reasonable to suppose that the cause of a diseased climate may

frequently be found in such a decomposition as that mentioned, when too

much ammonia has been formed, or too little nitrogen has been removed

by the formation of nitric acid. All the circum.stances may be found for the

purpose, abundance of nitrogen compounds and moisture ; even a warm

climate is not essential. And it also seems reasonable to suppose that the

formation of nitric acid is one of the means by which such evils are avoided,

whether in town drainage, \i here it becomes evident from the great amount

found, or in the imperfectly drained and rich, although not swampy lands of

tropical climates, where the large amount of nitrogen, if converted into am-

monia, would no doubt produce the worst eifects.

   Water alone on soil often becomes too saturated with organic matter for
use, and either attacks also the living plants, or induces circumstances which

forbid them to grow. Let us suppose the soil dried up ; the decomposition

would cease, and the nitrates formed would come out in efflorescence. Let

us suppose it not dried, but kept constantly moist and cold, and we have the

    ground in a state described in a very interesting manner by Bernardini Ra-

1

     mazzini, producing a disease which is not unlike the potatoe disease with us,

70 REPORT 1851.

the fish increased in such quantities as was not before known on any previous
year, so " that Neptune, instead of Ceres, supplied food" to the country.
About the beginning of June there appeared on vegetation a form of ru-
higo, a rusty withered appearance ; the same disease had occurred the year
before, which had also been very wet, although in a less degree. This disease
increased in spite of all prudential care, beginning with the mulberry and
attacking afterwards the beans very fiercely. This began in low -putrid

places, but it afterwards made its way into elevated situations. He says,
"Luctuosum sane ac deplorandum spectaculum omnium oculis fuit, campos
circumquaque non virentes, sed atratos ac fuliginosos intueri. Anno praece-

dente, rubro colore, hoc anno non creta sed cdrbone notando." " It was a
melancholy sight and painful to every one to look on the fields, which, instead
of being green and healthy, were everywhere black and sooty. The former
year might be marked red, but this year must be marked, not with white, but
black.". ..." The very animals returned the food which they had eaten, it was
so nauseous .... the sheep and the silk-worms perished .... the bees went
timidly to work with their honey-making .... the waters became corrupt and
fevers attacked the inhabitants, chiefly the country people, such as lived in
the wet lands."

    If the rain falls on land where plants are decomposing it will not be fit for
domestic use, unless passed through strata deep enough to clear it ; and water
of this kind, although not so bad as that described at Modena, will be found
more or less to make up rivers which surface-drain rich lands. This water
is always liable to deposit a large amount of green matter, and often in great

quantities, with abundant animalcules. One may even tell this kind of
water by burning the residuum from boiling ; if it has a vegetable odour, it

will after a time deposit vegetation and animalcules interspersed ; if it has

an animal odour, having much nitrogen, the animalcules will be of a different
kind; if it has a peaty odour only, having no albumen, it will produce little
or no deposit. It becomes therefore a matter of great importance, when
examining waters for use, to find v/hat becomes of them after standing awhile.
To say how much organic matter is in them is not enough, but it is import-
ant to know its quality. This difference of quality is the most important
thing to know ; suppose a specimen having merely humus in solution or
crenic acid, an analysis would put it in a very inferior condition to a specimen

of water having organic matter from rich fields, which water had never passed
through the soil, or water which had passed by towns and had in it matter from
the town sewers. The first would be shown by mere chemical analysis to be
the worst, having a larger quantity of organic matter ; the result by standing

would show the superiority. Water may pass by towns, and after standing

a little be very clear ; if kept still longer and in a suitable place, it will de-
posit its impurities in an organized state; it may be filtered again, and again
deposit impurities. The matter is in solution ; and very clear river and other
water is often found in this condition. It is therefore most important, as an
element in the appreciation of water, to find the amount of organizable
matter in it.

   The water from rivers which have run far is apt to contain salts of various
kinds, besides those contributing to hardness, and in this they seem to agree
with water from cultivated land. This would agree also with the deep
drain-water from cultivated land, so far as inorganic salts are concerned. If
water contains lime as a carbonate, the hardness and the amount of lime
ought to be the same. This occurs at the sources of the Thames, where, in
two instances, the hardness was rather greater than the whole amount of in-

organic matter. This is to be accounted for by the excess of carbonic acid

decomposing a little of the soap used to test for hardness. These waters

came out of the inorganic strata direct : the difference in this respect may-

be seen by the following specimens :  luorganic matter

   Hl<'her up the river the extraneous salts diminish as well as the ashes of
the organic substances. The best-drained land (the first two) has very little
in excess, but the badly-drained land has a great deal in excess. Tiie under-
ground cistern, with many impurities, may be looked on as water of very badly-
drained land, and is the worst ; it was taken from a court in London. There
mifht be many instances given of the same kind from wells and elsewhere.

   If we take the excess of inorganic matter over hardness, we shall have:

   Apparently then the difficulty of obtaining water free from impurity in-
creases as we go down a river, and as we come to cultivated land. The deep
drain-water of cultivated land, although having more inorganic matter, is
not in other respects to be objected to. I have several specimens, which,
after standing a long time, have deposited organic matter only in very minute
quantities, and are in fact equal to well-water of considerable depth. The
organizable matter seems to have been removed, although the organic
matter is not entirely removed, the only thing remaining being some of the
highly carbonaceous compounds of the soil. Its superiority over river-water,
which consists often of drainage water from the mere surface, cannot there-
fore be questioned, except when the river-water itself is composed of the
under-drainage of a country, or the drainage of such barren tracts as give off

little organic matter, or readily part with it.
72 REPORT 1851.

There is a not very distinct idea common enough with regard to water,

that it decomposes or becomes putrid. Now, properly speaking, this cannot

be             it  is  entirely  unchanged  in  all  situations ;  but  as  a  vehicle  for impurity,  it
            ;

may be said in popular language to become putrid. Water does not become

putrid therefore in any sense but this, that the matter which it has in solu-

tion becomes decomposed ; this putrefiable matter is obtained by the passage
of the water over the soil or out of the soil at a depth not sufficiently great

for its removal. Sir Humphry Davy says, " Common river-water generally

contains a certain portion of organizable matter which is much greater after

rains than at other times, and which exists in largest quantity when the stream

Arises in a cultivated country."                     good deal of this matter is in very fine

suspension, and without making it appear very turbid takes away at least from

the brilliancy of the water. To give instances will be unnecessary ; water

taken from the surface and allowed to stand, and water from a deep well, or

water taken from a drain which runs clear, may be compared easily by any

one. The soil contains an abundance of organic matter, but the under soil

contains little or none, diminishing as v.e go down. The line of demarcation

between tlie organic and inorganic portion of the soil is very distinct ; if

water be filtered through the upper soil even for a great length of time, the

organic matter is not removed from it; it will even be dissolved out, whereas

the soil immediately below it has first very little and then no organic matter

in it, whilst the constant draining downwards does not drag down to it the

soil of the surface ; the two remain distinct portions of the organism, so to
speak, of the soil. The use of this is also sufficiently clear; in growing, the

plants require that the food should be in solution, and the water dissolves it
but when it passes away tlie plants require that it should leave the food be-

hind it, and accordingly it leaves it.

Although the soil is acid, it is worthy of remark that waters flowing

from soils, river-waters and well-waters are alkaline, made so by lime-

salts generally, and also by niagnesian and alkaline salts. It is remarkable

with what rapidity the lime is dissolved, and how steadily the hardness of the

water is preserved at one point for years. The acidity of the soil must first

be neutralized by the lime, and an additional quantity be then taken up, the
lime compound being retained in the filtering medium, and the organic mat-

ter thereby prevented from removal. But the power of the soil to retain

matter does not depend on any mere formation of insoluble compounds, on

alkalinity and acidity ; but entirely on the action as a filter on what may

perhaps be termed its mechanical power, although it is not purely so.

   To show this, a solution of peaty matter was made in ammonia; the solu-

tion was very dark, so that some colour Avas perceived through a film only the

twentieth of an inch in thickness. This was filtered through sand, and came

through perfectly clear and colourless, having still a great excess of ammonia.

   Acetic acid was added to it until it became acid ; this solution was perfectly
clear (I may mention that acetic acid does not dissolve it if used first) ; it

passed acid through the filter of sand, and became colourless.

Thinking to try the power of such a filter, I dissolved some organic matter

in strong sulphuric acid, to see if the strength of the acid would not act as a

counter agent to the great decomposing power of the sand. The acid was

allowed to pass through almost pure, although the depth was only about four

inches.

   The same was tried with muriatic acid, which was black by the mixture of
some organic substance ; it passed through the sand rapidly, and was in fact

brilliant.

Sometimes, if the purifying is not completed by merely passing through
                  ON THE AIR AND WATER OF TOWNS.                                                      73

the sand, it is completely done by simply allowing it to stand in contact with

the sand. This would seem to indicate that the action was in a great mea-
sure, if not entirely mechanical ; at the same time it is not an action which
takes place in a moment ; some time is required for it.

If the water is driven too rapidly on it will not be filtered, and wells in

wet weather often indicate this by becoming turbid. It is true that beco-

ming turbid is different fi'om discoloration, but the particles which are carried

forward by the water are frequently those which have organic matter in them,
as may be shown by the deposit on standing. Time, however, is wanted

as a continued standing with the sand shows, and as the slow percolation

through soil also shows, the purification is most complete when the passage

Aof the water is continued for some time.     case was related to me by a

gentleman who had attempted to filter beer through a barrel of sand and

charcoal ; the filter was too strong for it, and it came through pure water.

I may add, from my own experiments, that a bottle of porter after standing

some time was made into a bottle of something like ale, the dark colouring

matter quite removed, and the taste nearly destroyed.

The material of the filter is also of inferior importance; one of the best

filters which I have made, as far as clearing of the water is concerned, was

of steel filings ; the water was of course rather a chalybeate. Oxide of iron

and    oxide  of  manganese made  very  good  filters                      pounded  bricks also,  as  far
                                                                        ;

as clearness is concerned, and mere removal of colour from the water.

Filtration, therefore, has another object in view besides the mere straining

through a substance, the pores of which are not sufficiently large to allow the
larger pieces to pass. The removal of organic matter in solution is one im-

portant object, as well as the formation of nitrates in some conditions. The

passage thi'ough the soil is very slow, and the complete act of filtration has

Wetime to be elaborated.  sometimes see water flowing from land having

only a slight moisture visible in it, and we see from whole acres a mere

Wedropping from the drains.       know, too, that water is kept close in contact

with surfaces, so much so as to give us the idea of very great force. It will

not pass through a porous substance unless its place is supplied by other

water; it will not keep its level in such situations as it does in a free state.

We may imagine, then, the great amount of surface with which it must

come in contact, moving slowly through acres and sometimes miles of

soil.

Mere freedom from matter in suspension is got very readily by the use

of fine porous substances ; the upper soil itself will take away matter in sus-
pension ; and peat will do so readily, sometimes without giving any colour
to the water. Mere fineness of pores is not therefore what is wanted, as the

finest part of the soil is uppermost.

Rivers have often a brown colour, arising from clayey particles in union

or in conjunction with organic matter; that is, the water in these cases, if

allowed to stand, does not deposit mere mud, but also organized bodies, the
same circumstances which bring one, bringing also the other. Motion
through soil with fine particles in it requires to be slow, otherwise there is
turbid water formed. It is remarkable how bright most of the chalk waters
are ; although hard, the chalk removes the fine substances that are so often
found suspended in water like small hairs, or in an invisible form, causing only
a dullness of appearance. This mechanical action is not difficult to procure,
as even in a laboratory the most brilliant solutions are obtained by the use of
paper only. Some substances are readily filtered out ; others are very difla-
cult to filter, and some cannot be filtered ; some will not filter in water, but will
readily in acid. There does appear to be an action by which a substance
--74 REPORT 1851.

 attracts all the impurities in water, or envelopes them in itself, as alum or
 albumen or lime is used to clear water, but I don't see any of these acting to

 cleanse the streams to any extent.
    The decoloration of water is not so striking on cultivated laud, because

 the colour is not so great ; but the colour on the hills which are covered with
 peat is of a deep brown, and it is curious that we have from such places the

 finest water.

    I have observed in several places that where the brown streams have been
 led into reservoirs on the top of the hill, or on the sides of the hill, or even at
 the bottom of the hill, these reservoirs have continued brown. The canal also
 from Leeds to Manciiester is brown, although the water is brought down a

 considerable distance. When these streams are led through artificial conduits

 or pipes, they do not become colourless ; at least the Sheffield water, although
 it may clearitself to some extent on the way, is still delivered in the town of
 a decidedly peaty colour. It is believed that plants obtain carbonic acid by
 the oxidation of humus and analogous substances ; but it is difficult to believe
that in the course of a few miles so much oxidation should take place on the
surface of a stream as to remove colour. Many of the streams come out pure
 from the hill, and, although fi-om a bed of peat of great thickness, are brilliant
and colourless. These hills may be found covered above, and in all hollow
 and flat places, with water which is of a deep brown colour, and strong taste.
It has been said that the purification is made by the dashing among the peb-
 bles and mingling with the air, but the most highly-aerated water is not found
in these streams. If this were a very important agent in purifying a short
water-course, the streams would have around them an atmosphere of car-
bonic acid, or they would sparkle with increased beauty as they proceeded,
until they bubbled with carbonic acid. I have never traced a stream in this
state of purification ; there is generally an influx of other water from various
points which influence its purity, and which probably contribute more to it

than the action of the air. It is curious, too, that the streams are brighter
in summer, although the water dissolves more peaty matter ; for then stronger
solutions of peat are to be found on the hills and in some streams.

   The water, however, may often be observed in tiie act of being cleared. On
the top of a hill we see a swamp over which it is difficult and indeed impos-

sible to pass without sinking deep enough to become wet ; we go round it, and
on every side it is dry. Very often there is one side depressed with a passage
for the water down the hill. This passage is often wet all the way down ; the

water collects from all sides and forms into a stream. I shall describe a pretty

common case as I have observed it at Tintwisle. There was no perceptible

passage of water from the swamp, although there was an easy natural flow
whenever the water rose high enough to take that mode of discharging itself.
This bed, if it may be so called, was at the time I examined it quite dry ; under
the turf there was coarse gravel, the surface of the white siliceous rock being
considerably broken. The v/ater in the swamp above was very brown ; going
further down there issued from the side of the hill a stream of pure water
the water came from the swamp through the gravel, and went down the side
of the hill pure; before getting down it was lost again, entirely disappearing
through some more gravel, but it made its appearance again still lower down.
It was nearly lost a third time by going into some grass land, which it made
very swampy, before it got finally down to the main brook. There was no
want of an opportunity to clear itself; the space was not above a few hundred
yards in which it sunk twice and re-appeared. After having seen this, I began

to find that it was common ; I found two streams near together, each draining
a considerable amount of wet land ou a hill neap Buxton, and disappearing
ON THE AIR AND WATER OP TOWNS.                                75

entirely, after beginning their flow down a narrow gorge which they seem to
have made for themselves. On walking up these streams, which were of a

considerable size, each was found to disappear ; the bed of the streams be-

came entirely dry, although it could be seen that they were very often filled

high with water. On going a little higher the streams appeared again, with

a taste of peat, which they had not below. Afterwards I began to find that

the disappearance of a stream which was wonderful in fable, was a very

common thing on these hills. Of course perfect purity is not found in these

cases ; the last traces of organic matter are only removed by passing through

great depths or long standing.

Again, by observing the manner in which a stream collects water, this

disappearance, however common, may be seen not to be essential to the fil-
tering of a stream. On the sides of the stream the water may be observed

oozing out of the soil at the lower points, sometimes very slowly, so as only

to give an appearance of moisture to the side ; but when this is continued the

whole length of a stream, the increase of water becomes plain. The actual

point of egress of the water from the soil into a stream which is purified, is,

I conceive, under the upper soil, and the water is in reality filtered, whilst

there is an accession of water from every point of both sides of the stream.

This will in a great measure explain how a stream becomes colourless by

mere running ; if it has come off the grounds without filtration, as is

sometimes the case, especially with the higher streams, by getting too readily

into a channel, the water is mixed with other water, oozing into it on every

side, and thus the filtered water mixes with the unfiltcred ; that water which
comes further down the hill before entering the channel, being most likely to

come through a filtering bed. Water flowing over unbroken and impervious

rocks could not become purified in this way ; it could not be subjected to any

action but the ordinary influence of the air. It would not, however, be ne-

cessary for the purification to be entirely confined to those cases ; a modifi-
cation of them is found when water flows down a hill through the sand or

gravel under the soil, in which case it may break through the soil, or trickle

through the subsoil, as occasion offers. The mere passage upwards through

the soil, in the manner of a spring, will not give it impurity, unless it be very
slow, as in this case it does not much come in contact with it.

This mode of natural purification would indicate that a reservoir for the

supply of pure water should not be put on very high ground, such as at

Blackstone Edge, or in fact so high that these natural processes should be
interfered with. It might lead us also to a mode of collecting, which has not,

as far as I know, been adopted, to drain the ground in such a way as not merely

Whento collect the water, but to filter it at the same time.  the rains are

heavy, the water does not follow any of these courses spoken of, and runs

over the surface, falling into streams without becoming filtered, and taking

down a great deal of matter in suspension. This could not be prevented pro-
bably when there is a great amount of water ; but in ordinary cases it might be
so hemmed in as to prevent it flowing away except through a filtering medium.

In some cases this would be very easy, where the water flows very gradually

out of a mass of peat. No filtering beds would be required, and little if any

attention. In looking over a large extent of sandy district in Surrey slightly

covered with heath, I was struck with the fact, that the upper sand, wherever

it was. bared, was washed white ; it was also white wherever it was on the sur-
face, although sometimes mixed with peat so as to give it a dark colour,
until the peat was washed off. The under-sand, however, was of a yellow-

ish or reddish colour, caused by oxide of iron. The acid from the peat had
washed away all the iron out of the sand, and left the colour of the silica pure.
--76 REPORT 1851,

whilst even a few inches below there was no colour removed from the sand.

There was another circumstance to be mentioned, that the water coming from

the lower strata had no taste of peat, whilst that coming from the upper strata

had. The whole surface might be taken as an instance of a great filtering

bed ; but it is very remarkable that the filtering did not appear to be gradual,

but instantaneous ; the sand did not gradually become redder on going down,

but it was red at once, and did not ciiange. The organic matter seems to be

Aremoved at a certain point, and not to go below it.  few inches below the

soil there was to be seen a black band running all along the country, I might

say, and I dare say most persons will have seen something similar where peat

lies on sand. The blackness was evidently caused by a constant deposit of

dark peaty matter on the point of filtration, as it may be called. There were

cases in which the water Howed over the bare sand, and then the blackness

was on the surface of the sand ; where there was vegetation, it was below the

roots. This black matter along with the sand looks like a sand and charcoal

filter. The same may be seen to a less extent on land which has not been

ploughed up for some time, a mark running along under the soil where

Wecolouring matter seems to have been deposited.  may very correctly look

on the soil as the greatest agent for purifying and disinfecting. Every im-

purity is thrown upon it iu abundance, and yet it is pure, and the breathing

of air having the odour of the soil, lias, on what evidence I dnn't know, but

evidently with truth, been considered wholesome. Whatever may be taken

up by the soil the water is discharged clear, and although vegetation does its

part, we do not wait the return of the season to remove impurities from the

air above the soil ; they are laid on in autumn, but do not disturb us. The

purity of drainage water has been observed long ago, so that 1 do not pretend

to advance a novelty; and we find in Loudon's Cyclopaedia of Agriculture,

that " Marshall, seeing the formation of natural springs, and observing the

effect of subsoil drains, and being at the same time aware of an objection to

roof-water, which, though more wholesome, is seldom so weli-tasted as spring

water, was led to the idea of forming artificial land-springs to supply farm-

steads with water in dry situations. He proposed arresting the rain-water

that has filtered through the soil of a grass ground situated on the upper side

of the buildings, in covered drains, clayed and dished at the bottom, and par-

tially filled with pebbles or other open materials, thus conveying it into a well

or cistern, in the manner of roof-water, and by this means uniting, it is pro-

bable, the palatableness of spring water with the wholesomeness of that which

is collected immediately from the atmosphere."

Besides this action of the soil, there is the chemical action by which wells

get filled with carbonic acid ; and water percolating through underground

strata becomes aerated by oxygen or by atmospheric air, and thus nitric

acid is formed. It is known that many substances in the act of decomposition

cause the union of oxygen and hydrogen, and in doing this some of the oxy-

gen is used for the formation of carbonic acid. This is a sufficient source of

the carbonic acid found in water, where time' and opportunity is given, such

as in passing through deep strata; and when we suppose it pressed into

the water by the mechanical force, such as is found in capillary and surface

action, we have in nature a close resemblance to the artificial plan of prepa-

ring soda and aerated waters. Sharp sand has been found to be most suitable

for the passage of water, and sharp pieces of glass have been found to cause

the union of oxygen and hydrogen more readily, and at a lower temperature

than rounded pieces. If the wells get their carbonic acid in this way, that is,

from the decomposing organic matter, the very impurities of the soil become

the greatest elements in purifying the water, and in rendering it palatable
ON THE AIB AND WATER OF TOWNS.  77

and sparkling, as well as dissolving rocks, and making those various solutions
which we often find difficult to imitate. At the same time we must infer that
the purest water is a great agent in removing the vegetable matter from the
soil, in the form of carbonic acid, and that it is not essential that the carbonic
acid should rise directly from the soil, or that plants should be placed on the
spot to consume it. It has never been the custom to add oxygen to any of
the aerated waters ; but although very little is absorbed, it would probably
be a very useful imitation of the natural process to add that gas in addition

to carbonic acid.
    Rain-water has often been asserted to be the purest of all water, and if

falling on siliceous rocks it must still remain pure, as they have very little
soluble matter to impart. This may be the case in some districts, but the
probability is against it, as rain is a mode of removing impurities from the
atmosphere ; and for the large towns in Lancashire, and similar places, there
can be no reliance placed on mere rain-water. Collected in a town, we know
it to be a nauseous and black liquid ; and when we go a mile from a town it
is no less nauseous, although it loses its blackness. This would show that the
black soot from chimneys is deposited very near a town, although the soluble

substances are carried further ; and it may be observed, that in wet weather
the smoke falls more rapidly, from the soot becoming heavy with moisture,
as well as from the change of the barometer. Even many miles round a town

the rain is unfit for use, without being passed through purifying materials.
I have tried it as far as ten miles from Manchester ; and it is probable that it
is nowhere free from objection, as it has been found necessary to take means
to render it palatable even in agricultural districts. But this same water
having passed through sand or rock comes out brilliant and in every respect
good, being purified by the natural process. For this reason, as has been

often remarked, the water springing out at some depth is much superior to

that lying on the surface.
    Even rain-water standing for a time gives indications of organization, which

is not the case with deep water. Although the water which does not come
from a great depth does contain more organic matter than rain-water, it has

gained other advantages sufficient to overbalance that fault ; if, indeed, the
small amount of organic matter found in water from sandstone can be looked

on as a disadvantage. As the washing of the air seems to be one of the duties
of rain, it is not surprising that some mode should be again employed by na-
ture to purify the rain. The action of the soil for this purpose seems to be a

necessary completion of the process. Dew does not exhibit the same extent

of impurities, no doubt arising from the limited space in which it is formed
whilst the rain passes through a large extent of air.

    As the use of surface-water has been so highly recommended, I have thought
it well to state the valuable qualities of a good filter, and the mode in which
I believe the best wiiler is produced. This I believe to be by filtration, which,
even more than distillation, removes the organic matter, and more than any
known method, improves the taste and the appearance. As the rain-water
 has washed the air, and the deep well-water has brought with it solutions of
 degraded rocks to a large extent, both seem objectionable ; and as the surface-
 water carries along with it matters of all kinds in solution and suspension,
 according to circumstances, it seems more advisable that the water which has
 been purified by passing not too deep under the surface should be used, since
 all the advantages and all the peculiar powers of filtration are found in that
 portion of the ground.

Report of the Committee appointed by the British Association to consider the
  probable Effects in an (Economical and Physical Point of Vieto of the De-

   struction of Tropical Forests. EyDv.HvGii Cleghorn, Madras 3Tedical
   Estahlish7nent; Professor Forbes ^oyi,^, King' s College, London; Captain

   R. Baird Smith, Bengal Engineers \ Captain 11. Strachey, Bengal

Engineers,

As preliminary to the Report which your Committee has now the honour to
submit, we have to make the following remarks. The great extent of the

subject prescribed to us, involving as it would have done, if completed in its

integrity, the collection of materials from every tropical region on the surface

of the globe, would have involved an amount of labour which we had neither

the time nor tlie means of devoting to the subject. Three of our members

had special duties required from them, which did not admit of being in any

way postponed*, and it has been consequently on the fourth (Dr. Hugh Cleg-

horn) that almost the entire labour has devolved of collecting and digesting

the materials now laid before youf.
   The personal relations of the whole of the members of your Committee

with the Tropical Region of British India, naturally suggested to them the

propriety of limiting their researches to that field wherein they had them-

selves been employed, and with the circumstances of vvhich they were not

only best acquainted, but had also the best means of filling in any imperfec-

tions which might exist in their knowledge. The subsequent report has

accordingly reference solely to the Forest Question as applied to India, and

we have endeavoured to collect all such information as would illustrate the

physical and ceconomical effects of the destruction of the natural woods,

which in that, as in other countrie's, are of such admitted importance.
   In reference to the physical efl^ects of the removal of forests, we found

considerable variety of opinions. There is, it must in fact be admitted, a

deficiency of exact or experimental information on ihe subject. Observations

of a, precise character on climate in countries once covered by forests but
now cleared, do not to our knowledge exist, and the evidence with which we

have to deal is a kind of evidence which admits of considerable variety of

interpretation. Of such evidence we have exhibited a number of examples,
and the general conclusions which appear to be warranted by these may be

perhaps best given in the following words of Humboldt, the most eminent
authority who has discussed the question :

   " By felling trees which cover the tops and sides of mountains, men in

--every climate prepare at once two calamities for future generations the

want of fuel, and the scarcity of water  Plants exhale fluid from their

leaves, in the first place, for their own benefit. But various important
secondary effects follow from this process. One of these is maintaining a
suitable portion of humidity in the air. Not only do they attract and con-

dense the moisture suspended in the air, and borne by the wind over the

 also shelter the soil from the direct action of the sun, and thus prevent eva-
 poration of the water furnished by rains." In this way, as Humboldt states,

 the forests contribute to the copiousness of streams.

    The question as between the maintenance and removal of forests appears
 to us to be a question of compensations. Wherever the progress of popu-
 lation requires that every portion of the soil be made to yield its quota of
 human food, there the destruction of forests is to be desired, and the disad-
 vantages to which want of wood for social and general purposes may lead,
 must be compensated for, as they doubtless will be, by the ingenuity which
 is born of necessity. But there are localities in nearly all countries to

 which the tide of population can never flow, but where the forest can

flourish, and wliere it ought to be maintained. To tropical countries, the

 preservation of the springs which feed the rivers, on which the fertility of the

 land and the prosperity of the people are so essentially dependent, is of the

 greatest importance. These springs rise in the mountain regions where

 forests prevail, and it is to such regions that a protective agency should be
extended, for there can be but little doubt that the entire removal of wood
leads to the diminution of water. In a single sentence, we would say that
where human exigences, whether for subsistence or for health, require the
destruction of forests, let them be destroyed ; but where neither life nor

health is concerned, then let a wise system of preservation be introduced
and acted upon.

    The planting of such trees as are desirable from the fruit which they
afford, or grateful from the shade which they yield, is an act which has been
held in high esteem in eastern countries, especially India, from very early
times. The eastern appreciation of the luxury of shade led to the banks of
the canals, constructed by the Mahommedan emperors, being planted, and

the waysides of the imperial roads being lined with trees of various kinds

in the Sunnud of the Emperor Akbar, it is directed, " that on both sides of the
canal down to Hissar, trees of every description both for shade and blossom,
be planted, so as to make it like the canal under the tree in Paradise ; and
that the sweet flavour of the rare fruits may reach the mouth of every one,
and that from those luxuries a voice may go forth to travellers calling them
to rest in the cities where their every want will be supplied*."

   But the planting of trees for timber seems to have been neglected there, as
it has been in most other countries, until modern times. This is no doubt
owing to self-sown forests being more than sufficient to supply all the wants
of man in tlie earlier states of society. As population and civilization are
advanced, such forests are looked upon rather as impediments to agriculture,
than as sources of wealtli, and the means of removing trees are more thought
of than the readiest modes of propagation, or how they should be treated so
as to produce tiie best timber in the shortest time, and in the fullest quan-
tity that the ground is capable of bearing, and so managed that it may yield
some profit even M'hile the timber is growing f.

   British India is so extensive an empire, so diversified in soil and climate,
as well as in natural and agricultural products, that it is impossible to pre-
dicate anything respecting it generally ; that which is descriptive of one
part, is not necessarily applicable to another. Thus some parts are covered
with primaeval forests, as the mountainous coasts of Canara and Malabar, the
country surrounding the Neilgheerics the Tenasserim Provinces, much of
Central India, the base of the Himalayan Mountains from Assam up to the

banks of the Ganges, as it issues from the hills, and beyond it ; while other
parts are not only bare of trees, but even of vegetation of any kind, as the
deserts which run parallel with the Indus, and stretch more or less into the
interior of India. The North-western Provinces, as well as many parts of
the Peninsula of India, are generally bare of timber-trees, as are also the
highly cultivated Southern Provinces of Bengal. But in most parts of India
clumps of trees may be seen by the traveller in every direction in which he
can look. This is owing to the Indian practice of embowering every village
in a clump or tope of trees, generally of the Mango, but frequently the
Bur, Peepul, Tamarind, &c. are found, some yielding fruit, others grateful for
their shade, and some yielding fodder for elephants and camels. In the
neighbourhood of every village also may be seen tracts of jungle, more or
less extensive, which by some are accounted so much waste land. They ai'e
often composed of long grass, or of low shrubs, as the Dhakand wild Jujube,
with a few trees intermixed, as the Babool and Seriss. These tracts, though
disfiguring the rich appearance of a cultivated country, are far from useless,

as they form the only pastures wliich the natives possess for their cattle, as
well as their whole source of supply for firewood, and whatever timber

may be required for the building of their huts or the making of their agri-

cultural implements.

   From the number and extent of the forests and jungles of India, it might
be inferred that timber was abundant in all parts, not only for home con-
sumption, but that a supply might be obtained for foreign commerce : this is
far from being the case. Though forest lands are extensive, their contents

in accessible situations are not of a nature, or sufficiently abundant, to
supply even the ordinary demands. In India, as in other long inhabited
and early civilized countries, the parts best adapted for agricultural purposes

have long been cleared of jungle. The forests lying nearest to the inha-
bited tracts were first stript of their timber, and as no precautions have been

taken to replace the old trees, a gradual diminution has been observed in the

supply of timber, which has consequently increased in price (as may be seen
in the Government contracts for building and the Commissariat outlay for

firewood), not solely from actual deficiency, but because timber is only ob-
tainable from less accessible situations, with considerable increase of labour

and expense.
    As the principal cities where the greatest demand for timber exists are in

the centre of cultivated tracts, so are they necessarily remote from the forests
from which they require wood, either for the construction of houses and
machinery for ship-building, or other purposes. Hence a commerce in
timber has long been established in India. Calcutta and the cities situated
on the Ganges are supplied with timber grown in the forests which skirt the
foot of the Himalayan Mountains, from Assam to the banks of the Junma.
These supplies are floated on rafts down the numerous feeders of the Ganges,
which forms the great artery of the plains of India. But this is not suflfi-
 cient for the consumption of Calcutta, as considerable quantities are im-
ported from the Burman Empire. In the same way there is an insufficient
 supply for the Madras Presidency, which is made up by importing timber

 from Ceylon.

    Bombay has long been celebrated for the building of ships with teak-wood,
 supplied from the forests of Malabar and Canara, whence timber seems always

 to have been exported even to Arabia and Persia.
     Looking at the extent of India, and reading of its interminable jungles, it

 may seem a work of supererogation to talk of the deficiency of timber or of
 the necessity of protecting its forests. Timber to be valuable must be of the
       ON THE DESTRUCTION OP TROPICAL FORESTS.            81

proper kind, of the proper age, and at proper distances, that is, in accessible
situations. As might have been expected, from continual drains being made

on these forests, without adequate measures having been adopted to keep up

the supply, a continued and increasing deficiency has been experienced in

all parts of India, which has frequently attracted the attention of the Indian

and Home Governments, so that in the Bombay Presidency numerous reports

have been made on the state of the teak forests, and measures adopted for their

improvement, without as yet much benefit.

In the Madras Presidency steps have at different times been taken to

encourage planting, as in the time of Dr. Anderson ; ami lately we have seen

the Madras Government applying annually to Bengal for the seeds of Saul

and Sissoo, for planting in Madras. These have been very successfully intro-

duced and acclimated in the territories of Mysore and other southern pro-

vinces. In a letter from Capt. Onslow to Dr. Cleghorn, dated Shemogah,

--21st July 1847, that intelligent officer writes in reference to a plantation on

the banks of the Toombudra, " I have never seen any vegetation so won-

derful as that of the Sissoo ; last year's seedlings are almost too large to
transplant. It would be a pity to allow the monsoon to pass over without

putting in more seed." The Mahogany (^Sivietenia Mahogani), a tree of

great value and beauty, has been introduced successfully into the Calcutta

Botanic Gardens, and a few specimens are thriving at Madras and in Mysore,

giving promise of its being nearly equal to the finest varieties from the Hon-

duras. Specimens of furniture prepared by Dr. Wallich from trees grown

at Calcutta are now in the museum at the India House.

Dr. Wallich was despatched in 1825 to the Upper Provinces in order

to inquire into and watch over the extensive forests of the empire, which

were found to be undergoing most wasteful and rapid decay. Three MS.

volumes of reports and proceedings, with two original maps of the route

taken by Dr. Wallich and Captain Satchwell, were placed by the Supreme

Government with the Agricultural and Horticultural Society '^ for informa-

tion and deposit." These volumes contain the labours of a body of public
officers, which, under the denomination of " The Plantation Committee,"

originated under the administration of the Marquis of Hastings and con-

tinued in existence six years. The records of its proceedings, as contained

in these volumes, extend over 1070 pages of manuscript. They contain much

and most valuable, indeed generally unknown information, bearing on the

great practical measure of forest cultivation, the Sissoo localities in par-

ticular ; and every eflTort should be made to rescue this information from
oblivion. The late Dr. Spry, Secretary of the Agricultural and Horticul-

tural Society, was desired to undertake the examination of these records,

and favour the Society with a report upon their contents. He devoted much

time to this duty, and reported in July 1841, that the really valuable part of

these papers might be condensed into a small-sized volume of about 250 pages.

The work of condensation, that is the compilation, so as to avoid the official

forms in which the information is introduced that the matter may be brought

into a continuous form, will necessarily be great, and require that some

specific allowance be made for its performance. The carrying out of this

proposal was committed to Dr. Spry, and had his life been prolonged, would

has not devolved upon any of his friends, considering the importance of

giving publicity to such valuable information, and we still think the matter

mony to the value of the information, and stated that if the undertaking be

sanctioned, he would be most happy and willing to give his valuable assist-
ance in the work, of publication.

   " The reports of Dr. Wallich are particularly valuable respecting the
natural forests, both of those within the British territories in India, and also
those of the neighbouring powers. In his visit to the Turai, or low and
moist forest-land skirting the base of the Himalayas, he particularly recom-
mends a vast extent of forest-land in Oude, situated on the east side of the
Kowreala river, as holding out the prospect of very valuable supplies, pro-
vided that means are adopted for preventing wanton destruction and of
allowing the young plants to grow up and supply the place of those which
are cut down. Among the forests in our own provinces, Dr. Wallich adverts
particularly to those occupying the Islands of the Gogra, commonly called
Chaudnee Choke. He represents them as extremely important, and in every
way deserving of being pi'eserved for the exclusive use of the Government, and
especially of being emancipated from the destructive depredations which are
annually committed. The Sissoo and Saul forests of the Deyra Doon are
also recommended to be preserved for the use of the service ; though from
these the facility of transportation is represented as not equal to that from
the otiier quarters previouslj' mentioned. But they are nevertheless as im-
portant for the stations in the north-west of India, as the forests of Oude
and Gorukpore are for those in the south. As considerable deficiencies of
timber, at least of those kinds usually employed, such as Saul and Sissoo,
besides Bamboos, had been experienced, and as the deficiency every day in-
creased, Dr. Wallich was induced to recommend that Government should
interfere in the management of the forests; for the natives, from their ex-
tremely injudicious mode of felling forests, cut and carry away all that are
easily accessible, both young and old plants, without planting any thing new
in their place, or encouraging the growth of the young seedlings. Another
great defect in the native mode of managing timber, is their total neglect of
any regular system of seasoning :-- timber ever being seasoned by them
at all, depends upon the proprietor not having been able to sell it." Royle's
Prod. Resotirces of India, p. 189.

    The glory of the Malabar and Tenasserim forests is their teak, the vast
importance of which is becoming daily more known and appreciated ; the
timber indeed has been long prized. Bontius described the tree under the
name of Quercus Indicu, though except as regards the timber it has no re-
semblance to the Oak. Rhaede has given an accurate representation of

--Tectona grandis, and refers to the teak forests of Malabar in these terms

(Hort. Malab. iv. t. 27) : " Crescit ubique in Malabar, at praesertim in pro-
vincia Caiicolan (Calicut) ubi integrse sylvae ingentium harum arborum

reperiuntur.* * Lignum vero hujus arboris quercino ligno hand absimile,
operi fabrili accommodum, atque naupegis ad navium fabricam in usu est:

sed in aquis (prsesertim dulcibus) teredini facile obnoxium.'"

    It Avill be shown that these large I'orests, supplying thejlnest sort of teak,
had fallen long ago into a deplorable state, both old and young trees having
been indiscriminately cut down, without regard to future supply.

   " This work of destruction," according to John Edye, Esq. (As. Soc
Journ. ii.), " is conducted by a company of Parsee merchants, who take a cer-
tain number of the natives from Mangalore at the proper season for felling,

and, without consideration for the future, cut all sorts of peon-spars, saplings
as well as large trees, to the great injury of the forests. There were hun-
dreds of small spars from five to nine inches diameter, and thirty-five to
Beventy-five feet long, actually decaying on the beach at Mangalore at the

time I was there ; from which circumstance in the course of a few years these
valuable forests must be exhausted. The whole of this trade is in the hands
of a combined party of these people, who never fail to take advantage of any
particular demand that may occur."

  --Jn Wight's ' Illustrations,' vol. ii., just received, he remarks, " The timber

of the Tectona grandis is about the most highly esteemed in India, that of
nearly all other trees is spoken of as jungle-wood and inferior. Time does

not now permit, otherwise some remarks might have been offered on the
subject of the preservation of the teak forests, and the recent fearful waste
and destruction of that valuable, I had almost said invaluable, tree in all our
teak forests, without a single step being taken either to keep up the stock
or preserve young trees from the ruthless hands of contractors and others,
licensed to cut teak timber. Measures are now, I believe, in. progress to
arrest the ruinous destruction that has for some years been going on, and it
is hoped that the Directors will succeed in their object ; otherwise the stock
in hand will soon be exhausted."

   The following extract is from a private letter of Dr. Macfarlaue, late

Zillah Surgeon, Mangalore :
    " For the Canara forests, I can testify from personal observation as late

as December 1849, that Coomree clearing was being carried on to a most
destructive extent in those tracts surrounding the falls of Gair-soopah. As
far as I could get any information on the subject from Lieut. Walker of the

Engineers, who is employed in the district of Canara, and with whom I

visited an extensive Coomree inclosure near the Deva-raunny Ghaut, no
check seems to be exercised over the forest population in this respect.
Lieut. Walker's description to me was, that the jungle people ringed the
trees to kill the large ones, took the branches and made a fence against wild
animals, burnt as much as they could, and then took one or two crops of

millet (or ragee) out of the soil, going over to another tract and repeating
the same practice. All around in that primaeval forest, thousands of acres
were, or had been, evidently under Coomree, the large timber-trees de-
stroyed, the spaces left blank in the forest, and in all these Coomree spaces
that had again been left to nature, I could not help remarking that wild
plantains invariably sprang up in myriads."

   The extensive forests of teak mentioned by Buchanan in his ' Journey
through Mysore in 1 800,' have well nigh disappeared, as will be seen by the
details in the following Report :

                                                      " Nuggur Division, Superintendent's Office, Shemoga,
                                                                        5th May 1847.

          " To the Secretary, to the Commissioner of the Government of the

      -- Territories of the Rajah of Mysore.

   "Sir, In connection with the subject of my letter of the 11th March
last, there is another, unquestionably of great importance, now occupying the
attention of the Government of India, and which I am confident will at once

--engage the attention of the Commissioner, I allude to the conservation of

the forests as regards timber, the value of which might with care and atten-
tion be made very important in Nuggur. From want of these nearly all the
fine teak and other timber which once flourished on the banks of the Toonga
and Bhudra rivers have disappeared, and the Government has derived but
very little benefit from it.

    " 2. Vast quantities of various kinds of timber are yearly carried down the
Toongabhadra river to the open coimtry, by people who pay a small sum to
the farmer of the forests for the privilege of cutting it. In the months of
August and September these people take down hundreds of floats made of

                                                                     g2
--84 REPORT 1851..

bamboos loaded with timber. Teak, black-wood, and ebony are forbid to

be cut ; but I am well assured that these proliibited timbers are taken away
in great quantities every year ; we have no means whatever of preventing it.

    " 3. The forests are rented yearly to the highest bidder; the renters, holding
their farms for a year only, have no interest in preserving the forests ; on the
contrary, their interests are best served by their destruction. They make
their profits by taxing the timber-cutters and coomri cultivators ; therefore
the more jungle there is cut, the greater are their profits. The consequence

of this indiscriminate cutting is the total disappearance of teak in localities
where it formerly abounded, especially in the vicinity of the river Toonga.

Buchanan in his ' Journey ' says at vol. iii. p. 287, ' Here {i. e. between Teer-
thully and Mundagudda in the Cowledroog Talook) were many fine teak-
trees, more indeed than I have ever seen in any one place. They might be
of value could they be floated down the Toonga to the Kerishna, and so to
the sea.' This is after he had seen the Soonda and other fine forests in Canara.

When at the same place in February last, I saw no teak, and I saw none the

whole length of the river as far as Mundagudda.
   " 4. There is some teak remaining in the forests near Mundagudda about

twenty miles from this, but it is fast disappearing, and in a few years there
will be none M'ithin the reach of the river. Teak is occasionally cut on
account of Government, brought to Shemoga, and sold ; but it does not bring

a good price. The average amount of sale for the last five years is Com-
pany's rupees 181 6, as is shown in the accompanying statement, which

exhibits also the average of each item of i-evenue, the produce of the forests

for the same time, and a total average of Canteroy pags. 1168 5, or Com-
pany's rupees S397 i 2 annually.

   "5. This is all the revenue that the magnifijcent forests of Nuggur are made
to yield by the present system, which is fraught with mischief. There is no
preservation of the timber that stands, nor encouragement of the growth of
young trees ; and at the present rate of destruction there can be no doubt
that in a few years there will be no valuable timber left in places from which

it can be carried away.
    "6. But this is by no means the only evil : Coomri cultivation is mischie-

vous in various ways. The following are some of the most prominent objec-
tions to it. It causes llie most rapid destruction of the forests, which, it is
a well-ascertained fact, lessens the quantity of rain and moisture, and must
thus, in the course of no very long time, seriously affect the cultivation and
prosperity of the country. The cultivation of the Mulnaad* is solely de-
pendent on rain (there being no irrigation), and requires abundance of it.
The people of the Mulnaad begin already to remark that there is a diminu-
tion of rain ; and I think it highly probable that it is attributable to the vast
extent of Coomri clearings all over the country, but especially along the crest
of the Ghauts. Looking over Canara, immense tracts of Coomri are to be
seen as far as the eye can reach. Some weeks ago I went down the new
Ghaut leading from Hunnaur, above the Ghauts, to Colioor in Canara, and
Avas much struck with the immense extent of Coomri. I saw tens of thou-
sands of acres cleared on the hills. The new pass is six miles long, and is en-
tirely through clearing, where not a single forest-tree is left standing. In these
clearings, the primaeval forest, with all its beautiful timber and valuable pro-
ductions, has given place to a thick scrub of noxious weeds and brambles,
containing nothing useful. It may be supposed that clearing the forest would .
make the country more healthy, and so it would if the clearing were more;
permanent ; but the forest is now destroyed only to be replaced by a thick

                                                             * i. e. Rain-country.
ON THE DESTRUCTION OP TROPICAL FORESTS.  85

jungle of rank vegetation, still more unhealthy than the forest, which being
open below, admits of circulation of air ; but the scrub is a dense mass of
vegetation, and from bottom to top it is about twenty feet high. But however
this may be, I think it is a question worthy of serious attention, whether the
present unlimited destruction of the forest shall be allowed to continue, risk-
ing the diminution of rain, the effect of which would extend over the whole
of the southern part of the peninsula, and perhaps occasion most disastrous

consequences.

   " 7. More inland, Coomri cultivation is destructive of much sandal-wood.
There is now a case under inquiry in the Shikarpoor Talook, in which eighty
trees have been destroyed. The average valueof a sandal- wood tree is from

five to fifteen rupees. In the coffee districts this system is very objectionable.
Coffee will not grow in a Coomri clearing, the soil having been exhausted,

and the fires in the neighbourhood of plantations endanger it. The Coomri
cutters would be nmch better employed in the plantations. Upon a repre-
sentation of these objections, I forbid Coomri in the Chickmoogloor Talook
some months ago.

    " 8. This cultivation has great attractions to the lower classes of cultivators
and labourers; it leads numbers from the cultivation of the beriz-lands, and

thus directly injures the revenue, and produces in those who take to it law-
less and vagabond habits. Along the Ghauts t!ie Coomri cultivators, when
not engaged in their cultivation, employ themselves in smuggling, which the

MuUclearings and their knowledge of the country greatly facilitate. In the

naad a trifling rent is paid to the forest-renter. In the open Talooks a low
rent is paid directly to Government. In either case the payment of it is often
evaded by those who have clearings in remote and inaccessible parts, where
they are not easily discovered. The cultivation is of the rudest and simplest
mode. The trees are felled in January and February, and allowed to remain
in the ground till the next season, when they are burnt. The earth is not
turned at all, and the seed, ragee, castor-oil, or dhoU*, is thrown broad-cast
upon the ashes among the stumps. The crops thus produced are always
abundant. Formerly the practice was to take only one crop, and leave the
clearing, which allowed the stumps to shoot out again, and the same spot
would bear cultivation again after from twelve to twenty years. Rut of late
the practice of repeating the process the second year has grown up. The
same clearing will bear cultivation again after from twelve to twenty years :
when it has been cultivated for only one season the stumps of the trees shoot
out again if only once cut and burnt ; but if this is done a second year, they
perish, root and branch, and the spot is ever after productive of nothing but
scrub. The soil has been totally exhausted, and produces nothing but

weeds. It is probably this practice, which did not formerly exist, that has
caused such extensive destruction of the forest.

    " 9. Coomri cultivation is therefore directly injurious to the revenue ; it
has a demoralizing effect upon a great number of people, and is in all respects
objectionable, except under the circumstances explained in the following
paragraph. The renting system is unproductive of revenue, and destructive

of the forests ; I am therefore of opinion that it ought to be abolished, that

 the forests should be kept in the hands of Government and preserved, and
 that Coomri should be altogether forbidden, except under strict supervision,
 and the orders of the superintendent.

    " 10. There are some parts of the country where clearing the jungle might
 be done with great advantage in many ways. There are extensive ranges of
jungle composed of bamboo and stunted trees, which are quite unproductive,

                         * Eleusine coracana, Ricinus communis and Cajanus indieus.
--86 REPORT 1851.

and the clearing of which I would encourage. The people might be taught

to clear and cultivate the land in a way which would not be destructive of

its powers. There are immense ranges of this kind ofjungle between Chick-

moogloor and Belalryandroog, and in the Luckwolly Talook, to the west of

the Bababooden Hills, which produce nothing whatever, and are very un-

healthy. In other parts, more to the east, there are similar jungles, which

produce sandal-wood. In these, Coomri could be allowed, care being taken

of the sandal-wood. It is along the Ghauts where I think Coomri is particu-

larly objectionable ; there the forests are composed of fine timber-trees, hold

many valuable productions,  and are  perfectly  healthy                                   and it is there  where
                                                                                       ;

the formation of rain would be most aiFected by clearing the forest.

" 11. To bring out the value of the forests, not only should that which exists

be preserved, but considering the vast importance of its timber, teak should

be planted, as is done in other parts of India. Hearing of the successful

planting of teak in Malabar, I applied to Mr. Conolly, the collector, for in-

formation, and he has been kind enough to send me a memorandum of his

method of planting, which he tells me is most successful ; I am confident that
the same could be done in many parts of Nuggur, in the most favourable

positions along the banks of the Toongaand Bhudra rivers, where teak grows

spontaneously, and where, from the facility of transportation afforded by the

river, it would become very valuable. I annex a copy of the memorandum I

have received from Mr. Conolly. I have collected a quantity of teak-seeds,

and Dr. Cleghorn undertakes to raise seedlings here, which I purpose to

plant as an experiment along the banks of the Toonga, between Shemoga

and Mundagudda, where formerly teak grew large and abundantly.

"12. Should the Commissioner sanction my proposal to preserve the forests

and form plantations of teak, it will be necessary to keep up a small establish-

--ment. Perhaps the following would be sufficient for the present : One

Darogha on 6 rupees per month, and twelve Carnatties on 3 rupees. It is

desirable not only to plant young trees, but to facilitate the growth of the

spontaneous seedlings by clearing away obstructions. Buchanan remarks on

this subject in the same paragraph that I have quoted above, ' I know of no

place that would answer better for rearing a teak forest than the banks of

the Toonga, where close to the river there is much excellent soil which is

considered as useless, as there are on the spot many fine teak-trees. All that

would be required would be to eradicate the trees of less value, which I look

upon as a necessary step to procure any considerable quantity of teak in a

well-regulated government.' This remark is perfectly applicable to the

ornamental timber in this country, I will just mention what I discovered at
Hydrabad. I was in want of light-coloured wood for picture-frames, and

applied to the legimental contractor: what was my surprise to find that

every third or fourth log in his great store of firewood was most beautiful
satin-wood of large size ! Only imagine the victuals of a whole regiment, not

to say of a large community, being cooked with satin-wood ! On this fact

becoming known, applicants for the satin-wood became numerous. I con-

sider it nearly equal to the bird's-eye maple for ornamental work.'

ON THE DESTRUCTION OF TROPICAL. FORESTS.  87

   In the following extract of a letter from Dr. Wight to Dr. Cleghorn,

--dated Coimbatore, 3rd April, 1851, it is well observed, "As to the destruc-

tion of forests, it appears to me that there can be but one opinion on the

subject, and that is, that it is most injurious to the welfare of any country,
but especially of a tropical one, and ought upon no account to be tolerated,
except where the ground they occupied can be turned to better account, and

even the entire denudation should be avoided. I am not yet prepared to

admit that trees have the property of attracting rain-clouds, and thereby in-
creasing the quantity of rain that falls ; but there can be no doubt that they
increase the retentiveness of the soil, and moreover keep it in an open
absorbent state, so that in place of the rain running off a scorched and baked
soil as fast as it falls to the earth, it is absorbed and gradually given out by

springs. I am not prepared to go so far as to say, that forests, especially on
high hills, have not the effect of attracting rain-clouds, but I am quite sure

that if they to ever so small an extent have that property, the benefit is aug-
mented a hundred-fold by their property of maintaining an open absorbent

soil.

   " On this ground it is that I should like to see this country extensively

planted, especially on all the elevated lands, because water absorbed in
elevated grounds forms springs in the low ones : you truly say, that short-

sighted folly has already done much mischief, and the Ryots have suffered
to an immense amount. This is most true, but the difficulty is to put the

saddle upon the right horse. Who has done the mischief?

   " Within about fifty miles of the spot whence I write, a tract of country has
been cleared ; the result is that the inhabitants are now so much distressed

for the want of water that they contemplate leaving the country, their wells

being all dry. On inquiry, it does not appear that the rains have fallen below
the usual average, but notwithstanding, the country has become so dry that

their wells no longer provide a sufficient supply of water.

   " Major Cotton, from whom I have the information, attributes it to the rain

running off the baked soil as fast as it falls, in place of sinking into the earth
and feeding springs. The subject is now attracting attention, and doubtless
before long it wilt be ascertained whether forest has the effect of augmenting
the fall of rain, or whether it results from the increased capacity of the soil
for moisture. If the former, it is to be hoped that extensive plantations will
be had recourse to as a means of equalizing the monsoons ; and if the lattei",
that it will be adopted as a means of retaining the water that falls from the

clouds."

   Concerning the vast forests on the opposite side of the Bay of Bengal, the
principal observers, so far as we can learn, have been Wallich, Heifer,

Griffiths, Blundell, Seppings, and O'Riley.
   Dr. Heifer, who has written a Report on the Tenasserim Provinces, speaks

of the Teak as furnishing one of the greatest riches of the country, and being
the foundation of all those improvements which have followed our acquisi-

tion of it. He informs us that many trees perish by bad management ; that
many trees which are killed are not found subsequently fit for use ; that they

are suffered to decay, and generate a host of insects, which attack good
trees before they are seasoned, and that much timber is wantonly destroyed.
" The same negligence of the natives which reigns throughout the country

with regard to wanton destruction of the forests by fire, extends equally to
teak forests ; and I saw extensive tracts utterly destroyed, because it was
the pleasure of some wild Karean to fix his abode in the vicinity, and for this

purpose to clear the jungle by burning all down.
   " As teak is such a valuable article in general, and it may be safely asserted,
--88 REPORT 1851.

hitherto the only one to which Moulmein owes its daily increasing prosperity,
the preservation of teak forests should be the principal care of government."

   The following observations are extracted from a paper by Mr. O'Riley, in

--a recent number of the ' Journal of the Indian Archipelago:' "At the

head of the vegetable productions of spontaneous growth of these provinces,
the Teak of its extensive forests holds the most prominent place ; forming as
it does, the only staple article of commerce that has as yet undergone any
degree of development, and upon which the interests of the port of Moulmein
have arisen and steadily progressed to their present scale of importance.

   " Many obstacles oppose themselves to the attainment of an accurate

knowledge of the actual resources of the teak localities; the most important,

and the only insuperable one, being the excessive unhcalthiness of the forests,
which possess an atmosphere loaded with malaria, and fraught with fever to
all persons unused to its bsuieful influence. Since the demand for teak-
timber for the home market has been created, it will be apparent from the
 following statement of the exports from 1840 to IS-tS, that the quantity to
be obtained is fully equal to the demand for it ; and this is more evident from
 the circumstance of there being at the present time a stock of rough logs

 equal to 15,000 tons of converted timber, which has not yet passed the
general department, the absence of a demand preventing the holders from

 paying the duty upon it.

To which may be added 3415 tons appropriated to ship and house building,

and other purposes, giving a value at the rate of 40 rupees per ton of Company's
rupees 869,800 as an annual amount derivable from this commercial staple of
Moulmein.* * * * For the due encouragement of the timber trades in the first

instance it was deemed advisable to grant licenses to cut teak within certain
ill-defined limits to parties connected with the trade of the place, which teak,

on its arrival from the forests, was subjected to a certain rate of duty.
    " For the preservation of the forests, certain terms were demanded by

Government from the holders of licenses, to the effect that trees below a

standard size were to be left, and for each full-sized tree felled, a stated
immber of young trees were to be planted, the latter from experiment
having been found to be impracticable. With so frail a tenure, it might
have been anticipated that the holders of such licenses, perhaps without any
large amount of cajutal available for forest purposes, would endeavour to

realize the largest possible amount of benefit at the least possible outlay, with-

out reference to tlie ultimate productions of the forests ; hence the system of
sub-letting supervened, as being the most congenial means to the end ; and
the result of such measure has been the working of the forests by Burmese,

who receive an advance on a contract to pay to the holder of the cutting-
license the half of the timber on its arrival in Moulmein. To the same cause
must be assigned the reckless destruction of property, which has become a
system in the extraction of the timber from these forests. Many of the trees
ON THE DESTRUCTION OF TROPICAL FORESTS.            89

being of the largest size, and admirably adapted for ships' masts, are for the
sake of convenience and expedition in their transport to Moulmein, cut into
lengths of more manageable dimensions, say from fifteen to twenty cubits, and
in this form of log depreciate the value of the original spar to one-tenth of

the amount it would have realized as a ship's mast ! No excuse can be ad-

mitted in extenuation of this defective process of \vorking the forests : the
most powerful and effective animal power, in the shape of elephants (which
are in general use in the forest work), is abundant and cheap, and if to that
power the simplest European mechanical appliances were systematically
applied with ordinary skill and management, the British navy might be
masted from the teak forests of these provinces.

    " Whether it be found expedient to reserve the forests as a government
property exclusively, or on the other hand, granting right of property in per-

petuity to the holders of forest licenses on certain well-defined terms, and

--thereby enlist their pecuniary interest in the preservation of the tree, and

improvement of their grants, whether either of the foregoing form the basis
of the ultimate measures of Government, it must be evident that in the
establishment of a well-organized system of administration instead of the
present obviously defective one, permanent good must result.

   " The subject of teak-timber has claimed the attention of several public
journals of late, in consequence of some disclosures made in the proceedings
of the Government dock-yard of Bombay, and all are unanimous in directing
attention to it as a most important commodity, demanding the most stringent
legislation to secure supplies for the future from the British possessions

--equal to the growing demand for it, as a staple, thus noticed by the ' Friend

of India' : ' The amazing durability, we might almost say indestructibility
of teak, renders it not only one of the most valuable, but the most valuable
wood, in a climate like that of India, where the elements of decay are so
numerous and powerful, where dampness brings on rapid corruption, and

the white ant devours without scruple.'

    " The principal trees of Tenasserim are the following, some of them classed
by Dr. Wallich in his notice of the forests of these provinces :

1. Anan.                    6. Kouk Kmoo.
2. Thengan, Hopea odorata.
3. Peengado, Acacia.         7. Padouk, Pterocarpus.
4. Bambwai.                  8. Theet Kha.
5. Pumah, Lagerstrcemia.
                             9. Toung Baing.
                            10. Yin dick, " a bastard Ebony."

   " The foregoing are the most generally knownwoods of the forestsin common

use with the natives, but to them might be added a list of forty or fifty others

more or less useful, which require but a careful examination to reveal some
quality that may render them of serviceable application. Of the remaining

forest trees and shrubs which possess valuable properties, the following are
those most adapted to a demand for European consumption ; but owing to that
absence of commercial enterprise already noticed, are at the present moment
all excluded from the list of exports in Great Britain.

  "Of trees and plants possessing odoriferous properties those forming

articles of trade are as follows :

   " The Tavoy province, from the large number of wood oil-trees found in
its forests, supplies the whole of the provinces with materials made from the

oil, <Src.

valuable acquisition to the exports of these provinces, are,

Gamboge, produce of Tha-nahtan, Garcinia elliptica.

Camphor,      ,,  Blumea.

Balsam tolu.

Cardamoms.

   " The trees producing both Gamboge and Balsam tolu, are unequally
dispersed through the jungles, and are comparatively scarce; the gamboge

predominates, and might afford a considerable quantity of the article, did the
knowledge of its value and the process of collecting it exist with the Karens;
the tree however is felled indiscriminately with the rest of the forest in the
annual clearings for upland paddy, and vegetable plantations, and an article
which forms a prominent item in the rich exports from Siam, is on this side
of the border range utterly neglected and destroyed.

   " The most common weed which springs up after the fires of the new
clearings in the jungle, is that which produces the camphor ; of its abun-

dance it is scarcely necessary to remark, that it is, next to grass, in excess of
all other spontaneous vegetable life, and with proper appliances in the ma-
nufacture of the salt (its property), might be rendered useful as an article of
commerce*."

   The probable effects on the climate of Penang, of the continued destruc-
tion of the hill jungles of that island, are ably stated by J. S. Logan, Esq.,
in the same journal (vol. ii. p. 534 et seq.). " It was remarked that the whole
of the eastern front of the range (in Penang) has within a few years been
denuded of its forest ; the greater part of it is too steep for any permanent
cultivation, and in all probability, after the fecundity of the fresh soil en-
riched by the ashes of the trees has been exiiausted, it will be abandoned by
the Chinese squatters. It was not here alone that I was surprised to see the
rapid progress which squatters and Chinese charcoal-burners have made in
destroying the jungles in the hills during the last two years. In Singapore,
the present zealous Governor (Col. Butterworth) has in an enlightened spirit,
akin to that which has for some time characterized the Government of India
in reference to the same subject, absolutely prohibited the further destruction
of forests on the summits of hills. Representations have often been made to
the local authorities at Penang, urging the necessity of reserving the jungles
on the summits and higher slopes, but hitherto without effect. The reply

ON THE DESTRUCTION OF TROPICAL FORESTS.  91

has been, if the forests are of so much importance as the agriculturists insist,
they must have a certain value to them, and they are at liberty to purchase
any tract they choose. But it is impracticable for the holders of land to
unite in making such a purchase; and were it at all practicable, the majority,
from ignorance and selfishness, would refuse to contribute. But climate con-

cerns the whole community, and its prohibition from injury is one of the duties
of Government. In Germany and France there are especial laws for the
protection and extension of forests*. It is not necessary to cite Humboldt or
Boussingault to prove the great influence in tropical regions of forests, and
especially mountain forests, in attracting and condensing clouds, diminishing
local temperature, and increasing humidity. But if tlie forests had no other
effect than to protect the clay soil of the mountains from the action of the sun's

rays, this ought alone to be sufficient to secure their careful preservation. It
is in this soil that the waters which supply all the streams of the island, and
which percolate downwards to the lower lands, are enclosed. These moun-
tains are, in fact, great natural reservoirs, elevated in mid-air and exposing
the most extended surfaces possible, which are covered to a small depth with
a sponge of porous decomposed rock, for the absorption and retention of
water. In ordinary seasons, when there is a considerable fall of rain, the im-
portance of preventing the contents of these reservoirs from being dissipated

may not be so obvious ; but it may now be considered a well-established fact

that the Eastern Archipelago is subject to periodical droughts, although the
laws of their recurrence are not yet ascei'tained. That such droughts will
again and again happen, and are in fact the settled course of nature, admits
of no question.

    " Nature, when left to herself, provides a compensatory influence in the

dense leafy forests ; but if these are consigned to destruction, every successive
drought will prove more baneful than the preceding. Unless Government
will reserve at least the steeper mountain tracts, which are not adapted for
permanent culture, there is nothing visionary in the apprehension, for it has
been realized in other localities, that in some prolonged droughts, after the
naked sides of the hills have been exposed to the direct heat of the sun, every

stream in the inland will be dried up, and universal aridity ensue. The
great extent to which the mainland of Penang has been shorn of its forests,
would of itself produce an urgent necessity for a stop being at once put to a
war with nature, which must entail severe calamities for the future. In those
mountains in Greece which have been deprived of their forests, the springs
have disappeared. In other parts of the globe the same consequence has
followed. The sultry atmosphere and dreadful droughts of the Cape de
Verd Islands are owing to the destruction of the forests. In large districts
of India, climate and irrigation have rapidly deteriorated from a similar cause,
and the Government having become fully impressed with the necessity of
respecting the stubborn facts of nature, every means have been used to avert
 and remedy the mischief. Forests which had been so easily and thoughtlessly
 cut down have at great cost been restored."

   We extract the following very interesting results of tree plantations, show-

    * They have the sar8e in all the Italian States. So far back as 1475 the subject attracted
 the attention of the famous Venetian Council of X., by which a law was passed on the 7th of
 January of that year, regulating in great detail the clearance of the forests on terra firma.
 The mountain forests especially were protected by judicious regulations, which were renewed
 from time to time down to the very year of the extinction of the old republics. Tuscany and
 the Pontifical governments were equally provident. IdrauUca Ragionata di Menyotti, p. 321

ing that they may be self-supporting, from an article in the Calcutta Review
(No. 23), by Captain R. Baird Smith, Bengal Engineers:

   " The formation of plantations early occupied the attention of the British
Superintendents of the Western Jumna Canal. Something was done by

Captains Blane and Tickell ; but it was left to Colonel Colvin to proceed

systematically in this useful duty. An allowance originally of 2000 rupees,

afterwards increased to 2000 rupees per annum, was allotted to the plan-
tations, and they have been spread over all parts of the canals to which water
could reach. The trees planted are chiefly the Sissu, the Toon, the Kikur,
the Cirrus, the Saul, and the Teak, all furnishing wood of value for cecono-
mical purposes. The revenue derived from the plantations, although not
large, has more than covered all expenditure upon them ; and their ultimate
value will be very considerable. The details of the kind, number and esti-
mated present value of the trees on the 30th April 184-7, are shown below :

" In recommending more general attention to the subject of planting in

India, it is perhaps unnecessary, after detailing the foregoing facts, to dwell

longer on what appears to be tiie absolute necessity of something being done

either by Government or by individuals for the preservation of old forests or

the formation of new ones, whether this be immediately profitable or not,

because so long a time is required to bring timber to perfection, that unless

some means are adopted to provide for the future, so great a dearth of timber

will be experienced as to put a stop to constructions of all kinds, that is to

almost everything required for civilized life, or to force the Government and

natives of India to import timber at any sacrifice, even when there are abun-

dant tracts of unprofitable land, which might have been occupied by valuable

timber, and which would have yielded yearly some returns long before the

trees were fit to cut doM'n. In India, not only would the thinnings and

prunings of forests be required for all the purposes for which these are sold

in Europe, but a constant demand and profitable sale must always give value

to even the smallest fragments of wood in a country where it is the universal

fuel for daily cooking the food of millions, as well as for imparting warmth

in the cold-weather months, and required also for all the chemical arts in

which heat is necessary, some of which, as the preparation of sugar and of

indigo, are performed on the very farms where the plants are grown. The

leaves also of many trees are employed as fodder for elephants, camels, and

in the Himalayas even for goats, sheep, and horned cattle. They are col-

lected also when dry for fuel, and are preferred, I believe, for some fires, aa

those for heating ovens ; but their more legitimate employment, of being al-

MSS.lowed to enrich the soil, becomes neglected." Royle,  cit.

" Another object I would particularly call attention to, is the felling of

timber at the proper season when the sap is at rest. It requires no botanist

to point out when this is to be done ; although the leaves do not fall off in

India, as in more temperate climates, it is impossible to find any difficulty

in deciding, from the appearance of the tree, when the time for felling has

arrived. When the sap is rising, the leaves are generally somewhat soft and

perfect ; when it is at rest, the leaves are harder, and, in India, almost always

corroded by insects. In consequence of the facility of barking a tree when

the sap is rising, oaks are often felled at this season in England, always with

disadvantage to the timber ; and this same facility of barking is too often an

inducement to the renters of forests in India to fell timber at improper

--periods of the year." (Capt. Munro on the Timber Trees of Bengal, in

Asiatic Society of Bengal, No. XI. new series, page 1.)

It is not only in affording indigenous woods of wonderful variety, serving

all the purposes to which timber is applied, that the Indian forests claim our

attentive consideration. In them Nature presents to us other sources of

wealth, which under judicious management may yield a considerable increase

to the present revenue. Gums, drugs, dyes, resins abound, as gutta-percha,

caoutchouc, kino, gamboge, camphor, dammer, piney, varnisli, wood-oil,

with many other products not sufficiently known or appreciated, but which,

as the light of European science penetrates these partially explored regions,

will be applied to many useful purposes in the arts and sciences.

The Isonandra gutta flourished for centuries in its native jungles, exuding

its juice only to be received by the soil, before the discovery Avas made that

gutta-percha was suited for such an infinite number of applications (the pro-

perties of the other species remain to be examined), and the geographical

limits of the Tahan-ivee have yet to be ascertained. To urge the necessity

of exercising careful vigilance in protecting the trees whence so valuable a

product is derived, will perhaps appear unnecessary, but we know that even
their admitted financial value has not been sufficient to protect them from

thoughtless waste, but the contrary, as has been illustrated by various writers

in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago.

   The recent discovery of the source of East Indian Kino by Dr. Royle*,
the researches of Dr. Christison as to the new varieties of gamboge, and the
various investigations of Dr. Pereira, are instances of interesting and im-
portant advances in the medical botany of the Indian forests. The abundance

of Pterocarpus marsupium over the continent of India, producing the kino,
and the occurrence of Garcinia pictoria and elliptica, yielding the gamboge,
both in Coorg and Burmah, lead to the conclusion that much remains to be

done in developing the pharmaceutic resources of these forests.

  We are assured by the Rev. Mr. Mason f, Mr. 0'Riley|, and other ob-

servers, that the gamboge-trees ( Gamwza e/^ijofФca) are dispersed through

the forests of Burmah in such numbers as to afford a considerable quantity

of the exudation, did the knowledge of its value and the process of preparing

it exist with the natives (Kareans). The tree however is felled indiscrimi-
nately with the rest of the forest in the annual clearings which take place,
and the article, which forms a prominent item in the rich exports from
Siam, is on the eastern side of the border range utterly neglected and

destroyed.

   " The districts where the Burmese gamboge is produced are nearly in the
same latitude with Cambodia, where the commercial gamboge of Siam is

known to be collected ; the two localities are even at no great geographical

distance from each other, and hence a strong presumption arises that the

tree of Burmah is the same with the unknown gamboge-tree of SiamД.'
   The Coorg or Wynaad gamboge-tree has an extensive range ; we have

seen it along all the higher parts of the Malabar Ghauts for fully 120 miles
from north to south, and in some parts it is very abundant ; yet the produce
for the most part is made little use of, and the tree is considered of so small

value, that we have seen the supports and scaffolding of bridges, &c. entirely

composed of the stems of Garcinia pictoria, though from the valuable ob-

servations of Dr. Christison, this gamboge may be advantageously applied to

may be obtained in large quantity, it may be introduced equally to European

trade, when once the natives learn how to collect it in a state of purity, and

make it up in homogeneous masses, in imitation of pipe gamboge, the finest

Siam variety.

The names of the trees producing gamboge and kino should be added to

the list of trees protected from indiscriminate destruction, which list, so far

as we know, is at present limited to the Teak, Ebony, Black-wood and Sandal-

wood.

   Many other trees should no doubt be added to this list. In the present

state of our knowledge, however, we shall not venture to refer to any, except

the oil-yielding trees, of which the commercial importance cannot be over-

number (Dr. Cleghorii), finding his colour-box becoming exhausted, was enabled to supply

all his deficiencies, without difficulty, from the natural products of the surrounding forest,

including yellow from Garcinia pictoria, blue from various species of Indigofera, red and

rated, and to which comparatively little attention has yet been paid. In the
limits of a report like the present, we can only indicate in a cursory manner

Wethe names of the more important and best known trees of this class.

may especially allude to the different species of Bassia, Stillingia sebifera

(tallow-tree of China), Valeria Indica, which, from the high melting-point
of their oils or fats, have a peculiar importance from their use in the manu-
facture of candles, and from their being capable of replacing animal fats for

other purposes. Of those trees which yield fluid oils, Calophyllum inophyl-
lum, Aleurites triloba, and Pongamia glabra, may be particularly mentioned
(though various others possessed of equally valuable properties would pro-
bably be discovered by a more careful examination of those forests). The
demand for oils in European commerce has been steadily on the increase
for some years past, and the quantities consumed are now so large that these

and the other oleaginous products of tropical climates must sooner or later
acquire considerable commercial importance, and render the preservation of
the plants which yield them deserving the attention of Government, not so

much from their present importance, as from the value which they are likely

soon to acquire.

  We have alluded to gutta-percha ; its brief but remarkable history was

lately detailed in an overland journal. The history oi gutta-percha ox gutta-
taban, is brief but not uneventful. Previously to 184'4 the very name of
gutta-percha was unknown to European commerce. In that year two cwts.
of it were shipped experimentally from Singapore. The exportation of

gutta-percha from that port rose in IS^S to 169 piculs (the picul is 133^lbs.),
in 1846 to ISS^, in 184.7 to 9296, in the first seven months of 1848 to 6768
piculs. In the first four and a half years of the trade 21,598 piculs of gutta-
percha, valued at 274,190 dollars, were shipped at Singapore, tiie whole of
which was sent to England, with the exception of 15 piculs to Mauritius, 470
to the Continent of Europe, and 922 to the United States.

   But this rapid growth of the new trade conveys only a faint idea of the
commotion it created among the native inhabitants of the Indian Archi-
pelago. The jungles of Johore were the scene of the earliest gatherings, and
they were soon ransacked in every direction by parties of Malays and Chi-
nese, while the indigenous population gave themselves up to the search with
unanimity and zeal. The Tamungong, with the usual policy of Oriental

governors, declared the precious gum a government monopoly. He appro-

priated the greater part of the profits, and still left the Malays enough to
stimulate them to pursue the quest, and to gain from 100 to 400 per cent,
for themselves on what they procured from the aborigines. The Tamun-
gong, not satisfied with buying at his own price all that was collected by
private enterprise, sent out numerous parties of from 10 to 100 persons, and

employed whole tribes of hereditary serfs in the quest of gutta-percha.
    This organized body of guni-hunters spread itself like a cloud of locusts

over the whole of Johore. peninsular and insular. They crossed the frontier
into Linga, but there the Sultan was not long in discovering the new value
that had been conferred upon his jungles. He confiscated the greater part
of what had been collected by the interlopers, and in emulation of the
Tamungong, declared giitta-jiercha or giitta-taban a royalty. The knowledge
of the article, stirring the avidity of gatherers, gradually spread from Singa-
pore noi'thward as far as Penang, southward along the east coast of Sumatra,
to Java, eastward to Borneo, where it was found at Brune, Sarawak and
Potianak on the west coast, at Keti and Passir on the east. The imports of
gutta-percha into Singapore from the 1st of January to the 12th of July
1848, according to their geographical distribution, were from the Malay

peninsula 598 piculs, from the Johore Archipelago 1269, from Sumatra 1066,
from Batavia 19, from Borneo 55. The price at Singapore was originally
8 dollars per picul ; it rose to 24, and fell about the middle of 1848 to 13,
In the course of 3^ years 270,000 taban-trees were felled in order to get at
the gum, and nothing has been done to replace them. Express.

  We cannot help adverting in this place to the superb series of Indian tim-

bers in the Exhibition, and also the very extensive collections of woods in the
East India House ; the former contain large contributions from the Northern

Circars, Coimbatore, Assam, Arrackan and Malabar. The East Indian Mu-

seum contains a collection of 1 17 specimens sent by Dr. Roxburgh, 100 from
Java by Dr. Horsfield, and 456 from Dr. Wallich, who gave the duplicates
of his collection to the Society of Arts, of which they published a list in
their Transactions, vol. xlviii. p. 439, and for which they awarded the gold
Isis medal. These sufficiently illustrate the great variety and great import-
ance of the timber-trees of India, of which the following are the kinds chiefly

used. Much useful information will be found in Holtzappfel's Descriptive
Catalogue of Woods used in Turnery, to which notes have been added by

Dr. Royle*.

    The general conclusions which appear to the Committee to be warranted,

--by the various statements of fact and opinion as given in their Report, are

summed up as follows :
    1. That over large portions of the Indian Empire, there is at present an

almost uncontrolled destruction of the indigenous forests in progress, from
the careless habits of the native population.

    2. That in Malabar, Tenasserim, and Sciude, where supervision is exer-
cised, considerable improvement has already taken place.

    3. That these improvements may be extended by a rigid enforcement of

the present regulations and the enactment of additional provisions of the fol-
lowing character ; viz. careful maintenance of the forests by the plantation
of seedlings in place of mature trees removed, nurseries being established

--in the immediate neighbourhood, prohibition of cutting until trees are well-

grown with rare and special exceptions for peculiar purposes. In cases of
trees yielding gums, resins, or other valuable products, that greater care be
taken in tapping or notching the trees, most serious damage at present
resulting from neglect in this operation.

    4. That especial attention should be given to the preservation and main-
tenance of the forests occupying tracts unsuited for culture, whether by reason
of altitude or peculiarities of physical structure.

    5. That in a country to which the maintenance of its water supplies is of
such extreme importance, the indiscriminate clearance of forests around the
localities whence those supplies are derived is greatly to be deprecated.

   6. That as much local ignorance prevails as to the number and nature of

valuable forest products, measures should be taken to supply, through the
officers in charge, information calculated to diminish such ignorance.

   7. That as much information which may be of practical utility is contained
in the Manuscript Reports and Proceedings of the late " Plantation Com-
mittee," it is desirable that the same should, if practicable, be abstracted and

given to the public.

   To show the sources whence the information has been derived, the Com-

mittee annex the following statement of authorities :

                                     APPENDIX.

   In 184-7 the Court of Directors sent a despatch to the Supreme Govern-
ment, requesting the attention of the authorities to the effect of trees on the

climate and productiveness of a country or district. On receiving this com-

munication, the Madras Government directed a circular to their revenue
officers requesting them to forward any of the required information in their
power, and several valuable reports were accordingly received in reply, some

--of which we annex as follows :
    General Cullen, Resident of Travancore : " There cannot perhaps be a
more beautiful illustration of the effect of mountain chains in arresting and
condensing the vapour, than the generally luxuriant forests which clothe the
eastern as well as the western ghauts, but which cease almost immediately on
quitting those chains. The forests on the east coast, as might be expected,
are less lofty and luxuriant than those in Malabar, not only from the fall of
rain on tiie east coast being only half that of Malabar, but also because
they are in general double the distance from the sea, the chief source of all
 vapour.

    " There can of course be little question as to the effect forests must have
 during a great part of the year, in preventing the dissipation of the super-
ficial moisture, but I should doubt if that circumstance can have much in-
fluence on the supply of water from springs. The effect of the sun's rays
on the earth, even when fully exposed to them, is sensible to but a very
inconsiderable depth from the surlace, and not at all so far as the subsidence
of the water forming springs. The copiousness of springs must be influenced
so much by a variety of other causes as to render the effect of forests hardly
 appreciable. The vicinity to elevated table-lauds and mountains and hills,
 the nature of the rocks, and inclination of the strata, the general slope of
 the country, the absorbent qualities of the soil, &c., must all have the
 most important influence. At Trevandruin, even on eminences, the wells at
 a depth of forty feet from the surface rise occasionally several feet with a
 fall of rain of only the same number of inches, and within two or three days
 after heavy falls.

     " In the forests of this coast, and above the ghauts in the western parts of

 Mysore, Wynaad and Coorg, the trees are, I believe, everywhere nearly

 destitute of leaves during the early part of the year, the driest and the hottest
 season ; so that even in forest tracts the earth is at that period exposed to
 nearly the full force of the sun's rays.

    " The long grass and low jungle are also generally burnt down in these
 months, and the general heat and dryness in passing through such tracts are
 frequently intolerable. The almost entire absence of moisture and springs
 in forest tracts in the dry season is well known.

    " The district of Ernaad in Malabar, formerly so celebrated for its teak
 forests, and still, I believe, with nmch forest of other kinds, is, I believe, for
 the most part a plain and nearly level, but in the hot season is like the other
 tracts I have noticed, equally destitute of vegetation and moisture, and I
 speak of these facts from having, although many years ago, passed over all

--the tracts in question."
     Surgeon C. J. Smith, Bangalore : " In the Mulnaad and Coorg the quan-
 tity of rain that falls is very great ; and to what can we attribute this, but
 to the influence of the ghauts and hilly country inland, covered with dense
jungles, which attract and retain the largest portion of the south-west mon-
 soon ? Bellary, Seringapatam, and Octacamund are nearly in the same pa-
 rallel of longitude, but at different distances from the line of ghauts, and to
ON THE DESTRUCTION OF TROPICAL, FORESTS.                                                                         101

this circumstance we may attribute the difference in the falls of rain at these

stations."

   Assistant-surgeon Balfour, in his notes on this subject, has well remarked,
' that the observations of scientific men support the belief that a mutual re-

action goes on between these two physical agents, and that the presence of
trees greatly adds to the supply of water and feeds the running streams.'
The instance of a single district losing its supply of water on being cleared
of forest, and regaining it again when restored to its original state, would not
alone establish more than strong presumption that the clearing of the forest
and the loss of rain followed each other as cause and effect ; but the Ho-
nourable Court of Directors, in their circular, mention that this is not

uncommon in America.
   On the subject of springs, Assistant-surgeon Balfour quotes from Jameson's

Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, a very remarkable instance at Popayan in

Peru, of a district losing its supply of water from the clearance of the forest :

" Two instances corroborative of the above have come under my own obser-

vation, and happened to friends in different parts of the country engaged in

coffee-planting. The first happened in a range of hills south-east of Ban-

galore, at a coffee plantation now called Glenmore, in ihe Debenaicottah

talook of the Salem district. The proprietor, when preparing ground for a

coffee garden which was watered by an excellent spring, was warned by the

natives not to clear away the trees in the immediate neighbourhood of his

spring ; he disregarded their warning, cut down the trees, and lost his stream

of water. The other instance happened at the village of Hoolhully, about
Meight miles distant from the head of the new ghaut in
                                                        ungerabad                                                1 wrote
                                                                                                              ;
--to the gentleman to whom it occurred, who answered as follows : ' The

cutting down trees and clearing jungle on the sides of ravines in the close

vicinity of springs, undoubtedly has a great effect in diminishing the quan-

tity of water. I found it so in one or two instances in ravines I had cleared

for planting ; at one place where I had a nursery, which I used to water by
turning a water-course from the spring, I found that since I cleared up the
sides of the ravine in which the spring is (for planting), I have not anything

like the quantity of Avater I had before the shade was cleared. I presume

this is to be accounted for by the increased action of the air and sun ; at any

rate the natives about here are of that opinion. I leave the cause, however,

to be settled by more scientific men than myself; that the effect is so, there

Ais no doubt.  ravine close to the bungalo where there is a spring, a few

years ago I cleared for planting, and found the water decrease in like manner

but the coffee-trees dying away, and the place being too small for a plan-
tation, I did not renew them, but allowed the jungle to grow up again, since

which the stream has nearly regained its former size.'
   The superintendent of Nuggur writes, " that springs of water shaded by

trees, almost invariably dry up on the trees being cleared away. This has
been observed on the Neilgherry Hills and many other woody districts." In
what way trees influence springs it is impossible to say ; that they do so
seems to be established, as also that they condense and attract vapoui*.

    " This effect of trees in mitigating the intensity of tropical heat, has also

been alluded to by the present superintendent of forests in our western pre-
sidency, who mentions that in the southern districts of Guzerat the vicinity

of the sea and the proximity of the mountain tracts covered with jungle, tend
to render the climate more mild, and the temperature throughout the year
more equable than is the case in the other parts of the province. Further in-

land, and in the immediate vicinity of the hills, the heat is greatei', and in both

situations the humid and loaded atmosphere in the S.W. monsoon is often pain-

fully felt, particularly at night. In tiie whole of this district rain falls in greater

quantities than to the northward ; in the jungle districts to the east, the
supply of rain is said never to fail in the driest of seasons, and it often falls

there when none is apparent in the more open districts.

    " It is in such tracts as these that rivers rise, for from the number, height,

and comparative proximity of the hills to the southward of the Taptee, we

might, a priori, suppose that the supply of water in that district would be

abundant : and such is actually the case, as we find in a breadth of fifty miles

eight rivers, all containing water throughout the year. Reasoning from these

facts, we may also predicate the sort of country in which tiiese rivers have

their origin, viz. underlying hilly tracts abounding in rich soil, highly retentive

of moisture, and rendered still more so by luxuriant jungle." ^Surgeon Gibson

in Tr. Bomb. Med. and Phys. Soc. Journ., pp. 37, 4-1.

 --Report from Dr. Gibson, dated 9th March 1846 "In the collectorate

comprising the South Conkan, under Bombay, since this tract has been

denuded of forest, as it now has been to a great extent fi'om the pressure of

population, all the inhabitants concur in asserting that the springs have left

the uplands, that the climate has become greatly drier, the seasons more un-

certain, and the land less fertile. I believe that this can be confirmed by

the testimony of the late collector Mr. Elphinstone, but indeed it is most

apparent to a person travelling along that line of country, as I have just now

been doing, mainly with the intention of remarking changes which have

taken place in the interval of fifteen years, which period of time has elapsed

since I visited that line of country before; I have also understood that

Aeffects of a similar kind have been experienced at the Neilgherry Hills.

change of climate, similar to that now under contemplation, is by no means

limited in extent to the mere district in which the clearing has taken place,

but its influence extends far inland. Take for example all the southern and

western portion of the Dharwar Zillah. This fertile country abounds in

moisture, insomuch that it has been (though rather inaptly, I think) com-

pared to the valley of the Mississippi ; at all events American upland cotton
grows there, which it will hardly do in other parts of the Bombay presidency.

I think it is not too much to say, that much of this moisture depends on the

wooded country forming its western border, and that with the complete re-

Mymoval of this, the climate would greatly change.       own opinion is, that

in the Bombay presidency some cause of this kind has had a great share in

producing that irregularity of the rainy season which has of late years been

so much complained of, as to diminished fertility of the soil from the removal

of belts of wooded country ; the rationale of this is most evident."

On the lieproduction and supposed Existence of Sexual Organs in the

   Higher Cryptogamaus Plants. By Arthur Henfrey, F.L.B.

Having been prevented by the pressure of other engagements from comply-

ing with the request which the Association did me the liono^ir to make last

yeai-, that I should assist Prof. Lindley and Dr. Lankester in preparing a

Export on Vegetable Physiology, I venture to present a fragmentary contri-

mybution on ti-.e subject, relating to a branch of the science to which  atten-

tion has been recently strongly attracted, in the pursuit of my own investiga-

tions. I was the more induced to devote the short time at my disposal to
ON THE HIGHER CRYPTOGAMOUS PLANTS.  103

drawing up a summary of the state of knowledge of the repi-odaction of the
higher flowerless plants, by the importance of the discoveries which have re-
cently been made in this department, tending completely to change the general
views which have hitherto been entertained by most botanists as to the extent
to which sexuality exists in the vegetable kingdom, and in connexion with

other new facts relating to the Thallopbytes, to indicate that the existence

of two sexes is universal.
    Under the name of the higher Flowerless Plants, I include all those classes

which are distinguished on the one hand from the Thallophytes or Cellular
plants by the presence of a distinct stem bearing leaves, and on the other
from the Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons by the absence of the organs con-
stituting a true flower ; they are, the Hepaticae, Musci, Equisetaceae, Filices,
Lycopodiaceae, Isoetacese, and Marsileaceae or Rhizocarpese.

   On no subject has more discussion been maintained than on the existence

of sexes among the Cryptogamous families. The discovery of the two kinds
of organs, the antheridia and jiistillidia, in the Mosses and Hepaticae, and of
the peculiar organs containing analogous spiral filaments in the Characeee, were
for a long time the chief facts brought forward by those who supported the
sexual hypothesis ; and in the endeavour to carry out the view into the other
tribes, a similar nature to that of the antheridia was attributed to most varied
structures in the Ferns and other plants. These attempts to find distinct
sexual organs were in some instances pursued with so little judgement, that
the opinion had of late years fallen in some degree into discredit, and two
circumstances contributed still further to strengthen the doubts which were
entertained. The first was the exact analogy, pointed out by Prof, von
Mohl, between the mode of development of the spores of the Cryptogamia
and the pollen-grains of the flowering plants, which interfered very import-
antly to prevent any comparison between the sporangia and ovaries, and
apparently determined the analogy of the former to be with anthers. The
second was the discovery by Prof. Nageli, of organs producing spiral fila-
ments, therefore analogous to the antheridia of the Mosses, on the germ
frond, Qv pro-emhyo developed from the spores of the Ferns.

   At the same time, the facts observed in Pilularia were altogether equivo-
cal. Mr. Valentine* traced the development of the larger spores, exhibiting
in germination an evident analogy to ovules, from cells closely resembling
the parent-cells of pollen and spores ; while Prof. Schleiden stated that he
had observed a fertilization of these supposed ovules by the smaller spores
resembling pollen-grains, and thus seemed to remove the ground for attri-

buting a fertilizing influence to the spiral filaments contained in the so-called

antheridia of the Cryptogams.
   In this state the question remained until 1848, when Count Suminski |-

published his observations on the germination of Ferns, showing that the
researches of Nageli had been imperfect, and that two kinds of organs are
produced upon the pro-embryo of the Ferns, one kind analogous to the
antheridia, and the other to the pistillidia of Mosses ; from the latter of
which the true Fern stem is produced, like the seta and capsule from the
same organ in the Mosses ; further stating that he had actually observed a

process of fertilization. Soon after this M. G. Thuretij; discovered anthe-

ridia like those of the Ferns in the Equisetaceae ; Niigeii Д had previously

published, in opposition to Schleiden's observations, an account of the pro-
duction of spiral filaments from the small spores of Pilularia, and finally

M. Mettenius* discovered them in the small spores o{ Iso'ctes. Thus they

were shown to exist in all the families above enumerated, with tlie exception
of the Lycopodiaceae, in which they have recently been stated to exist by

M. Hofmeisterf . Before entering into a detailed account of their discoveries,
it may be mentioned, that, besides their well-known occurrence in the Cha-

racese, which most authors consider as Thallophytes, antheridia are stated by
Niigeli to exist on the Florideaj, among the Algae ; and peculiar bodies to
which the same nature has been attributed, were recently discovered by M.
Itzigsohn in the Lichens; a discovery confirmed by Messrs, Tulasne, who
 state that analogous bodies exist in many Fungi. Our knowledge of these
 latter points is, however, far less definite than that concerning the higher
 tribes, and I shall not include them in the following summary.

    One of the most remarkable circumstances concerning the antheridia of
 the leaf-bearing Cryptogams, is the very varied nature of the time and place

 of their development ; so great indeed is this, that it is only their essential
 structure, and the production of the moving spiral filaments in particular,

 which warrants the assumption of their identity of function in the different

 families. In order to make these variations clearly comprehensible, it will

 be necessary to describe the characters exhibited in the germination of the
 spores in each tribe, as it is only by this means that the important peculia-
 rities of each case can be made evident. It will be most convenient to give
 a separate sketch of all that is known of the process of reproduction in each
 family, taking these separately and in succession; after this we shall be in a
 position to compare them together, and trace out their differences and ana-

 logies ; the advantage of recalling all the essential facts to memory will, I
 trust, serve as an apology for the introduction of much that is already fami-

--liar to most botanists.
     Mosses. 'i'he antheridia of the Mosses occur in the axils of the leaves

 or collected into a head, enclosed by numerous variously modified leaves,
 at the summit of the stem. Tliey are produced either on the same heads as
 the pistillidia, or in distinct heads on the same individuals, such Mossesbeing

  called monoecious ; or tlie heads are found only on distinct individuals, such
  Mosses being termed dioecious. 'J"he structure of the anthcridium is ex-
  ceedingly simple; it consists of an elongate, cylindrical or club-shaped sac, the
  walls of which are composed of a single layer of cells, united to form a de-
 licate membrane. Within this sac are developed vast numbers of minute

  cellules, completely filling it, and, the sac bursting at its apex at a certain

 period, these vesicles are extruded. When the nearly perfect sacs are

  placed in water, the vesicles within appear to absorb water, and swell so as

  to burst the sac of the antheridium, and often adhering together, they col-
  lectively appear to form masses larger thnn the cavity from which they have

  emerged. Through the transparent walls may be seen a delicate filament

  with a thickened extremity, coiled up in the interior of each vesicle. Often
  before the extrusion, but always shortly after, a movement of this filament

  is to be observed when the object is viewed in water under the microscope.

  The filament is seen to be wheeling round and round rapidly within the
  cellule, the motion being rendered very evident by the distinctness of the

  thickened extremity of the filament, which appears to be coursing round the

  walls of the cellule in a circle. According to Unger, this filament breaks

out of its parent cellule in Sphagnum, and then appears as a spiral filament

moving freely in water, in fact, as one of the so-called spermatozoa.

   The pistillidia of the Mosses are the rudiments of the fruit or capsules.
When young, they appear as flask-shaped bodies with long necks, composed

of a simple cellular membrane. The long neck presents an open canal like

a style, leading to the enlarged cavity below, at the base of which, according

to Mr. Valentine*, is found a single cell projecting free into the open space.

This single cell is the germ of the future capsule; at a certain period it be-

comes divided into two by a horizontal partition, the upper one of these two

again divides, and so on until the single cell is developed into a cellular fila-

ment, the young seta ; tlie upper cells are subsequently developed into the

urn and its appendages, and as this rises, it carries away with it, as the

calyptra, the original membrane of the pistillidium, which separates by a cir-

cumscissile fissure from the lower part, the future vaginula. These obser-

vations of Valentine are not exactly borne out by those of Schimper")" in

some of the detail points. According to this author, the lower part of the

pistillidium (the germen of Dr. Brown) begins to swell at a certain time,

when a capsule is to be produced, becoming filled with a quantity of what
he terms " green granulations." As soon as the thickness has become about

that of the future seta, the cell-development in the horizontal direction ceases,

and its activity is directed chiefly to the upper part, which begins to elon-

gate rapidly in the direction of the main axis. This elongation causes a

sudden tearing off at the base, or a little above it, of the cell-membrane

enveloping the young fruit, and the upper part is carried onwards as the

calyptra                                      the  lower  part,  when  any  is left,  remains  as  a  little tubular  process
                                           ;

surrounding the seta. While the young fruit is being raised up by the

growth of the seta, the portion of the receptacle upon which the pistillidium

is borne, becomes developed into a kind of collar, and at length into a sheath

(the vaginula) surrounding the base of the seta which is articulated into it

there.

M. HofmeisterJ, again, describes the details much in the same way as

HeMr. Valentine.                                          states that there exists at the point where the ' style '

and ' germen ' of the pistillidium join, a cell, developed before the canal of

the style has become opened. In those pistillidia which produce capsules

this cell begins at a certain period to exhibit very active increase ; it becomes
rapidly divided and subdivided by alternately directed oblique partitions into
a somewhat spindle-shaped, body formed of a row of large cells. Mean-

while the cells at the base of the germen are also rapidly multiplied, and the
lower part of the pistillidium is greatly increased in size. The spindle-
shaped body continues to increase in length by the subdivision of its upper-
most cell by oblique transverse walls, and the opposition which is offered by
the upper concave surface of the cavity of the germen, causes the lower

conical extremity of the spindle-shaped body to penetrate into the mass of

cellular tissue at the base of the germen, a process which resembles the
penetration of the embryo into the endosperm in the embryo-sac of certain

flowering plants. The base of the spindle-shaped body, which is in fact the

rudiment of the fruit, at length reaches the base of the pistillidium, and
penetrates even some distance into the tissue of the stem upon which this is
seated. The growth of the upper part going on unceasingly, the walls of the
germen are torn by a circular fissure and the upper half is carried upwards,

bearing the calyptra, the lower part forms the vaginule. The upper cell of

the spindle-shaped body then becomes developed into the capsule, and the

calyptra often becoming organically connected with this, as the base of the

seta does with the end of the stem, it in such cases undergoes further deve-

lopment during the time it is being carried upwards by the growing fruit.

The view now entertained by Schimper, Hofmeister, and others of the

reproduction of the Mosses is, that the antheridia are truly male organs, and

that they exert, by means of the spiral filaments, a fertilizing influence upon the

pistillidia, it being assumed tliat those bodies, or the fluid wliich they are

bathed in, penetrate down the canal of the style or neck-like portion of tlie

l^istillidium to reach the minute cell, the supi)0sed embryonal cell, situated

in the globular portion or ' germen ' of the pistillidium, and thus render it

capable of becoming developed into a perfect fruit.

   No such process of fertilization has actually been observed in the Mosses,

and therefore all the evidence is at present merely circumstantial ; but this is
very strong. In the first place it is stated as an undoubted fact by Schimpev

and Bruch, that in the dioecious Mosses, those on which the antheridia and

pistillidia occur in separate plants, fruit is never produced on the so-called

male plants, and never on the so-called female unless the males occur in the

vicinity                                  several examples are cited in the work of Schimper above referred
                                       ;

to ; when the sexes occur alone, the increase of the plant is wholly dependent

on the propagation by gemmae or innovations.

By the discovery of the antheridia and pistillidia in the other higher Cry-

ptogams, the arguments from analogy greatly strengthen the hypothesis of

the sexuality of Mosses.

Further observation is required, then, for the direct proof of the occur-

rence of a process of fertilization in the Mosses ; but the facts now before us
all tend to prove their sexuality if we argue from analogy, and the probabi-

lities deduced from the negative evidence above referred to in regard to the

dioecious species.

It is unnecessary to give any account of the well-known structure of the

Moss capsules                                                                yet in order to render the comparison with the phsenomena
                                                                          ;

of the life of Mosses with those of tlie other leafy Cryptogams complete, it

may be worth while to allude to the germination of the spores. The spore

is a single cell, with a double coat, like a pollen-grain ; tliis germinates by

the protrusion of the inner coat in the form of a filamentous or rather tubu-

lar process, which grows out and becomes subdivided by septa so as to form

a confervoid filament. The lateral branches bud out from some of the

cells, some elongating into secondary filaments, others at once undergoing

a more active development, and by the multiplication of their cells, assuming
the condition of conical cellular masses, upon which the forms of Moss leaves

may soon be detected ; these cellular masses becoming buds from which the

regular leafy stems arise.

 --Hepatlcce. The genera comprehended in this family present a wonderful

variety of structure in the reproductive organs, but in almost ail of them

the existence of the two kinds of organs called pistillidia and antheridia have

long been demonstrated, and in most cases the development of the sporangia

from the so-called pistillidia has been traced. In those genera in which the

plants most resemble the Mosses in the vegetative portion, as in Jungerman-

nice, the pistillidia are very like those of the Mosses ; this is also the case
in Marchantia ; but in Pel/ia, Anlhoceros and other genera, the rudiment of
the sporangium bears a striking resemblance to the so-called ovules of the
Ferns, Rhizocarpeae, Sfc, pcguyrjog upon the expanded fronds very much in

the same way as those bodies do upon the pro-embryos of the said families.
It would occupy too much space to enter into a minute detail of tlie various
conditions that are met with. It is sufficient to say that in all cases the

physiological stages are analogous to those of the Mosses ; since the pistil-
lidia produced upon the fronds or leaf-bearing stems developed directly from
the spores, go on to produce a sporangium alone, in which the new spores
are developed, without the intervention of the stage of existence presented
by the pro-embryo of the Ferns and Equisetacas, where the pistillidia and
anlheridia occur upon a temporary frond, and the former give origin to the
regular stem and leaves of the plant.

  --Ferns. This class formed for a long time the great stumbling-block to

those who sought to demonstrate the existence of sexuality in the Crypto-
gamous plants. The young capsules were generally considered to be the
analogues of the pistillidia of the Mosses, and the young abortive capsules
which frequently occur among the fertile ones were supposed by some
authors to represent the antheridia. Mr. Griffith*, sliorlly before his death,
noticed a structure which he was inclined to regard as the analogue of the
antheridium in certain of the ramenta upon the petioles.

    In the year 1844, Prof. Nagelif published an account of his observations
on the germination of certain Ferns, and announced the discovery of moving
spiral filaments closely resembling those of the Charag, on certain cellular
structures developed upon the pro-embryo or cellular body first produced by
the spore. It is not worth while to enter into an analysis of his observations,
as they have since been clearly shown to have been very imperiect ; it is

sufficient to state that he only described one kind of organ, and from his de-
scription it is evident that he confounded the two kinds since discovered, re-
garding them as different stages of one structure. The announcement of this
discovery seemed to destroy all grounds for the assumption of distinct sexes,
not only in the Ferns but -in the other Cryptogams, since it was argued that
tl)e existence of these cellular organs, producing moving spiral filaments, the
so-called spermatozoa, upon the germinating fronds, proved that they were
not to be regarded as in any way connected with the reproductive processes.

    But an essay published by the Count SuminskiJ in 1848 totally changed
the face of the question, and opened a wide field for speculation and investi-
gation on this subject, just as it was beginning to fall into disfavour. Count
Suminski's paper gives a minute history of the course of development of the
Ferns from the germination of the spore to the production of the regular
fronds, and he found this development to exhibit phaenomena as curious as
they were unexpected. The cellular organs seen by Nageli were shown to
be of two perfectly distinct kinds, and moreover to present characters which
gave great plausibility to the hypothesis that they represented reproductive
organs ; moreover, this author expressly stated that he had obtained abso-
lute proof of sexuality by observing an actual process of fertilization to take
place in the so-called ovules, through the agency of the spiral filaments or
spermatozoa.

   The main points of his paper may be briefly summed up as follows. The

Fern spore at first produces a filamentous process, in the end of which cell-
development goes on until it is converted into a Marchantia-like frond of
stmall size and exceedingly delicate texture, possessing hair-like radicle hairs

on its under side. On this under side become developed, in variable num-

bers, certain cellular organs of two distinct kinds. The first, which he terms
antheridia, are the more numerous, and consist of somewhat globular cells,
seated on and arising from single cells of the cellular Marchantia-like frond.
The globular cell produces in its interior a number of minute vesicles, in
each of which is developed a spiral filament, coiled up in the interior. At
a certain epoch the globular cell bursts and discharges the vesicles, and the
spiral filaments moving within the vesicles at length make tlieir way out of
them and swim about in the water, displaying a spiral or heliacal form, and

consisting of a delicate filament with a thickened clavate extremity ; this, the
so-called head, being said by Count Suminski to be a hollow vesicle, and to
be furnished with six or eight cilia, by means of which the apparently volun-

tary movement of the filament is supposed to be effected.
   The second kind of organ, the so-called ' ovules,' are fewer in number and

present different characters in different stages. At first they appear as little
round cavities in the cellular tissue of the pro-embryo, lying near its centre
and opening on the under side. In the bottom of the cavity is seen a little
globular cell, the so-called embryo-sac. It is stated by Count Suminski
that while the ovule is in this state one or more of tlie spiral filaments make
their way into the cavity, coming in contact with the central globular cell.
The four cells bounding the mouth of the orifice grow out from the general
surface into a blunt cone-like process, formed of four parallel cells arranged
in a squarish form and leaving an intercellular canal leading down to the
cavity below. These four cells become divided by cross septa, and grow
out until the so-called ovule exhibits externally a cylindrical form, composed
of four tiers of cells, the uppermost of which gradually converge and close
up the orifice of the canal leading down between them- Meanwhile the
vesicular head of one of the spiral filaments has penetrated into the globular
cellule or embryo-sac, enlarged in size and undergone multiplication, and in
the course of time displays itself as the embryo, producing the first frond
and the terminal bud whence the regular Fern stem is developed. In con-
sidering the import of these phaenomena, the author assumes the analogy
here to be with the process of fertilization in flowering plants, as described by
Schleiden, regarding the production of the embryo from the vesicular head
of the spermatozoa as representing the production of the phanerogamous
embryo from the end of the pollen tube after it has penetrated into the
embryo-sac.

   The promulgation of these statements naturally attracted great attention,
and since they appeared we have received several contributions to the history
of these remarkable structures, some confirmatory, to a certain degree, of
Suminski's views, others altogether opposed to them.

   In the early part of 1849 Dr. Wigand* published a series of researches
on this subject, in which he subjected the assertions of Suminski to a strict
practical criticism ; the conclusions he arrived at were altogether opposed to
that author's views respecting the supposed formation of the organs, and he

never observed the entrance of the spiral filaments into the cavity of the so-

called ovule.

   About the same time M. Thuret-j- published an account of some observa-

tions on the antheridia of Ferns. In these he merely confirmed and corrected
the statements of Nageli respecting the antheridia, and did not notice the

so-called ovules.

   Towards the close of the same year, Hofmeister| confirmed part of

Suminski's statements and opposed others. He stated that he had observed

distinctly the production of the young plant (or rather the terminal bud for

the new axis), in the interior of the so-called ' ovule,' but believed the sup-

Heposed origin of it from tlie end of the spiral filament to be a delusion.

regards the globular cell at the base of the canal of the ' ovule ' as itself the

rudiment of the stem, or embryonal vesicle (the embryo originating from a

free cell produced in this), analogous to that produced in the pistillidia of the

HeMosses.   also describes the development of the ovule differently, saying

that the canal and orifice are opened only at a late period by the separation of

the contiguous walls of ihe four rows of cells.

   About the same time appeared an elaborate paper on the same subject by

Dr. Hermann Schacht*, whose results were almost identical. He found the

young terminal bud to be developed in the cavity of one of the so-called

' ovules,' which were developed exactly in the same way as the pistillidia of

the Mosses. He stated also that the cavity of the ' ovule ' is not open at

first, and he declares against the probability of the entrance of a spiral fila-

ment into it, never having observed this, much less a conversion of one into

an embryo.

In the essay of Dr. Mettenius already referred tof, an account of the de-

velopment of the so-called ovules is given. His observations did not decide

whether the canal of the ' ovule,' whicl! he regards as an intercellular space,

exists at first, or only subsequently, when it is entirely closed above. Some

important points occur in reference to the contents of the canal.

   The contents of the canal in a mature condition consist of a continuous
mass of homogeneous, tough substance, in which fine granules, and here and
there large corpuscles, are imbedded. It reaches down to the globular cell
or ' embryo-sac,' and is in contact with this. This mass either fills the canal
or diminishes in diameter from the blind end of the canal down to the 'embryo-

sac ;' in other cases it possesses the form represented by Suminski, having a
clavate enlargement at the blind end of the canal, and passing into a twisted

filament below. In this latter shape it may frequently be pressed out of isolated
* ovules ' under the microscope, and then a thin transparent membrane-like
layer was several times observed on its surface. In other cases the contents
consisted of nucleated vesicles, which emerged separately or connected

together.

   The embryo-sac consists of a globular cell containing a nucleus, and this
author believes that the commencement of the development of the embryo

consists in the division of this into two, which go on dividing to produce the
cellular structure of the first frond.

    With regard to the contents of the canal the author says,
   " Although I can give no information on many points, > as in regard to the
origin of the contents of the canal of the 'ovule,' yet ray observations on the

development of the ' ovule ' do not allow me to consider them, with Suminski,

as spiral filaments in course of solution just as little have I been able to
                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

convince myself of the existence of the process of impregnation described by
that author. It rather appears to me that the possil)ility of the entrance of
the spiral filaments and the impregnation cannot exist until the tearing open
of the blind end of the canal in the perfectly-formed ovule, as after the open-
ing of the so-called 'canal of the style' in the pistillidia in the Mosses."

   Another contribution has been furnished by Dr. Mercklin J, the original of

which I have not seen, but depend on analyses of it pubHshed in the ' Bota-

nische Zeitung*,' and the 'Flora' for 1851 1> and further in a letter from
Dr. Mercklin to M. Schaclu*|;, which appeared in the ' Linnaea ' at the close

of last year.

He differs in a few subordinate particulars from M. Schacht in reference

to the development and structure of the ^^rothallium or pro-embryo, and of

the antheridia  and  spiral filaments                                                                  but these do not require especial men-
                                                                                                    ;

tion, except in reference to the vesicular end of the spiral filament described

by Schacht, which Mercklin regards as a remnant of tlie parent vesicle, from

which the filament had not become quite freed. The observations referring

to the so-called ovule and the supposed process of impregnation are very im-

portant ; they are as follows :

   " 1. The spiral filaments swarm round the * ovule ' in numbers, frequently
returning to one and the sajne organ.

   " 2. They can penetrate into the ' ovule.' This was seen only three times
in the course of a whole year, and under different circumstances ; twice a
spiral filament was seen to enter a still widely open young ' ovule,' then
come to a state of rest, and after some time assume the appearance of a
shapeless mass of mucilage ; t1ie third case of penetration occurred in a fully-
developed ' ovule,' through its canal ; it therefore does not seem to afford

evidence of the import of the spiral filament, but certainly of the possibility

of the penetration.
    " 3, In the tubular portion of the ' ovule,' almost in every case, peculiar

club-shaped, granular mucilaginous filaments occur at a definite epoch,
these filaments, like the spiral filaments, acquiring a brown colour with
iodine. These mucilaginous bodies sometimes exhibit a twisted aspect, an
opake nucleus, or a membranous layer, peculiarities which seem to indicate

the existence of an organization.
    " 4. These club-shaped filaments are swollen at the lower capitate extre-

mity, and have been found in contact with the ' embryo-sac ' or globular cell

which forms the rudiment of the future frond.
   " 5. The spiral filaments, which cease to move and fall upon the prothal<

lium, are metamorphosed, become granular and swell up."

   Hence the author deduces the following conclusions :
    " That these clavate filiform masses in the interior of the ' ovule' are trans-
formed spiral filaments, which at an early period, while the ovule was open,
have penetrated into it; which leads to the probability that
   " 1. The spiral filaments must regularly penetrate into the 'ovules,' and
   " 2. They probably contribute to the origin or development of the young
fruit frond (or embryo). In what way this happens the author knows not,
and the details on this point given by Count Suminski remain unconfirmed

facts."

   An important point in this essay is the view the author takes of the whole
process of development in this case. He regards it as not analogous to the

impregnation in the Phanerogamia, since the essential fact is merely the de-
velopment of a frond from one cell of the prothaUium, which he considers
to be merely one of the changes of the individual plant ; while all the other

authors who have written on the subject, with the exception of Wigand, call
the first frond, with its bud and root, an embryo, and regard it as a new in-
dividual, or at all events a distinct member of a series of forms constituting

collectively the representatives of the species.

    Finally, Hofmeister, in his notice of this essay in the ' Flora*,' declares that
the development of the so-called ' embryo' or first frond commences, not by
the subdivision of the globular cell or ' embryo-sac,' but by the development
of a free cell or 'embryo vesicle' in this, like what occurs in the embryo-sac
of the Phanerogam ia ; and he asserts that this is the first stage of develop-
ment from the globular cell in all the vascular Cryptogams, including that
found in the pistillidia of the Mosses.

 --Equiselacece. The first discovery of the analogy between the developments

from the spore in germination, in the Ferns and Equisetaceae, is due to M. G.
Thuretf, who saw the spores of the latter produce a cellular pro-embryo
somewhat like that of the Ferns, and in this were developed antheridia of
analogous structure, emitting cellules containing many spiral filaments.

   This announcement was confirmed by M. MildeJ, whose observations
extended over some months, during which time no ' ovule ' was produced,

but he saw what appeared to be the rudiment of one. Dr. MetteniusД states
that he has met with decaying ' ovules ' precisely like those of the Ferns,
upon the pro-embryo of an Equisetum, and thus the evidence is completed,

--so far as the occurrence of t^he two kinds of organs is concerned.
   Lycopodiacece. The fructification of this family consists, as is well known,

of spikes clothed with fruit-leaves, bearing on their inner faces sporangia

containing spores. These spores are of two kinds. One sort occur in large
numbers in their sporangium, and are very small ; the others are much
larger, and only four are met with in a sporangium. Spring ||, who has devoted

great attention to the general characters of the Lycopodiaceae, has given
especial names to the two kinds of sporangia ; those with the four large
spores he calls oophoridia, those with the small spores antheridia yet he

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

did not mean to attribute a sexual antithesis, merely a morphological one,

as he expressly states.

    The general impression however with regard to the import of the two

kinds of spores has long been, that the large spores alone are capable of pro-

ducing new plants, and five years ago Dr. C. Miiller published an elaborate
account of the development of the Lycopodiaceae^, in which the germination
of the large spores was described at length. The following are the essential

results of his investigations.

    The large spores are more or less globular bodies^ usually flattened on
the surfaces by which they are in contact in the oophoridium ; thus, while the

outer side has a spherical surface, the inner side has three or four triangular

surfaces, as in L. selagmoides, and L. denticulatum. They possess two coats,
the outer very thick and composed of numerous cells, the cavities of which
are almost completely filled up by deposits of secondary layers. This outer
coat exhibits various forms of raised markings on its outer surface, and in
some cases these seem to form a distinct layer, a kind of cuticle, capable of
being separated from the subjacent cells. The inner coat of the spore is
usually perfectly structureless, and not very firmly attached to the outer coat.
In L. gracillinmm Dr. Miiller observed below the outer coat a structure com-
posed of a layer of rather large parenchymatous cells, wiiich could be easily
isolated ; and as there was no structureless membrane within this, he regarded
tlie layer as the proper inner coat. This observation is important in relation
to the discrepancies between Dr. Miiller's statements and those of Mettenius,

to be spoken of presently. The cavity of the spore is filled with granular

mucilage.
    Wiien the spore is placed in favourable circumstances for germination it

begins to swell up, and if the contents be examined with the microscope, a
few minute cells will soon. be found to have become developed in the muci-
lage. This cell-formation commences at a determinate spot upon the inner
coat of the spore, the cells being so firmly applied that they appear blended
with this inner membrane. Tiie cell-formation goes on till an obtuse conical
process is developed, which breaks through the outer tough coat of the spore,
and this process is recognized as the germinal body or keim-korper, corre-
sponding to the pro-embryo of the other Cryptogams. From this, which at
this period does not by any means fill the cavity of the spore with its lower
portion, an ovate process is produced, at first obliquely directed upwards, the
bud of the future stem, and a conical process taking the opposite direction

representing tlie radicle. On the ascending process a distinction can soon be

observed between the terminal bud, a little oval body, and a short thread-like
stem on which it is supported ; as the bud opens, the leaves appear in pairs.

    At the conclusion of the paper Dr. Miiller offers some remarks on the
evidence with respect to the import of the spores, the substance of which may

be transcribed. " Up to tiie present time it remains doubtful what purpose
is served by the antheridium-spore. Some persons maintain one opinion,
others another. One author declares he has seen it germinate, another that
he has never been able to do so. Kaulfuss* relates that Fox sowed Lye.

Selago, and Lindsay L. cernuum with success, and that L. clavatuni sprung
up abundantly with Willdenow. With himself it did not succeed ; but the
garden-inspector. Otto of Berlin, raised L. pygmceum several years in suc-
cession from seed. The last case however is readily explicable, since
L. pygmceum possesses oophoridia."

    Goppertf however states that he has seen the development of young
plants from antheridium-spores in L. denticulatum. Dr. Miiller expresses
some doubt as to whether the observation was absolutely exact, since Gop-
pert never mentions seeing a young plant actually adherent to an antheridium-
spore, neither does he give the structure of the leaf, and the young plant he
figures closely resembles a Fissidens, frequently springing up in flower-pots
in green-houses. In his own attempts to raise plants from antheridium-

spores. Dr. Miiller in every case failed. He does not deny, however, that
they may be capable of germination, especially as some Lycopodiaceae

appear to be devoid of oophoridia.

   In 1849 appeared M. Hofmeister's notice on the fructification and germi-

nation of the higher CryptogamiaJ, in which he indicated the existence on
the pro-embryo of Sclaginella, of a number of peculiar organs, composed of
four papilliform cells, enclosing a large globular cell in the centre. In one
of these large spherical cells the young plant is produced. The nature of
the structure was only briefly described in this paper for the purpose of
showing its analogy with what occurs in Salvinia.

    In 1850 Dr. MetteniusД published an essay on the Propagation of the
Vascular Cryptogams, and in this is to be found a full description of the
organs mentioned by Hofmeister and altogether overlooked by Dr. C. Miiller.

       ON THE HIGHER CRYPTOGAMOUS PLANTS.     113

According to this author, the large spores of Selaginella invohens possess

two coats, each composed of two layers ; and in an early stage of the germi-
nation, the inner layer of the outer coat, together with the inner coat, form

the walls of a globular body which does not wholly fill the cavity enclosed

by the outermost membrane. This globular body is firmly attached to the

outer membrane immediately under the point of junction of the three ridges

separating the flattened surfaces of the inner side of the spore. The globule

enlarges until its walls come to be applied closely to the outer layer, com-

pletely filling up the large cavity. Then between the two layers of the inner

coat, at a point immediately beneath the point ofjunction of the three exter-

nal ridges, a process of cell-formation commences, producing a flattened plate

of tissue interposed between the two layers ; this structure is the pro-embryo.

The cells are at first in a single layer, but the central ones soon become di-

vided by horizontal septa so as to produce a double layer, and finally four or

more tiers of cells one above another. The outline of the pro-embryo, seen
from above, is circular, spreading over the upper part of the spore. On its

surface appear the so-called ovules. The first is produced at the apex of

the pro-embryo, the rest, to the number of twenty or thirty, arranged upon

its surface in three lines corresponding to the slits by which the outer coat

of the spore bursts. These ovules, closely resembling those of Salvinia, Pi'

lularia, the Ferns, fkc, consist of a globular cell surmounted by four cells,

which rise up into four papillae, and leave a canal or interceHular passage

between them, leading down to the globular cell or embryo-sac. The four

cells are usually developed into four or five cells, one above the other, by

the production of horizontal septa ; sometimes they are developed unequally
and to a considerable extent so as to form papillae, presenting an orifice be-

tween them at some point on the outer surface, indicating the canal leading
down to the embryo- sac.

During the development of the ovules, a delicate parenchyma is produced

in the great cavity of the spore, finally entirely filling up this spore.

Before it has completely filled it, the embryo makes its appearance in the

embryo-sac of one of the ovules.

   The first change in this sac is the appearance of a nucleus ; from this cells
are developed representing the suspensor of the embryo. The cells of the

suspensor multiply and form the process which penetrates down into the

parenchyma of the cavity of the spore ; at the lower end may be detected
the embryo, a minutely cellular body. Dr. Mettenius never saw the embryo

produced in the embryo-sac before the suspensor had broken through the

bottom of it to penetrate the parenchyma of the spore-cell ; it was always

within this parenchyma and attached to the end of the suspensor. In this point

he is decidedly opposed to Hofmeister, who states that the embryo originates

in the embryo-sac, whence a young embryo attached to its suspensor may

easily be extracted from the spore.

The part of the embryo opposite to the point of attachment of the suspen-

sor corresponds to the first axis of the Rhizocarpeae, which never breaks out

from the spore-cell in Selaginella ; it pushes back the loose parenchyma of
the spore- cell as it becomes developed, and when completely formed, is sur-

rounded by a thin coat composed of several layers of the parenchymatous cells

much compressed, enclosed in the still existing inner coat of the spore. On

one side of the point of attachment of the suspensor the embryo grows out

towards the point where the spore-cell has been ruptured, thus apparently

in a direction completely opposite to the end of the axis. As it enlarges it

produces in this situation tlie leafy stem growing upwards, and the adventi-

tious root turning downwards. The pro-embryo is at first distended like a

sac, and finally broken through on the one side by the first leaf, on the other

by the adventitious root ; upon it may be observed the numerous abortive

ovules, with their embryo-sacs filled with yellow contents part of its cells
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

grow out into radical hairs. Dr. Mettenius several times saw two young

plants produced from one spore; the ends of their axes lay close together,

and separated inside the cavity of the spore. No account is here given of

the characters exhibited by the small spores, or of anything like a process of

fertilization                                          yet we have indicated  in  the  foregoing description of the  so-

called ovules, a clear analogy between these bodies and the so-called ovules

of the Ferns and Rhizocarpese. These points will be referred to again at

the close of the report.

In a review of Dr. Mercklin's essay on the reproduction of the Ferns, in the

Flora*, Hofmeister states that spiral filaments are produced from the small

spores of Selaginella, but does not state that he has seen them or give any

authority.

  --Isoetacece. The spores of the Isoetes lacustris are of two kinds, analogous

to those of the Lycopodiaceae ; both kinds being produced in sporangia im-
bedded in the bases of the leaves, but the large spores are found in great

numbers, not merely four in a sporangium as in the Lycopodiaceae. The

development of the spores was little known until the publication of an essay

on the subject in 1848, by Dr-CMiillerf, forming a sequel to his researches

on the Lycopodiaceae. Here, as in the other case, his observations on the

earlier stages were imperfect; but he indicated the existence of the struc-

tures which have since been recognized as the so-called ovules ; as also did
Mr. Valentine J in his essay on Pilularia.

   In his essay Dr. C. Miiller compares the complete large spore, as discharged

from the sporangium, to the ovule of flowering plants ; and lie describes it as
a globular sac enclosed by three coats, which he names the primine, secun-

dine, and the nucleus. The outermost coat, or primine, is stated to be com-

posed of a thick cellular membrane exhibiting a raised network of lines, which

give it the aspect of a cellular structure, but are in reality analogous to the

rnarkings on pollen-grains. The outer surface exhibits the lines indicating

the tetrahedral arrangement of the spores in the parent cell, as in Selaginella,

and it is at the point of intersection of these that the membrane gives way in

germination. The next coat, or secundine, is another simple membrane lining
the first. The nucleus is a coat composed of delicate parenchymatous cells,
but among these are found groups of peculiar character. These are de-

scribed as consisting of a large cell divided by two septa crossing each other

at right angles, projecting from the general surface, being either oval in the

general outline, or having four indentations opposite the cross septa, so as to

give the appearance of the structure being composed of four spherical cells.

The cells surrounding them are of irregular form, different from the gene-

rally six-sided cells of the rest of the nucleus. Many of these groups occur

on the nucleus, always at the surface of the coat where the primine and se-

cundine afterwards give way, scattered without apparent order over it, but

one always near the point of the opening. To these structures Dr. Miiller

did not attribute any important function, explaining them merely as produced

by peculiar thickenings of the tissue to protect the pro-embryo during germi-
nation. The contents of the nucleus were stated to resemble those of the

cavity of the spores of Selaginella.
    In these contents, which become dense and mucilaginous, a free cell is de-

veloped near the upper part of the cavity ; this is the rudiment of the embryo,
and by cell-multiplication becomes a cellular mass, which soon begins to ex-
hibit growth in two directions, producing the first leaf and the first rootlet,
projecting from a lateral cellular mass, which the author calls the " reservoir
of nutriment." The embryo then breaks through the coats ; the first leaf
above and the first root below, the coats remaining attached over the central
mass of the embryo. The subsequent changes need not be mentioned here,
further than to state that the leaves succeed each other alternately, and are
not opposite as in the Lycopodiaceae ; moreover no internodes are developed
between them, so that the stem is represented by a flat rhizome, like the base
of the bulb of many Monocotyledons.

   In the paper by Dr. Mettenius*, already alluded to, we find some very im-
portant modifications of and additions to this history of development of the
spores of Isoetes, bringing them into more immediate relation with the other
vascular Cryptogams.

    This author describes the spore-cell as a thick structure composed of seve-
ral layers ; in some cases he counted four. It completely invests the pro-

embryo, which is a globular cellular body filling the spore-cell. Among

the cells of the outermost layer of the pro-embryo (which layer forms the
nucleus of Dr. Miiller), on the upper part, are produced the ovules, fewer in
number than in Selaginella, arranged in three rows converging upon the
summit of the spore, these rows corresponding to the slits between the lobes
of the outer coat of the spore. The four superficial cells of the ovules (which
are evidently the peculiar groups mentioned by Miiller and previously no-
ticed by Valentine f) grow much in the. same way as in the Rhizocarpeae
and in Selaginella, into short papillae. The embryo is developed in the sub-
stance of the pro-embryo, displacing and destroying its cells, and a globular
portion (corresponding to the " reservoir of nutrition" of Miiller) remains
within the spore after the first leaf and rootlet have made their way out.
This body is the analogue of that portion of the embryo oi Selaginella which
penetrates into the cavity of the spore, and to the end of the first axis in the

Rhizocarpeae.

   The most important point, however, of Dr. Mettenius's researches relates
to the phaenomenon exhibited by the small spores. In the water in which
the spores were sown he observed moving spiral filaments resembling those

of the Ferns. He was not able to trace all the stages of development of these

spiral filaments from the small spores, but he obtained nearly all the evidences
relating to their origin which Nageli has done in reference to the similar
organs in the Pilularia%. In the small spores minute vesicles are produced
of varying size and number, seen through the outer coat. The inner coat or
spore-cell breaks through the outer coat either in the middle or at both ends
at the projecting ridges, by which they are originally in contact with the other
spore-cells. Its contents are expelled, as is proved by finding numerous
empty membranes. The expelled vesicles are met with in considerable num-
ber in the water, and contain one large or several small granules, and in
them the spiral filaments are apparently produced ; but the actual course of
development was not observed. In one case a spiral filament was seen halt

way out of the spore-cell in active rotation, finally emerging completely, so

that the moving spiral filaments are probably developed in the vesicles, while

these are still contained within the spore-cell.

No actual connexion of these moving spiral filaments or spermatozoa with

the so-called ovules has yet been traced.

 --Rhizocarpece. Almost from the earliest period of the study of Cryptoga-

mous plants, attempts have been made to prove the existence of distinct sexes

in the Rhizocarpeas, various parts of the structure being regarded by differ-

ent authors as analogues of the stamens and pistils of flowering plants. Ber-
nard de Jussieu* went so far as to class them {Pilularia glob, and Marsilea

quad.) with the Monocotyledons, with Lemna, considering the large spore-

sacs as pistils and the small ones as stamens.

    Others have sought the male organs in the hairs upon the leaves or recep-
tacles f ; but the rest of the numerous authors who have written on the sub-
ject, have either denied tiie distinction of sexuality altogether, or are agreed

in considering the large spores as either ovaries or ovules, the small spores

as pollen-grains. Experiments have frequently been made upon the gene-

rative powers of the two kinds of spores. Paolo Savi:|; found that the large

spores of Sakinia would not germinate alone, and tlierefore he regarded the
small ones as anthers. DuvernoyД, on the contrary, states that he saw the
large spores of Salvinia germinate when separated from the small ones, and

therefore he did not regard the latter as anthers, but only rudiments. Bi-

schoff||, who minutely described the structure of the European species, said

that in his experiments the large spores of Salvinia germinated as well with-

out the small granules as with them. Agardh^ saw the large spores of Pi-

lularia germinate separately, but later than those united with the anthers.

Pietro Savi** made careful observations on the germination of the separated
large spores o{ Saloinia, and found them to produce a green raamilla which

underwent no further development ; he therefore regarded the small spores

as necessary for impregnation. Esprit Fabreff carefully experimented on

Marsilea Fabri.  The      separated   large  spores  did  not     germinate                                              they did
                                                                                                                      ;

not even produce the stationary green papilla observed in Salvinia by Pietro

Savi. Dr. C. MvillerJ:^ found that the large spores o? Pdularia would not

germinate when separate from the small ones.

   The development of the spores and the germination of the larger kind in
Pilularia appear to have been first accurately described by Mr. Valentine ДД,
in a paper read before the Linnasan Society in March 1 839. It is unnecessary

to enter into the particulars of this paper, which gives accurate statements in

most points, and mentions for the first time the occurrence of the cellular pa-
pilla upon the pro-embryo which has since been regarded as the " ovule," ana-
logous to that found on the pro-embryo of the other vascular Cryptogams.

   Dr.C.Muller'sllll essay appeared in 1840, and agrees in some points ; but
he appears to have mistaken the mode of origin of the pro- embryo. In 1843

Schleiden^^announced that hehadobservedaprocessof impregnation in Pilu-

laria, in which the small spores acted the partof pollen-grains, producing tubes
which entered into a cavity on the surface of the large spore or " ovule," and,
in accordance with his views of impregnation in general, became the embryo.

   The next paper on the subject was an essay published by Dr. Mettenius*
in 1846, in which the anatomy and development of /ya^umfa is treated at

length; that o{ Pilularia and Marsilea less perfectly. He did not observe

the process of impregnation described by Schleiden, yet from the want of
organic continuity between the embryo and the " ovule," he inclined to adopt
the theory of fertilization propounded by Schleiden, both for the Phaneroga-
mia and the Rhizocarpeae, namely, that the end of the pollen-tube penetrated
into the so-called ovule and became the embryo ; nevertheless he had some
doubts, since he could not reconcile the production of " pollen-tubes " from
the small spores of Salvin'ia with the facts he had observed, and never saw
the " tube" penetrate the " ovule " in Pilularia.

   In 1846 Prof. Nageli published some new and important observations on
Pilulariaf, in which he stated that the observations of Schleiden were alto-
gether incorrect, and that the bodies which that author had described as
three or four " pollen-tubes," produced by the small spores and adherent to
the summit of the large spore, were in fact parts of this, constituting a papil-
liform structure, forming a part of the pro-embryo developed by the large
spore itself. Moreover he discovered a totally unexpected fact in regard to

the small spore or " pollen-grains." He found that these, without coming in

contact with the large spores at all, became elongated by the inner coat pro-
truding like a short pouch-like process through the outer. This contained
starch-granules; and s<ome he found burst and surrounded by starch-grains
exactly like those inside the others ; and in addition to these, minute cellules
which seem to have been expelled from the small spores. In these cellules
were developed spiral filaments exhibiting active movement, just like those
of Chara, the Mosses, &c. These filaments finally make their way out and
swim about freely in the water. They were constantly met with in the gela-
tinous mass in which the spores were enveloped.

   In 1849 M. Hofmeister J published the essay on the higher Cryptogams
already alluded to, and there briefly described his own critical observations,

referring to the points of difference from his predecessors. His statements

are as follows :

   " The publications of Mettenius and Nageli, as also those of Schleiden
himself, sufficiently show that the large spores of the Rhizocarpeae (the organs
called by Schleiden 'seed-buds' (ovules)) originate essentially in the same
way as the spores of the Cryptogamia generally, and as the small spores of
the Rhizocarpeae ('pollen-grains' of Schleiden) in particular. One young
spore in each sporangium becomes developed more rapidly than the others,
and finally usurps the whole cavity. At the time when the spores are ripe,

a large spore does not differ from a small one in any respect except in dimen-
sions (the size of the organs allows of the structure of the outer secreted
layer being very distinctly observed ; An Pilularia five layers can be clearly

detected). The large spore is a simple tough-walled cell filled with starch
or oil-drops and albuminous matter, enclosed by a thick exine, which, at the
point when the ' sister-spores' were in contact with the developed spore in

the earlier stages, exhibits peculiar conditions of form, displaying, according

to the generic differences, a splitting into thin lobes or a considerable thin-

ning of the mass. Not the least trace of the cellular body (the pro-embryo,
papilla of the nucleus of Schleiden) is to be seen at this point at the time when

the spores are just ripe.

--118 REPORT 1851.

    " After the ripe spores have lain a longer or shorter time in water, a process
of cell-formation commences at that point of the spore, within the proper,
internal spore-cell, whence results the formation of a cellular body occupying
only a small portion of the internal cavity of the spore. The cells multiply
rapidly, and break through the exine, appearing externally as the green cellu-
lar papilla called the ' keim-nmlst' by Bischoft', the 'papilla of the nucleus'
by Schleiden. I see no ground why this should be named otherwise than as
the fro-embryo. In Pilularia it is very soon seen, where the pro-embryo
consists of only about thirty cells, completely enveloped by the exine, and
where the only external evidence of its existence is a little protuberance,
that the pro-embryo consists of a large central cell surrounded by a simple
layer of smaller ones. The smaller cells covering the apex of this large cell,
four in number, elongate into a papilla before the pro-embryo bursts through

--the exine, which splits regularly into twelve to sixteen teeth ; subsequently

they become divided by horizontal walls, and then appear as the organ which
Schleiden, and after him Mettenius, supposed to be ' pollen-tubes ' produced
from some of the small spores. These papilliform cells most certainly ori-
ginate from the pro-embryo, a fact which takes away all material ground
from Schleiden's theory.

   " The four papilliform cells separate from each other and leave a passage
leading to the large central cell. In this cell the young plant originates

shortly after the smaller spores, which never produce ' pollen-tubes,' begin
to emit the cellules containing spiral filaments discovered by Nageli. I ob-
served and dissected out an embryo consisting of only four cells. It com-
pletely filled the large central cell, and there was not the least trace of a
pollen-tube attached to it.

   " The organization of Salvinia is somewhat different from this. On every
pro-embryo several, as many as eight cells of the outer surface of the cellular

layer next but two to the obtuse triangular cellular body, acquire a consi-
derable size, a spherical form, and become filled with protoplasm ; the four
cells covering each of these larger cells lose the greater part of their chloro-
phyll and separate from each other to leave a passage leading down to the
large central cell. In this large cell the young plant originates. The number of
these organs inSalvinia allows the possibility of the occurrence of poly-embry-
ony in this genus ; I observed two embryos on one pro-embryo in one case.

    " It is out of the question to talk of a ' larger pollen-tube' in Salvinia.
Mettenius has already shown that the structure of the small spores renders
such a product from them impossible."

    Dr. Mettenius's Essay on the Vascular Cryptogams*, already frequently
referred to, confirms the preceding account in all essential points, some slight
criticisms relating only to the structure of the coats of the spore ; and it adds
a description of the development of the *' ovules " in the pro-erabryo of
Marsilea Fabri, which agrees closely with that in Pilularia. Hofmeister-j*
has recently announced the discovery of the production of cellules contain-
ing spiral filaments from the small spores in Salvinia, ']\x&t as Nageli saw thera

in Pilularia.

               General Conclusions.

    In the facts of which I have given confessedly a very imperfect resumi in
the preceding pages, we have two important points to consider. In the first
place, we have to determine how far they suffice to warrant the belief in the

   * Beitrage zur Botanik. Heidelberg, 1850.

  t Flora, 1850. p. 700 (in a note to a review of Mercklin's Essay on the Reproduction of

Ferns).
ON THE HIGHER CRYPTOGAMOUS PLANTS.                                          119

existence of a distinction of sexes in these families. In the second place, we

have to endeavour to trace the analogies which exist between the different

conditions presented by the supposed sexual organs in the different families.
These considerations, if we adopt the hypothesis of sexuality, lead to some very

interesting questions in reference to the process of reproduction generally.

In regard to the first question, that of the existence of two sexes and the

necessity of a process of fertihzation, we have several kinds of evidence.

1. The inferences to be deduced from the universality of the existence of

Wetwo kinds of organs in connexion with the reproductive process.  have

seen that these exist in all the families at some period or other of the life of

the representative of the species. In the Mosses and the Hepaticae they occur

in the fully developed plant. In the Ferns and Equisetacese they occur upon

cellular structures of frondose character developed from all the spores, which

frondose bodies or pro-embryos have an existence of some permanence, espe-

cially in the Equisetaceae. In the Lycopodiaceae, the Isoetaceae and Rhizo-

carpese, the pistillidia occur upon very transitory cellular structures produced

from one kind of spore, the larger, while the smaller spores at once develope

in their interior cellules containing moving spiral filaments such as occur in

the antheridia of the other families.

   2. The inferences to be deduced from the observations on the development

of those plants in which the two kinds of organs, occurring in distinct places,

can be separated. Strong evidence has been brought forward that the dioecious
Mosses, as they are called, do not produce sporangia when the pistillidia are

kept apart from the antheridia by natural accident. The majority of observers

state that the large spores of the Rhizocarpeae do not germinate if the small

spores are all removed from contact with them ; a few counter-statements
however do exist. Again, the majority of authors, and all the recent ones,
state that only the large spores of the Lycopodiaceae and Isoetaceae produce

new plants ; while some older writers believed that they had seen the small
spores do so.

   3. The direct observation of a process of fertilization, of which we have

only testimony from two authors, Suminski and Mercklin, in reference to
the Ferns alone ; since the assertions of Schleiden in regard to the Rhizo-
carpeae have been demonstrated by Nageli, Hofmeister, and Mettenius to

have been based on very imperfect observation.
   The circumstantial evidence furnished under the first head seems to rae

very strong, so much so that I am inclined to adopt the idea of sexuality on

this ground as the legitimate provisional hypothesis arising out of our present

knowledge, especially when supported so strongly as it is by the negative

evidence indicated under the second head.

   The positive evidence of the third head is certainly very insufficient as

yet, considering the extreme delicacy of the investigation. Suminski's other

observations on the details have been contested in many particulars ; and

Mercklin, the only other observer who asserts that he has seen the spiral
filaments within the so-called ovules, describes the conditions differently, and

states that he has only been able to observe them positively there three times.
At the same time the difficulty of the investigation should make us hesitate

in attaching too much weight to the failure of the other observers in tracing

a process of fertilization ; moreover it is quite possible that actual entry of
the spiral filaments into the canal of the ovules or pistillidia is not always, if

ever, necessary.

   The facts before us, then, appear to me strong enough to warrant the

adoption of the views propounded by the latest authors on this subject, and

 the acceptance of tlie hypothesis of sexuality in the Vascular Cryptogams
 as the most satisfactory explanation of the phsenomena as yet observed.
 The question lies now much in the same condition as that of the sexuality
 of flowering plants before the actual contact of the pollen-tubes with the
 ovules had been satisfactorily demonstrated.

    Further arguments may be adduced from grounds lying out of the pre-
 ceding statements, viz. 1. The late discovery of two forms of organs in the

 Algse, Lichens and Fungi, which, although imperfect at present, lead to the
 expectation that the analogues of the antheridia and pistillidia of the
 Mosses, so long known, will be found in all Cryptogamous plants. 2. The
 analogies between the processes of animal and vegetable reproduction which
 appear to be offered by these new views of the nature of the phaenomena in

 the Vascular Cryptogams. To this last argument I shall merely allude, as
 it may be considered to lie beyond the special province of the vegetable phy-
 siologist ; yet when we recollect the imperceptible character of the gradations

 of the lower forrn^ of the two kingdoms, there seems far sounder ground
 than is allowed by Schleiden for arguing from apparent analogies between
 the phasnomena occurring in the two great kingdoms of nature.

    Under the second point of view mentioned above, the facts of structure
may soon be disposed of, so far as the analogies of form are concerned; the
 antheridia of the Mosses, Hepaticae, Ferns, and Equisetaceae agree with the
 small spores oБ Isoetes, Selaginella, Pilularia, and Salvinia in producing- the
 cellules in which are developed the moving spiral filaments which constitute
the essential character of the organs of the one kind ; while the pistillidia of
the Mosses and Hepaticae agree with the so-called " ovules " of the Ferns,

 EquisetacCcE, Lycopodiacesc, Isoetacea?, aiid Rhizocarpese, in general struc-

ture and in the presence of the central large cell from which the new form

of structure originates.

    The great difTerences depend on the position in time and space of the or-
gans, in the different classes, and the nature of the immediate product of the so-

called " embryo-sac," the large central cell of the pistillidia and " ovules."
    In the Mosses and Hepaticas the pistillidia occur upon the plant when the

--vegetative structure is perfect, and the immediate product of the great cell

is a sporangium. If a process of fertilization take place here, we may re-

gard the antheridia and pistillidia as analogues of the anthers and pistils of

flowering plants, the sporangia of their fruits; or with Hofmeister we may

regard the phaenomenon as an instance of an " alternation of generations,"
where the pistillidium would be looked upon as an ovule, producing (in the spo-
rangium) a new individual of totally different character from that developed
from the spore (the leafy Moss plant in the usual acceptation of the term).

   In tlie Ferns and Equisetaceae, we find the spores producing a frondose
structure of definite form, upon which are developed antheridia and pistil-
lidia, or " ovules." Here then we seem to have one generation complete, and
the new development from the pistillidium or " ovule " appears in a totally
new form, producing stem and leaves which have a distiyct individual form
and existence, and produce the spores after a long period upon tem])orary
parts of the structure, on the leaves ; and by no means cease to exist when
those are matured. Here we seem to have a real " alternation of genera-
tions," and Hofmeister compares the whole permanent plant of the Fern or
Equisetum to the sporangium of the Mosses and Hepaticag. In all the
other families, the Lycopodiaceae, Isoetaceae, the Rhizocarpeae, the p ro
embryo is a very transitory production, and is developed from a differ en
spore from the spiral filaments. This pro-embryo is clearly analogous to
ON THE HIGHER CRYPTOGAMOUS PLANTS.  121

that of the Ferns and Equisetacese ; and if the existence of sexes be a fact,
we have here a dioecious condition as contrasted with a monoecious condi-

tion in the two last-named families. Hofmeister here again assumes that

the pro-embryo developed from the large spore is an intermediate genera-

tion between the two perfect forms of tlie plant.

    It is rather difficult to decide upon the real analogies of these structures with
those of the flowering plants. The resemblance of structure is so close between
the pistillidia of the Mosses and Hepaticae, and the " ovules " of the other
Vascular Cryptogams, that they must be regarded as analogues, and then the

former could not well be conceived to be analogous to the pistils of flowering

plants, but rather to ovules ; if this be the case, the sporangium must be

considered the analogue of the perfect plant in the Fern, &c., and the
leafy stem as the analogue of the pro-embryo of the Ferns, &c. The
pistillidium of the Mosses can indeed liardly be regarded as analogous to the
fruit of a flowering plant, as in that case the spores would be ovules pro-
duced long after fertilization ; and on the other hand, if we consider the
pistillidia of the Moss as an ovule, which it might be, analogous to that of

--the Coniferae, in which a large number of embryonal vesicles or rudiments
--of embryos are produced after fertilization on the branched extremities of

the suspensors, then we seem to lose the analogy between the product of
the pistillidium of the Moss and that of the ovule of the Fern, unless we
would regard the entire plant of a perfect Fern as analogous to the ovule of

a Conifer.

   Perhaps the time has hardly come for us to arrive at any conclusion on these
points. The phaenomena in the Ferns and Equisetaceae, as well as in the
RhizocarpcK, Lycopodiaceae, and Isoetaceae less strikingly, seem to present
a series of conditions analogous to those which have been described under
the name of " alternation of generations " in the animal kingdom, and seeing
the resemblance which tlie pistillidia of the Mosses have to the ovules of the
other families, we can hardly help extending the same views to them ; in which
case we should have the remarkable phaenomenon of a compound organism,
in which a new individual forming a second generation, developed after a
process of fertilization, remains attached organically to the parent, from which
it differs totally in all anatomical and physiological characters. It is almost
needless to advert to the essential difference between such a case and that of
the occurrence of flower-buds and leaf-buds on one stem in the Phanero-
gamia, as parts of a single plant, yet possessing a certain amount of indepen-
dent individuality. These are produced from each other by simple extension,
a kind of gemmation ; while the Moss capsule, if the sexual theory be cor-
rect, is the result of a true reproductive process*.

   In conclusion, I may remark, that these anomalous conditions lose their
remarkable character to a great extent if we refuse to accept the evidence of

sexuality which has been brought forward here. If the structures are all
products of mere extension or gemmation, the analogies which have been
supposed to exist between them and the organs of flowering plants all fall
to the ground. But believing that the hypothesis of sexuality is based on

solid grounds, I am by no means inclined to allow the difficulty of the ex-

   * Moreover we have an analogy to the increase by huds in the innovations by which the
leafy stems of the Mosses are multiplied, both in the earliest condition, where a number of
stems are developed from the byssoid mass produced by the spore, and afterwards by gem-
mae on the stems and leaves, as in the Liverworts also. The byssoid mass produced by

the Moss-spore has usually been called the pro-embryo, but it is evidently not analogous to
the bodies termed pro-embryos in the Ferns, Lycopodiaceae, &c. &c. It would almost seem

to constitute a third member of a series of generations.

can only claim space to indicate the general results of his

work as given in the concluding summary: " The comparison of the course

of development of the Mosses and Liverworts on the one hand, with the

Ferns, Equisetaceae, Rhizocarpeae and Lycopodiaceae ou the other, reveals

the most complete agreement between the development of the fruit of the

former and the developmentof the embryo of the others. The archegonium

of the Mosses, the organ within which the rudiment of its fruit is formed,

resembles perfectly in structure the archegonium of the Filicoids (in the

widest sense), that part of the prothallium in the interior of which the embryo

of the frondescent plant originates. In the two great groups of the higher

Cryptogams, one large central cell originating free in the archegonium, gives

origin by repeated subdivision to the fruit in the Mosses, and to the leafy

plant in the Filicoids. In neither of them does the subdivision of this cell

go on, in both does the archegonium become abortive, if spermatic filaments

do not reach it at the epoch when it bursts open at the apex.
    " Mosses and Filicoids thus afford one of the most striking examples of a

regular alternation of two generations widely different in their organization.

The first of these, produced by the germinating spore, developes antheridia

and archegonia, sometimes few, sometimes many. In the central cell of the

archegonium, in consequence of a fertilization through the spermatozoids

emitted from the antheridia, becomes developed the second generation, des-
tined to produce spores, which are always formed in a number much greater

than that of the rudimentary fruits of the first generation.

" In the Mosses the vegetative life is exclusively committed to the first,

the production of fruit to the second generation. Only the leafy stem pos-

sesses roots; the spore-producing generation draws its sustenance from the

foregoing. The fruit is usually of shorter duration than the leaf-bearing

plant. In the Filicoids the opposite condition obtains. It is true the pro-

thallia send out capillary rootlets ; those of the Polypodiaceae and Equise-

taceae under all circumstances, those of the Rhizocarpeae and Selaginellae

frequently. But the prothallium has a much briefer existence than the

frondescent plant, which in most cases must vegetate for several years be-

fore it comes to bear fruit. Yet the contrast is not so strong as it appears
to be at first sight. The seemingly unlimited duration of the leaf-bearing

Moss-plant depends upon constant renovation {verjiingung). Phaenomena

essentially similar occur in proliferous protliallia of the Polypodiaceae and

Equisetaceae. The structure of the lowest Mosses (^Anthoceros, Pellia) is

less complex, and the duration of the fruit-bearing shoots is little longer than

Onthat of the fruit itself.  the other hand, the ramification of ti)e prothallium

of the Equisetaceae is exceedingly complicated ; its duration is even equal to

that of a single shoot.
    " It is a circumstance worthy of notice, that in the second generation of

Mosses, as of the Filicoids, destined to produce spores, more complex thick-
enings of tlie cell-walls regularly occur (teeth of the peristome of Mosses,

wall of capsule and elaters of Liverworts, vessels of Filicoids, &c.), while in
the first generation, springing from the spores, such structures are found only

rarely and as exceptions.
   " The manner in which the second generation arises from the first, varies

much more in the Filicoids than in the Mosses. The Polypodiaceae and
Equisetacese are hermaphrodite ; the Rhizocarpeae and Sehtgineiiae monoe-
cious. All the Filicoids agree in the fact that the first axis of their embryo

possesses but a very hmited longitudinal development; that it is an axis of
the second rank which breaks through the prothallium and becomes the main
axis ; further, in the end of the axis of the first rank never becoming elon-
gated in the direction opposite to the summit. All Filicoids are devoid of a

tap-root, and possess only adventitious roots.
   " In more than one respect does the course of development of the embryo

of the Conifers stand intermediately between those of the higher Cryptogams
and the Phanerogams. Like the primary parent-cell of the spores of the Rhi-
zocarpeae and Selaginellae, the embryo-sac is an axile cell of the shoot, which

in the former is converted into a sporangium, in the latter into an ovule. In
the Conifers the embryo-sac also very early becomes detached from the cel-

lular tissue surrounding it. The filling-up of the embryo-sac with the albu-

men may be compared with the origin of the prothallium in the Rhizocarpeae
and Selaginellae. The structure of the 'corpuscula' bears the most striking
resemblance to that of the archegonia of Sahinia, still more to that of the

Selaginellae. If we leave out of view the different nature of the impregna-

tion, in the Rhizocarpeae and Selaginellae by free-swimming spermatic fila-

ments, in the Coniferae by a pollen-tube (which ^jer/iaps developes spermatic

filaments in its interior), the metamorphosis of the embryonal vesicle into the

primary parent-cell of the new plant in the Conifers and Filicoids is solely

distinguished, by the latter possessing only a single embryonal vesicle which

completely fills the cavity of the central cell of the archegonium, while the

former exhibits very numerous embryonal vesicles swimming in it, of which

only one pressed into the lower end of the ' corpusculum' becomes impreg-

nated. The embryo-sac of the Conifers may be regarded as a spore which

remains enclosed in its sporangium ; the prothallium which it forms never

comes to light. The fertilizing matter must make a way for itself through

the tissue of the sporangium, to reach the archegonia of this protliallium.

   *' Two of the phaenomena which led me to compare the embryo-sac of the
Conifers with the large spores of the higher Cryptogams, are common also

to the embryo-sac of the Phanerogams : the origin from an axile cell of the

shoot, and the independence of the surrounding cellular tissue (so striking,

for example, in the Rhinanthaceae, through the independent growth of the

embryo-sac). By their pollen-grains producing tubes the Conifers are closely

connected with the Phanerogams, from which they differ so much in the course

of development of their embryo-sac and the embryonal vesicles. The sepa-

ration of the prothallium of the Conifers into a number of independent sus-

pensors,is aphaenomenonof a most peculiar kind, having no analogue through-

--out the vegetable kingdom." (^Loc. cit. pp. 139-41.) A.H. Dec. 16,185 1.

On the Nomenclature of Organic Compounds. By Charles G. B.
     Daubeny, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry at Oxford.

                                  Introduction.

My attention has of late been in some degree attracted to the nomenclature

of organic combinations, and on considering this subject, it has struck me

as a matter of surprise, that none of the British treatises on chemistry

with which I am acquainted should contain any rules to guide us, either in

affixing names to substances newly discovered, or in divining the nature and

relations of bodies from the appellations attached to them. Nor do I find
this deficiency supplied in a manner which to me appears satisfactory, when

I turn to the writings of continental chemists. Amongst these I may men-
tion two in particular, namely Gmelin and Gerhardt, who have busied them-
selves on this subject ; both men of eminence in their respective countries,
neither of whom however appears to me to have proposed a scheme of no-

menclature at all calculated for general adoption.

Gmelin, indeed, in his Handbook, has invented entirely new names for all

simple bodies whatsoever, designating compound ones by means of words

made up of those which he had affixed to their constituents. He has even

gone further than this, first, in suggesting a method by which the number of

atoms of each element may be implied by the inflexion of the name which

expresses it ; and secondly, in extending the same mode of designation to

organic bodies, by the use of distinct terms for each of the supposed radicals,

from which, with the addition of certain other elements, the various sub-

stances met with in this department of nature are conceived to be built up.

Thus for example,

            1 atom of oxygen is expressed by the word ane,

            2 atoms                                 ene,

            3 atoms                                 ine,

            4 atoms                                 one,

            5 atoms                                 une,

            6 atoms                                 aene ;

and so on.

            1 atom of hydrogen is called            ale,

            2 atoms, by inflexions of the like description.

            ------1 atom of carbon is called        ase,
                         of sulphur                 afe,

                     of nitrogen                    ate,

                     of chlorine                    ahe,

            и of potass                             pate,
                         of soda                    nate

                                                                          ;

and so with others. Water will be designated by two syllables, derived from
its two constituents, and is therefore called alan ; sulphurous acid a/ew ; sul-
phuric acid afn ; sulphate of soda therefore will be naian-afin. Arbitrary
names are attached to the compound radicals : thus ethyl is vine ; amyl is

myl; pheuyle is/wwe, &c.

   Now it will be seen, that as the new names assigned to the elements bear
no relation whatsoever to those in common use, the amount of labour incurred

in the adoption of such a nomenclature would be equivalent to that attending
the acquisition of a new language, and one too all the more embarrassing
from the near resemblance which the words themselves bear to each other.
Accordingly I cannot bring myself to believe that such a nomenclature as
Gmelin's will ever come into general use ; for although it be true, that the
          ON THE NOMENCLATURE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 125

one for inorganic bodies introduced by Lavoisier and his associates, which
with all its faults has wonderfully facilitated the advancement of the science,
met with rapid success, it must be recollected, that the innovations then
made did not extend beyond a few bodies, and those for the most part of
recent discovery ; whilst even in their case the names imposed were by no
means so arbitrary, or so destitute of meaning, as are those of Gmelin.

    Oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, comprise perhaps the entire
catalogue of new names for elementary substances devised by the French
chemists, and in every one of these the Greek or Latin root of the word
suggests some at least of the chemical properties or relations of the body

itself.

    It is indeed true, that the changes which they introduced pervade the whole
of chemistry, because the elements to which new names had been assigned
enter so largely into combination with others; but the principles upon
which they proceeded in the innovations proposed were nevertheless in
themselves few and simple.

    Gmelin's method, on the contrary, involves the rejection of the entire

system of names in common use, and requires moreover such a perfect fami-

liarity with those which he has substituted, as should enable us to perceive at

a glance the import of any combination of them which may occur, and to

appreciate the value of each of the inflexions to which the terms are subject,
according to the number of atoms which the constituents of the substance

designated may severally present. What chemist, for instance, would tolerate

 such an expression as natan-qfin for sulphate of soda, or follow the lecturer
 when he spoke of lenevine for wine-alcohol ? I have no idea, therefore, that
 a nomenclature formed upon such a principle as that of Gmelin will ever
 meet with general adoption, or can be regarded in any other light than as an

 exercise of ingenuity, or as a kind of philosophical puzzle.

    With respect to the other scheme proposed by Gerhardt in his ' Precis de
 Chemie Organique,' I perhaps need only remark, that such modifications as he
 has recommended in the established method are foundedupon his own peculiar
 theoretical views, and upon the system of classification which he has thought
 fit to adopt with respect to organic bodies. Whatever therefore may be its
 merits, it does not meet the object I have in view, which aims at nothing
 further than rendering the existing nomenclature more consistent with itself,
 and with the principles agreed upon by the great body of scientific chemists
 who are employed upon this department of the subject, and which therefore
 excludes the adoption of any alterations which imply the recognition of
 views not yet generally assented to. Moreover, the classification of organic
 substances with which Gerhardt has set out, is entirely artificial, and one
 which places bodies belonging to the same type often in the most distant parts
 of his system ; nor has it, to compensate for this defect, the same recom-
  mendation which the Linnaean system possesses in Botany, namely, that of
  enabling us promptly to distinguish the object denoted ; since the composition
  of the body, upon which its place in the series depends, can only be ascer-
  tained after a minute and laborious investigation.

     But dissatisfied as I may be with the methods hitherto proposed, it is
 foreign from my intention to suggest any new principle of naming organic
 substances, convinced as I am that none, except the great masters of the
  science, who possess influence enough to give laws in the first instance to a
  numerous band of pupils, and a general reputation so extensive as to cause
 them to be submitted to afterwards over a much wider circle, have a right to
  expect that a patient hearing would be given to them, were they to under-
--126 REPORT 1851.

take to originate a Sj'stem of Nomenclature. All that I aim at accomplishing
is to impart, if possible, something like definiteness to our ideas on the sub-
ject ; and this I propose to do, first by comparing the names assigned by the
highest authorities to various organic compounds with the relations in which
the bodies themselves stand to each otlier, and by submitting to you such
inferences with respect to the general principles which appear to have guided
them in the choice of the terms they employ, as I may have thence deduced
and secondly, by pointing out instances in which the principles assumed ap-
pear to have been departed from, and thus anomalies to have been intro-

duced into the language employed.

   The plan adopted by the founders of that distinct branch of science now
recognised as Organic Chemistry, seems to have been nothing more than an
extension of the system common in all similar cases, namely, to select,
as a generic name for a class, that of some body belonging to it which hap-
pens to be most familiarly known to us. Thus, as the use of the term Salt
has been from time immemorial extended, from the substance commonly and
best known to us as such, to all that class of bodies which possesses a similar
constitution, so in organic chemistry Alcohol is employed as a generic term

for a class of bodies, of which spirits of wine is the type ; Ether for that of
which the body commonly called sulphuric ether is the best known ; Camphor
for the one to which the well-known product from the Laurus Camphora
belongs. It is also customary to employ one of the syllables of the word
expressive of a class as a part of the name of any particular member of it.
Thus chloraZ is a body of the type of aldehyde, but containing chlorine ; ure-
thane, a compound of an ether with an organic base, urea. These indeed
may perhaps be regarded rather as abbreviations of the former, than as
distinct names for the members of a series.

    I shall therefore begin by considering the names applied to those classes
under which the multiplied products of natural and artiticial processes which
present themselves in the domain of organic chemistry have been ranged, at

least provisionally, by our systematic writers.

         --Part I. On the Classes of Organic Bodies.

The following classes of organic bodies appear to be recognized :

Hydrocarbons.    Alcohols.   Nitriles.

Essential oils.  Aldehydes.  Ureas.
                 Hydrurets.  Cetones.
Camphors.

Resins.          Ethers.     Glycerides.

Acids.           Amides.     Neutral or indif-
Neutral salts.   Imides.        ferent compounds.

         Alkalies.

 --Hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon is a term comprehending too miscellaneous

a collection of bodies to be of much use for the purposes of classification in

the ordinary sense in which it is employed, embracing, as it does, not only the
so-called compound radicals, but likewise a large number of the essential oils.

As however several of these latter contain in addition oxygen, and others sul-

phur, such a classification would be inapplicable to a large proportion of the
members of this family ; and it is also to be considered, that in those oils

which consist only of carbon and hydrogen, a portion of the latter principle
seems bound to the other element by a looser affinity than the remainder, so

that even these may be regarded rather in the light of hydrurets than of

simple hydrocarbons. Reserving therefore this latter term for bodies which
          ON THE NOMENCLATURE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 127

stand in the relation of compound radicals, we have three distinct families to
set apart from them : namely, essential oils, or eleoptenes ; 2nd, camphors, or

stearoptenes ; and 3rd, resins.
    Essential Oils Essential oils agree sufficiently in physical and chemical

properties to admit of being referred to the same class, notwithstanding such
subordinate differences as the superaddition of oxygen, nitrogen, or sulpho-

--cjanogen may occasion.
    Camphors. Camphor is a term applied to a class characterized by re-
maining solid at ordinary temperatures, and by corresponding with the
essential oils associated with them in the same plant in the relation between
their hydrogen and carbon, the essential difiference between the two being

--the superaddition of an atom of oxygen to the ingredients of the oil.
   Resins. They thus are distinguished from the class of resins, which seem
to be derived from the essential oils through the substitution of oxygen for
hydrogen. Thus oil of turpentine is represented by C'o H** ; whilst its resin

His C'o H7 O, being removed, O added.

  --Acids, With regard to this next class; I am not disposed to recom-

mend any innovation upon existing usage, though aware that Gerhardt has
proposed uniting those which contain the elements of water with the neutral
salts, distinguishing the former by the generic term usually applied col-
lectively to the whole series of combinations which they contribute to form,
and designating the members of each group by specific names taken from

those of the several bases united with them.
    Thus oil of vitriol would be called normal sulphate, whilst the several com-

binations produced by its action upon the alkalies, earths, and metallic oxides
would retain their present distinctive appellations. I much doubt however
whether chemists in general are as yet prepared for such an innovation; and

for my own part 1 should not easily reconcile myself to the propriety of
transferring to the acid constituent a name so long applied to the genus, of

which the several salts constitute the species.
    This latter objection indeed might be got over, by calling the hydrous acid,

in the instance before us, sulphate of water ; but such an expedient would
compel us to class together bodies, whose physical and chemical properties
appear to differ from each other as materially as those of an acid from a

neutral salt.

   To do this at the present time would be nothing less than to assume the
Binary Theory of salts as established on incontrovertible evidence, instead

of remaining amongst the debateable points of science, and would therefore
be inconsistent with the principle upon which I have proceeded, of recom-
mending no system of nomenclature which implies the adoption of views

--not generally recognized.
    Neutral Salts. Hence I should prefer that the compounds which are
produced by the union of a vegetable acid with a base, or, if you please,
by the replacement of the hydrogen in the former by a metal, should still
be thrown into the class of salts, the genus and species of each being cha-
 racterized, as at present, by terms expressive of the acid and base which

--contribute to its formation.
     Vegetable Alkalies. With respect to these, it will be seen that the bodies
so-called may be thrown into one or other of the three classes of amides,
 imides and nitriles, if these words be any longer retained in the nomencla*

 ture of science.
    There are indeed bodies called amides which possess acid properties, such

+as the oxamic acid, which is composed of oxamide NH^ C^ O- oxalic acid

 C* O' ; but this is nothing more than an instance of a conjugate acid, or of a
--128 REPORT 1851.

body which retains its acid properties, when united to another which does
not neutralize it. Oxamide, however, and many other so-called ammonia
compounds are not alkalies, although all alkalies derived from the vegetable
kingdom appear to be obtained through the medium of ammonia.

   The recent researches, however, of Wiirtz and Hofmann bid fair to rid us
of these three classes of bodies. They have shown, for instance, that many
compounds termed amides are nothing more than replacements of one of the
hydrogen atoms present in ammonia by various hydrocarbons, and that
imides and nitriles are often formed by the substitution, the first of two, the
latter of three atoms, of an organic base for the hydrogen of the ammonia.

   That the vegetable alkalies, indeed, using the term in its stricter and more
ordinary sense, are thus formed, seems now in a manner demonstrated ; but
before we allow ourselves to substitute the term alkali for the three classes
under consideration, it must be shown on the one hand that all organic
bodies possessing alkaline properties are formed in this manner, and on the
other, that all amides, imides, and nitriles possess alkaline properties.

   The existence of acid-amides would not in itself militate against this
view, as the chemical relations maj' in them be determined by the acid pre-
sent, but whether other exceptions may not occur in the way of such a ge-
neralization must be left for further inquiries to decide. At any rate it
deserves to be considered, whether the bodies of the class known as Ureas, a
term which has been extended from the animal excretion so designated to
other bodies possessed of an analogous composition to it, and therefore to
bodies isomeric with the alkaline cyanates, are to be ranked under this same

head.

Their analogy of constitution to that of the vegetable alkalies may be seen

by comparing the composition of normal urea, as well as of aniline urea, with

that of the bodies we have been considering.

HOUrea is often represented as C^NO,  + NH^; and aniline-urea is shown

H0NOby Hofmann to have the composition of C'^       + C- H'N, or of cyanate

of aniline.

But the former may be regarded as composed of two atoms of ammonia

conjoined, in each of which one atom of hydrogen is replaced by CO, forming

as it were a double carbamide, viz.

                         NH
                           H

                   CO                = N2H*Ci02;

                 NH
                     H
                               i

and in like manner aniline-urea as

can be referred to this same class.    They are analogous, indeed, to urea, if
this body be regarded as
                                            C* N O + HO + NH^
                   Cyanate of ammonia

but not to the alkaloids, if the latter be represented as replacements of hy-

drogen atoms by hydrocarbons.

  --Alcohols. The term alcohol, although applied to a number of bodies,

whose physical properties deviate widely from those of the substance which

it was originally meant to signify, is a convenient expression for a class be-

--longing, chemically speaking, to a common type whether we regard them

with Liebig as the hydrated oxides of a hydrocarbon ; with Dumas as dif-
fering from their respective ethers simply by the addition of a second atom

of water ; or with Gerhardt as a cluster of atoms, the arrangement of which

is unknown to us, but which possess in common the property of being meta-
morphosed into a carburet of hydrogen, by abandoning the elements of one
equivalent of water ; and into a monobasic acid, by the substitution of two

atoms of oxygen for two of hydrogen.
   Although not more than six or seven of such bodies have as yet been dis-

covered, there seems a probability that we may eventually be able to form as
many as shall be equal in number to the vegetable acids already recognized,
and hence a particular name for the class in general seems indispensable.

 --Aldehydes. I am not aware of any objection that applies to the next
--class that of aldehydes, which, designating in the first instance the substance

prepared by the abstraction of two atoms of hydrogen from wine-alcohol, is

intended to stand as a generic term for all bodies similarly constituted.

    It ought therefore, as it might seem, to take in the essential oil of bitter

almonds C* H^ O^ which by the addition of O^ is converted into benzoic

acid, as .well as the analogous compounds derived from salicine, from cinna-

mile, and from cuminile, each of which gives rise to a corresponding acid.

    Thus, essential oil of

       Almonds  C* H^ +O^ O^ produces Benzoic acid.

       Spirsea  +O*Yi^"-0* 0^ ,, Salicylic acid.

       Cinnamon.. ..C'8H╗6 02 + 02 ,, Cinnamic acid.

       Cumin    +C^o H^-* O^ O^ ,, Cuminic acid.

In none of these cases, however, have the corresponding alcohols been

discovered, and hence it will be seen that in Turner's Chemistry they are

referred to the class of hydrurets, being considered as compounds of the or-
ganic radical, benzoyle C"H*0-, with 1 of hydrogen. The chemist, how-

ever, will have to take his choice of these two views, for he cannot without

confusion adopt both ; aldehydes in one sense being hydrurets, and hydru-

--rets in another putting in a claim to be regarded as aldehydes.
   Ethers. I next proceed to the class called ethers, a name originally ap-

plied to the peculiar volatile fluid produced by the action of sulphuric acid

upon wine-alcohol. Here, however, a considerable confusion has been

created by placing under the same head bodies connected together by a very

vague analogy.

Whether, indeed, we regard sulphuric ether as the oxide, or as the hydrate

of a hydrocarbon ; or whether, discarding theory, we simply state it as
the product of the union of an alcohol with an acid, accompanied by the

elimination of the elements of water ; it will be found that this generic term

has been extended beyond the strict limits of its definition.

Chemists, indeed, in general seem to consider it sufficient to place all those

bodies, the basis of which is an ether, under the head of compound ethers

1851.                                                          K

forgetting, that on the one hand, the greater part of those classed under the

latter head differ from the simple ethers, as much as the class of alkalies does
from that of neutral salts ; and that on the other, bodies of the same compo-
sition as the so-called compound ethers, such as the xanthic acid, consisting

of two atoms of sulphuret of carbon united to sulphuric ether, 2CS'--l-AeO,

--are referred by them to a different head the groundwork of the classification

being thus shifted from the composition of the body to its chemical pro-

perties.

   One is also at a loss to draw a line between a compound ether. . AeO-l-a;

and sulphovinic acid                                             iHoX

Indeed sulphovinic acid, instead of being excluded from the class of ethers,

would seem to be the only known body to which the term sulphuric ether

can properly be applied.

In short, if the term, compound ether, be retained at all, it should be re-

stricted to bodies like those produced by Williamson, in which a simple ether

is united with an ether radical, as the oxide of ethyl with methyl or with

amyl, constituting what he calls two and three carbon ethers, according to
the number of atoms of carbon present.

I do not cavil with such a mode of distinguishing these several compounds

but as the same nomenclature would be applicable to the simple ethers as well

as to those which he describes, it would seem preferable to call them by the
name of compound ethers, adding the specific term indicating the number

of atoms of carbon present in them, as a method of distinction.

There is likewise another cause of confusion traceable to the use of the

term ether for the oxides alike of methyl and amyl, as well as for those of

the ethyl series.

Hence, when nitric, carbonic, acetic, benzoic ethers are spoken of, we are

left in doubt as to the class meant to be expressed, whether it be an acetate,

or other salt, of methyl, of ethyl, or of amyl.

I therefore approve of the method of naming, already practised with

regard to certain of these compounds, and would extend the same to all,
calling them respectively

                                   And in like manner

Chloride of ethyl.                 Chloride of methyl;
Bromide of ethyl.

Nitrate of oxide of ethyl.         Sulphate of oxide of methyl.

Hyponitrate of oxide of ethyl.     Benzoate of oxide of methyl.

Sulphocarburet of oxide of ethyl.

Acetate of oxide of ethyl.         Acetate of oxide of methyl.

And so with the rest,

--Cetone. This term, improperly, as -I conceive, changed to Ketone, has been

applied to a class of bodies, formed like acetone by exposing to heat an an-
hydrous salt of some one of the fatty acids with lime or barytes, such as the

acetate, butyrate, benzoate, margarate, or stearate of these bases.

   Under such circumstances the acid parts with one atom of carbon and with
two of oxygen, which form together an atom of carbonic acid. This com-

bines with the base, whilst the remaining atoms are driven off as acetone in
the form of vapour,

ON THE NOMENCLATURE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 131

the distillation of metacetonic or propionic acid, which he calls propione,

   Kane indeed has referred acetone to the class of alcohols, regarding it as
the hydrated oxide of his hypothetical radical mesytyle ; but the mode of its
formation keeps it apart from the alcohol series, to w^hich indeed it would
be difficult in the present state of our knowledge to refer the other members
of this division, so that it would seem advisable that this name should be
retained for the entire class of organic compounds which are framed in the

manner represented.

  --Glycerides. This is another series of organic compounds which deserves

our notice, including most of the fixed oils. They are essentially composed
of some acid of the description called fatty, and of the oxide of a base called

Glycerine.
   Although they are in fact neutral salts, yet the peculiarity of their phy-

sical characters, and their frequent occurrence throughout both kingdoms of

--organic nature, appear to render a distinct term for them advisable.
   Neutral Bodies. I do not know that chemical writers have as yet suc-
ceeded in establishing any other well-defined groups for the multiform pro-
ducts of the vegetable world, except it be that extensive one consisting of
bodies commonly designated as neutral or indifferent, and composed of car-
bon with a certain number of atoms of water, or at least of oxygen and
hydrogen in the proportions that form that fluid.

   These in consequence possess much of a common character, and are often
convertible one into the other, the diiferences between them being rather

structural than chemical, and their affinities being less intense than those of

bodies which belong to any of the preceding classes.

                     Part II.

On the Terminations of the Words designating the Members of each Class.

Most chemists have found it convenient to denote bodies which belong to

the same class by words terminating alike, although Gerhardt in his classifi-

cation of organic compounds has neglected this principle, inasmuch as he

gives to the general terms indicative of classes the same termination, and

moreover places under each head bodies terminating very differently.

   Of the terminations commonly understood to designate the members of

--particular classes, the most unexceptionable perhaps are, 1st, the termina-

tion yle for the compound radicals, methyle, ethyle, amyle, benzoyle, &c.

and as the above has been assigned to the bodies possessing the atomic con-

stitution assigned to the organic radicals by Liebig, namely C« H^ with the

superaddition of two or more multiples of C' H', it may prevent confusion

to adopt the termination ene or en for those hydrocarbons with an equal num-

ber of atoms of carbon and hydrogen which Dumas used to regard as the

HSreal organic radicals ; thus etherene will be a compound of C*  methylene

of C* H-, and other compounds with an analogous constitution will terminate

in the same manner.

The termination ine is reserved for the vegetable alkalies, or for bodies

possessing properties of at least an analogous nature.

Thus strychnine, morphine, nicotine, as well as isotine, aniline, and even

kreatinine, cholesterine, &c. belong to this group.

                                                        K2
--132 REPORT 1851.

   It may be doubtful whether kreatine, not being alkaline, is strictly entitled

to this termination, and at any rate it should be understood, that it is to be re-

stricted to bodies containing nitrogen ; thus the ethers are rightly excluded,

because although possessing basic properties, the absence of nitrogen is

attended with properties of quite a different nature.

Dr. Hofmann, whose most valuable researches on the nature of the vege-

table alkalies have added so much to the number of these bodies, proposes

to designate them by terms constructed out of those which signify the hydro-

carbons present in each.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and when all the three atoms of hydrogen are replaced, we should be com-

pelled to adopt words of the truly formidable length of methylethylophenyl-

amine.

   I would suggest to the distinguished author, who amidst the herculean
labours of unravelling these intricate combinations, may have wanted time to
bestow upon so subordinate a point as their nomenclature, whether his names
may not be conveniently abridged by using only the first syllable of that ex-
pressive of the organic radicals which replace the hydrogen atoms.

                         Thus let meth stand for methyl,

                            eth ethyl,

                            am amyl,

                            chl*     chlorine,

                            br bromine,

                            nitr     nitric acid,

                            phe      phenyl

adding in the five former cases to the end the next vowel, when the succeed-
ing syllable begins with a consonant, and in the last the next consonant, when

the succeeding syllable begins with a vowel.

   In this manner it will rarely happen that the number of syllables of which
the word consists can exceed six, as will be seen by the following table :

Symbol.  Common Name.                   Hofmann's Name.  Abbreviation proposed.

   * Some may prefer the abbreviation chlor for chlorine, and brom for bromine. This
change however will involve the use of an additional syllable, whenever the next substance
expressed begins with a consonant : thus chlophenamine would be chlorophenamine, brophe-
namine, bromophenaraine, &c. The advantage in point of perspicuity will therefore have to be

balanced against the inconvenience of increasing still further the length of words, often of

necessity extended already to the limits of ready utterance. When however nitrous acid

is the replacing body, the introduction of a second syllable to indicate its presence cannot

well be avoided, for ni alone might stand for several other substances.

   If we restrict the termination amine to the alkalies artificially produced by

replacing one or more of the hydrogen atoms of ammonia with a hydro-
carbon, and retain that of ine for those resulting from natural processes, and
--134 REPORT 1851.

only eliminated by art, we shall mark in this manner the distinction between
bodies, which though often isomeric are not identical.

  NHThus the compound artificially produced, which consists of

may be called methypheimmine ; whilst the principle extracted from oil of
tolu, which is found to have the same composition, may retain its name of

toluidine. The dissimilarity in properties between these isomeric bodies

renders a different name for the two indispensable.
    Analogy therefore might perhaps lead us to assign to Fownes's artificial

alkali, furfurine, the name of furfui amine, although its composition is more
complicated than that of Hofmann's alkaloids, as it contains oxygen
(CsoNФH'2 06).

   No such change would be warrantable in the names of bodies, like kreatine,

kreatinine, thialdine, &c., which, even if entitled to their present designations,

as they contain nitrogen, and the two latter at least possess decided basic pro-
perties, bear little resemblance to the vegetable alkaloids, and can neither be

referred to the class of amides, according to the old theory, nor yet be resolved

into substitutions of hydrocarbons for hydrogen, agreeably to the views of

Hofmann.
   But how are we to deal with bodies which, like oxamide, bioxamide, &c,,

though artificially produced in the same manner as the bodies we have been
considering, do not, nevertheless, possess alkaline properties? For them
I would propose to retain the received name of amides ; only as the distiuc-
tipn between amides, imides and nitriles, seems now to point to an exploded
theory, it would be better to extend to them the same principle of nomen-
clature as that adopted by Dr. Hofmann, namely, that of calling the com-

pound in which 2 atoms of benzoyle are substituted for 2 of hydrogen, not,

as Laurent has done, henzimide, but d'lbenzamide ; and if one were discovered
in which 3 atoms were so introduced, to name it tnhenzamide, and so with

the rest.

Mr. Robson, indeed, in a late communication to the Chemical Society, has

already pointed out a compound which he terms dibenzoylimide, but this has

H"the composition of C^s  NO^, or NH3+2C"HФ0-. It is therefore an

ammoniacal compound of benzoyle, and not an amide.

Some chemists have adopted a still more abbreviated form of expression, by

attaching the termination am, with the name of the combining body prefixed,

to indicate such compounds.
   Thus hemidam has been used to designate aniline ; melam for the com-

pound of ammonia with mellon, in the proportion of three of the former to

two of the latter. Nothing, however, is gained in point of convenience by

adopting the former term, in compensation for the confusion which its use

would introduce; for phenamine is as concise a term as benzidam, and cer-
tainly more euphonious ; but melam belongs altogether to another series,

since in it the mellon does not replace the hydrogen atoms of ammonia, but
unites with ammonia as such, in the proportion of 2 to 3 :

ON THE NOMENCLATURE OP ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 135

   Laurent has proposed to give the termination se to those bodies which are
formed from a hydrocarbon by the substitution of some element for one or
more of the hydrogen atoms present in the original compound. To these
letters he prefixes one or other of the vowels, according to the number of
atoms so replaced, a being used when only 1 atom of the new ingredient is
introduced, e when 2 atoms, i when 3, and so on, till the whole number of
vowels is exhausted ; after which the series recommences by prefixing the

syllable al to the vowel.

   Thus, from naphthaline, C*^ H*, he derives,

Chlornaphthase C* H^ CI,
Chlornaphthese C^ H6 C%
Chlornaphthise C^ H* C*, and so on ; but
Chlornaphthalese is C^ H^ CP.

   Other refinements upon this mode of nomenclature are proposed in
M. Laurent's various papers, and well deserve the attention of those who

follow up similar tracks of research.
   The termination al has been appropriated to combinations into which

aldehyde enters as a constituent, or which are derived from that body. It

may be right, however, to point out, that many substances bound together by

a very loose analogy are thus embraced.

Thus chlora/ is aldehyde in which the 3 hydrogen atoms are replaced by

HOO +3 of chlorine. C* H^  becomes C* Cl^ O + HO.

Aceta^, on the contrary, is aldehyde united with oxide of ethyl.

                    C* H* O' aldehyde
                    C* H5 O' oxide of ethyl

                        H' O' water

                    C8 H9 03 acetal

whilst the analogous compound of aldehyde with ammonia is called simply

aldehydammonia.

The term ethane, in like manner, comprises compounds of which ether

forms a part ; but it should be confined to those into which an acid does not

enter as a constituent, since in the latter cases the nomenclature of the salts

may be preferable.

Thus urethane may be retained as the name for a compound of urea and

carbonic ether, or the carbonate of oxide of ethyl, its composition being

                    Urea   HC * * O* N^

                    2 Carbonic ether. . C" H"> O^

                           Ci2Hi*08NФ

But it would seem better to designate the substance called oxamethane, by
the term oxamate of oxide of ethyl

                    Oxamic acid. . C* H^ N' O*

                    Ether  C^ H^ O^

                           CФ H7 N' 06

and oxamethylane by that of the oxamate of oxide of methyl.
   In this manner we shall also avoid the confusion that may arise between

names so related as oxamethylane and oxamethane, the former indicating

the oxamate of methyle, the latter that of ethyle.

   I am unable to attach any definite meaning to the termination an, by
which certain organic compounds connected with urea are now designated.

    Alloxan, one of them, is regarded as an acid, the erythric of Brugnatelli.

Murexan may probably be a salt of cyanoxalic acid and ammonia; but not-
--136 REPORT 1851.

withstanding the researches of Liebig and Wohler, the true relations of their

bodies one to the other still appear obscure.

   The termination one appropriately denotes bodies formed from vegetable
acids by the abstraction of 1 atom of carbonic acid, and should be reserved
for this same description of bodies ; but the use of the analogous termination
ole for those formed by the abstraction of 2 atoms of carbonic acid from the
same may be apt to cause some ambiguity. Thus we use the terms benzofe,
pheno/e, and aniso/e, as being derived respectively from the benzoic, salicy-

lic, and anisic acids.

Benzole  C'^ H^ + C^ O* forming benzoic acid C* H^ 0*.

+Phenole ... C'2H6 02 CФ0* ,, salicylic ,, C* H^ O^.

Anisole.. ..C'<H8 0"-+C2 0* ,,  anisic ,, C'Ф H8 Qs.

   But unfortunately the same termination, or one so similar as to be easily
confounded with it, has been applied to bodies of an entirely different com-
position, in order to indicate that they belong to the class of oils. Thus ben-
zoilo/ is the name given by some to the essential oil of bitter almonds;
cinnamoZ to the oil of cinnamons, and so with the rest.

   It would seem better that these latter names should be abandoned, and
that the termination ole should be applied only to bodies formed in the same
manner as benzole and its analogues.

    The above remarks and suggestions in relation to the classification and
nomenclature of organic compounds, crude as they may appear in the eyes of
chemists more thoroughly versed in the subject than myself, will not be
altogether thrown away, if they only serve to stimulate others to make it the
subject of their consideration, and thus lead to the establishment of more
precise and convenient terms of art. Some indeed may object that the whole
of this department of chemistry is at present in a transition state, and conse-
quently that no fixed rules, for classifying or naming the various products
that present themselves to us whilst investigating it, can as yet be laid down.
But the fact is, that we are compelled, whether we will or no, by the very
necessity of the case, to adopt a certain system of nomenclature whenever a
new body comes before us, and the only question is, whether this system
shall be consistent with itself, and shall convey a correct impression of the
relation in which, at the time of its discovery, we suppose the body to stand

with reference to others.

   It has been my endeavour, in the preceding remarks, to point out what
appear to me to be the views which have guided the most eminent chemical

authorities in the names they have thought proper to impose, and thus rather
to give expression to their ideas, than to advance any theories or methods of

my own invention.

    I would however submit to the chemists here assembled, whether the want
of precision which has been shown to exist in the application of those prin-

ciples of nomenclature to particular cases, does not suggest the expediency of
having the whole subject brought under revision by this Section, or by a
Committee appointed by it, and of having certain definite rules laid down by
their joint authority, in conformity with the usage, and in accordance with

the understood principles, of those great masters of chemical science to whom
we all look up in deference.

   In the mean time, I will, in conclusion, submit to the Section the few fol-

lowing directions, as calculated, in my humble opinion, to simplify the nomen-

clature of organic compounds, and therefore as worthy of adoption, at least
provisionally, in order to render it more expressive and perspicuous.

   1st. That in the case of bodies only known to be produced by artificial
          ON THE NOMENCLATURE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 137

processes, names should, if possible, be given them by putting together terms

expressive  of  the  several  constituents  which  contribute  to  form  them                          but  as
                                                                                                    ;

no name ought, for the sake of convenience, to exceed in length six or seven
syllables, the first syllable only of the vi^ord indicating each component part

should be introduced into that of the compound designated.

This principle I have endeavoured to carry out, in the modifications pro-

posed for the names given by Hofmann to the various substances, produced

by him through the replacement of atoms of hydrogen by hydrocarbons.
The necessity for such abbreviations will, I conceive, be the more felt, now

that iu the further prosecution of his researches no less than 4 atoms of

hydrogen have been so replaced*.

2nd. When, owing to the complicated nature of the body discovered, or to

the obscurity that hangs over its real nature, it seems impracticable to name

it on the plan above proposed, a word expressive of some obvious and

marked physical or chemical character should be selected, and one whose

Greek or Latin root may be readily apprehended.

   * I must confess myself quite unable to invent pronounceable names for such compounds,
if it be ruled, that they are to express, not merely the nature of the constituents, but likewise
the origin or mode of fonnation attributed to each.

   Provided the latter condition be waved, I do not despair of assigning to them terms little
more difficult to articulate than those proposed for the bodies described in Dr. Hofinann's
preceding papers. Should the alterations suggested be regarded as sinning against any un-
derstood Canons of Nomenclature, I see no alternative, but that of discarding names for these
new bodies altogether, and contenting ourselves vvith symbols ; for a word which cannot be
uttered, whilst it is iu no respect preferable to a symbol, is much less easily written ; and such
I apprehend to be the case with some of the terms which I have given below, and for which
therefore, I venture to propose the annexed substitutes :

   Thus mercaptan, kapnomor, pittacal, parabanic acid, allophanic ether,
seem for the above reasons objectionable ; whilst such terms as mellon, cre-
osote, glycerine, &c., are perhaps as good as could have been fixed upon under

the circumstances for the bodies so designated.

   3rd. That when the substance to be named has been produced by natural
processes, and only eliminated by art, a name expressive of its origin would
seem preferable to one taken from its composition.

   Hence not only should the tei-ms strychnine, nicotine, &c. be retained,
but even toluidine, xylidine, and cumidine, although apparently produced
by the replacement of hydrogen atoms, like the artificial compounds which
Hofmann has discovered, should be preferred to words indicative of their
component parts.

   4th. That in general bodies belonging to the same class, or formed accord-
ing to the same type, should preserve the same termination ; but that never-
theless when a body, long recognized and familiarly known to us, has been
shown to belong to a type to which a particular termination is assigned, it
may not be advisable to alter its recognized and received appellation, so as
to bring it into harmony with the rest.

   Thus the term urea should be retained unaltered, notwithstanding its
analogy in certain respects to the organic alkalies, which have the termina-
tion ine appropriated to them.

           On two unsolved Problems in Indo-German Philology.

                  By the Rev. J. W. Donaldson, B.D.

The science of Ethnography, which involves the arrangement and classifi-
cation of the different members of the human family, and explains their
common origin and casual juxtapositions, must be regarded as the most im-

portant accession to systematic knowledge which has been made in our time.
It is only recently that it has found a place among the subjects of inquiry
suggested to the British Association ; and until the present year it has been
entrusted to a subsection only. But if we estimate its value properly, and
consider the diversified range of study which it implies, and the vast number
of labourers who are contributing in different ways to lay the foundations of
this great edifice, we may fairly plead for a recognition of its right to a fore-
most place among those sciences which it is the design of this Association to
 advance. At any rate there is no branch of study which is more likely to
 profit by the retrospective surveys, for which an annual meeting like the
present furnishes so good an opportunity. For while no science is more
 steadily progressive than ethnography, and while none more rapidly accu-
 mulates the materials of induction, its encyclopedic range, and the want of
 communication between the many active minds engaged upon it, especially
necessitate a periodical report of its existing state, such as may suffice to in-
 dicate what has been really effected, and to point out the objects to which
the attention of inquirers may still be most profitably directed. At the
 present season, when the Great Exhibition in the metropolis has brought to
 our shores deputations from all the leading families of the Indo-European
 race, and when we are met near the East- Anglian coast, where Britain re-
 ceived the first instalments of that northern colony which gave a new name
 to our island and ingrafted on our language its most characteristic elements,
 it seems particularly incumbent upon us to look back on what has been
ON PROBLEMS IN INDO-GERMAN PHILOLOGY.  139

secured in the scientific classification of the race to which we belong, and to

indicate the outlying difficulties which invite the united efforts of modern

genius and learning.

   Those who have fully studied the subject will readily admit that the great

majority of questions raised by the various writers on Indo-Germanic ethno-
graphy have received satisfactory answers, and that our general results rest
on the solid basis of scientific certainty. There are, in fact, only two pro-
blems suggested by this subject which still demand an adequate solution
the amount and nature of the affinity which connects the Indo-Germanic and
Semitic branches of the human family, and the origin and interpretation of
the ancient Etruscan language. The difficulties occasioned by the Basque or
Euskarian language may be considered as having received at least an approx-
imate settlement, and it may be concluded generally that this isolated idiom
is due to a combination of the Celtic and Finnish elements, which form, either
separately or together, the outer fringe or hem of the population of Europe.
But the other two problems still require a scientific investigation. Indeed
it may be considered as the greatest reproach to modern scholarship that the
Etruscan language is little better known to us than it was to Dempster ; and
that while we can read the Cartouches of the Pharaohs, and interpret the
cuneiform records of Darius, we cannot come to any satisfactory result
respecting a language which was spoken by the immediate ancestors of
Maecenas, and which, long after the time of Pericles, was the vernacular
idiom of one of the most powerful and civilized of the nations of antiquity.

And with regard to the Semitic question, it is scarcely less strange that we

should still allow Rabbis and Talmudists to separate the language of the
Jews from that of the Greeks by a Chinese wall of demarcation, and that the
two adjacent sources, from which the streams of European civilization flowed
until they converged in one united channel of religious philosophy, should

still be referred to different hemispheres, and should be thought to present
indisputable marks of a diversity of origin.

    Having approached the discussion of these topics on various occasions,
and having surveyed them from different points of view, but always with a

tendency to the same result, I have thought that my best contribution to

this Meeting would be such a general statement of the conclusions at which
I have arrived as might tend to facilitate a mutual understanding between
myself and others who have not yet developed the direction of their researches

in the same field. For it appears to me to be one of the most important of
the objects of this Association to promote the intercourse of those who cul-

tivate science, and thus to substitute a systematic division of labour for that
purposeless repetition of the same exertions, which is the natural consequence
of unconnected inquiries.

    I have been led to include the two unsolved problems in Indo-Germanic
ethnography under one head, because I believe that one and the same channel
of investigation will conduct us to the proper issue in each case. The sci-

entific procedure, according to my view of the matter, will show that the

solution of both difficulties depends on a satisfactory definition of the Asiatic

starting-point and European limits of the Sclavonian emigration. And I

shall endeavour to show you that the first and last contacts of this great

-- --family of men, the extreme edges of this great stratum of population, fur-

nish us with the points of transition to the Syro- Arabian stock in general,
and to the Etruscan nation in particular.

    But I must begin with some principles of universal application, which

appear to me to be the axioms or postulates in every ethnological argument,
but which, I fear, are not sufficiently regarded as such. As the sum of our
--140 REPORT 1851.

 knowledge hitherto acquired tends to confirm our instinctive belief and almost
 universal tradition respecting the unity of the human race, it seems reason-
 able to start with the assumption that men cannot be divided into zoological
 genera ; and as every presumption is in favour of this axiom, we must leave
 the omis probandi, with regard to any other hypothesis, upon those who feel

 disposed to contradict us. For my own part, I confess I feel somewhat in-
 dignant when I fall in with an attempt to classify men according to the ex-

 ternal peculiarities of feature and colour. I consider it a degrading theory
 to maintain that man belongs to the merely animal kingdom at all ; and if in
 other departments of their own science naturalists would refuse to place in
 the same group, whether zoological or phytological, species which were not
 connected together by at least three marks of essential affinity, affecting their

absolute definition, I cannot understand why man, the only reasoning and
thinking being, should be placed by the side of those creatures, which cannot

reason or speak, merely on the strength of an outward analogy, which does
not in tlie slightest degree affect our distinctive attributes. Scientific eth-

nology seems to me to start from the postulate that our race is essentially
one, and accidentally different. In many cases, we can clearly trace the

causation of these differences to the influence of climate, aliment, and civi-
lization, and as they do not, in the widest and most pronounced form of dis-
crepancy, interfere with the definition of man, as such, it is surely unscientific
to make ethnography dependent in any way on the casualties of physical
conformation. Speaking with reference to the whole period of time which
must have elapsed since the establishment of our species on the surface of
this planet, we may say that the settlement of the Anglo-Saxons in North
America is an event of yesterday, and yet they already begin to exhibit
physical characteristics more akin to those of their neighbours than to those
of their ancestors. Peculiarities affecting the cellular substance and max-

illary process may place an almost Turanian stamp on a highly cultivated
United States man, who can discourse eloquently in the language of Shaks-
peare, who bears an English name, and exhibits in all his actions the energy

of that race which has spread its colonies over the whole world. Differences
of craniological structure and intellectual development must also be re-
garded as accidents perfectly consistent, not only with the aboriginal unity,

but also 'vith the present identity of men. May not the same family contain

an idiot and a philosopher ? Does not every family exhibit the gradation
of helpless infant, thoughtless boy, and mature man ? It is surely idle to
endeavour to classify the human race by distinctions which may be found in
the same household. The latest book* which has treated " the varieties
of man" as a branch of "natural history," arranges the population of the
world under three great subdivisions : the MongolidcB, corresponding mainly
to the Turanians; the AtlantidcB, including the Semitic race; and the

JapetidcB, who are identical with the Indo-Europeans. Now almost any
man's experience may convince him that hereditary civilization and similar

opportunities will place Jews and Gentiles, Mongolians and Indo-Germans,
on a footing of the most perfect equality. The Atlantid Toussaint was a
match for his Japhetic antagonists ; the Mongolian Kossuth has held his own
in European statesmanship ; and on the battle-field of Austerlitz the same
military talents were displayed by Miloradowitch, who was a Servian and
therefore of the purest Indo-German stock, by Bagration, who was a Geor-
gian prince, and thei-efore of Mongol extraction, and by Soult, who, according
to DTsraeli, derived his origin from the Semitic Jews.

   As then a difference of climate and aliment is calculated to produce, in

                                                         * Dr. Latham's.
                         ON PROBLEMS IN INDO-GERMAN PHILOLOGY.  141

the same race and within a limited time, striking bodily distinctions, and as,

on the contrary, similarity of culture and habits seems to cause, in different

races, an identity of craniologlcal structure and intellectual development,

it is clear that ethnography, as the science which treats of the different fa-

milies into which mankind are divided, and accounts for their distribution

over the surface of the globe, cannot be satisfied with the results of physio-

logical investigation. The comparative anatomy of the different races of

men is not at all calculated to explain the facts of our science or to assist

us in forming our classification. Interesting on its own account, as an im-

portant branch of pathology, it is useful to the ethnographer only as removing

the difficulties by which he would otherwise be encumbered. It is our

projjer business to show why a nation or people, having its own peculiar

modification of language, came to be settled in a particular locality, and in

Nowwhat manner it is related to the contiguous tribes.     it is obvious that

there can be but four elements in such an inquiry as this. (1.) Our first and
most important step is to examine philologically the language of the tribe;

(2.) the ancient designation of the people, and the names of persons and

places within the district, furnish us with additional materials of the same

kind                     (3.) the knowledge thus acquired is to be compared with any historical
                      ;

traditions which may be available ; and (4.) the final test is supplied by phy-

sical or descriptive geography. To take a simple and easy example : the

district called Hungary is mainly occupied by the Magyars, who are distin-

guished by their language from the German, Sclavonian and Wallachian

tribes with which they are intermixed. It is by their language that we per-

ceive their ethnical identity with the Laplanders of the North and with the

Bashkirs of the South. The names of their nobles, of their cities, and of

their rivers and plains, show to what an extent they have superseded or

yielded to conterminous influences. Their history gives a distinct account

of their immigration, and the geographical conformation of the country which

they occupy shows how they originally entered it by the outlet of the
Danube, and how their ulterior development was controlled by natural ob-

stacles. The same process might be applied in eveiy case ; and thus, while

the facts are established by a philological investigation of the language

spoken and of the names imposed, these facts are explained and accounted

for by the results of our historical and geographical knowledge. If we desire

to ascertain the origin of any branch of the great human family, this is the
only course which we can pursue, and if we have access to all four sources

of information, the result is safe and satisfactory. It rarely happens that any

further light is derived from the observation of physical peculiarities. Ex-

cept as an evidence of hereditary descent, within narrow limits and without

the operation of climatologic peculiarities, an appeal to physiology is super-

fluous. If ethnography can solve the problems which it undertakes, it must

do so without the aid of the anatomist, and we should only complicate our
difficulties, if we allowed the precarious and casual to take the place of that

which is a proper and essential element in our inquiries.

Under these circumstances, we cannot too soon relinquish, as unscientific,

the attempt to classify mankind by the accidents of physical conformation.

Differences of race are not regulated or explained by differences in the

parietal diameter of the cranium, or in the maxillary process, or in the pelvis,

any more than by varieties in the colour of the hair and skin. To separate men

into different groups according to their outward distinctions, which do not

affect the essential characteristics of our race, is not less puerile than the
prima fade classification, which gives rise to the earliest nomenclature in the
142 REPORT 1851.

natural history of lower animals. There some one prominent quality is

grasped by the mind, and an attributive noun is formed, which, so far from

defining the species, is often equally applicable to animals of the most different

Wegenera.     smile when we are told that theyba;, the stoat, and the lobster,

are designated in Old English by a common name referring to the wideness

of the tail. But surely this is only the same process as that which induces

us to distinguish the human race into great families by a reference to external

characteristics, many of which may be exhibited by the different members

of the same family, and all of which may exist, at least in approximate forms,

in members of the same national tribe. Scientific classification ought to be

regulated by (he most advanced results of our knowledge, and not by the

vague impressions resulting from our first cursory observations. Imperfect
science, like imperfect manhood, dwells upon differences long before it can
perceive resemblances. It is the business of the matured intellect to find

the common element by which classes are linked together, and to subordinate

the multiform exterior to the unity which reigns within. If this is true in
all cases, it is so especially when we have to do with man, whose essential
definition is independent of his external frame. The instinct which convinces

us that our race constitutes one family, dispersed indeed by emigration, but

connected with one home by a common pedigree, is confirmed by all access-

ible knowledge, and it seems that no ethnographical classification can be
permanently satisfactory, unless it recognises this primeval unity, and con-
trasts it with the subsequent process of separation and dispersion. As the
evidences furnished by language, tradition, and physical geography all point
to Armenia as the first cradle of the human race, it would seem to be most
scientific to contrast the original nucleus, which formed itself in this region,

and more gradually expanded itself in massive outpourings, with the scat-

tered offshoots which were always dispersing themselves in scanty streams of

Werestless wanderers.  shall thus find two great subdivisions of the popu-
--lation of the world the central and the sporadic. The former will include

the Jndo- Germanic race, which extended itself from Iran to India on the

one side, and on the other side peopled the whole of Europe : and the Semitic

race, which after having reached the highest pitch of civilization in Syria

and Egypt, pushed forward its undulations of decreasing intelligence until it

had covered the whole of Africa. All the rest of the world, the north and
east of Asia, America, and the intervening islands are peopled by branches of
the sporadic race, more or less connected with the Eastern or Iranian group.

Among the various advantages of this classification, I may mention that it not

only represents the present results and obvious tendencies of our researches,
but is also conformable to our daily experience. For the world is still but par-
tially peopled, and still exhibits itself as a central mass, sending forth spo-

radic ramifications of colonies. And even if we were to discover reasons,
much more convincing than any which have as yet been produced, in favour

of the Polyadamism of our race, nothing can alter the fact that there has been
a centre and starting-point of human civilization, and that the cradle of the
Semitic and Indo- Germanic families has sent forth those tribes, whose history

is that of the world.

   However, it is not my purpose on the present occasion to pursue these
general reasonings any farther. I may be content to refer to what I have
elsewhere written on the subject. And I shall proceed at once to my im-

mediate object, namely, to the indications of the important conclusions

deducible from a more accurate survey of the first and last contacts of the

Sclavonians.
ON PROBLEMS IN INDO-GKRMAN PHILOLOGY.       143

   It can scarcely be necessary to trouble this Association with prolix details
respecting the Indo-Germanic family. For the sake of method and clearness,

however, I must recapitulate the main facts of the case.
   The district called Iran, which we must regard with filial respect as the

birthplace of our race, and with lively political interest as the western
limit of our eastern empire, may be defined generally as the plateau which
is bounded by the sea on the south, and by the Tigris, the Oxus, and
the Indus on the other three sides. These great rivers are however only a

part of the fences by which it is enclosed on the land side. On the north the

Caspian and Aral seas, together with long ridges of mountains, the offshoots

of the Himalayas, form a cordon more or less difficult of transit. And to
the east, more than one rocky range, now advancing to the Indus, now

receding from it, and penetrated only by passes white with the bones of
slaughtered armies, stand fast as a natural wall not easily surmounted by

those who would sally forth from the Sindian plains.
   Within these limits sprang up, side by side, the different members of that

great Iranian or Indo-German race, with the subdivisions of which I am now

concerned. One band after another of hardy and enterprising emigrants

escaped from the comparatively narrow limits of this plateau, and carried

their high courage and intellectual capabilities to be strengthened and in-

creased under the bracing influences of the climate of Europe. Among

themselves and within the limits of Iran they were known by different names,
just as brothers are distinguished from brothers; they had also marked di-

stinctions of moral and speculative qualities, just as the children of one parent

may differ from one another in these respects. According to their different

characteristics were their different destinies, which they have all fulfilled

according to the original pattern.

   Omitting the desert interior of the Iranian plateau, we may divide its an-

cient population into the four following groups : the Persians or Germanians
who abutted on the Persian Gulf and Sea and looked towards Arabia ; the
Medes or Matians, who extended from the Caspian until they reached the

Persian borders ; the Sacce, who extended from Khorassan to Bokhara ; and
the Arians, who spread themselves from Hinduh-kuh over the mountains

which look down upon the Indus and its tributaries. It is the consistent

result of all ethnographic speculations that the conquerors of the Punjab and

Hindostan, to whom we owe the Pali and Sanscrit languages, belonged to

this last branch of the Iranian stock ; and it is equally clear that the di-

stinctive elements of the population of Europe are traceable to the other

three branches.

   The Turanian and Celtic races, to whom we undoubtedly owe the first

beginnings of the population of Europe, have been extruded to the uttermost

parts of the continent, and are so overruled by and intermixed with sub-

sequent importations of ethnical ingredients, that they may be and usually

are omitted in a general survey of the Indo-Germanic race. Indeed, if we

except the comparatively modern settlements of the Ugro-Tatarians in Hun-

gary, and of the Turco-Tatarians in Macedonia and Greece, we must divide

--the whole population of Europe into three and only three classes the Scla-

Avonians, whom we will call ; the Low- Germans, Goths or Saxons, B ; and

Athe High- Germans, or Herminones, C. Of these it is clear that class en-

tered Europe first, and that throughout the greater part of the district where

it is now found, it escaped all mixture with the subsequent bands of emi-

grants from Iran, In ancient Greece and Italy the fusion in different pro-

A+C A +portions of  B gave rise to the Pelasgo-Hellenic and Pelasgo-
and

A +Umbrian races, and a similar mixture of  B in the north of Europe

constituted the Lithuanian people. Among the Teutonic tribes there are
frequent compounds of B and C, but the Scandinavian tribes exhibit the

Low-Germans, or class B, in the purest form. It is the intention of the

following pages to use the distinction between the Scandinavian and pure

Sclavonian languages for the purpose of resolving into its separate elements

the Italian compound of the two which has caused so much difficulty to phi-

lologers. But in the first place I must consider the Asiatic contacts of the

Sclavonian race, and the problem, which is suggested and solved by these

juxtapositions.

Schafarik has shown that the earliest names under which the Sclavonian

race is recognised in Europe are the appellation of Wends, Winden, O.-H.-G.
Winidd, A.-S. Veonodas, which was given to them by their German neigh-

bours, and the title of Servians, Serbs, Sorbs, which they bestowed upon

themselves. It is of no avail for the purposes of ethnography to examine

the name which this race received from their neighbours, but it is interesting
to inquire why they called themselves Servians. From a comparison of the

forms Sermende, Sirmien, with others in which the b is changed into m,

Grimm {Gesch. d. deutschen Sprache, p. 172) is disposed to recognise the
root Serb' in the name of the ancient Sartnatians. I consider this latter
word as a compound, and shall discuss its meaning by and by. Schafarik, who
does not now admit the Sclavonian affinities of the Sarmatians (Slawiscke
Alterthiimer, i. p. 333, seq. ed. Wuttke), connects the ethnic name Servian
with the Russ. jaaseri =z puer, privignus, PoL pasierb, which he identifies with

pastorek, pasterka=privignus, the t in the latter being an arbitrary insertion,

as in strjbro for srebro ^= argentum, &c., so that pa-ser-b and pa-ser-k differ

only in the formative affix, and the two words fall into an equality with one

=another and with the S&nscT. paser puer, Pers. puser, Pehlevi poser, &c.
=The root then is that of the Sanscr. su generare, and the meaning of the

ethnical name Serb is merely " natio, gens," after the analogy of the term

Deutsch, Thiotisk, derived from the Gothic thidda=^gens {Slatv. Alterth. i.

p. 178-180). This appears tome very vague etymology, and I have no he-

sitation in proposing another derivation, which, though it ultimately falls

back on the same root, presents it under a special form and not in a mono-

syllable, which, as Grimm says, might be the mother of every word beginning

with the letter s. The old gloss of the Mater Verborum, published by

Schafarik and Palacky, in Die dltesten Denhndler der Bohmischen Sprache,

contains the following definition, p. 225 [303] : " Sr'bi, Sarmate si7bi turn

Nowdicti a serendo i. quasi sirbtiim."    the earliest notice which we have

respecting the Sclavonians is the statement of Procopius (B. Goth. iii. c. 14.

p. 498) that their ancient name was STropot, which he refers to the fact that

Wethey were a-Kopah^v lii.a^r]vi)ixkvoi.  cannot doubt that SttcJ/jos involves

a metathesis of the genuine Serb or Sorb, and it is equally obvious that this
metathesis was occasioned by a wish to make the word correspond in Greek

to the meaning which Procopius had heard attached to it. But there is no
reason whatever for supposing that the metaphor, involved in the Greek
adverb and in the name of the scattered islands of the ^gean, was also

common in the old Sclavonian idiom. On the contrary, the analogy of other

Sclavonian gentile names would show that the word would designate them

by their employment, or by the physical features of the locality, and that

they might be called "sowers," i.e. "agriculturists," as occupiers of the
plains, in contrast to their neighbours, just as the Chorwats got this name
from being mountaineers, and just as the Pomerajiians were so called from
living on the sea. Thus the name Serb will correspond in effect to that of

Pole, the latter denoting the plains in which the agriculturists were settled,
       ON PROBLEMS IN INDO-GERMAN PHILOLOGY.     145

and the former indicating their usual occupation. The name Sclavonian,

Sloio-ja7ie, Sloio-jene, has generally been derived, either from s/Ф?<7a, 'glory,'

=and so considered as synonymous with slawetnj gloriosi, laicdabiles, celebres,

or else from slotvo, 'a word,' in which case it would signify the o/.i6yXwTroi,

Sermonales, articulateiy-speaking natives, as opposed to the Nemj, Nemci,

' dumb,' /japjSapoi, or unintelligible foreigners. Instead of these compli-

mentary derivations, Schafarik now proposes {Slmo. Alterth. ii. p. 42 foil.)
to consider the word as a local title, like the other words in -a7ie or -ene, and

would rather derive it from the geographical name Sloioi/, which he would

connect with sallmca, ' an island,' ' meadow,' or ' holm,' so that the Sloivjanin

would be the ' islanders,' with reference perhaps to the marshes which sur-

Arounded their original settlements.  comparison ofsrebro with silver might

even suggest the possibility of identifying the roots xerb and slaiv. At any

rate it is clear that when the wars of the ninth and tenth centuries furnished

an abundance of Sclavonians as prisoners and captives, the German names

for these unhappy persons were indifferently Slave and (Sly?;/", a circumstance
which indicates a widely-spread identity of ethnical designation.

    That the ancient Saiiromatce or Sarmatians wei'e ethnologically identical

with the Sclavonians appears to me to be certain. The grounds on which

Schafarik has maintained tiie contrary opinion do not amount to a valid ar-
gument. It is quite possible that the ancients may have used the term Sar-
matian in a lax and vague manner, and may have classed with the Scla-

vonian tribes, to whom this name belonged, some others which were more

or less connected with different branches of the Indo-German family. For
example, the title seems to have included the Lithuanians, who were Scla-
vonized Low-Germans belonging to the great stock of the Getas. In the

same way, the term Scythian is extended so as to include, not only the Sar-

matian tribes, but also others of Gothic and Turanian origin. It is quite

clear, indeed it is generally admitted, that the Sarmatians, as such, were

Sclavonians, and, as Grimm has observed (Gesch. d.deulschen Spr. p. 173),

if the Sarmatian word ft'pts, given by Lucian in his Toxaris (40), can be
shown to be Sclavonian, this alone would settle the point. Schafariii himself
admits (p. 370), that many of the Sarmatian proper names betray a Scla-
vonian origin. The question is one of considerable importance ; for if the

universal belief, that the Sclavonians and Sarmatians are identical, be allowed

to hold its ground, we can trace the Sclavonian migration from Iran through

all its stages, until we get back to the original starting-point. Every au-
thority concurs in assigning a Median origin to the Sauromatce, and according

to Gatterer's etymology, which is generally received, the name itself signifies
" the Northern Mateni or Medes." One of their tribes was called Ixa-matce
or laxa-matce, i. e. " Medes from the laxartes or Oxus." And thus we can

lay down the route of the Sclavonian population from the borders of Assyria

through Media and Hyrcania, round the eastern shores of the Caspian and

Aral seas, across the Tanais, and so on, until we find them extending from

the Baltic to the Adriatic.

   Now if we can identify the Sclavonians with that branch of the great

Iranian family which occupied Media, it will follow that their language, in
its oldest form, must furnish the point of contact between the Indo-Germanie

and Semitic idioms. And I proceed to indicate some of the important in-
ferences which may be drawn from the comparison thus suggested.

   The researches of Col. Rawlinson may be regarded as supplying us with
at least prima facie evidence of the fact that the language of the ancient

Assyrians and Babylonians was in the same syntactical or disintegrated con-

dition as the Hebrew and other Semitic dialects. He seems to have recog-

1851.                                         L
--146 REPORT 1851.

nised a definite article, prepositional determinatives of the oblique cases,
personal pronouns prefixed rather than affixed to the verb-form, and even

the peculiar modifications which are generall)'^ known as conjugational
varieties of the Semitic verb. On the other hand, it has long been an
opinion maintained by ancient orientalists that the Chaldceans, Kasdim, or
Kurds, were an Indo-German tribe who descended from their mountains and
conquered the plains of Mesopotamia about the time of the Prophet Isaiah.
Michaelis and Reinhold Forster have gone so far as to claim for them a
Sclavonian affinity, and Gesenius, who rejects this hypothesis, still connects
them with the Medo-Persians. But if they were of the Median stock, they
were also Sarmatian or Sclavonians. And thus, starting from two opposite
points of view, we come to the same conclusion, and find the Indo-Germans
and Semites in close contact, if not intermingled with one another, on the
banks of the Tigris. Every step which we take in the way of induction

confirms our d-priori reasoning, and the internal evidences of language en-
able us to arrive at a demonstrative result.

   The distinctive characteristics of the Semitic languages may be said to
consist in the generally triliteral form of their uninflected words, and in the
invariably syntactical contrivances by which the whole mechanism of speech

is carried on. I seek the cause of this in the early adoption of alphabetical

writing, in the establishment of a literature, and in the unusually frequent
intermixture of cognate races. The distinctive characteristics of the Scla-
vonian languages, as they appear in Europe, may be said to consist in the

perfection of the etymological forms and in the total absence of merely syn-
tactical contrivances, and the cause of these peculiarities may be sought in
the known fact that they have been more free than any other branch of the
Indo-Germanic family from intermixture or fusion, and that their literature
is of moi'e recent origin than that of any great section of the human race.
Thus we may say, that the Sclavonian and Semitic tongues stand in direct

antithesis or contrast, as far as their state or condition is concerned. And
if, in spite of this, they still retain marks of their original contact, we must

admit that the argument from internal evidence is the strongest possible,

because it is obtained under the most unfavourable circumstances.

  --Now the facts, on which I rely as conclusive, are these : (1.) that there

are verbal coincidences between the Sclavonic and Semitic languages which

cannot be accidental, which are not traceable to any subsequent intercourse

between the two races, and which are not common to the Sclavonic and other

Indo-Germanic  idioms                          (2.) that  the  Sclavonian  language  alone  furnishes
                                            ;

parallels to the Semitic conjugations, and presents words in such a state of

agglutination as would be liable to the triliteral pollarding from which the

existing system of Semitic articulation seems to have sprung.

(1.) There is no word more peculiar to the Semitic languages than the

expression for goodness and convenience, which in Hebrew is ^\\0y dhob^

Iin Arabic j,Фt> debr. I have remarked elsewhere that the articulation of the
Hebrew Б2 must be a medial rather than a tenuis aspirated, and the Arabic
synonym shows that it is so in this particular case. Now this root, which does

not occur in any other Indo-Germanic language, is as common in Sclavonic as

in Hebrew, and, what is remarkable, it constantly occurs with the affix r, which

it exhibits in Arabic. Thus we have in Polish dob, " a suitable time," dob-ro,

in both Russian and Polish, with the signification " good," " useful," &c.,

with an infinite number of derivatives. Although we might find other Indo-

Germanic analogies for the root of the Russian doroga, " a road," it is only

^0in the Hebrew *^y\ dei-eh and the Arabic                     derej that we have the exact
ON PROBLEMS IN INDO-GERMAN PHILOLOGY.           147

synon^^tn. There are some Semitic roots which we should not understand

H^Dwithout the help of the Sclavonic ; thus  dhdba'h is generally supposed

to signify " he sacrificed ;" but HUtO dhabbd'h means " a cook," D^H^D^};?

Viai^arfAfAim means "ripe melons," and the Arabic i^sjjs dhaba'h means "he

cooked," и\j^ dhabbd'h is "a cook," and ^nIaL dhabaik means "hot

winds," so that we are led to the well-known Sclavonic word tep-lei, " warm,"

whence the name of the hot baths of Tceplitz ; and we may assign the same

origin to the title of the Scythian goddess of fire, which, as Herodotus tells

Weus, was Tabid.  might recognise the monosyllabic root of *1I1"T dd-bar

in ver-bum, as we might in the Sclavonic ^o-z;or-iY', but it is only in the Rus-
sian that we have the genuine compound do-varei, as in raz-dovarei, " fami-
liar discourse." The Greek SoXix^s belongs to the Pelasgic or Sclavonian
state of the language ; in the Sanscrit dirgha, Zend daraga, Behistun daragOf
&c. the / is changed into r, but in all the Sclavonian forms the I is retained,

as in dolgie, dlauhy, dlugi, &c., and the same is the case in Arabic JUs

Hdhdl for dhol ; Hebrew vH-J gd-dol, " great," 7T and 7 71 ddldh and

ddlal, " to hang down." These examples, which are taken at random and

might be multiplied to any extent, will suffice to show the nature of the re-

semblance between Sclavonian and Semitic roots. Nor is the resemblance

confined to the roots. The mode of using them is also marked by features

of similarity, and we have some cases in which these classes of idioms pre-

sent solitary examples of a corresponding process of thought. Thus, it is a

peculiarity of the Semitic race to regard "four," and especially its multiple

"forti/," as a round number or expression of indefinite pluralitj'. Similarly,

in Russian, we find that, although the other numbers are formed on a prin-

ciple of internal development, the term for " forty " is so-rok', which is not

connected with chetere, " four," and is obviously a collective noun formed

with the preposition so. Again, in common Hebrew we never find the sim-

ple relative she, but always the lengthened secondary form 'hasher. Simi-

larly in Sclavonic the simple form koe is only used in poetry ; the lengthened
form hotorei, hotoraia, kotoroe, which is equivalent to Koropolos, being invari-

ably employed in common discourse. The form kto is a variation of the im-

personal chfo.

   (2.) But agreements of sound and even of usage are less conclusive, as
proofs of common origin and ethnical contact, than a communion in those

principles which regulate the structure of a language. And this remark

particularly applies to the comparison of the Sclavonian language which

exhibits a living power of etymology in its most active state, with the Semitic

languages in which the development of the form has been checked and the

whole stock of inflected words petrified into a congeries of triliteral fossils.
Every person, who is acquainted with the Sclavonian languages, must have

been stj-uck by the fact, that none of the other Indo-Germanic idioms ex-

hibit the monosyllabic roots in such a constant state of accretion or agglu-

tination with the affix, prefix, or both. And with regard to the prepositional

prefix in particular, there is certainly no class of languages which can vie

with the Russian, i. e. the purest Sclavonian, in the number, variety, and

Nowconstant use of these distinctive initials.  modern philology leads us

to the conclusion that the Semitic languages were originally built upon the
same system of monosyllabic roots as the Sanscrit and Greek, and that the

additions by which every such element is accompanied in the existing state

of the language are formative appendages belonging to the time when the
148 REPORT 1851.

etymological activity bf the idiom was still unimpaired. According to this

view, it is quite clear that the particular form of the Indo-Germanic lan-

guages, under which such a permanence of crude trigrammatism became

possible, must have been tliat which we recognise in the Sclavonian family,

namely, a state of accretion, in which the separability and independent sig-

nificance of the monosyllabic root are no longer regarded, or taken into con-

sideration. The converse phasnomena, in the case of the Sporadic or Tura-

--nian languages, furnish the best illustration of the Semitic word forms. It

cannot be doubted that the tribes which supplied the continents of Asia,

Europe and America with the first Avide-spread sprinkling of population, mi-

grated from the central district, while the monosyllabic root was still regarded

as independent and separable, and the civilization which gathered round a

fresh nucleus in China has not been able to deprive the monosyllabic lan-

guage of this inherited characteristic. As then we have in the one case a

luxtaposition of formative contrivances without any real fusion, we observe

in the Semitic languages the development of etymology checked after it had

Weassumed the concrete forms of Sclavonic agglutination.  require then,

for the explanation of the only known condition of the Semitic languages,

that ethnographic fact of Sclavonian antiquity to which another train of rea-

soning had already conducted us.

Again, it is a distinguishing characteristic of the Semitic languages to have

a great abundance of derivative forms for the verb itself by the side of a

striking parsimony in the inherent tense-forms. This is equally a character-

istic of the Sclavonian idioms. The Semitic languages have no proper di-

stinctions of tense as past and present; the forms which they use designate

transient or momentary, as distinguished from continuous states or actions.

The derivative forms which are called conjugations, such as NipMial, Hi"

ph^'hil, Hithj}a"hel, are contrivances for expressing the various relations, de-

grees, and modes of agency. Precisely the same is the anatomy of the Scla-

vonic verb. Instead of the proper distinctions of tense, the verb-forms are

divided according to the mode of action into branches or classes, which

modern grammarians designate as semelfactive or monologous (in Polish

iednotliwe) as opposed to frequentative or iterative (in Polish czestotliwe), and

complete or perfect (in Polish dokonane) as opposed to incomplete or imper-

Afect (iiiedokonane).    simple examjjle will show, even to those M'ho have

not studied the subject, how completely the usual distinctions of tense are

set aside by this mechanism. The Russian verb trogaf, 'to touch,' makes

amja trogaiti, ' 1  touching,' in the present tense of w hat is called the indefi-

nite branch. But if we prefix the particle ras, we get^'a rastrogaiu, ' I shall

touch,' for the future of the perfect branch, which, in its so-called present

ja rastrogaV, 'I touched,' exhibits all the characteristics of a past tense. In

the same way, we find no real present tense in the semelfactive tronut, ' to

touch once,' and in the iterative trogivat', ' to touch repeatedly,' but only

the past forms ya tronid', 'I touched,' and ^a trogivaV, 'I kept touching,*

while the present form of the semelfactive ja tronu is used as a future, 'I

shall touch.' This habit of substituting distinctions of complete or incom-

plete, of single and continued or repeated action, for the true distinction

between past, present, and future, is peculiar to the Sclavonic as compared

with other Indo-German idioms, but common to all the Semitic dialects.

The internal or etymological modifications by which the change of significa-

tion is expressed are, of course, less distinct in the Semitic idioms, but they

are still sufficiently apparent. Into the origin and value of these pronominal

myinsertions, it is not  business to enter on the present occasion. I will only

call the attention of scholars to the fact, hitherto unnoticed and unexplained,
ON FBOBIiEMS IN INDO-GERMAN PHILOLOGY.  149

that the insertion wm, which marks the semelfactive verb in Sclavonian, is
never found in Sanscrit, Greek, or Latin with any trace of that reduplication
which is the proper expression of repeated action. Thus we liave da-ddmi^
hut ap-no-nti ; Si-dw^i, ridr] jii, 'i/rrrifii, hut ^euy-rvfii, cdfx-vri-fii, 'ti;-veofMai, &c.;
rjTiTtTb) for TTt-Trerw, but ttit-vo) ; and Latin verbs which insert n, always omit
this adjunct in the perfect, their only reduplicated tense ; thus we have tundo,
but tutudi. The syntactical contrivance by^ which the Semitic languages
express the passive or reflexive voice is also introduced in Sclavonic verbs,
which have no etymological mechanism for the purpose, although their per-
son-endings are remarkably complete. I have shown elsewhere {Maskil le

Sopher, p. 33) that the prefix of the reciprocal hith-pa"htl is the subjective

n combined with the objective ilJ*?, and that the passive nipk'hal has for its

initial the objective J only. The Sclavonic verb absolutely subjoins the re-
flexive pronoun sya to all persons of the verb. It is useless to weary you by
pursuing this grammatical comparison any farther. Those who have studied
the refinements of philology will be able to estimate the argument from
these hints, and it would be idle to present the details to those who take no

interest in the subject.

   But independently of the arguments deducible from these lexicographical
and grammatical coincidences, there are certain phonological peculiarities,
common to the Semitic and Sclavonian languages, which seem to me to
confirm the view which I have taken of their original contact and congruity.
It is well known to the philological student that whole families of languages
have been discriminated by the different degrees in which they have main-
tained the integrity of their sibilants, or, in other words, by the various sub-
stitutes which they have allowed to supersede these more ancient articula-
tions. In examining the sibilants of a particular language, we have to con-
sider two classes of sounds : the original sibilants, which in secondary

states of the idiom degenerate into mere breathings, or are softened into
semi-consonants and vowels ; and those palatal sibilants, which are themselves
generated by a softening of guttural and dental consonants. The latter class
of phsenomena, to which we owe the constant employment of the ^ in Greek,
and our own soft g,j, and ch, must be carefully distinguished from the causes

which interfere with the permanence of an original assibilation. An example
will show the nature of the difference. The substitution of an aspirate for

an initial s is one of the main characteristics of the change from old or Pe'
lasgian Greek to the classical Hellenism with whicli we are acquainted, and
this substitution has very much diminished the use of sibilants in the language.

On the contrary, the aversion to palatal sounds on the part of the Hellenes

has almost invariably substituted Hi, which is a sibilant, for all the softened
gutturals or dentals of the older dialects. This procedure, which a recent

philological writer (Schleicher, Sprachvergleicheiide Untersuchiingen, p. 33)
has proposed to term Zetacismus, may take place in any language, in which
a guttural or dental is affected by an immediate contact with i. But the
evanescence of s, or its change into a mere breathing, belongs to a particular

state or condition of language, and we may classify idioms according to this
phaenomenon. Thus the Pelasgian and Latin as compared with the Greek,
the Sanscrit as compared with the Zend, the Erse as compared with the

Welsh, retain an initial sibilant, which in the corresponding but later forms
of the same language is consistently changed into h. The history of the
Greek alphabet, with which we are best acquainted, teaches us that the effect
has been to diminish the number of sibilants. In spite of the Zetacismus,

the old Sav has vanished, and while p and v have usurped many of the func-
tions of 5, usage has deprived I of one of its original employments. If on
150 REPORT 1851.

the other hand we examine the Sclavonian alphabets, we shall be struck by

the superabundance of sibilant articulations for which they furnish the ex-

pression. They are rich not only in palatals, but in varieties of pure dental

Weassibilation.        notice precisely the same phonology in the Semitic dia-

lects, but here the guttural and nasal breathings also play an important part.

The Sclavonian alphabet, as is well known, is an adaptation of the Greek,

increased by characters borrowed from the Armenian and Coptic. The

author was Cyril, otherwise called Constantine the philosopher, who was

brother to Methodius, bishop of Pannouia and Moravia. The Greek order

is preserved with the following exceptions. Before Vjedi and Zjelo, which

corresponded to the Greek /3>jra and /3av, Cyril inserted Buki and Zivjete,

and remanded to the end those letters peculiar to the Greeks, namely \, \(/,
6, and v. The alphabet thus enlarged contains the following sibilants

(a) pure dentals, zj'elo, zemlja, slovo, tzi ; (6) palatals, cero, sha, shcha, besides

the compounds ksi and psi. If we take the Arabic as the most extensive

form of the Semitic alphabet, we shall find that it contains the following

sibilants :  (a) pure  dentals, thse, dsal, ze, sin, ssad, zza                                                                                                                  (Z╗) palatals, ^Vm, skin.
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

The Hebrew, which has its full complement of pure dental sibilants in zain,

tsade, and ^amech, has no palatal except shin. Now as the palatals are

softened or degenerated forms of the gutturals, it is a natural consequence

that the guttural aspirate should abound in proportion as the palatal is

wanting. This is strikingly the case in Hebrew, which has no less than four

distinct aspirates, 'haleph, he, 'heth, "hayin, besides its guttural mutes gimel,

kaph, and hoph. The only approximation in Hebrew to that softening of the

gutturals, to which the formation of zetacised articulations may be ascribed,

is to be found in the semivowel use of yod, which is undoubtedly the off-

spring of the gutturals. But it is never so combined with gutturals or

dentals as to form a pure palatal sound, unless we recognise it in shin as a

substitute for sk. Reverting then to the principle which enables us to di-

stinguish between the pure sibilant and the subsequently formed palatals, we

shall come at once to the conclusion that the Semitic and Sclavonian lan-

guages exhibit a complete coincidence in regard to their unimpaired deve-

lopment of the original sibilant, for they alone possess the three sounds of

zain and zemlja, of tsade and tsi, of famech and slovo ; and while the for-
mation of palatals has proceeded to its full extent in Sclavonian and Arabic,

the permanence of the pure sibilant in Hebrew is shown by the fact, that

with a full array of breathings there is no diminution in the use of the

sibilants in anlaut or as initials. The force of this observation will be felt
by those who know that even in the Zend, as compared with the Sanscrit,

the transition from the initial s to an initial h has established itself in uniform

observance. Important conclusions to the same effect may be derived from

the palaeography of the cuneiform characters, which have preserved to us a
record of the Median or Sclavonian idiom at the earliest known period of its

subjection to Persian or Germanic influences. If we examine this alphabet,

we shall see that the arrangements of the arrow-heads or wedges,of which each

character is composed, are not casual, but technical and systematic, having

reference to a perception, more or less scientific, of the true affinities of arti-
culation. Thus we shall see that all the characters, which are connected with

/the lateral angle turned to the left, are more or less affected by aspiration.

The distinct aspirate h \X^\ has two of these marks, and the inclusion in this

^/character of n       only shows that, like the Hebrew "hayin y, it was re-

garded as a nasal breathing. As d and r, the affinity of which is well known,

are but slightly different forms of the same character in the Semitic lanФ

guages (1, 1i I \), and as r and Ф ( ^J ) are similarly related in Arabic, we
find in the cuneiform alphabet that r and s are represented by the same cha-

^jracter turned in different directions (for r is  and s is T^). With

these indications of contrivance and design, it becomes important to note that

J^ T^a lateral mark only distinguishes s
from v                                    . For as Col. Rawlinson

has shown that the character which he calls u \vi has an inherent aspi-

ration, and as hit is, in the passage from Sanscrit to Zend, the representative
of sv, we find thus in the very contrivances of the alphabet an explanation
of that transition from the sibilant to the breathing, and from the labio-dental
to the vowel u, which is the main characteristic of the Persian as distin-
guished from the Median, and of the Gra3C0-German as contrasted with the
Pelasgo-Sclayonian idioms. Compare, for example, the transitions of sound
in the Sanscrit gvan, Median gpaka, Russian sabac, Greek kvuv, German
hund ; in the Russian svera, Lettish svehrs, Latin fera, Greek Q))p, English
deer ; Sanscrit svapna, Greek virvos, and so forth.

    Putting all these circumstances together, there cannot, I conceive, be any
doubt that the Sclavono-Median language furnishes us with the point of de-
parture and line of demarcation between the Indo-German and Semitic
families. With the most pronounced ditferences of subsequent condition,
the Semitic and Sclavonic idioms exhibit those marks of internal resemblance
which could only spring from contact and intermixture at a very early period,
and this contact and intermixture are preserved in all that we can learn re-

specting their geographical settlements respectively. And it is as easy to
explain the differences as it is to account for the resemblances. The Scla-

vonian languages are the most full in etymology and the most meagre in
syntax of all varieties of Indo-German speech, because the race has remained
pure, and because it did not till a late period adopt alphabetical writing or
encourage the development of a national literature. The Semitic idioms,
on the contrary, are the most completely fossilized in etymology and the
most distinctly syntactical of all languages, because the races which spoke
them were constantly exposed to fusion and intermixture, and because they
were the first to adopt alphabetical writing and the earliest possessors of
literary records. The efiiects, which an admixture of different races, whe-
ther proceeding from migration or conquest, produces upon the inflexions of
a language, have long been recognised, and the familiar illustration furnished
by the modern English language, as the result of a combination of the
Norman with the Anglo-Saxon, has often been adduced. But perhaps I

shall not make my meaning as clear as I could wish without adding a few

remarks on the influences of alphabetical writing and literary cultivation;

for sufficient attention has not been paid to the fact that these influences are
most decisive and permanent when their first operation is contemporaneous.

   Alphabetical writing was not invented by one effort. It is the last result
of a series of successive improvements. The first step is a system of picture-
writing or significant signs, which is the usual concomitant of an application
of art to the service of idolatry. The constant use of an ideographic picture
in connexion with the name of a particular object leads to its employment
as a determinative initial for all names which begin with the same or a similar
sound. Hence we have phonetic signs intermixed with emblems or pictures.

A further step in advance takes us to combinations of phonetic signs alone,

and a greater use of writing naturally leads to abbreviations and cursive forms
of them, which are first syllabic and then literal. This is the origin of al-
phabetic writing. Whether there has been more than one invention of the

art, or whether all existing alphabets may be traced back to a common
--152 REPORT 1851.

source, are still open questions. Thus much, however, is certain, that all the
civilized nations with which we are acquainted in Asia and Europe, have
either passed through the various steps of the process which I have just
described, or have borrowed the Semitic syllabarium in some stage or other

of final development.
   It is by no means necessary that the use of alphabetic writing should

precede the formation of a national literature. On the contrary, the purely-

epic period in a national literature will generally, if not always, precede the

adoption of a mode of writing calculated to supersede the memory, especially
in the case of those languages which still retain their etymological structure,
and are thus calculated to meet the exigencies of uniform metre, and to pass,
by oral teaching, from one generation of bards to another in unbroken suc-
cession. It is pretty clear that the Pali literature of the Buddhists was
committed to writing long before the Brahmins borrowed from them the
means of writing down their old epic and religious poetry. So that although
the Sanscrit language is in a more perfect etymological condition than the
Pali, and though the Vedas and even the Mahdhhdrata are older than the

Pali inscriptions, the records of the Sanscrit literature are preserved in bor-
rowed characters of comparatively recent date. Notwithstanding all that

has been written on the Homeric question, it remains a fact that the epic
poetry of the Greeks is of earlier date than their adoption or familiar use of
the Semitic alphabet. The result has been, in both cases, that the forms of
the words in Greek and Sanscrit retain their exuberant fullness, which in
the former language is unaffected even by the existence of a perfectly logical
syntax. The converse cases are furnished by the Old Egyptian and Chinese
languages, which never entirely shook ofFthe symbolical and sensual reference
of their written characters. The Egyptian, indeed, did in the end arrive at
a purely phonetic use of its hieroglypliic signs; but the Chinese never lost
the point of departure suggested by their sidng-hing or " figurative images;"

the highest abstraction being that of the hing-ching or "figurative sounds,"
which however were always combined with ideographic or pictorial signs.

The palaeography of the Semitic nations lies half-way between that of the
Greeks and Indians, who adopted no system of writing except the alphabetic,
and did not make use of this until their poetical literature had taken root
and began to flourish ; and tiiat of the Chinese and Egyptians, who employed
picture-writing instead of their memories from the very earliest period, and
who never attained to a perfectly abstract and simple alphabet. I believe
that the first Semitic alphabet was due to the Hebrews rather than to the
Phoenicians. The Sacred History of this nation tells us that their great
legislator was educated in Egypt at a time when the phpnetic hieroglyphs
were in general use, and there cannot be the least doubt that the Phoenician
and Hebrew characters may be traced to particular signs in the Egyptian
Byllabarium. Some very satisfactory specimens of this have been given by
Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood in the ' Transactions of the Philol. Soc' vol. v.
No. 101. It has always appeared to. me a most interesting fact, that we
should owe our first alphabet to the same race from which we derive the
foundations of our religion. Picture-writing and picture-worship are inti-
mately connected. Abstraction is anti-idolatrous, and is manifested in the
invention of an alphabet quite as much as in the adoption of a pure theism :
nor would I quarrel with any one, if he thought fit to ascribe to the same
inspiration, tiie Commandments written on the two tables of stone, and the
simple characters by Avhich they expressed their meaning. Be this as it may,
it seems pretty clear that the Hebrews never had any but an alphabetical
system of writing ; and it is also clear that they had no literature except that
ON PROBLEMS IN INDO-GERMAN PHILOLOGY.  153

which was written down alphabetically. The same may be said of the other

pure races of the Syro- Arabian family ; and this alone will explain the perma-

nence and uniformity of their syntactical structure.
   With regard to the cuneiform characters, I cannot doubt that they are of

Mesopotamian and therefore of Semitic origin. Internal evidence shows that
their origin was not immediately hieroglyphic, but that they emanated from
a system of phonetic writing in which affinities of articulation are fully per-
ceived and recognised. The form of the character was regulated by the
materials. The alluvial plain of the two rivers furnished abundance of
brick earth, and nothing could be more simply ingenious than to form a set
of letters which might be made by impressions on the unbailed clay struck
with the end of an iron tool, and arranged in different groups according to
a technical plan or convention. The lapidary character whicli was subse-
quently imparted to this mode of writing does not interfere with our evi-
dences of the fact tiiat the cuneiform letters were the natural and simple
invention of a people of brickmakers, who had abundance of clay, and no
hewn stones to write on. In these days of note-paper and envelopes we do
not sufficiently consider how much the mode of writing, in the first begin-
nings of the art, depended upon the nature of the stationery. The ostracism
of Athens and other cities, and thepetalism of Syracuse show what difficulties

were caused by a general demand for slips of paper. When the great body

of citizens in those populous towns wished to get rid of an obnoxious states-

man, it was usual to effect this by writing down the name of the party to be
exiled and sending it in as a ballot-paper. In the want of other substitutes
for waste-paper, the Syracusans employed olive-leaves, and the Athenians,
Argives and Megarians used fragments of broken pottery, i. e. pot-sherds.
It is amusing to observe how the old blunder about the offrpuKoy still main-
tains its ground. Even Mr. Grote talks of votes given by means of oyster-
shells I To say nothing of the fact that oarpaKov never meant an oyster-shell,
how would they write on such a material, and whence would they obtain
such a superabundance of these shells ? On the contrary, the most econo-
mical and abundant substitute for waste-paper would undoubtedly be broken
pottery ; a mons testaceus might be formed in any town where porcelain is
used ; and any pointed instrument would scratch the obnoxious name on a

piece of tile or broken vase.

   But while we can explain the cuneiform writing even down to the origin
of the characters of which it is composed, and while we can not only read
the Cartouches of Egyptian kings, but discuss the fii'st beginnings of hiero-
glyphic writing, it certainly is most unsatisfactory to reflect that we cannot
understand the remains of the Etrurian language, which we find in the midst
of the old Italian civilization, written in a character with which we are fa-
miliar, belonging to a well-known historical epoch, and surrounded on every
side by literary and linguistic associations. It is the remaining object of
this paper to show, by a process of ethnographic exhaustion similar to that
which I have employed in discussing the Semitic question, that there can be
only one solution of the Etruscan problem, and that if we cannot explain
everything in the inscriptions, we can at least see the limits within which
their explanation is possible, the line of motion in which our future progress
must take place, and the goal at which we must ultimately arrive.

   Looking at the population of Europe just as we should regard the geology
of a district, we must recognise the following ascertained facts in the strati-
fication of the Indo-Germanic family. The eastern half of Europe, from the
Baltic to the Mediterranean, is filled by diflerent branches of the Sclavonian
family. In the south no less than in the north these Sclavonians abut upon
--154 REPORT 1851.

members of the Gothic or Low-German race, with whom of course, on the

oscillating boundary-lines of the two families, they are intermixed in diflerent
degrees of fusion. Such an intermixture by tlie side of pure Sclavonism we
find in the Lithuanians of the north and in the Latins of the south. There
cannot be any doubt as to the Sclavonian origin of the Tyrrheno-Pelasgian
race. There cannot be any doubt that the other element in the old popu-
lation of Italy was, like the Lithuanian, a mixture of the Sclavonian and
Gothic. As then, in the north, our next transition is to the Scandinavian or

purely Gothic race, it is reasonable to conclude that the Rasena, who con-
quered Umbria and Tuscany, and who are expressly described as a neigh-
bouring tribe, must have been either pure Sclavonians or pure Goths ; for
there was no Celtic tribe in that district. But it is clear that if they had

been Sclavonians, their language would not have differed so strikingly from
that of the Tyrrheno-Pelasgians. It follows therefore that they must have
been pure Getse, Goths, or Low-Germans. This is ihe inevitable result of
the prima facie evidence. Let us see how it is borne out by the remains of
the Etruscan language and by the traditions respecting this nation.

   To begin witii tradition, there cannot be a more definite ethnological

statement than that in Livy (v. 33) which connects the Etruscans with the

original inhabitants of Lombardy and the Tyrol, on whom the Gauls after-

wards encroached. That the Rhasti in particular were of the same stock as
the Etrusci is stated also by Justin (xx. 5) and Pliny (H. N. iii. 25), and
relics of art, names of places, and peculiarities of language tend to confirm
the ethnical tradition. Niebuhr (ii. 525, i. IIS, 114) is favourable to the
conjecture, that the Etruscan race, which maintained its ground among the
Alps, with Gauls all round it, must at one time have spread along the
northern skirts of those mountains and into the plains of Germany. Be this
as it may, we find that all along the eastern boundary-line of the Sclavonic
population, wherever they abut on Teutonic tribes, they have received from

their neighbours the name of Wind or Wend. What this name signifies is

quite unknown, but it is certain that it is not the Sclavonian or native desig-

nation, for that, as we have seen, is Serb or Servian. And it is reasonable
to conclude that it is a Gothic or Low-German name, given to the Servians
by their Teutonic neighbours. Now we find that the Etruscans in Lombardy

called their neighbours to the east Veneti, and that the Etruscans in Rhsetia
called their eastern neighbours Vindelici, or " Winds on the Lech." The
fair inference would be, that the Rhaeto-Etruscans were a Teutonic tribe,
and, if Teutonic, they must have been of the Scandinavian, Gothic, or Low-
German branch. If we are compelled to recognise the same admixture, and
indeed the same name, in the Lithuanians of the north and the Latins or
Latuinians of the south, w^e must recognise also the same juxtaposition of
separate elements in the Scandinavians who stand opposite to the Sclavonians

on the Baltic, and in the Rhaetians who face the Wends in central Europe.
Consequently, if we accept the tradition which identifies the Rasena with the

--RhEetians, and I agree with Dr. Latham that it is entitled to the greatest
--consideration, we must also identify them with the Scandinavian race.

   On the philological confirmation of this tradition I hope to throw some
new light in the remarks which follow. It is unnecessary to repeat the

statements of Lepsius and others respecting the composite structure of the
old Etruscan language, and the different degrees in which the Pelasgian or
quasi-Greek element prevails in it. There can be no doubt that the civili-
zation of northern Italy is due to the Tyrseno-Pelasgians, and that they
belonged to the same branch of the Sclavonic race which constituted the
basis of the old Achsean population. Their name Tvpar)vos, as Lepsius has
ON PROBLEMS IN INDO-GERMAN PHILOLOGY.  155

shown, signifies ' the 'tower-builders.' I am prepared to prove, that both in

Greece and Italy the Pelasgians were the original architects, that the Dorians

in the former case, and the Etruscans in the latter, borrowed the arts of the
nation which they subdued, and that the so-called Dorian architecture was

imported, in a complete form, from Asia Minor. Just in the same way we

find that the North American Aztecs who conquered Mexico adopted the

arts which the civilized Toltecs had previously established there. It is worthy

of remark that the name Toltec is a synonym for 'architect' (Prescott,

Conquest of Mexico, i. p. 12). Their capital Tula may therefore be com-
pared with Tyrrha, from which the Tyrrhenians derived their origin. In

general, the mixed race of Aztecs and Toltecs, which Cortez found in

Mexico, with their gorgeous luxury, their skill in cookery, &c., remind one

very much of the Etrurians.

On the fullest consideration, I cannot assent to the opinion of Otfried

Miiller {Etr. i. 71), that the name Etruscus is another form of Tyrsenus\
and in spite of its alluring facility, I feel myself obliged to abandon the fa-

vourite hypothesis that Rasena is a mutilation of Tarasena, the genuine form
of thePelasgian designation. The true philologer will find theproofs of a com-

mon origin in forms presenting to the unskilful eye the marks of an almost total

dissimilitude, and he will also, in many cases, reject as inconclusive the most
striking evidences of merely outward resemblance. He knows, for example,

that sero, sertus, is a difierent word from sero, situs; and that the concessive

modo has no connexion with the ablative of modus. It is therefore not a sci-

entific procedure to conclude that Etruria and Etruscus, which always begin

Vi'\thEovHe, are elongated forms of Tuscus and Tyrsenus ; or conversely that

Rasena is a mutilation of a more original word beginning with T. If we admit
the RhcBtian origin of the Etruscans, the name Rasena must stand. And as

Et-rus-ci or Het-rus-ci presumes an original Het-rus-i, it would be more rea-

sonable to conclude that this term comprises the root ras, with a significant

prefix, and Niebuhr has shown that Ras-ena contains this root with the aftix
-ena found in Pors-ena, &c. The old Scandinavian will tell us what this
prefix means ; for in Icelandic hetia is ' a warrior or soldier,' and in the same

language ras implies rapidity of motion : so that the Ras-ena and Het-rusi
would be as good names for a warrior tribe as TroSas diuvs was for Achilles, and

Owes for a troop of predaceous animals. Another identification of similar

roots must be equally avoided. Nothing is more natural at first sight than

to suppose that the names Tapx^vioi/, Tarkynia, Tarquinii, are harder fornas

of the Pelasgian Tvpirijvds. But there is a conclusive reason against this

assumed identity, which has not yet occurred to any philologer. If rapx- or

rpox- and rvp-a- belonged to the same root, the latter must be a secondary

Nowor assibilated form of the other.  to say nothing of the fact that the a- of

rvp-fftiios and rvp-cris belongs to the termination, and is not found in rup-
avvos, &c., it is clear l^at the form rvp-crjjvds is the only one which was ever

known to the Pelasgians in Greece, whereas the harder form belongs to the

later or mixed race in Italy. It would be, therefore, more reasonable to
conclude that while Tvp-arivos is the Pelasgian, whether in Italy or Greece,

the Tar-chons and Tar-quins belong to the Etruscans properly so-called.

Now if we admit this, we at once fall back upon the Scandinavian race.

For the prefix Tor or Thor is a certain indication of the presence of the

mNorth-men. Thus we have the town of Thor-igny the N.W. of Normandy,

where the termination is the same as that of many other towns in the same

district, as Formigny, Juvigny, &c., and corresponds to the Danish termina-
tion -inge, as Bellinge, Helsinge, &c. (Etienne Borring, Sur la Limite meri-

dionale de la Monarchic Da7ioise. Paris, 1849, p. 9). It is worthy of remark
--156 REPORT 1851.

that the word -ing, which is appropriated by the Ing-cEvones, Angli, English,

and other pure Low-German tribes, seems to signify 'a man,' or 'a warrior'

(Grimm, I).3L i. p. 320), and as cpiinna is the Icelandic for mulier. Tor'

ing and Tar-quin are antithetical terms. The Low-German name Tor-quil

is probably a by-form of the latter ; at any rate we cannot but be struck by

the resemblance of these Northern and Etruscan names. The mythical

Tanaquil of Etruria reminds us of Tanaquisl, the old Scandinavian name

for the Tanais, which however is feminine (Grimm, D. Gr. iii. 385).

It is obvious that we cannot expect to find one uniform language in the

Etruscan Inscriptions, which belong to very different epochs, and are

scattered over the whole of the territory occupied in different proportions by

a mixture of cognate tribes. In the most ancient fragments, and especially

in those which are found in the south of Etruria, we should expect to find a

predominance of the Pelasgian element, which is common to Greek and

Latin : and in point of fact, many of these inscriptions differ little, if at all,

Wefrom Archaic Greek.  should have no difficulty about the remains of the

Etruscan language, if all the fragments were as easily deciphered as mi

Kalairu fuius=^eljx\ KaXuipov Fikos. In some we find not only the Greek

language, but the Hexameter line, which is peculiar to the Greeks ; thus we

have, in the Museum at Naples,, the following line : mi ni Mulve nehe Velthu,

IT Pupliana, " I am not Mulva nor Volsinii, but Populonia;" and we find a

complete couplet on the vase found by Galassi at Cervetri

mi ni kethtima, mi mathu maram lisiai thipure'imi ;
ethe erai sie epana, mi nethu nastav helephu,

** I am not dust, I am ruddy wine on funereal ashes : where there is feasting
under-ground, I am water for thirsty lips." In other inscriptions we natu-

rally find a nearer approximation to the IJmbrian language, as represented by

the Eugubine tables. And I propose to show that where we cannot derive

any assistance from Pelasgian or old Italian sources, the Scandinavian lan-

guages will furnish us with certain and ready help. I must premise, how-

ever, that I do not intend to engage in any detailed explanation of the

Etruscan inscriptions : it will be sufficient for my present purpose, if I can,

by a few decisive instances, establish the character of the language, and thus

confirm the other proofs of Scandinavian or Gothic affinity.

With this view, the proper mode of proceeding, as it appears to me, is to

begin with those inscriptions which involve repetitions of the same phraseo-

logy, and of which the jsrimayacie interpretation is most simple and obvious.

When, for example, we find on sepulchres such inscriptions as : eca suthinesl

Titnie (Dennis, i.24-2. p.443), or eca suthi Larthial Cilnia (Dennis, i. p. 500),

or kehen suthi hinthiu thues (Vermiglioli, i. p. 64), or eka suthi amcie Titial

(Vermigl. i. p. 73), we can hardly doubt that eha and kehen are either adverbs

or pronouns signifying ' here ' or ' this,' in accordance with the root which

appears in all the Indo-German languages, and that suthi implies either

Nowlamentation or recollection.  in Icelandic sut is dolor, mcestitia ; and, in

the same language, nesla or hnesla* is futiis, laqueus ; so that we might trans-
late eka suthinesl Titnie and eka suthi Larthial Cilnia. by : " this is the sorrow-

ful inscription for Titinius," and " this is the mourning for Cilnius the son of

Larthius." If this were an isolated parallelism between the Scandinavian and

Etruscan, it would prove little beyond the fact that there is a certain similarity

of sound between the two languages. But by the side of the eka or keJien

suthi we have cen phleres tree (Vermigl. p. 31) and eka erske ndk achrum

phler-thrke (Dennis, i. xc.) ; wheve phleres differs ivom suthi in being the de-
signation of moveable objects rather than of fixed monuments or sepulchres.

Thus we have ken phleres teke (or trke) on the toga of the statue of Aulus

Metellud (Micali, Antichi Monumenti, pi. 4^. n. 2), and on the left thigh of

the laurel-crowned Apollo (Gori, Museum Etruscum, i. pi. 32) we have the

legend: mi phleres Epul aphe Aritimi, Phasti Ruphria turce den cecha.

From these and a number of other examples it is clear that phleres must de-
note the object offered up or consecrated. As most of the objects are of the

nature of supplicatorj' gifts, it would be natural to suppose that the word

denotes a votive oblation. Now we know from Festus (p. 230, cf. 77, 109)

that ploro and imploro or endoploro in old Latin signified ' to call for aid.'

If then we compare the Icelandic fleiri, Suio-Gothic Jlere, with the Latin

plures, we shall easily see how phleres may contain the same root as ploro,

especially since the Latin language recognises a similar change in the cognate

Jieo. The word is then in its effect equivalent to the Greek avadrjfia, and

means a " votive offering," like the votiva tahella of the ancient temples, or

the veto of the modern churches in Italy, and it is easy to see how the ideas

of ' vow,' ' prayer,' and ' offering,' run into one another. But though we can
at once translate mi phleres Epul aphe Aritimi, " I am a votive offering to

Apollo and Artemis," this does not tell us the meaning of the word tree or

three, which in the other cases is appended to phler or phleres. Here the

Scandinavian languages at once come to our aid ; for in Suio-Gothic trcega

is dolere, and trcBge=^dolor ; and in Icelandic at trega is desiderare and tregi

is desiderium or mceror; and to the same root we may refer the Icelandic

threk=gravis labor or molestia, for tregi also means impedimentum. Now

as the monuments on which three or tree occurs are clearly sepulchral, it fol-

lows th&t phler-thrce must mean "a votive offering of sorrow." The inscrip-

tion eka erske nak achrum phler-thrke appears on an amphora found at Vulci

and in connexion with a picture representing the i'arewell embrace of Adme-

tus and Alcestis. It may be assumed then that the amphora was a funereal

Weoffering from a husband to his deceased wife.  learn from Galassi's vase

that era in Etruscan signifies 'earth,' and therefore er-ske* would naturally

denote an earthenware vessel ; nak is the preposition which, under the form

na, nahe, nach, occurs in all the Teutonic and Sclavonian languages; and

achr-um is the locative of achr=-acker, ager, which occurs in the great Peru-

gian inscription; so that the legend signifies: "this earthen vessel in the

ground is a votive offering of sorrow." It is as well to mention that I do not

consider turce on the statue of Apollo as connected with the word thrke : its

position between the proper name and the well-known den shows that it is a;

family adjunct; and as the word ceca, compared with cechaze on the Feru-

gian Inscription (1. 45), and with cechase on the Bomarzo Sarcophagus

(Dennis, i. p. 313), seems to be a reduplicated verb-form (perhaps akin to

--the Icelandic hasa, Danish hokase, ' to heap up,' or ' build,' perhaps con-

nected with gefa, geben, x^Fw, &c.), we may I'ender the passage thus:

" Eastia Rufria, Tuscijilia natu maxima, dedit."

  It is not necessary for my present purpose to pursue these comparisons of

individual words any farther. Arguments of this nature are alwaj's more or
less precarious, and no number of instances would be more decisive than the

fact that the Scandinavian sut=.dolor and trage=dolor stand under the forms

suthi and treke on funereal monuments in Etruria. I shall therefore with-

hold the other examples which I have collected, and direct your attention to

to me to furnish an indisputable proof of affinitj'.

Now here we have, as part of a constantly recurring phraseology, an auxiliary

verb signifying 'to let' or ' cause,' followed by an infinitive in -a. If then

we had nothing else to induce us to suppose that there was some connexion

between the Scandinavians and Etruscans, we should be struck by the coin-

cidence that the largest of the Etruscan inscriptions, that of Perugia, actually

begins with this phraseology : " eu lat tanna La Rezul amev achr Lautn

Velthinas." Of course there is no prima facie reason to conclude that tanna
is a vei-b ; on the contrary, I am well aware that it has been generally con-

sidered as a feminine prsenonien, found, for example, in the name Tana-quil.

It so happens, however, that I have recently been favoured with the means

of confirming the supposition which brings this celebrated record into contact

Awith the old Runic inscriptions.  small patera, brought from Chiusi by my

friend Mr. J. H. Porteus Oakes, and now in the Bury Museum, contains the

following legend: '^ stem tenilaeth nfatia," The very first glance at this

must convince us that tenilaeth is the third person of a transitive verb, the

nominative being Nfatia, probably the name of a woman (cf. Caphatial= Ca-

fatia natus in Dennis's Bilinguallnscription, ii. p. 475), and the accusative
 being the pronoun stem for istam. The verb tenilaeth obviously belongs to the

same class of forms as the agglutinate or weak-perfects in Gothic, which are

formed by the affix of the causative -da, as soM-da, " I did seek" (Gabelentz u.

WeLobe, Goth. Gramm. % 127).  have the same formation in the Latin ven-do,

pen-do, &c., and I have indicated the existence of a remarkable class of cau-

Wesatives in -so, -sivi, as arces-so, capes-so, quce-so ( Varronian. p. 207>252).

may therefore see that lat tanna represents as separate words what teni-laeth

exhibits in an agglutinate form, the auxiliary, in the lalter case, however, being

in the present tense, which in Gothic is formed in th ; and lat being a strong
perfect. With regard to the verb tana, tent, it is clearly the same as the

Icelandic the?i, at thenia=-tendere, O.H.G. danjan, denjan, A.-S. dJienjan,

N.H.G. dehnen, Gr. Teivw, tcivvm, Sanscrit tan-, and therefore signifies " to

ofier," like the Latin j^orrigo or porricio. As ten-do, which is an agglutinate

form quite analogous to this teni-lata, is really synonymous yi\t]\ porrigo* , we

have in the cognate and conterminous Latin and Etruscan languages a per-
fect compendium of ritual phraseology ; and stem tenilaeth Nfatia is quite

as near to istam ten-dit or porrigit Nefatia as we should a priori expect.
The Perugian inscription is, however, even nearer to the Runic than this

patera legend is to tlje Latin ; and the evidence furnished by the two, taken

together, seems to me conclusive. Without entering upon any lengthened

examination of the Perugian monument, I will only remark ihdXlautne, which

occurs in other Etruscan inscriptions (Vermiglioli, p. 64), is best translated
by a reference to the Icelandic laut-=locus defossus, so that the beginning of
the document will signify : " Here Lars Raesial let offer or give a sepulchral

(ama, Ice\.=ango) field as the grave of Felthina." As we have elsewhere

would be curious if it were only by an accidental coincidence that kuml is
the regular Runic name for a monumental stone : thus we have ku lit rasa
kuml, i.e. " Bos fecit erigere monumentum" (Dieterich's Runen-Sprach-

Schatz, p. 124).

   The companion patera or saucer to that which I have just examined con-
tains an inscription, of which a fac-simile has been kindly sent to me by its
possessor, Mr. Beckford Bevan, and which tends to confirm what I have just
said. The words are : flenim dekinOl Qm-tf-lan-eQ. In Icelandic flenna

English le7id, so that the compound verb may denote, " he lendeth for a dark
dwelling," and the inscription means : Thekindul datpateram ad commoraU'
dum in tenebris. The Icelandic has compounds of nouns and verbs, as
hdlshoggra, 'to behead,' and also of verbs with other verbs, as brenni'

merhja, ' to brand.'

   And here I must conclude this paper. It was not my intention to discuss
at length all the topics on which I have touched. To do this, I must have
written a volume. Enough has, I think, been said for the fulfilment of the

tion of ray own researches, and to invite either sympathy or correction from

ethnographic philology.

Report on the British Annelida. By Thomas Williams, M,D.

   Land. University, Extra Licentiate of the Royal College of Phy-
   sicians, and formerly Demonstrator on Structural Anatomy at Guy's

    Hospital.

                                                                            Historical Introduction.

Into the nomenclature of Zoology the word ' Annelida ' is of comparatively

recent introduction. Ancient naturalists adopted the term Vermis, plur.

=Vermes Worms, as denotive, generally, of all lower animals resembling

in form the leech and the earth-worm. In this uncircumscribed acceptation

the latter word prevailed in use among naturalists down to the epoch of the

writings of Lamarck. Appellations no less indefinite were employed by

the Greeks in characterizing all forms of animals distinguished by soft and

elongated bodies. The words aKwXrit,, ehXai, eXfxirs, were used by the Greek

writers as names of different animals marked by the common character of a

vermiform figure. The okuiXtiS, of Aristotle is evidently paronymous with the

=Latin Vermis, and this latter word is conjugate with ?5erto, to turn, i. e. tor-

tuous. All animals whose movements were tortuous, were known under this

designation. The Aristotelian word probably related only to the larva of

insects. The Scolex of iElian, however, is limited in its application to the

earth-worm                                                    by  Ctesias,  a  still  more  ancient  author,  the  same expression
                                                           :

conveys the idea of some fabulous animal, engendered and nourished in

wood. The Scolezia of Athengeus denotes a parasitic worm peculiar to the

mule.

The second Greek term, euXa), seems to have been one of less extended

employment, and to have been restricted in its application to the larvce of

insects. In many of the works of Hippocrates, the word ekjxivs occurs as
--160 REPORT 1851.

the definite designation of the class of animals now known as the intestinal
worms. By ^Elian and Aristotle, this term has also been employed under
the same signification. The Vermis of Pliny comprehends in extent of
meaning the three Greek terms already explained, and by this illustrious
naturalist it was that the intestinal worms were first grouped under the

special denomination of " lumbricus," the Vermes of Pliny having a co-exten-
sion of meaning with the modern term worms. Neither this word nor the
French vers, both of which are traceable to a Latin origin, conveyed any
clearly bounded ideas as to the zoological place and form of the animals of
which they became the conventional names. In the writings of Lucretius,
the word Vermes is thus used : " Videre licet vivos existere Vermes stercore
de tetro." In the works of Celsus, the substantive Lumbricus occurs in the
following sense, " terram rimentur, effodiantque lumbricos."

   Der Wurm of the Germans, Vers of the French, and Worms of the En-

glish, are in the vernacular of these three people no doubt representative or
equivalent expressions, all employed in an equally confused acceptation.

Among the Romans, the generic name of Exsanguinia was subsequently in-

troduced to signify those animals, previously comprehended under the all-
embracing denomination of Vermes, of which the blood was colourless, viz.
the Insecta, MoUusca and Zoophyta of modern zoology. It was not, how-

ever, until the sera of the naturalists of the last century that the old Latin
word Vermes reached the full vagueness of its sense. In consequence of
having united in the definition of the term, the consideration of the softness
of the body to that of its elongated form, it came to embrace in the range of
its application all animals, except the Vertebrata, Insecta, and Crustacea.

To the authority of Linnaaus is ascribed by Cuvier this undue extension of

the word, since anteriorly to the epoch of the Swedish naturalist, Isidore of
Seville had grouped under the class Vermes such animals only as might with
zoological propriety have received that appellation.

   To the ancients, the marine worms circumscribed within the modern class
Annelida were almost wholly unknown. The Nereides are probably identi-
cal with the marine Scolopendrce of Aristotle ; leeches and intestinal worms

were also familiar to this author. In the writings of ^lian, Oppian, Dios-
corides and Galen, and even those of Pliny, no additions to the natural history

of these animals occur. By each, tiie sagacious statements of Aristotle are
servilely copied or grossly exaggerated. By Isidore of Seville, the attempt
was first made to classify the Lumbrici, Ascarides, leeches and flesh-worms
in an independent group. In his work on the Animals exsnngtiinia, Albertus
Magnus alludes to the leech and the earth-worm in alphabetical order.
Wotton has not extended the number of the animals of this class, and only
speaks of the Nereides under the name of Marine Scolojjendra in his book

--upon Insects ; of leeches among the fish ; and of earthworms under the

name of intestini terrce, as well as of intestinal worms under the generic de-
nomination of Lumbrici, Elmins of the Greeks, among the insects. Belon,
in his History of Aquatic Animals, mentions for the first time under the phrase
lumbricus marinus, in opposition to the earth-worm, which he names lum-
bricus terrestris, the worm which is now known as Arenicola Piscatoriim. It
is susceptible of historical proof that to Rondelet is due the merit of having
first clearly defined the genera of marine Annelids now characterized as the
Nereides. In his work, under the head of Sea-Scolopendra, figures of these
worms occur. By the same acute observer, a genus of tubicolous Annelids,
probably identical with our Serpul^, was also definitively described*. About
this period a useful compilation, under the heads Vermis and Scolopendrae,

                          * See Supplement to Griffith's edition of Cuvier, vol. xiii.

appeared from the pen of Gesner, presenting a synoptic view of the state of
knowledge with reference to this class of animals. The alphabetical order

observed by Gesner in the arrangement of the Vermes, was violated by AI-

drovandus. It is remarked by Cuvier as singular, that to Aldrovandus and

his disciples the Chaetopodaof Gesner, and the setigerous Annelida of recent

observers, should have been unknown ; and no less is it to be wondered at,

that this writer and his abridgers were unacquainted with the deep differences

--of zoological characters which separate the slug from the earth-worm a di-

--stinction, too, which Isidore of Seville had already precisely defined (" Fer-

mis Umax dictus eo quod in limo nascitur, tmde et sordidiis semper et immun-

dus habetur"'). The Chsetopoda, or setiferous worms, are however mentioned
in the seventh book of Aldrovandus, in allusion to aquatic insects. The
Nereids are comprised under the appellation of Sea-Scolopendr^. The Gor-

dius is called ^^ seta vel vitalis aquaticus," and which has been denominated
Gordius from the habit of twisting itself up like the Gordian knot. The

Ololygon of Theon appears to have been the same worm. By this author
the Sipunculi of Rondelet are spoken of as sea-leeches ; under the same name
are characterized the Arenicola of Belon. The epoch of Ray had now ar-

rived, distinguished as it was by a radical regeneration of natural science.

In the group Insecta of Ray were comprehended all articulate animals

amongst other subdivisions of this class, that of the Apoda, including those

worms which live in the earth, and that of Infesfince, those which infest the
bodies of animals, may be recognised. Under the head Insecta terrestria, Ray

ranks (the Myriapods) the true Scolopendras ; and in his aquatic division of

Insecta, the Sea-Scolopendrae or Nereids occur. In the first edition of his

* Systema Naturae,' Linnaeus extended the term Vermis to all animals except

the Vertebrata and Insecta ; excluding however the insect-worms of Ray from

his class Vermis. After this first essay appeared an account of the genera

Amphitrite, Nereis and Aphrodita, which belong to the Chaetopoda. In the

subsequent edition of IJnnasus, the name Intestines was substituted for Rep-
tilfa for the first order. In a following edition the class of Worms is sub-

divided into five orders Intestina, Mollusca, Testacea, Lithophyta, and

Zoophyta, and the genera which at present constitute the class of red-blooded

worms were parcelled out, some as Lumbricus and Hirudo in the first order

others, as Terebella, Aphrodita. and Nereis, in the second ; and finally, some, as

Serpula and Sabella, in the fourth, in consequence of the tube in which they

live. The true zoological limits of the Annelida were, however, only con-

fusedly determined by the observers of nature antecedently to the time of

Pallas (1766). To the sagacity and industry of this naturalist, science is

indebted for the first clear definition of the boundaries of this class. By his

successful researches on the Aphroditce, the Nereides and the Serpula, a

material advance was imparted to the knowledge of the Annelida as a class.

He recognised the principle, that the presence or absence of a calcareous en-

velope did not constitute a sufficient ground for placing in two separate

orders animals which in other respects are similarly organized. The Aphro-

dites and Nereids of the order Mollusca of Linnaeus, and the Serpulce and

Amphitritce of his order Testacea, were accordingly grouped into a single

order, through which lay the passage to the Zoophytes. To this order were

also annexed the Hirudines, Lumbrici, the Ascarides, the Gordius, and the
T(Bni(B. The data thus accumulated by Pallas constitute the foundation of the
modern classification of the Worm-tribe.

   After this the Nereids were made the subject of extensive inquiries by the
two Danish philosophers, O. T. Miiller and O. Fabricius. By these authors

additions were also made to the history of the Ndides and Amphitrites.

   Blumenbach it was who first observed that true worms are in no instance
distinguished by the possession of articulated organs of motion, a negative
character in whicli they are separated from all insects and Crustacea. Ad-
ditions to the number of genera at this period were made by Gmelin in his
new edition of the ' Systema Naturae.'

   Under the name of Worms^ Cuvier, in the year 1798, in his Synopsis of
Animals, introduces a chapter in which the Vermes of Linnaeus are presented
under two leading groups, of which one includes those worms in which the
setae or spines for locomotion are present ; and the other those in which these
organs are absent : thus were first instituted the two orders ChcEtopoda and
Apoda, a distinction afterwards adopted by M. de Blainville. Cuvier thus fol-
lowed in the direction first indicated by Pallas, and abandoning the views of
Linnaeus, ret^urned to the adoption of those of Aldrovandus, Mouffet, and
Ray.

   Even at this period in the history of invertebrated animals, which after-
wards he himself was destined so remarkably to extend, Cuvier saw, though
only with dim insight, the necessity of separating the Entozoa (which at the
time could be thrown only into a sort of i7icerta sedes) from the true worms.
In the year 1802, in a memoir read before the 'Institute' on the organiza-
tion of the Chatopoda,M.. Cnwier first proposed to designate this division under
the phrase red-blooded worms, adding to it the genera Hirudo and Lumbricus,
It was about this time that M. de Lamarck defined with increased clearness
the line indicated by Cuvier which divided the Chcetopoda from the Intestina.

A new aera in the history of the Annelida was now about to occur, for it was

in the year 1812 that the class-name Annelides sprang from the fertile and

inventive fancy of M. de Lamarck. By this denomination, through various

--mutations, the Worm-tribe has ever since been known among naturalists.
   Nomenclature. The word Annelides, invented by M. de Lamarck, and
adopted by M. Bruguiere in his excellent article in the French Encyclopae-
dia, by M. de Blainville, by M. de Savigny, and Milne-Edwards, is probably
derived from the Latin annellus, to which has been affixed the Greek termi-
nation eidos. It is therefore a compound epithet of illegitimate construction,
for the rules governing the formation of new words require that the consti-

tuent etymons should be drawn from the same language. It is not a purely
French word, for the substantive annelet is used in French to signify the di-
minutive of ring. It is not a Latin word, for the substantive annus, i. e.cir-
culus, gives the participle annulata, and this is the name which Mr. Macleay
has preferred*.

    The Vermes of Linnaeus, then, became the Vers a sang rouge of the early
 editions of the 'Regne Animal' : i\ie Annelides of Lamarck, Blainville, Savigny,
Fleming, Audouin and Milne-Edwards, has settled into the latinized Annelida
 of all English authors on comparative anatomy ; a word, however ungram-
matical, which has grown into universal and unalterable employment among

--all modern naturalists.

series from the zoophyte to the mammal has led to many false distributions

 of classes ; nor is it yet manifest that the truly natural principle of arrange-
 ment has been evolved out of the wondrously accumulated data of modern
 science. Neither the nervous nor the circulatory system is available, in the

inferior extreme of the scale, as a groundwork of classification. From ex-
 tended researches on the homology of the nutritious fluids of the Invertebrata

 recently conducted by the authorf, it is certain that below the Echinoder-

mata no true blood exists, defining the blood as a fluid circulating in a di-
stinctly and independently organized system of vessels. In the Zoophytes
and Acalephae, the blood is replaced by a fluid, the basis of which is sea-
water. In the organism of the Echinoderm and the Annelid, notwithstanding
the superaddition of a distinct system of vessels for the blood proper, this
fluid, the characters of which will be afterwards described, constitutes an or-
ganic zoological character more significant of locality in the series than any
other single element of structure. Guided by the affinities of this important
fluid, the naturalist may discover unquestionable points of serial approxima-
tion between the Annelid and Echinoderm through the Sipunculidce on one
side ; at another angle of the group, the Aphrodita aculeata exhibits the most
striking resemblance in structure (the mere outward form excepted) to the

AsteridcB.

   In another direction the Annelida approach the inferior Mollusca. Many

features of analogy exist between the Tunicata and the Echinodermata
through the genus Pelonaia, which in its general form and in some structural
characters betrays an obvious tendency towards the Sipunculidce, whilst in
other respects in that group an undoubted approximation is traceable to the
annulose division, in the appearance of a disposition to bilateral symmetry in
the packing of the viscera and the transverse segmentation of the external

tunic. Among the Gasteropod Molluscs, as originally indicated by Milne-
Edwards*, an approach is made through the Chitons in the direction of the
annulose families. It was M. de Blainville, however, who first suspected this

alliance, and accordingly constituted a special group, transitional between the
Mollusca and Annelida, under the name oi Polyplaxiphora, In the transverse
segmentation of the shell of the Chitons, a remarkable resemblance is offered
to the covering of an articulated animal : nor is this resemblance limited to the
shell, for its several parts arc connected together by means of a complex
muscular apparatus, which enables the animal to move them one upon the
other in such a manner as to roll itself up into a ball : nor are there wanting
other similarities of external structure ; the generative apparatus presents a
symmetrical arrangement after the type rather of that of the Annelid than
of that of the Mollusc. The heart occurs under the character of a pulsatile
dorsal vessel, indicative of another affinity to the Annulosa. In the Chito-
nellus the tendency to the transverse division of the body is still more signi-
ficantly marked. Here the shell is not sufficiently developed to cover the
 dorsum of the animal, yet its several rudimentary pieces are disposed at
 regular intervals like the scales of the Aphrodite ; the vermiform elongation
 of the body is more decided, and the circulating system is still more obviously
 constructed on the plan of that of the Annelid. The respiratory and digest-
 ive organs, and the lingual apparatus on the other hand, remind us, as sug-
 gested by Prof. Forbes, of the corresponding organs of the Prosobranchiate

 Molluscs, while the creeping disc is that of a true Gasteropod.

     It is a subject of surprise that the Dentaliadce, the molluscan nature of

 which is now so conclusively established, should have received, in the last
 French edition of the 'Regne Animalf,' a place among the tubicolous Anne-
 lida. The researches of Deshayes and Savigny, and more satisfactorily those
 of M. de Blainville and Mr. Clark J, have abundantly proved that these

   f This is by far the most perfect and elaborate edition of this great work ever published,

Gasteropods should rank somewhere between the Chiton and Patella. In

Dentaliiim, the symmetrical subventral position of the branchiae, the posterior

flow into them of tlie water, and the resemblance of the foot to that of some

of the bivalves, appear in a striking manner to prove its connection with the

Conchiferae; whilst by its oesophageal cerebral ganglions, and the completeness
of its circulating system, its affinity to the Gasteropod is established. But it

cannot be disputed that there are, on the other hand, evidences of approxima-

tion to the Annulose tribes ; the red blood, and the vermiform configuration

of the posterior part of the body, the tubular figure of the shell, the operation

of the operculum, the apparent resemblance of the branchiae to those of the

Sabellce, may be readily conceived as prefiguring some of the outward features

of the Annelida. These points of analogy however are merely apparent and

supel-ficial ; the Dentaliadce are therefore hereby excluded from the pale of

this Report.

Both Cuvier and Lamarck saw in the Cyclostomatous fishes indications of

resemblance to the Annulose tribes. In the anatomy of Amphioacus there
exists only one fact of structure which likens it to the Annelid. The circu-

lating system consists of two longitudinal trunks, a dorsal and ventral; the

movement of the blood, however, being the exact reverse of that of the An-

nelids ; the current in the dorsal vessels sets in the direction of the tail, that

in the ventral forwards I The affinities of the Amphioxus, indeed, connect it
much more intimately with the Ascidian MoUusk than with the Annelid.

The data to be advanced in the subsequent portions of this Report will

prove that a much closer analogy exists between the Annelida and the Ento-

zoa than that which is implied in the received divisions of systematic natu-
ralists. It will be shown that in every detail of organization the Cestoid En-

tozoa link directly with the genera Borlasia and Lineus, both of which rank in
the family of the Planarice, The disposition of the intestine, the peculiar situ-

ation of the chylo-aqueous fluid, the curving of the intestine as in the Sipuncu-

lidcB, the corpuscles of the chylo-aqueous fluid in these latter marine worms,

establish between them and Tcenia an immediate relationship. But the au-

thor has proved that in the PlanaricR the csecal ramifications of the digestive

system are not, as taught by Owen and all other comparative anatomists,

adherent to the parenchyma of the body ; for a fluid, rendered visible by
moving corpuscles, intervenes and is set in motion as in the Echinoderms by
vibratile cilia. This fluid, of which much more will hereafter be stated,

exists also in the Cestoid Entozoa, and suggests doubts as to the propriety of

the nomenclature of Prof. Owen, in which they are characterized as solid-

worms, or Sterelmintha.

In the Nematoid Entozoa, the space between the intestine and integument

is more capacious and filled with a much larger amount of that fluid, which
in this Report it is proposed to distinguish under the name of Chylo-aqtieoics
fluid. This division of the Entozoa is denominated by Professor Owen the

 Coelelmintha or cavitary worms.

    Notwithstanding the recent excellent researches of M. Blanchard*, the

difficulties raised by the investigations of the author of this Report on the

structure of the allied genera of Annelida, will demand a re-examination of the

whole class of Entozoa. Impressed at present in a strong manner with the
conception of the essential unity of the type on which the Entozoa and Anne-

lida are constructed, we applaud the caution and doubt with which Professor

Owenf speaks as to the place in the zoological series in which the Entozoa are
made at present to stand. " These animals are associated together chiefly in

consequence of a similarity of local habitation, which are the internal parts

ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  165

of animals. In treating therefore of tlie organization of these parasites, we
are compelled to consider them, not as a class of animals, established on any
common, exclusive or intelligible characters, but as inhabitants of a peculiar
district or country." In the progress of this Memoir it will be rendered in-

disputable, that if the ' denominations ' established by the learned Hunterian
Professor among the Entozoa be applicable and rightful on the ground of
anatomical structure, the same terms, on the same plea, will become avail-
able in the methodical distribution of the Annelida. Anatomical inquiries
afford no sanction to the use of these phrases : There is no solid annelid,

--neither is there a solid Entozoon. Why then perpetuate the employment of

terms productive only of false conceptions ? Difference of habitat neither
suggests nor requires a corresponding difference of organization : species of
the same genus, and nearly allied, are frequently found to maintain existence

under very diverse physical conditions. The inference is, therefore, even
d priori probable and just, which demurs to the separation of the Entozoa
from the Annelida on the ground of a difference in the outward circumstances
of existence ; nor is the propriety of such division yet clearly sanctioned by
the evidence drawn from anatomy. There is no single trait by which the
separation is so much justified as in that of the absence in the Entozoa of the

transverse annuli so characteristic of the true annelid.

   From these observations it must be evident, that the interposition, as has
been done by Dr. Carpenter*, of the Rotifera between the Entozoa and An-

nelida, can only be regarded as the putting asunder, on hypothetic principles,

those whom nature has intimately united in the bonds of consanguinity.
   Surveying the Worm- class in its affinities to those, superior to the Anneli-

dan standard in the scale, the eye encounters the highest forms of the arti-
culate type. In the structure of the Annelida and the Myriapoda, marks of a
community of plan may be readily discerned. The leech and the earth-worm
on one side, and lulus on the other, occupy the verge of the frontier-line
dividing these two articulate families. Neither the leech nor the earth-worm
is provided with any special organs for atmospheric respiration. The so-
called respiratory sacculi have nothing whatever to do with the respiratory
process ; and though from the date of the early Essays of Duges to the pre-
sent time, they have received the fondest marks of attention from every suc-
ceeding anatomist, as beautiful evidences of design, fitting these humble
worms for the double luxuries of an amphibious life ; to these parts, hence-
forth, must be assigned a far different function.

   It is only in this particular that the leech and the earth-worm, whose orga-

nization is singularly similar, stand distinguished from all other Annelida
that in them, more especially in the leech, the intestine is so uniformly ad-
herent to the integument as to preclude the existence of the chylo-aqueous
fluid. The intestine is joined to the integument by means of a thick spongy
layer, blended intimately with pigmentary epithelium, and composed of ca-
pillary blood-vessels. This is the true apparatus of respiration, and the me-
chanism of its function will be afterwards explained. The general proposi-
tion may here be enounced, that, in all Annelids, the true blood system and
that of the chylo-aqueous fluid are inversely proportional to each other.
The greater the amount of the latter, the less the complexity of the former,
and conversely. In the leech the peripheral circulation is densely complex,
and the chylo-aqueous fluid is superseded. In the earth-worm the latter
fluid is present in small amount, and the proper blood system is, in this pro-
portion, less elaborately developed. Between these two important systems of
nutritious fluids, there exists in the economy of the Annelida a wonderful

physiological balance ; it is a subject which conducts to a new path of in-
quiry. The problem of organization in the Echinoderm, Acalephae and

Zoophytes, through aid of its suggestive guidance, will soon receive a new

solution.

From the researches of Mr. Newport it appears that the series of lateral

respiratory sacculi (sic) already described in the leech and the earth-worm,

are also present in lulus. This fact, more than any other, serves to demon-

strate a near zoological relationship between this myriapod and the Annelida.

In the tendency to segmental repetition in the body, in the history of the deve-

lopment of the embryo, and in the character and distribution of the main

vascular trunks, the lulidce exhibit a close similarity to the Annelida. As

the lulidcB differ from insects in the absence of wings, they no less strikingly

differ from the Annelida in the possession of articulateil members.
   The true classification of articulate animals can only be reached through

the joint aid of comparative anatomy and embryological metamorphoses. In

the latter department Agassiz has done much*. These two methods lead,
however, to different results. By the naturalist it has been considered that

the presence of a heart in Crustacea entitles this class to the highest place

among the Articulata. This arrangement is founded upon the view that all

animals should form a natural linear series, disposed in one progressive line
according to their successive gradations of structure. The distinction intro-

duced by Cuvier of different types, of four distinct plans of structure, has
not yet sufficiently penetrated the spirit of those who have followed in his
steps. Viewed thus as separate types, it is evident that what might be re-
garded as a character of superiority in one group, may not be entitled to

such consideration in another; that in each type a separate ruling principle

should be recognised, and that these types could not be brought into con-

nection with each other unless upon the most general considerations.

The embryo of the Annelid undergoes few, if any, metamorphoses. It is

true that the young are at first almost wholly devoid of appendages ; but the

body in no instance suffers those deep transmutations traceable in the growth

Aof the larvae of Insects and Crustacea.  considerable change of outward

form is impossible, without some mutation of structure. Embryological

metamorphoses accordingly become grounds of comparison and induction in
the eye of the systematic zoologist. As the metamorphoses of an embryo by

which it is raised to its mature phaise cannot be held, at all events, as retro-

grade steps in organization ; it is not difficult to perceive that these ' changes

from the ovum to the perfect animal may lead to valuable inferences as to
the real and final place of the adult animal in the series. Now, since the

insect reaches the standard of the annelid in its first metamorphose (the

vermiform caterpillar), its ultimate destination, after two further mutations,

must place it far above the rank of the worm. It cannot be doubted that a

comparison, instituted between the larval conditions of Insects generally and

the Annelida, would issue in many interesting discoveries : such compara-
tive view has actually led M. Agassiz to see in the naked larvae the proto-

--types of the non-setigerous or Abranchiate Annelids, and in those provided

with appendages a resemblance to the dorsibranchiateand cephalobranchiate

worms. Nor does this distinguished naturalist scruple to descend to parti-
culars in this comparison, declaring that the larvae of Simacodes may be
viewed as terrestrial representatives of the genus Polyno't ; those of Bomhy-
ces as corresponding to the Nereids \ while some among the larvae oi Papilio
proper, with their protractile branching appendages upon the neck, remind us

of Terebella. The same line of argumentation applied to the Crustacea has

led this naturalist to infer that this class should occupy a place immediately

above the Annelida and below Insects ; that thus the Annelida should stand

at the bottom of the Annulose series and the Insecta at the summit, the Crus-

tacea being intermediate.

While we are willing to applaud the sagacity of these speculative thoughts,

we must persist, in this Report, in adhering to the evidence drawn fromadult

rather than embryonic structures, and that on the plea that mature forms in

the same sub-kingdom must bear to each other constant and invariable re-

lations, and that the perfect animal no less than the transfigurations of the

embryo, by the deep written characters of its organism, must attest its true

relative position. It will accordingly be maintained in this memoir, that

below, the nearest connection of the  Annelida are the    Entozoa                                        that  the  Si-

punculidcB associate them in a direct and natural manner with the Echino-

derms, and with far greater intimacy of resemblance in structure than that

with which they are joined to the Mollusca by the intervention of the Chi-

tonidce, and that above the Annelida should be placed the inferior species of

the lulidce. Considerations founded on anatomical evidence will be after-

wards advanced confirming the propriety of this distribution.

It is proposed now to enter at some length upon that division of our Report

which relates to the anatomy of Annelida, as an appropriate prelude to a de-

--tailed study of species.
   Anatomy of the Annelida. Anatomical details, correctly determined, will

be found hereafter indispensable to the classification of the Annelida. These

animals, unlike all other inferior tribes, in many instances present so little

external diversity among themselves, while their internal organization at the

same time may be strongly marked by specific peculiarities, that a careful

consideration of the anatomy of the class will here appropriately precede that

of its methodical arrangement. Certain leading points in the structure of

worms were established by the dissections of the earlier anatomists. The

researches of Willis* gave some rude conception of the character of the cir-

culation of the blood, and the outline of the alimentary system. By Sir E.

Homef this inquiry was prosecuted to some further extent ; and in this path
of investigation, this comparative anatomist was followed by M. de Blain-

ville J and MorrenД. It was about this date that the labours of M. Duges
were given to science, by the publication of his memoirs on the circulation

and reproductive system of the Annelides||- It is a fact lamentable to relate,

that the errors and imperfect dissections of the professor of Montpellier should

have been propagated through the classic works of the most distinguished

modern authors down to the present time. The account which M. Duges

has given of the reproductive organs of the leech and the Nais is full of grave

errors, and it will be afterwards proved that those of M. Quatrefages, although

nearly fifty years later, are little less remote from the truth of nature. It

should have been previously stated, that in the year 1806 a M. Thomas^ had

already thrown some light on the anatomy of the leech. The 'Le9ons d'Ana-

tomie Comparee ' of Cuvier, edited by M. Dumeril, which appeared about

this period, on the subject of the anatomy of the Annelida, contained little
more than an epitomized statement of what had been previously published.

The names of Moquin-Tonquin of Montpellier and M. Phil'ippi of Milan*,

 should be honoui-ably associated with this branch of comparative anatomy.
 Hunter had formed a correct appreciation of the general structure of several
species of Annelids, as exemplified in the beautiful preparations which he has

bequeathed to the science, in the Hunterian collection f. The organization

 of the Serpulce, the Amphitritce, and Nereidce, have been meritoriously studied

by M. Delle ChiajeJ.
    The researches of the earlier English zoologists were for the most part

limited to the descriptive history of species ; the names of Leach and Mon-

 tague should, notwithstanding, be gratefully allied with this department of
natural science in England. Dr. George Johnston of Berwick-on-Tweed
has done more than any other modern observer to rescue the Annelids from
the region of obscurity and confusion. The descriptions of this excellent

naturalist are characterized by exactness and truth, and his investigations of
structure, as far as they have extended, seldom deviate much from the results
attained through aid of the modern microscope Д.

    It is scarcely required to remark, that the efforts of ancient anatomists, how-
ever laborious, in those fields especially in which the subjects of investigation
were minute in size and of difficult manipulation, anterior to the era of the
microscope, could at best have been but imperfect. In the preparation of
this memoir, it will be accordingly found that the author will have few ac-
knowledgements to render to the works of these venerable authors. This

observation, however, does not apply to the labours of Owen and Milne-Ed-
wards, by whom, indeed, almost everything hitherto known to science with

reference to the organization of the Entozoa and Annelida has been contri-
buted. The researches of Milne-Edwards have been principally confined to

the system of the circulation in the Annelida|| ; those of Prof. Owen are re-
stricted to the Entozoa^. The author of this Report desires in this place to

bear testimony to the accuracy of the observations of Milne-Edwards. His
account, however, as stated, embraces little more than the central apparatus of
the circulation, and yet it will be subsequently seen that the study of the cha-
racters oi the periphery of the circulation, identified as it must be with the
intimate structure of the integral organs of the body, will conduct to results
of the highest interest. The author regrets that it has not been in his power
to refer in any satisfactory manner to the recent works of the Swedish and
Danish naturalists on the subject of the AnneMda. The reports by Prof.
Siebold of Erlangen, published by the Ray Society, are very insufficient for

the purposes of reference ; nor are all the anatomical investigations of M.
de Quatrefages and M. Blanchard within reach.

  --The Circulating Fluids. In the economy of all Annelids, one or two

species excepted, two distinct and separate fluid elements of nutrition exist
of which one consists of the proper and true blood, contained in closed vessels
and moving in a definite orbit, and constituting a well-marked circulation

in suspension, varying in different species, and performing irregular to and
fro oscillations under the agency of the muscular contractions of the intestine

and integuments. On these two fluids, two separate physiological functions

devolve : each is essential to the maintenance of life in the Annelid ; nor is
it improbable that the clue unravelled by the study of these fluid elements in
this class, will lead to important conclusions in relation to the mechanism of
nutrition in all invertebrate animals. All the recesses and ramifications of
the general cavity of the body in the Annelids, communicate freely with each

other, constituting thus one common space. This cavity is lined by a distinct
membrane, which is obviously the anatomical analogon of the peritoneum, and

is filled by a fluid which is unquestionably an organic fluid. Reasons will
be afterwards adduced for regarding this fluid as phyBiologically allied to the
chyle of the higher animals, and the containing cavity as the prototype of the
peritoneal. It is therefore proposed in this memoir to distinguish this general
splanchnic chamber as the peritoneal cavity, and the contained fluid under
the designation of the peritoneal fiuid, or the chyle-aqueous fluid of the
peritoneal cavity. In the Annelida, the peritoneal membrane is not vihra-
tile; the oscillations of the fluid contents cannot therefore be due to ciliary
vibration. This fact distinguishes the Annelid from the Echinodermata, of

which the peritoneal space, in all species, even in the SipuncididcB, is richly
lined with vibratile cilia. Tliis observation it is only necessary to qualify by

the single remark, that in some species of Annelids, as that of Glycera, the

hollow interior of the branchice in which the peritoneal circulates is lined

with mobile cilia.

   The real characters of this fluid have remained up to the date of the
researches of the author of this Report quite unknown to anatomists*.

   * About two years ago he communicated to the Swaaisea Literary and Scientific Society a
paper " On the Structure and Habits of the Annelida," in which a summary was presented

of the results at which he had then arrived, with respect to the organic and chemical compo-

sition of this fluid. In that communication, illustrations of the floating organic corpuscles

were also exhibited, and the views, expounded in the text, with regard to the physiological

signification of the fluid in the economy of the worm, were first sketched. The author has
only recently become acquainted with a memoir, " Sur la famille des HermeUiens," by M.

De Quatrefages (Annales des Sciences Naturelles, 3""^ serie, 1848), in which this industrious

--French anatomist alludes in the following language to the general cavity of the body in the

instance of Sabella alveolata :

   " Chez les Hermelles comme chez toutes les Annelides, et on pent le dire aujourd'hui, comma

chez la majorite des invertebres, les teguments et les couches musculaires sousjacentes cir-

conscrivent une cavite, dans laquelle est renferrae le tube digestif. Dans les Annehdes en

general, dans les Hermelles en particulier, cette cavite n'est pas d'une seule venue. Entre

chaque anneau se trouvent des cloisons incompletes fermees par des colonnes musculaires qui

s'elevent en s'elargissant, et se soudant de has en haut, de maniere a former en dessus une

membrane. Entre le dernier anneau thoracique et le premier anneau abdominal, la cloison

est beaucoup plus epaisse et plus complete ; eUe manque, an contraire, entre le deuxieme, et

le troisieme anneau abdominal, espece qui correspond an jabot. Dans chaque anneau de

    The coagulating principle consists of fibrine, and there can be no doubt
that thp great bulk of the fluid portion is composed of sea-water. The mor-
photic elements vary in a remarkable manner in different species ; that is,
for the same species the corpuscles of the peritoneal fluid are constant,
and nearly the same for every season of the year. In different species, there-
fore, these solid elements become signs of specific distinction, but the specific
variation is much less marked than the generic ; this is exemplified in the
instances of the Spios and Terebellce. In Sjjio coniocephala these corpuscles

are large flattened oval cells, enclosing smaller elliptical bodies and a nucleus,
and presenting a singularly serrated border. (Plate II. fig. 1.) In Spio vul-
garis, a smaller species of the same genus, the same bodies occur under a re-
duced size ; the serrated edges, however, are still observed. The serrations
are not endowed with any motive property, for these cells manifest no loco-
motive power. The otm of these same Annelids are orbicular, nucleated
bodies, and differing strikingly from the serrated corpuscles just described

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

these latter are always present in the peritoneal fluid ; the ova are very
seldom to be found. These facts, which are readily and demonstratively esta-
blished, prove beyond doubt that the serrated bodies are not germ-cells.
The illustrations present them in the maturity of growth ; they never attain
a larger size. In two species of Terebella which abound on these coasts, the
peritoneal fluid contains morphic elements of a similar character, and no less

specifically peculiar.

    These bodies, in Terebella nebulosa, the larger of the two species, are
smooth-edged oval cells, slightly compressed, containing six or seven or more
oil-globules, highly refractive, and filled with spherical molecules, floating
in a fluid possessing a refractive power greater than that of the outer fluid
(Plate If. fig. 2). In these bodies no nucleus is discoverable, a fact which
clearly distinguishes them from true ova.

   They are commonly however mistaken for ova in this species, and the
peritoneal chamber is accordingly described as a marsupium or incubating
cavitj' ; additional proofs will be afterwards adduced of the fallacy of this

conclusion. In this species, other bodies than those described floating in

the peritoneal fluid may be seen ; these latter consist of spindle-shaped
and irregular cells, fragments of cell-membrane and other compound bodies,

all differing from the regularly oval cells which constitute the bulk of the
solid elements of the fluid. The spindle-figured bodies, especially when affix-

ing themselves at one extremity into a stellar bunch, may be readily mistaken

for sperm-cells, with which, however, on other grounds, they are not to be

vidus." From tliis passage it is evident that Quatrefages has done little more than recognise
the existence of a fluid in the general cavity of the body. It is true, as explained in the
author's Report, that in some species ova and speimatozoa are sometimes found floating
in this fluid. But it is not in accordance with his observations that this fluid is kept in
motion by cilia. In no single species are these internal cilia to be found in the general
peritoneal cavity. It is easy to mistake those wliich in many species clothe the bases of the
feet and branchiae externally, for the agents occasioning the motion of the fluid in the inte-
rior. Quatrefages saysnothingof the composition of this fluid, of its uses in the economy; he
makes no allusion to the specific differences which the floating corpuscles exhibit in different
species, nor does he appear to have suspected any connexion between this fluid and the true
blood contained in the blood-vessels. The merit of priority in the demonstration of the com-
position, and in the appreciation of the physiological significance of the peritoneal fluid of the
Annelida, is therefore claimed for the author of this Report.

    It is only possible in the larger species to obtain it in sufficient quantity for chemical ana-

lysis. In Terebella nebulosa, Arenicola, and the large Nereids, it may be readily collected
for examination. It is denser in gravity than conmion sea-water.

   In a few minutes after removal from the body of the animal, it throws down an unques-
tionable coagulum, like the clot of true blood. The organic corpuscles cohere into groups
and masses, and sink with the clot.

confounded. In Terebella conchilega, a species very closely allied to the
former, but inferior in size, the corpuscles of the peritoneal fluid consist
of cells of precisely analogous organization. Like the corresponding bodies
in Terebella nebulosa, they are regular and uniform in figure, size and struc-
ture. Such remarkable uniformity proves incontestably that they are governed
by a definite law of parentage, birth and growth ; that they are restricted to
determinate dimensions by a singularly invariable principle of increase. In
these two species the cephalic cirrhi or tentacles are composed of hollow
tubes, filled with the peritoneal fluid ; the movements of this fluid are
determined by the muscular walls of the containing cavity ; the tentacles
are extended and contracted by the alternate flux and reflux of this fluid
in their axes. In the general cavity of the body it is urged to and fro in
large waves by muscular agency, and not by ciliary. Mechanically and
physiologically, this fluid is immediately essential to the maintenance of life
mechanically, by preventing contact between the intestine and integument,

thus favouring the circulation of the blood-proper; and physiologically,
by furnishing the pabulum out of which the latter fluid is perpetually being

reinforced.

   In other species this fluid is characterized by equally distinctive peculiari-
ties. In Arenicola Piscatorum it is abundant, and highly charged with
corpuscles. Towards the month of August it increases in amount by the
influx of oviform bodies, but at every season it abounds in corpuscular ele-
ments, which consist of compound granular cells, from the circumferences of
which digitate and filiform processes project, imparting to the cells an ap-
pearance resembling that of spermatozoid bodies ; the oviform corpuscles are
spherical, and distinguished at some point of their circumference by a bright,
pellucid, nucleated cell. It will be shown in another part of this memoir,

that although these bodies severally resemble the sperm- and germ-cells of
this Annelid, yet general analogy requires that they be regarded as peculiar

to the peritoneal fluid (Plate II. fig. 3).

In the earth-worm the space between the intestine and integument is almost

obliterated, these two cylinders being so closely bound to each other at the

interannular bauds. There exists, however, in the chambers between these

dissepiments a small quantity of viscid fluid, the morphotic elements of which

consist of uniformly figured spherical molecules, bearing a few granules, and

in some instances a nucleus. The true ova, which in this familiar Annelid

can be proved never to enter the peritoneal cavity, are perfectly distinct from

these corpuscles ; these latter being manifestly peculiar to the peritoneal

fluid, another datum corroborative of the view which regards this fluid as

fitted to discharge functions independent of the reproductive. In the Onone

maculata the fluid is thickly charged with minute orbicular particles, all of

the same size and figure, and very minute, and bearing no analogy whatever

to the ova of the same worm.

The BorlasicB and Liniadce, of the family Planarice, present a plan of

structure which distinguishes them in a very marked manner from other

orders of Annelida. The oesophageal intestine, turned upon itself, terminates

here not far from the cephalic extremity of the body, after the manner of
Athat of the Sipunculidce.
                              hollow sacculated organ then proceeds from the

base of the proboscis throughout the body as far as the tail. By Quatrefages,

Blanchard and Milne-Edwards, this remarkable organ has been mistaken for
the ovarian system. It is, however, a true alimentary system, and it is in its

cavity in these species that the peritoneal fluid is contained, and not in

the space, which in these instances is obliterated, between this organ and the

integument, The corpuscular elements consist here of fusiform and ellip-

 tical cells, transparent and devoid of granular contents, and quite dissimilar
 in character from the true ova.

     lu the genus Sabella, the peritoneal fluid is opalescent and thickly cor-
 pusculated; it does not change its colour with that of the true blood, since
 its colour is the same in those species which are distinguished hy green blood
 as in those of which the blood is red. The bodies in this instance consist
 of several varieties of cells, some of which are fibre-like, others orbicular, and
 bearing granules; but in different individuals of the same species they are
 constant. In the Nereids (fig. 4} these corpuscles are more or less oviform,
 and the fluid is distinct, but not large in quantity. In the Aphroditacece it
 is charged with epithelium-like scaly bodies. To this remark the Aphrodita
 acideata is an exception, for here the fluid bears no visible morphous sub-
 stances, and seems to depart little from the standard of salt water. In one
 other respect this aberrant Annelid approaches tlie Asterias ; namely, in the
 fact that the peritoneal cavity is lined by vibratile epithelium.

     It must not be overlooked, however, that in this Aphrodite the alimentary
 system exhibits a curious modification when considered in relation to the
 plan prevalent among the Annelida as a class. The chylous fluid in this
 case is transferred from the outside (peritoneal cavity) to the interior of the
 digestive cБecal processes, from which it is absorbed into the system of the
 blood-proper; the exception therefore becomes more apparent than real-

No example occurs in the whole class in which the real physiological

 character of this peritoneal fluid becomes so unequivocal as in that of
 Glycera alba (fig. 5). The general cavity of the body in this beautiful

worm is filled with a fluid, bearing in great abundance blood-red flattened

 oval corpuscles, resembling the blood-corpuscles of the frog. This is
the only Annelid in which the bodies of the peritoneal fluid are coloured.

The blood-proper in this species is almost devoid of colour, faintly red, and
quite incorpuscular. The bases of the feet in this worm, as in many others,
are hollow, and the branchial processes are tubular and filled with the peri-
toneal fluid, the interior being lined by vibratile epithelium. The branchial
process, which is lined within and without by vibratile epithelium, is filled
with the peritoneal fluid, the corpuscles of which move under ciliary agency,
peripherally along one side, and centrally along the other of the process.
The walls of this appendage contain no true blood-vessels ; and there exists
no other respiiatory organ. The inference is therefore irresistible, that
the peritoneal fluid it is, and not the blood-proper, which in this case is
submitted to the influence of the aerating medium ; and the branchial pro-

cess exhibits a structure modified with express reference to the efiicient ex-
posure of this fluid rather than of the blood. These facts lead by ob-
vious induction to the two-fold division of the process and mechanism of
respiration in the Annelida, that, first, in which the true blood is submitted
directly to the process of aeration ; and that, secondly, in which the

peritoneal fluid is the medium which immediately receives the external oxy-
gen. The system for the circulation of the blood-proper under the latter
circumstances is little developed ; under the former it is more elaborate, and
the volume of the peritoneal fluid is proportionately reduced. There
is observable, then, both physiologically and anatomically, an inverse relation-
ship between these two systems of nutritious fluids. It follows further from
the facts, which, in the example of Glycera alba are so easy of demonstration,
that if the peritoneal fluid, which is so unquestionably the recipient, be the
reservoir for the collection of the external oxygen, and consequently of car-
bonic acid from the blood-proper, the interchange of gases between it and
the external sea-water could not occur if both were of the same specific gra-

vity. This is an inferential datum, which proves that the peritoneal fluid,
although consisting of a large proportion of sea-water, is nottvithstanding
an organic Jiuid. This fluid, in the instances of the TerebellcB and Arenicola,
in which it is abundant, is rendered opake by the addition of nitric acid,
proving the presence of albumen ; and by standing, a coagulum is formed,
sufficient to prove the presence of fibrine ; and the microscope establishes the
existence of highly organized compound corpuscles.

   Now, that the basis of this fluid consists of sea-water, is rendered almost

--certain by the following simple expedient : If the peritoneal fluid of

Arenicola or Terebella nebulosa be collected in adequate quantity and care-

fully filtered, and the clear liquor be then submitted to evaporation, the
crystalline products will be found identical with those resulting from the
evaporation of simple sea- water. The inference then is probable, that the
fluid bases of the peritoneal fluid in all Annelida must consist chiefly of

sea-water ; nor does inductive caution here forbid the generalization sug-
gested by the preceding facts, that in the lower forms of life the surrounding
medium is assimilated with remarkable rapidity ; that sea-water under such
circumstances readily assumes the character of an organicfluid \ in other and
more specific language, that sea-water is vitalized with wonderful facility
by the solid organic elements contained in the peritoneal fluid. It is per-
fectly impossible to demonstrate any direct communication between the peri-

toneal cavity and the exterior. The channel of communication lies through
the alimentary canal ; the water is swallowed, and under the agency of the

intestinal, glandular and vascular systems, it receives the first impulse to or-
ganization ; thence it probably passes by direct transudation into the general
peritoneal chamber. The anterior extremity of the intestinal canal is endowed
with the power of readily absorbing this fluid, while the caudal end no less
readily gives it exit into the rectal division of the same canal ; and this is the
mechanism by which the peritoneal cavity is supplied with its fluid contents.
Whether the peritoneal fluid is organically capable of maintaining the

nutrition of the solid structures of the system, cannot be directly proved;
but it is scarcely susceptible of doubt, from the intricate manner in which

the true blood-vessels coil in the midst of the fluid contents of the general
cavity, that the former must absorb from the latter the elements from which
the true blood is afterwards manufactured ; that in fact it presents the same
relation to the contents of the proper blood-system of vessels, as the chyle of

the higher animals does to the true blood ; the peritoneal fluid of the An-
nelid differing from the chyle of the mammal only in the fact that the latter
is contained in vessels, while the former rolls in a capacious chamber.

   The absorbent power of the peritoneal fluid for oxygen is increased

in proportion as its density is increased ; this property the author deduces

from his experiments on salt water. When this fluid is evaporated to dif-

ferent degrees of density, and allowed to stand for a day or two, the gases
extricated by boiling bear a direct proportion in volume to the specific gra-
vity. Liebig has recently shown that the absorbent property of water for
carbonic acid is very much increased by the addition of phosphate of soda,
or a solution of sulphate of copper saturated with nitric oxide. These and
analogous facts render the inference highly probable, that the peritoneal
fluid, in virtue of its augmented absorbent power, readily withdraws oxygen
from the circumfluent medium, and brings this vitalizing gas in a more con-
densed and concentrated form into immediate contact with the true blood
and the solid structures of the body. This mechanism therefore, so far from
diminishing, actually multiplies the aerating influence of the surrounding
medium. The respiratory process ia rendered not less, but more efficient, by

the interposition of the peritoneal fluid between the blood-proper and the
external medium.

   The history of the remarkable fluid element of nutrition, as now described
in the Annelida, will henceforth enable the physiologist to understand how

intimately and immediately necessary to the maintenance of the vital actions,

the influence of the surrounding medium must be in these inferior orders of

animals                                    how  instantaneous the death when transferred into fresh water, and
                                        ;

how important the part must be which the mineral and saline ingredients of

sea-water perform, in preserving the integrity of the voluminous organic

fluids of the body.

 --Blood-proper. When Cuvier first constituted the Annelida into an inde-

pendent class, he attached great importance to the discovery of red blood in
these animals, and this fact became the ground of his classification : " Frappe

de la couleur si remarkable du liquide nourricier, chez ces animaux, il les

designa d'abord sous le nom de Vers a sang rouge." Lamarck, no less than

Cuvier, was impressed with a sense of the important significance of red blood
iu the animals to which he now applied the name of Annelides ; like Cuvier,
he viewed the red blood as the essential distinction of the class*.

   M. de Blainville now discovered that in Aphrodita Herissa the blood was
coloiirkssf. Pallas, however, had in fact anticipated both Cuvier and De

Blainville in this discovery, and also in that of the existence of red blood

in the Annelida generally t.

   To the laborious researches of Milne-Edwards, the zoologist is indebted

for a full and complete history of the colour and distribution of the blood in

the AnnelidaД. But it is a remarkable circumstance that so searching an

observer should have overlooked the question aflfecting the microscopic cha-

racters of this fluid. After stating that in the EunicidcB, Euphrosinida, Ne-

reides, Nephthys, Glycera, Ojionidce, Arenicola, Hermellce, Terebellce, Ser-

pulce, Lumbrictis and Hirudo, the blood is of a red colour, he remarks, " Mais,
du reste, examine au microscope, ce liquide ne m'a pas semble difl'erer du

sang des autres animaux sans vertebres. Les globules qu'on y voit nager
n'ont pas du tout I'aspect de ceux propres au sang des animaux vertebres : ce

sont des corpuscules circulaires dont la surface a une apparence framboisee,

et dont les dimensions varient extremement chez un ineme animal."

In the passage cited, this eminent author admits the existence of circular

corpuscles in the blood of the Annelida, Avhich according to his account pre-

sent the appearance of raspberries, varying much in dimensions in the same

individual ||. In his excellent memoir in the Philosophical Transactions^,

tous les animaux vertebres. On sent bien que, parmi les animaux que nous rapportons a

tegument, out of which the "IjTupha turbidula" escaped, and that it was not the blood-pro-

per, as Milne-Edwards supposes, but the peritoneal fluid which Pallas saw.

Mr. Wharton Jones describes and figures the blood-corpuscles of the Earth-
worm and the Leech, and thus defines the mode in which he obtained the
specimens submitted to examination :

   " The blood was most readily obtained for examination from the abdominal
vessel, but in abstracting it, care was required to guard against its becoming
mixed with the secretion poured out from the skin in great abundance when
the animal is wounded," p. 94: Mr. Jones then observes, " The corpuscles
of the blood of the Earth-worm are remarkable for their great size, being on
an average yjij^dth or y^^j^dth of an inch in diameter. There are both granule

and nucleated cells*."
   Investigations of the most extended and scrupulously exact description

enable the author here to affirm most confidently that in the account of the
corpuscular elements of the blood of the Annelida just cited from the memoirs
of Milne-Edwards and Wharton Jones, these distinguished observers have
fallen into extraordinary errors. In no single species among the Annelida
does the blood-proper contain any morphotic element whatever I In all in-
stances, without a single known exception, it is a perfectly amorphous fluid,
presenting under the highest powers of the best microscope no visible cor-
puscles or molecules or cells whatever ; it is a limpid fluid variously coloured,

as originally and correctly described by Milne-Edwards, in different species.

No complete distinction into venous and arterial blood can be observed, and

the plan of the circulatidn renders such a distinction only partially possible.

In all cases the colouring matter is fluidified and uniformly blended with the
fluid mass of the blood ; the colour therefore must be developed in the fluid

mass, for there exist here no morphotic elements in the blood itself by
which the separation of the coloured substances from the peritoneal fluid

can be effected, unless indeed the parietes of the vessels of the blood-proper
discharge this eclectic function. With one exception, namely, that of Gly-
cera alba, in which they are red, the corpuscles of the peritoneal fluid
are in all species destitute of colour. But it is not at all chemically impos-

sible that the coloured ingredients may exist in this fluid in a colourless
state, and that these ingredients, through entering into new combinations,
may become brightly coloured after transition into the true blood. In con-

sequence of the impracticable minuteness of the quantity, no direct chemical
analysis of the blood in the Annelid can be executed. As to the colour,
however, analogy removes all doubt that the red tinge is due to the salts of
iron, and the green to those of copper. In those species in which the blood
is light-yellow, opake, or lymph-like, it does not follow that the salts of the

coloured minerals are altogether absent ; they may exist under colourless
combinations. The physiologist cannot view with unconcern the question
which in this class of animals affects the mode in which the peritoneal

fluid and the blood-proper stand related to each other. That the former is
higher than the latter in degree of organization no doubt can exist ; but it
 is not quite clear that the true blood is reproduced out of the elements of the
 peritoneal fluid ; since the vessels distributed over the parietes of the

 alimentary canal may take up some of the immediate products of digestion

 before the latter exude into the general cavity of the body to mingle with its
 semi-aqueous contents. Nor can it be affirmed, from the evidence drawn
 from its composition, that the peritoneal fluid is unfitted to supply the
 means of nutrition to the solid structures, into the interior of which in every

 animal, the corpuscles of the Leech are the smallest." (p. 95, op. cit.)
--176 REPORT 1851.

 part of the body it intimately penetrates. It is more probable, because more
 in accordance with analogy, however, to suppose that it is a manufactory in
 itself, that its corpuscles execute an office by which the mineral substances
 and proximate principles are vitally assimilated, that the corpuscular elements
 in the Annelida do in this fluid what in the higher animals analogous bodies
 efl"ect in the blood-proper. From these facts the physiologist may advisedly
 say thus much, that in these animals nature divides the vital fluids into two
 separate and distinct orders, on one of which the preparative and elaborative
 cell-agency devolves, on the other the work of solid nutrition. They prove
Avith great clearness that the corpuscular elements, either in the blood itself,
or as in this case, in some contributory fluid, are essential to the preparation
of the blood-proper ; for when in the zoological series, as in the higher
Articulata, this corpusculated fluid disappears, the blood itself becomes
corijusculated, or when the peritoneal fluid, as in the Echinodermata,
becomes less organic, then also morphotic elements are developed in the true
blood. From these observations the inference may be further drawn, that
between these two nutritions fluids there exists a definite physiological
balance, that one is capable of absorbing or merging into the other, according
as the observer ascends or descends the organic scale. The peritoneal
system of fluid terminates at the standard of the insect, the true blood system
traced downwards terminates at the Echinodermata.

  --Circulating System. Under this division of our subject we propose to

consider only the central apparatus of the true blood-circulation in the Anjie-
Uda, postponing the study of the periphery of this system to the time when,
in the order of our arrangement, the branchial, pedal and tentacular appen-
dages shall have to be described.

   To Prof. Milne-Edwards is due the merit of having first contributed to

science a systematic and exact exposition of the circulating system of the
worms. Preceding and contemporary anatomists had indeed offered at
different times detached and ill-digested observations on this branch of com-
parative anatomy. Elaborate memoirs on the organization of some species

of Annelida from the pen of M. Quatrefages, have recently appeared in the
* Annales des Sciences Naturelles*.' From the conclusions and descriptions

of this naturalist, the author of this Report will have frequent occasion very
materially to diff'er. In the following account, which will be drawn almost
entirely from original observations, no order will be observed in the selection
of examples. So great is the simplicity of the plan on which the main vas-
cular trunks, constituting the central apparatus of the circulation in Annelids,
are arranged, that a few general statements, expressive of leading constructive
principles, will be found not inapt as introductory to the study of details :

    1st. In all Annelids the blood flows in the great dorsal trunk from the tail
towards the head.

    2nd. In all Annelids the blood flows in the great ventral trunk from the
head towards the tail.

   3rd. In the whole integumentary system of vessels the blood moves from
the great ventral towards the great dorsal trunk ; this movement constitutes
the annular or transverse circulation. The main current of the blood in the
ventral trunk pursues a longitudinal course until exhausted by successive

lateral deviations.
    ith. In the majority of Annelids the intestinal system of vessels consists of

four longitudinal trunks : one dorsal, which may be called dorso-intestinal

   * Etudes sur les types inferieurs de rembranchement des Annelides, par M. de Quatre-
fages ; et Memoire sur la famille des Hennellieus, S"'^ serie, 1848.
       ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.     177

one ventral, whicli may be distinguished as the sub-intestinal ; and two lateral.

These several trunks are joined together by circularty disposed branches,
bearing a dense, glandular, capillary system. In the inferior intestinal system
the general movement of the blood is from before backwards, in the circular
branches from the ventral towards the dorsal trunk.

    5th. In Arenicola, Nais, Lumhriciis, Hirudo, the dorso-intestiiial trunk
sends off the afferent branchial vessels, and tliese latter return into the great
dorsal trunk. In these species the former vessel therefore discharges the func-

tions of a pulmonary artery or branchial heart.
   6th. In the Terebellce and Serpulce, which are cephalobranchiate, the ante-

rior extremity of the great dorsal trunk enlarges fusiformly and propels the
blood directly into the branchial appendages. In these genera tlierefore
this vessel becomes the branchial heart ; and the great ventral trunk, into
which the efferent branchial vessels empty themselves, becomes the systemic

aorta.
    7th. In all cases, without exception, the three inferior intestinal trunks

carry arterial blood, and in nearly all species, the dorso- intestinal venous.
   8th. In Arenicola, Nais, and the Borlasice and Liniadce, there exists a di-

stinct heart.

   9th. In all other species the main vessels, more or less modified in different

species, constitute the propulsive centres.

   To these general statements, which in the Annelida express the main laws

of the circulating system, no real exception occurs.
   In different species different portions of this system receive augmented de-

velopment, in accordance, first, with the method of the respiratory process, the
position of the branchiae, and the degree of muscular mobility conferred on
different parts of the body. In those species in which locomotion is accom-
plished by alternate and extreme elongation and contraction of the body, the
vessels are in all parts remarkably coiled and convoluted. This feature is
exemplified most perfectly in Naisfiliformis. If a part of the body only be
endowed with this vermiform mobility, the convoluted character of the blood-
vessel is limited to such part ; and this embraces most frequently the region

of the oesophagus.

   In the Leech the circulating system is more highly developed than in any
other Annelid. The presence or absence of a heart-like centre to this system,
is by no means in this class of animals the true criterion of the degree of its
evolution. The amount of blood relatively to the size of the body, the degree
of capillary subdivision which occurs on the periphery of the blood-system,
and the proportion of the latter to the peritoneal fluid, form more correct
indications. In the Leech there exists no free space between the intes-
tine and integument ; to this anatomical fact the highest interest will be sub-
sequently shown to belong when explaining the mechanism of respiration in
this Annelid. Here the chylous fluid, which, as formerly shown in nearly all

other Annelids, occupies the general cavity of the body, like a cylindrical

fluid stratum, separating the intestine from the integument, is transferred into

the interior of the lateral diverticula of the stomach. The peritoneal chamber

being no longer required, is obliterated by the adhesion of the intestine to

the integument ; the union of these parts is effected through the medium of

a dense, spongy layer of capillary blood-vessels, the contents of which are

exposed internally to the influence of the fluid contained in the digestive

caeca, and externally to that of the circumfluent element ; hence the mecha-

nism of the respiratory process, and the power enjoyed by this and other

abranchiate Annelids of dispensing with all external breathing appendages.

While, however, the peripheral segment of the vascular system in the Leech

1851.                            N
--178 REPORT 1851.

exhibits proofs of great complexity, the main currents of the blood obey two

leading directions. If the body of the worm be longitudinally bisected by

an imaginary, horizontal plane, into a doi'sal and ventral semi-cylinder, then
the blood in the primary trunks of the dorsal half will move from the tail
towards the head, and in the ventral half from the head towards the tail
this movement prevails equally in the great longitudinal trunks of the integu-
ments and alimentary canal. The transverse or circular movement of the
blood is performed by means of branches which run between the main lon-
gitudinal vessels ; this latter system is divisible vertically into as many por-

tions as there are rings in the body of the worm ; each segment of the body
under this arrangement has its own independent circulation, transverse and
longitudinal. Thus the currents describe two eccentric ellipses, cutting each

 other at right angles ; of course the segmental divisions of the general system
communicate with each other most intimately at every part, while the primary

longitudinal trunks are common to all the segments. From this description

it is manifestly impossible that a distinction of venous and arterial blood can
 exist in the circulating system of this Annelid ; in every part of the circum-

 ference of each ring the blood is being arterialized as it is being rendered
venous ; the two opposite processes proceed simultaneously in the same capil-
lary system ; the blood must be therefore as arterial and as venous at one
and the same time in the dorsal and in the ventral trunks ; the dorsal main
is notwithstanding recipient, the ventral distributive of the blood ; all the
secondary currents converge upon the former and emanate from the latter

the blood in both is nevertheless identical in physiological properties.

   A diagram accompanying this Report conveys a correct expression of the

principles as now explained (fig. 6).
    There is, however, in the Leech another distinct and almost independent

segment superadded to the general circulation, which, since the aera of the

memoirs of M. Duges*, has been called the respiratory or pulmonary system.
If there existed really in nature what this anatomist has described, most
wonderful and admirabe indeed, estimated by the Annelidan type, would be
this pulmonary system. The illustrations of the singular vessels composing
this " minor circulation " for breathing, as originally given in the memoir of
M. Duges, must be familiar to every one who has ever opened a book on
zoology ; since every European writer, from the year 1 828, has servilely
copied the figures given by M. Duges. M. Quatrefages, in the illustrations
published in the last edition (Crochard's) of the ' Regne Animalf ,' has indi-
cated the pulmonary hearts of M. Duges as the " poches secretrices laterales

avec leurs caecum," an error no less extraordinary than that committed by
his eminent predecessor in this branch of comparative anatomy. The fol-
lowing description of the minute anatomy of these parts will prove conclu-
sively, that these two observers, in whose track all modern anatomists, with-
out a single exception, have followed, have imperfectly described what they
saw, and saw most incompletely what existed in nature. The curved branches

Edwards, in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, or Owen's ' Lectures on Comparative

thick-walled, fusiform vessels, arising from the dorso-lateral trunk, and breaking into a
plexus of capillaries upon the parietes of the so-called respiratory sacs, correspond in outline
with the upper edge of the utero-ovarian system as figured in the illustration, fig. 6. More

than this resemblance of outline, there is uothing in common between the results of the
inquiries and the conclusions of Duges.

pulmonary hearts, form in reality the edge of the utero-ovarian organ (fig. Q,f)
The walls of these fusiform hearts are described as muscular, highly irritable,
and perforated only by a small bore. The error of this description is so
flagrant, that we are constrained to stop, that we may indulge in one more
expression of surprise, that English authors for a period of twenty-three
years, and that in the epoch of the microscope, should have lent themselves
to the propagation of statements so diametrically at variance with nature.
The detailed description of these parts will belong to that division of this
memoir which treats of the reproductive organs of the Leech ; to this source

the reader is accordingly directed for full information.

   In addition to the main dorsal and ventral trunks, there exists in this An-
nelid and in the Earth-worm, two strong and obvious lateral trunks, one on
each side (fig. 6, e, e), as to position and size, correctly enough described
by Duges under the appropriate name of latero-abdominal vessels ; the

remarkable structure of these vessels has, however, altogether eluded the

observation of M. Duges. In his account they are described as ordinary
vessels, while the branches proceeding from them are represented as furnished
with very strong muscular parietes. Our researches have led us to conclu-
sions directly the reverse of those of M. Duges. The branches exhibit in
their walls a structure precisely the same as that which distinguishes the
vascular system in every other part of the body, while the primary lateral

trunks are provided with remarkable muscular parietes, the fibre of the

muscle being of the striped kind. The fascicle of the muscle composing the
walls is arranged in a manner which is quite distinctive of and peculiar to
this vessel (see fig. 6, e, e) ; it is coiled with so much regularity as to en-
close a perfect cylinder, in which the blood flows ; the longitudinal fibres are
almost entirely suppressed ; the circular fascicles, lined within by a hyaline
membrane, constitute therefore the exclusive coat of the vessel ; such a ves-
sel is almost unique in structure in the animal series, but none other would
perform so admirably the peculiar duties for which it is introduced into this

part, obviously as a special provision. Its business is to transmit with aug-
mented force a current of blood, in a transverse direction, from the side to
the utero-ovarian organs ; these organs form a double longitudinal series, one
on either side of the ventral mesial line* in each annular segment of the

body. An express branch from the latero-abdominal trunk on either side is

rendered to these reproductive organs (fig. 6, h) ; so that the amount of blood
propelled by this vessel, measured in its totality, must be very considerable
and the quantity, during the generative season, must undergo great increase,

in consequence of the augmentation of size which at this period these organs
experience. The lateral longitudinal vessel is strikingly adapted ta meet
such alternations of extremes ; constructed of muscle, it readily yields under
the_/?ow of the blood-tide to the organs to whose wants it ministers ; and

constructed of muscle, its parietes augment by accelerated nutrition during
the periods of increased local determination of blood ; formed of any other

structure than muscle, such admirable adaptive alternations could not happen.
   In the dissections of Quatrefagesf, the great dorsal trunk in the Leech is

correctly represented as common to the integument and intestine. In con-
sequence of the layer of pigmental glandular cells by which all the vessels

in this Annelid are enveloped, to trace their courses individually is rendered,

practically, very difficult.

   The Earth-worm exhibits a vascular system (Plate III. fig. 7), of which the
plan coincides in a remarkably intimate manner with that of the Leech. This
correspondence between the circulatory systems of these two Annelids arises

from a similarity in the structure and disposition of the utero-ovarian organs
while the male organs in these two worms strikingly differ in structure and
arrangement, the female systems are almost identical. To this system in the
Earth-worm, again, M. Quatrefages has erroneously applied the description of
''^ Secretory pouches^' " poches secretrices venant s'ouvrip sur le dos par les
canaux renflis*." The primary longitudinal trunks are similar in number and
disposition to those of the Leech ; the direction of the blood-curreut is also
the same. In the dorsal longitudinal half of the system, the blood moves from
the tail towards the head ; in the ventral, contrariwise. In the Earth-worm,
in this respect distinguished from the Leech, the intestine is only tied to the
integuments at the interanuular points; the intervals or segmental spaces
being left as chambers, containing a small quantity of viscid corpusculated
fluid, which is the peritoneal fluid of this worm. The interposition of
a fluid stratum in this part involves other anatomical modifications, which
still further separate the organization of the Earth-worm from that of the
Leech ; the spongy vessels described as occupying this part in the latter are
absent in the former. The intestine as well as the integuments are reticu-
lated with elaborate capillary plexuses (fig. 7,/), both of which enact a part
in the process of respiration. The complex character of the peripheral cir-
culation in the Earth-worm, proves with great force the inverse proportion
which in all Annelids exist between the volume of the blood-proper and that

of the peritoneal fluid. In this worm accordingly, from the denseness of the
peripheral capillaries, the physiologist may predicate almost the absence of

the peritoneal fluid.
    Superadded to the primary median blood-channels (fig. 7, a and d, c), a

minor lateral system, founded upon the latero-abdominal trunk, may be de-
monstrated in the Earth-worm as in the Leech ; in all essential particulars in
the two cases, the main trunk of the system and its branches are the same.
The Earth-worm is essentially a water-breathing animal ; it dies in pure water

from starvation, in dry air from asphyxia; the character of the circulatory
fluids obviously suggest the above inferences. The larger blood vessels, where-
ever they come into relation with the intestine, are more or less embraced by

the peritoneal membrane of this canal, and in this, as in all worms, this mem-

brane is intimately adherent to the biliary gland-cells. In its foldings, this
structure, with its yellow-coloured cells, more or less envelopes the vessels,
and gives to them the appearance of being surrounded by a spongy pigmental

coat. M. Merren, in the refinement of his dissections, saw in this covering a
separate structure, and distinguished it as the " ChloragogenaV An order
of vessels in the circulating system of the Earth-worm now presents itself, to
which there exists no parallel in that of the Leech. At the segments occu-

pied by the testicular masses, the great dorsal trunk detaches symmetrical,
lateral, successive branches (fig. 1,b,b) of large calibre, to the number of
seven or eight, which vertically embrace the oesophageal intestine, and empty

themselves, without subdivision, into the ventral trunk. By Duges and all

 subsequent writers these vessels have been called the mojiiliform hearts.
Quatrefages, in his recent and beautiful illustrations, published in Crochard's
edition of the ' Regno Animal,' has depicted these vessels as consisting of a
succession of beads, as moniliform as those given in the lectures of Sir Everard

Home, or by the ancient Willis, in his classic work 'De Anima Brutorum !'

In real truth, these vessels are not in the slightest degree whatever monili-
form; they consist of nearly uniformly outlined cylinders ; the middle of each

 munications between the dorsal and ventral trunks ; in them the blood sets
 vertically downwards from the dorsal to the abdominal vessels. In other
vertical vessels situated more posteriorly and parallel to the so-called monili-
 form hearts, the blood moves in a converse direction from below upwards
the moniliform character which these vessels exhibit is produced by the pro-
 cess of dissection. If, in the ordinary way, a longitudinal dorsal incision is
made, and the two halves be then separated and pinned down, the vessels under
such tension are sure to assume a moniliform outline ; that is, one part will
contract, and another will dilate, and so on successively throughout the length
of the vessels ; the dilated portion will be filled with blood, and the contracted
will be empty, and the beaded figure will be perfect. If, however, a more
careful mode of opening the worm be adopted, dividing by means of a fine
scissors the membranous segmental partitions, and laying gently open the
integuments, these vessels will present a perfectly smootii outline; if now one
of them be seized with the forceps and gently pulled, it will become irregu-
larly knotted or moniliform. Muscular fibres, chiefly circular, are present in
their parietes, and it is to the uneven action of these elements that the beaded
fonn is attributable. The contraction of the circular fibres at two points
separated by a short interval, imprisoning in that interval a globule of blood,
the same conditions occurring at another part, explain clearly the mode in
which the moniliform character occurs. Every European writer for the last
thirty years has glowed with admiration in describing these "moniliform

hearts" in the Earth-worm! And yet even without the refutations of de-
monstrative anatomy, how easy, on a little mechanical consideration, would it
have been to see that no form of vessel could have been mechanically less

adapted for reinforcing the moving power of the blood-current than a conduit
composed of a succession of contractions and dilatations ! it is evident that

Athe efficient propeller would be the last dilatation only in the series.

spindle-shaped tube, on the other hand, and muscularly contractile, will be
seen to realize all the physical conditions required under such circumstances
for imparting a new impulse to the moving current. The latero-abdominal
trunks, destined for the supply of the utero- ovarian system, are present in the
Earth-worm, and present a structure and relations analogous to the corre-
sponding vessels in the Leech ; in the latter, however, the circular muscular
fibres are much more developed than in the former, and the vessel is relatively-

larger.

    It was imagined by Willis* that he had discovered the existence of a series
of pores upon the dorsal aspect of the Earth-worm, which by him were con-
strued into stigmata ; and in confirmation of their perforate character, he re-
lates that air blown into the openings is dispersed between the integument
and intestine, diffusing itself throughout the segmental compartments. It is
stated by Duges that he has repeated these experiments with the same results,
finding that the pores, instead of terminating in muciparous follicles, as they
were supposed to do by many anatomists, penetrate into the interior of the
body, so that air injected into one of them passes freely along the segmental
chambers which surround the intestine and escape through other neighbour-
ing orifices. By these distinguished authors it is further affirmed, that water
is imbibed into the segmental chambers through the same orifices, and from
which it is given out when the animal is too rapidly dried by exposure to the

sun, or irritated by external stimuli. And it is conjectured that aerated water

 thus taken into the system, and brought immediately into contact with the

 deep-seated vascular network dispersed over the intestinal parietes, must,

 therefore, necessarily contribute to the respiratory formation.

--182 REPORT 1851.

   These observations of Willis and Duges are totally irreconcileable with the

--facts adduced in this Report: first, the alleged orifices (stigmata), commu-

nicating directly with the cavity of the body, cannot now be proved to exist;

and secondly, it is susceptible of demonstration that the fluid contained in
the peritoneal space is not watery in this worm, even though it may have

been immersed for some hours in water previously to the examination. As

already described, the contents of the cavity are composed of a viscid, cor-

pusculated fluid, insusceptible, from its consistency, of such rapid removal as
is implied in the above observations. The orifices which communicate with

the interior in this worm, as in nearly all others, open directly into the mem-
branous utriculi of the generative system. No other perforations can be proved

to exist.

In Nats filiformis, so abundant in the freshwater pools of this country,

the anatomist 'is presented with a favourable opportunity for resolving the

Aproblem of the circulation (fig. 8).  living specimen, placed between two

slips of glass, from the perfect transparency of the integuments, will exhibit

to the eye, in a perfect manner, all the circulating movements both of the

vessels and the blood. In Nais, the large dorsal vessel (fig. 8, a) is first seen
travelling wavingly along the dorsum of the intestine as far as the heart,

which corresponds in situation with the intestinal end of the oesophagus.

This vessel is enveloped by the glandular peritoneal layer of the intestine,

while the coats of the ventral vessel are clear and transparent ; the dorsal
vessel is endowed with parietes of greater strength and density than the

ventral. Each of these vessels (as at fig. 8, a', b') dilates into a fusiform heart,
which is situated on either side of the oesophagus. These hearts, which are

joined together by transverse vessels, pulsate alternately, and with exact

regularity. In the dorsal vessel the blood moves forwards from the tail, as

far as the dorsal heart ; thence it descends into the ventral heart, by which it
is now propelled, chiefly in a backward direction, partly through the main
ventral trunk, and partly through the inferior intestinal. The other portion

of the blood, conveyed by the great dorsal vessel into the ventral heart (6'),
passes forwards as far as the head, where its moving power is again rein-
forced by a cardiac dilatation, which now impels the current from before

backwards through a superior oesophageal trunk into the dorsal heart (a'), by

which organ, the blood, received from the region of the oesophagus, and coming

from the head, as well as that received from the great dorsal, and coming from,

the tail, is urged downwards into the ventral heart, and thence, chiefly in the

direction of the tail, through the ventral and intestinal trunks {e,f); this
latter, therefore, is the true systemic heart. At the oesophageal end of the

body the two primary trunks, dorsal and ventral, are connected together by

means of a remarkable class of vessels (g, f/, like g, g', g), which in this region
proceed at successive points from the dorsal oesophageal, and which may be

traced in long coils, without division of the vessel, floating in the fluid of the
peritoneal cavity. Posteriorly to the heart-centre these vessels (fig. 8, g, g, g)
emanate from the dorsal intestinal (b), and correspond precisely with those

branches from the same vessel, which in Arenicola Piscatorum proceed to

supply the branchial arbuscles. In Nais, therefore, partly from this ana-

logy, but chiefly from their anatomical relations, bathed by, and floating in,

the chyl-aqueous contents of the peritoneal cavity, the physiologist can ex-

perience no difficulty in dedicating these coiled vessels to uses very definite.

First, it cannot be doubted that they absorb from this fluid the elements by

which the blood-proper is formed and replenished ; and secondly, it is in the
strongest degree probable, that the true blood is in great part &ei'a.ted through

the agency of these vessels upon the gaseous elements contained in the peri-
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  183

toneal fluid. They constitute the special branchial system of vessels (internal

branchiae), while they discharge incidentally an absorbent function. In the

--movement of the blood, then, in Nais as in Lumbricus, there are discernible

only two leading directions, one forward, in the primary and intestinal dor-
sal vessels (fig. 8, a, b), the other backward, in the primary and intestinal
ventral (fig. 8, d, e,f). It is not possible to trace the blood into the capil-
lary parietal system of the intestine, in consequence of the transparency of
the stream when thus minutely subdivided. In Nais there is also an integu-
mentary system which intervenes between the two primary (dorsal and abdo-
minal) trunks (a,/), ramifying on the substance of the integuments, upon
which in part a respiratory function may devolve.

   In the Terebellcs, in consequence of the concentration of the tentacles and
branchige around the head, the blood-system at this extremity of the body
discovers a great increase of development. The peritoneal fluid in this
genus is very voluminous and densely corpusculated ; the system of the
blood-proper is notwithstanding elaborate and full-formed. The chamber of

--the peritoneum is one undivided space the segmental partitions of the

Earth-worm and the Leech being here replaced by limited bands proceeding
from the intestine to the integument, tying together these two cylinders, such
as to permit one to move longitudinally within the other with remarkable

freedom.

   The great dorsal vessel in Terebella nebulosa is limited to the anterior
extremity of the body (fig. 9, a). It emanates chiefly from a large circular
vessel (6), embracing the base of the oesophagus which receives the whole
blood of the intestinal system. In this species, therefore, the primary and
intestinal dorsal trunks, over the whole intestinal region, are united, or the

former vessel is superseded by the latter.

   On the dorsal view of the oesophagus, a large, pulsatile, fusiform vessel (a)

is displayed on the first opening of the integument in a loqgitudinal directian.
Little attached to the structure on which it rests, it appears as if suspended
in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity. Advancing to the occipital ring, it

breaks out into six branches (rf), of which three proceed to the branchiae of each
side, while the reduced continuation of the original trunk furnishes minute
 ramuscules to the tentacles, in the hollow axis of each of which an afi'erent
 and efi"erent vessel is contained, surrounded by the peritoneal fluid, which
 penetrates to the remotest ends of these exquisite organs. Both from the
 tentacles and branchiee, the blood now returns into the great ventral trunk (c),
 which to the posterior extremity of the body is distinct from and independ-
 ent of the intestinal system (/). From this trunk branches are detached on
 either side of the median line, for the supply of the feet and integument.

    At the point corresponding with the circular vessel (fig. 9, b), the primary

 ventral sends off a considerable division for the supply of the intestinal system.

 The current therefore entering the glandular parietes of the intestine is purely
 arterial in this genus, for it is unmixedly composed of blood returning from

 the tentacles and the branchiae, by both which the function of respiration is

 performed. Here again there exist but two principal directions in which

 the blood circulates, viz. longitudinally and transversely, or circularly, the

 former currents being connected by the latter. The circular vessel (fig. 8, 6)
 acts like an auricle ; it receives the blood from the intestinal system and de-

 livers it into the great dorsal (a). The alimentary canal is embraced in this

 genus, as in all Annelids, by a framework of longitudinal and transverse

 vessels, in which the blood moves backwards below and forwards above (/).
     In Terebella conchilega the circulating system is planned on the same

 type with that of the former species. Here, as in the former case, the main
--184 REPORT 1851.

agent of the circulation is seen in the large oesophageal dorsal trunk, which

commences at the confluence of the intestinal longitudinal vessels. The
ventral-most of these latter, on rising to the dorsal aspect of the canal and
meeting in the common dorsal oesophageal, produce, as in T. nebulosa, the
appearance of the vascular ring encircling the oesophagus. The infra-
neural or ventral trunk, bearing a current from the branchiae and tentacles
to the intestine and integument, constitutes the apparatus for the systemic

distribution of the blood, the dorsal oesophageal being the true branchial

heart. The alimentary canal, posteriorly to the ring-vessel, is embraced in
a framework of four longitudinal trunks, severally communicating through
the medium of glandular capillary plexuses. The peritoneal fluid in this
species is less voluminous than in the former. The peritoneal space is a
continuous chamber, and the parietes are vascular. The tentacles, orga-
nized nearly as in the former species, are smaller and fewer in number.

   The resemblance is remarkable betv/een the circulating system of the
Euniciadce and Terebellce. At an early period M. Delle Chiaje recognised
and described the leading features of the blood-system of Eunice gigantea,
under the name of Diopalre*. M. de Blainville has also given some account
of the circulation of this wormf. To Milne-Edwards belongs the honour of
having first fully and minutely investigated the anatomy of the circulatory-
system in this and other Annelida. In accuracy his description is not to be
surpassed. It is only in one particular that the author's account, which has
been drawn with repeated care from his own dissections, will be found to

differ from the statement of Milne-EdwardsJ.
   As a great degree of mobility is conferred upon the cephalic extremity of

the body in Eunice, and as the protrusile oesophagus is considerably less

vascular than the intestine, the great dorsal vessel occurs here as in the Te-

rebellce under the character of an wwbranching tube, reaching from the in-

   X Compare the diagram given by the French naturalist, of the circulating system oi Eunice
(pi. 12, fig. 2, Annales des Sciences Natm-elles, ser. 2, Octobre 1831) with the author's de-
scription as given in the text with reference to this Annelid, a worm which probably
attains less gigantic proportions in this country than on the southern parts of the coast of
France, and the reader will perceive that the lateral branches going, at each segment, into
the branchise, undergo no heart-\\k.e dilatation as represented in the illustration of Milne-

--Edwards. In relation to these branches the description of this profound anatomist runs as

follows : " Enfin par son extremite anteriem'e, le vaisseau dorsal envoie divers branches a la
tSte et d'autres rameaux qui se portent en dehors corame chez les Terebelles, mais qui, au
lieu de se rendre aux branchies, remontent en arrit-re et vont se distrihuer au pharynx ou

leurs divisions s'anastomosent avec celle du vaisseau ventral. Ce dernier tronc suit le meme

trajet que chez les Terebelles et donne egalement naissance, dans chaque anneau du corps, a
une paire de branches laterales. Mfiis la conformation de ces branches est differente ainsi
que leur usages. Aussitot apres sa naissance, chacune d'elles se renfle beauconp et se re-
courbe brusquement sur elle-meme, de fa9on a ressembler, lorsqu'on I'examine superficielle-
ment, a une vesicule o\iilaire, disposition qui a probablement induit en erreur M. Delle
Chiaje, quand il a aunonce I'existence d'ampoules ou pouches arrondies, situees sur le trajet
des branches laterales du vaisseau dorsal de I'Eunice gigantesque. Ces vaisseaus transversaux
se. portent ensuite en dehors, foumissent une branche ascendante au tube digestif, gagnent
la base des pieds, y donne naissance a plusieurs petites branches anastomiques dont la re-
union constitiie un lacis vasculaire, et a des ramuscules destines aux muscles et aux tegumens
voisins ; enfin penetrent dans les filamens branchiaux coiTespondans et s'y terminent. Le
 sang qui a subi I'iufluence de I'oxygene, a travers la surface de ces appendices dermoides,
est refu dans d'autres canaux transversaux qui se dirigent vers le tube digestif en suivant les
cloisons interannulaires, et debouchent dans le vaisseau situe de chaque cote de la ligne
mediane sur la face dorsale de cet organe." In the references to the diagram Milne-Edwards

 branches ' laterales' remplissant les fonctions de coeurs pulmonaires." Op. cit.

testinal commencement of the oesophagus to tlie occiput, and, tortuous and
little attaclied, reposing on the upper surface or oesophageal portion of the
digestive tube. Coinciding with the whole extent of the intestine-proper in
this worm, the anatomist will observe a double vessel along the dorsal-median
line, and lodged in parallel apposition in the longitudinal sulcus of the upper
surface of the alimentary tube. These two trunks belong to the intestinal
system, I'eceiving branches however at numerous points from the integn-
nientary veins. In these vessels the blood moves from behind forwards, and
mingles in the oesophageal circular vessel with that coming from the lateral
intestinal, in which also the blood-stream sets anteriorly, while in the infe-

rior intestinal, as in the great sub-ganglionic or ventral, the current sets in

the direction of the tail. In this Annelid the branchise are limited to the

posterior two-thirds of the body, each branchia consisting of two, three, four

or five blood-vessels, according to the species, projecting in a comb-like

manner from the dorsal base of each foot. The great heart-like oesophageal

dorsal vessel therefore, while anatomically similar, is physiologically very

different in this worm and the Terebellce. In the latter species it is exclu-

sively a branchial heart, in the former it is indirectly systemic and branchial.
It empties itself into the anterior extremity of tiie main ventral trunk, by which

the lateral segmental branches are directly supplied to the feet, integument

and branchia.
   It was formerly stated ihat Milne-Edwards has described and figured the

branchial vessels as ampullated soon after the origin of each from the com-
mon trunk, the ampullae being designed to fulfil the function of branchial
hearts. These vessels, therefore, according to the representations of Milne-
Edwards, are, in Eunice, the exact analogons of those remarkable cardiac
vessels (pulmonary hearts) described by M. Duges in the Leech. The ex-
istence of these latter vessels has already been demonstrated, beyond doubt,
to be altogether imaginary, M. Duges having mistaken for them the curved
edges of the reproductive utriculi. According to the author's observations,
these vessels in Eunice present nothing approaching to the ampuUas figured
in the illustrations of Milne-Edwards. The pouched dilatations are produced
by the dissection and exposure to atmospheric stimulus, just as in the Earth-
worm the moniliform character of the descending vessel was shown to be
caused by the stretching. In Eunice the lateral segmental branches are re-

latively large at first, but soon divide into three lesser branches, of which
one goes to the foet, the other to the intestine, and the third to the branchiae,

from which the blood returns into the dorsal vessel, which in this worm ac-
cordingly carries arterial blood. The suddenness of this division favours the

imprisonment of a drop of blood in the first stage of the vessels, the drop
thus enclosed occasioning a bulged enlargement in this portion of the vessel
but that this appearance is altogether accidental, the author has repeatedly,

and with various kinds of proof, shown to be unquestionable. The blood is
admitted into and returned from the branchiae by alternate movements of
contraction and dilatation ; these movements are not simultaneous in all the
branchiae, but variously and independently in each individually, the afflux
into one being synchronous with the efflux of blood from those contiguous.
This contractile power is by no means peculiar to these vessels. The motion
of the blood in the vessels in every part of the body of the Annelid is effected,
not through the agency of uniformly travefling undulatory contractions of
their coats, but by complete contractions and relaxations of successive por-

tions of the tube ; so that during the instant of contraction, the cylinder ol' the
vessel in the part contracting is completely emptied of blood, the sides col-
lapsing and meeting in the axis ; and during the period of dilatation, the

same portion of the vessel becomes densely distended with blood ; and this
is the true mechanism of the circulation in those species even in which a
central propulsive organ exists, for example, in Nais and Arenicola. In no

part of the system, therefore, is the superadded contractile bulb required as
an agent of circulation, since this contractile power resides in every part of

evei-i/ vessel, in virtue of the muscularity of its parietes. The truth of these
observations, opposed as they are to the statements of Milne-Edwards, may
be established beyond doubt, and easily, by a scrutiny of the circulating

system of Arenicola Piscatorum *.

  A general survey of the circulation in Eunice will suffice to satisfy the

physiologist that no part of the system contains pure arterial and no part
pure venous blood. Into the double dorsal trunk arterial blood is poured
from the branchiae, but into the same trunk the intestinal branches contri-
bute venous blood ; the mingling of these two classes of currents in the same
trunk must result in blood of an intermediate quality. It is then manifest

that the great subneural trunk, which in this worm is both systemic and

branchial, must distribute blood of composition intermediate between venous

and arterial. No part of the circulatory apparatus therefore contains pure

arterial blood but the efferent branches of the branchiae.

   The SabellcB, in the number and general disposition of the primary blood-
vessels, do not very materially differ from those Annelids of which the circu-
latory apparatus has been already described. The evidence of " centraliza-
tion" is less complete in this genus than in the genera i'zmice and Terebella,
The dorsal vessels preserve a uniform diameter from origin to termination. In

Sabella alveolata, the dorsal vessels, whicii repose on, and belong to, the ali-
mentary tube, commence at the caudal extreme of the body as a small single
trunk. Where the true intestine begins, as indicated by the segmental saccu-

lations of the canal, this single vessel divides into two trunks perceptible on the
dorsum of the intestine, which on either side of the median line proceed for-
wards in parallel directions. At the crop-like dilatation, which occurs at the
commencement of the oesophagus, these two vessels are united by a large

transverse branch, and advancing round the sides of the crop-like bulge, be-
come again united into a single trunk, which follows the oesophagus as far as
the occiput, where it resolves itself into numerous minute branches for the

supply of the cephalic tentacles. These latter organs are penetrated by the
peritoneal fluid which moves to and fro in a liollow axis, along which a
single delicate blood-vessel reaches the extreme end of the tentacle and then
returns upon itself. The functions of these tentacular ramusculi have refer-

ence more to an absorbent than a respiratory process. In this worm the
sub-ganglionic trunk is comparatively small, while the sub-intestinal is more
developed. It is from the latter and not the former vessel in Sabella alveo-

  --* Speaking of the circulating system in Eunice, this anatomist thus expounds the mecha-

nism of the circulation : " Les vaisseaux sanguins, consideres d'une maniere absolue, se dis-
tribuent done a-peu-pres de la menie maniere chez les Eunices et les Terebelles, mais, si on
les considere dans leur fonctious et dans leur rapports avec I'appareil respiratoire, on y voit,
 dans ces deux genres, des differences tres grandes. Dans les Eunices, le cours du sang n'est

voient le sang aux branehies en meme temps qu'a Tintestin, aux muscles, a la peau, etc., et

 compte quelquefois plusieurs centaines ; et cette multiphcite des organs moteurs du sang, iu-
 dependans les uns des autres, est probablement une des circonstances qui donnent aux

 ete separes du reste de I'animal."
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  187

 lata that the lateral branches designed for the branchiae proceed, the effe-
 rent vessels of these organs returning the arterialized blood into the dorsal
 intestinal trunks. Between the longitudinal trunks a complex capillary system

 of vessels is interposed. Upon this system the glandular functions of the
 biliary cell-layer of the alimentary canal depend. From the relative con-
 nection and directions of the primary and secondary trunks, it may be seen

 that the blood in all the lateral branches connected with the dorsal vessels
 sets towards the median line, while that in the ventral secondaries sets/ro;w
 the median line. In this Annelid therefore, as in every other, there are two

 concentric circular currents, while in many there exist also concentric lon^

 gitudinal movements of the blood.

    On the British shores two other species of Sabellce are familiar, of which

 the circulating system is distinguished in several respects from that of Sa-
 bella alveolata. In S. a sang vert o{ Milne-Edwards* the dorsal vessel is
 single, maintaining a median position from one extreme of the body to the
 other. It is branchial in office. Situated at the cephalic end of the body,
 the entire blood of the branchial tentacles is derived immediately from this
 vessel. Its contributory branches proceed from the intestine and integu-
 ments ; its contained blood is necessarily venous. The sub-neural trunk
 receives the branchial veins. This vessel in Sabella chhroema ie large, and
 distributes unmixed arterial blood to the feet, integuments and intestine.
There exists in this worm a considerable amount of peritoneal fluid, which,
in common with the blood-proper, penetrates into and follows the sub-
divisions of the branchial appendages. The blood, bright-green in colour,
is perfectly destitute of all morphotic elements ; it is entirely fluid. The
peritoneal fluid is colourless and corpusculated. The blood-current in

this Annelid observes two leading directions : in the dorsal vessel it moves
forwards, in the ventral backwards, in the lateral branches upwards and cir-

cularly, in conformity with the law controlling the circulation in all Annelida.

    In the subsequent portion of this Report another species of Sabella will be
described, in which the branchial tentacles coexist with the bilateral series

of branchias. In this graceful Annelid the features of the circulating system
of S. alveolata and S. chlorcema are interfused. The species characterized
by Montagu as Sabella vesiculosa, in which the branchial appendages are
concentrated around the head, exhibits a blood-system, of which the dorsal

vessel is single and branchial, conforming in every detail with that of S.

chlorcema.

    The Nereides are elaborately organized ; the blood-system is highly deve-

loped ; the peripheral portion is densely subdivided ; the nervous system is
numerously ganglionized. Thus is explained the vigorous muscular power
of nearly all the species of this genus.

    In Nereis margaritacea of our coasts the system of the blood is double.

There exists a primary dorsal vessel and intestinal dorsal, much smaller than

the former. This latter vessel is not represented in the diagrams of Prof. Milne-

Edwards, but it may be readily exposed to view. The superior or greater

dorsal presents its largest diameter about the middle of the body. It receives
at every segment considerable venous branches from the intestine, and arte-

rial from the bases of the feet. Anteriorly about the commencement of the
oesophagus it sends down to the great ventral a large proportion of its blood
by means of descending lateral branches, like the moniliform (sic) vessels of
the Earth-worm.

   * I have constructed a Greek specific name for this elegant Annelid, namely, Sabella chlo-
rcema, in accordance with the French designation applied to it by Milne-Edwards, both sig-

nifying the existence oi green blood.
188 KEPORT-- 1851.

    The sub-ganglionic trunk in this worm exceeds the dorsal in calibre; it

 re-circulates throughout the system the contents ol' the dorsal trunk ; lateral
 branches, slightly coiled and lengthened, a provision against injury during
 the vermiculations of the body, are detached at each ring, to the feet and
 intestine. Those for the former penetrate at the roots of these appendages
 and reach the cutaneous surface, whereon a complex network of capillary
 vessels is formed, veiled from the exterior only by a layer of epithelium.
 This plexus is the true respiratory organ of the Nereid (see fig. 13, a). This

plexiform subdivision of the vessels is not seen in many worms ; it is a forma-

tion almost peculiar to the Nereids. In the neighbourhood of these respiratory
 plexuses, artfully arranged, a system of vibratile cilia is provided, without
which the great function devolving on these vessels were incompletely dis-
charged. The intestine is embraced in a framework of four longitudinal
vessels, between which a glandular capillary system intervenes, which pro-

vides the digestive secretions.

    In the Nereids, then, no heart-like centre to the circulation exists. The
great dorsal, the reservoir of the centripetal streams of the body, may be
likened to a right ventricle (the lungs cut off), and the great ventral to a
left ventricle. The duty of the former is to collect the refluent blood of the

 system, of the latter to circulate it again.

   A slight modification in this system occurs in Nephthys Hombergii, a dorsi-
Abranchiate Annelid allied to the Nereids, and common on our coasts.

strong proboscis, enclosed in an oesophagus of corresponding strength, by
its constant motions would, in this worm and in this situation, endanger the
safety of lateral vessels. The position of these branches is accordingly
thrown back as far as the commencement of the intestinal division of the
alimentary tube. The crowding of the branchial veins upon this point of
the vessel imparts to the latter an augmented diameter or a heart-like form.
The vessel then creeps along the dorsal surface of the proboscidian oesopha-
 gus, neither giving nor receiving branches, as far as t!ie occipital segment,
where it divides into two branches which descend on either side to the ven-
tral trunk, while a i'ew small twigs proceed forward to supply the tentacles.
In this worm a distinct branchial organ is provided, which is situated at the
inferior base of the superior foot. The branchial veins stretch across the
peritoneal space and empty themselves directly into the great dorsal vessel.
As in the Nereids, the afferent blood-vessels of the branchiae are derived
from the great ventral ; the branches corresponding in number with the
 segmental divisions of the body. It remains to note a peculiarity of the
 ventral or sub-ganglionic system in Nephthys, which Milne-Edwards was the
first to recognise. The vessel, which is a single trunk in all other Annelids,
is double in this. The parallel trunks, however, communicate freely here and

 there by cross branches. It appears then that the lateral series of vessels of
 one side destined for the branchiae are independent of those of the other.
 This conformation, so remarkable, has a meaning. It is a beautiful provi-

sion against the consequences of injury, to which the habits of this worm

 render it obnoxious.

    The resemblance is most striking between the circulating system of Nais
Jiliformis and that ofArenicola Piscatormn (fig. 10). From the dimensions of
 this last worm, it is easily dissected ; the older anatomists had discovered the
 existence of a heart-like centre. Hunter, SirE.Home and Lamarck, have each
 described the blood- system of this vulgar worm. But it was reserved to
 Prof. M. Edwards to unravel its details with a demonstrative accuracy worthy
 of modern science. Nothing remains to be added to the account given by
 this naturalist. The blood-system is more centralized in this worm than in

Aany other known Annelid.  large dorsal trunk (a) at the anterior three-

fourths of the body, receiving exclusively the efferent vessels of the branchiae,

proceeds forwards from the tail and empties itself into the cardiac cavities, of

which one is situated on either side of the oesophagus (b, b). Another ves-

sel, proceedingyrom the head towards the heart, empties itself into the same

cavity with the former. The blood then enters a second cavity (c', c') more

ventrally situated, by which it is propelled forwards into the subcesophageal

trunk, but principally backwards into the great longitudinal trunks of the ali-

mentary canal. The blood, returning from the intestinal system of vessels,

reaches the dorsal intestinal (^) (lying in the median line, underneath the
great dorsal trunk), from which the current diverges laterally at right angles

into the branchiae (/,/)и This conform' 'i:on differs from that prevalent in
all other dorsibranchiate Annelids, in which the great ventral trunk is the
source of the branchial arteries. But the typical plan of the circulation is

observed in the system of Arenicola, at the posterior half of the branchial

division of the body, whereas the afferent vessels of branchiae emanate from

the ventral trunk. It may be necessary to explain that the motion of the
blood in that part of the circulating system which is anterior to the heart is
the reverse of that in that posterior to this centre. The ventral oesophageal

carries the blood forwards and the dorsal backwards towards the heart.

The independent contractile (ergo circulating) power of each individual

vessel may be very completely proved by an examination of the branchiae of
Aa living Arenicola (see fig. 12).
                                    single ramuscule in the branchial tuft

may contract and empty itself, while the surrounding branches are expanding

diastolically. There is no synchroneity in the circulatory movements of these

vessels. Both the afferent and eff'erent vessels of the branchiae are long and

tortuous, but discover no cardiac ampullce in any part of their course. In

fact such formations exist in no known Annelid, and this conclusion has now

been substantiated by anatomical demonstration.

   Over the parietes of the stomach in this worm a very dense reticulation
of capillary vessels may be observed with the naked eye, from the bright yel-

low colour of the biliary gland-layer. In Arenicola the peritoneal chamber

is filled with a highly corpusculated fluid, the basis of which consists of sea-
water, and the presence and movements of which are indispensable to the

circulation of the blood-proper. By this remarkable mass of fluid, the slender,

tortuous vessels are shielded from injurious pressure.

   In the BorlasicE, a genus of Annelids, of which the true organization is ex-
plained for the first time in this Report, the central organ of the circulation
occurs as a bilocular heart, which is situated on the dorsal surface of the
proboscis and near the occiput.

   This organ, in every species oiBorlasia hitherto examined by the author,
consists of two chambers, between which, by means of a large transverse
channel, a free communication exists ; into one of these cavities the blood of

the dorsal vessel is poured. This blood is derived from the cutaneous system
of capillaries, which in these worms are superficially situated, and only pro-
tected from the surrounding element by a coating of vibratile epidermis.

This vibratile epidermis is limited to the dorsal half of the body, which may

be therefore assigned as the true area of the respiratory process. Vibratile
epidermis in all other Annelids is restricted to special localities, wherein the
function of respiration is performed. In the Borlasice and Liniadm it is co-
extensive with the whole dorsal region of the body, and becomes a distinct-

ive anatomical character of these unfamiliar genera. From the dorsal cham-

ber of the heart, the blood through the connecting channel is directed into
the ventral cavity, and thence distributed over the integumentary and intes-

tinal sj'stems. The extreme elongation of the body in these worms necessi-

tates tlie existence of a central propulsive power, notwithstanding the con-

tractile property with which every part of the circulating system is endowed.

In these singular worms, the alimentary system of which will be afterwards

described, the blood-proper is red in colour, and perfectly devoid of globules
of any sort. The peritoneal space, as it exists in most other Annelids, is not

to be found in these genera, since the alimentary organ superadded to the

proboscis and oesophagus is adherent to the general integument.

  A general idea has now been given of the central agents of the circulation

of this class of invertebrate animals. The special elaboration of the circum-

ferences of this apparatus to meet the exigences of local and special func-

tions, will be further considered in describing the ultimate structure of the
several gland-organs of the body. Over the intestine the blood-vessels ramify

in accordance with a special plan of subdivision. This observation applies

also to all the other constructional elements of the organism : each is provided

Awith its peculiar order of blood-vessels.  subordinate system of blood-

vessels, distinct and remarkable in its anatomical relations, is susceptible of

demonstration in all Annelids in which the peritoneal fluid exists. These
vessels may generally be distinguished by their coiled length, perfect naked-

ness, and floating in the fluid of the cavity, and liwbranching (see again fig.

8, g,g,g). And, finally, it must impress the physiologist with surprise, that
amid so great apparent complexity of arrangement in the blood-vessels of the
Annelida, it should be possible to reduce the movement of the blood to a
single definite orbit of remarkable simplicity. The anatomical details now

presented suffice to establish the general propositions formerly enounced,

which indicated only two circles of motion, longitudinal in the primary trunks,

circular in the secondary.

 --Integumentary System. The integumentary system will anatomically in-

clude a consideration of the whole apparatus of the appendages, wherever

these latter are found to exist. In the organization of the Annelida, no part
presents such constancy and fixity of character as the hard elements of the

appendages. They constitute the least fallacious ground for the classifica-

tion of species. The soft elements, on the contrary, are liable to endless
variations from age and the accidents of growth. The appendages in all

cases are true productions of the integ\unentary structures. In no instance

do they exhibit any connexion whatever with the visceral and intestinal

systems. All Annelida are comprised in the twofold division of Branchiata

and Abranchiata ; this however is neither an unobjectionable nor a convenient
distribution. Several species exist, of which the soft pedal appendages do not

contain a specially organized branchial element: this remark is true of all the
Syllidce. The proposition is notwithstanding not difficult of anatomical
proof, that the Annelida are really divisible into those which have and into

those which have not external and apparent branchial organs. M. Dumeril

had realized a clear conception of the practicableness of such a division,

when he proposed the terms Cryptobranchia and Gym7iobra?ichia as expressive

of this bipartite arrangement. Far-sighted and sagacious as must have been

the views which suggested this general proposition, the word Cryptobranchia

involves an anatomical untruth : there exists no species in which the branchiae

are internal or concealed. Respiration in all those destitute of external

appendages is performed internally, but not by any specially constructed

organs. This function, under such circumstances, devolves either upon the

general walls of the alimentary canal or external surface of the body, as in

the Borlasiudce, Gordiusida. ; or it is enacted by the fluid, which, in nearly
all the Abranchiate genera (except the Leech and the Earth-worm), occupies
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  191

the peritoneal cavity. One or two exceptions only can be urged against the
statement that all Annelida breathe either by an external or an internal me-

chanism ; in the former case special organs are nearly always provided, in the
latter never. All the external branchial appendages are again subdivisible
into two leading varieties, radically and essentially distinguishable. In one,
the branchial organ is constructed with special reference to the exposure of
the blood-proper to the agency of the respiratory element ; in the other, the
branchia is a mere hollow process filled with the chyl-aqueous fluid of the

peritoneal cavity. Without this division, which is now for the first time sub-

mitted to the consideration of the physiologist, no correct ideas could have
been formed with refei'ence to the nature or the mechanism of the process of
respiration in those genera of Annelids in which the true-blood, in proper
blood-vessels, is not brought directly under the action of the surrounding
water. Neither is it possible, without the new light afforded by this theory,
to comprehend the manner in which the function of breathing is discharged
in the Entozoa, in which the integuments are perfectly devoid of proper

blood-vessels.

    The blood-proper in the external branchia of the Annelida is distributed
on two distinct plans. According to one method, & plexus of blood-vessels
embraces the circumference of the branchial process (fig. a, a, a, a) ; while
under the other type, the axis of the appendages is traversed longitudinally
by a single blood-vessel, which at the extreme end returns upon itself. The

NereidtB present examples of the former type, the genera Spio, Cirrhaiulus,

Eunice, &c., of the latter (figs. 16, 18).

    The body of the Annelid is for the most part vermiform in figure ; it is
generally cylindrical in outline, but frequently flattened, or more or less oval.
It is composed of a longitudinal succession of annuli or rings, which first
suggested, as already stated, the name of the class to the mind of Lamarck.
In structure these rings are neither horny nor calcareous ; they are always
fleshy and soft. The true Annelid is distinguished therefore from the true
articulated animal in the perfect absence of any approach to a hard skeleton.
The segmentations are divided from each other only by a circular band of

muscular fibres ; the annular segments are not, as in the Articulata, perfectly
distinct from each other ; the longitudinal muscles pass over and under the

constricting circular bands. The segmentation therefore is not real, it is only
apparent. The rings form the bases of the appendages ; the latter grow out
 of the former. The structure of each is produced laterally under various
 shapes to constitute the foot. The feet are never situated perfectly dorsally
 or perfectly ventrally, always more or less laterally. Each appendage, that
 is, the lateral processes of each segment, is divisible from above downwards
into a dorsal and ventral half. The dorsal group of appendages is called the
superior or dorsal foot, comprehending a cirrus, which may be flat or oar-
shaped, tapering or cylindriform ; a true branchia, which in shape may be a
 tapering lamelliform naked vascular, or cylindriform and ciliated process;
 and lastly spines, which are imbedded in the central substance of the foot for
 the purposes of mechanical support, and setse or bristles, of numerously

 varied forms, for the purposes of locomotion or tube-making. In each foot

--then there is discernible, 1st, abranchial organ, which is generally developed

 on the dorsal moiety ; 2nd, a tactile process or cirri, which are for the most
 part of largest size in the superior foot ; and 3rd, the setae and spines, which
 are constant in shape, although diff'ering at the anterior, middle, and posterior
 thirds of the body. The annular segments are most distinctly marked in the
 middle third of the body, least so at the tail. In many genera the cirri are
--192 REPORT 1851.

extremely exaggerated at the head ; this fact is exemplified in the Syllidce.

The tentacular cirri of the Nereidce are instances of the same development.
Both the fleshy and branchial appendages in the dorsibranchiate Annelids
are more or less suppressed in the ventral feet.

   The further study of these complex and compound organs, the appendages,

--will be more advantageously prosecuted under the threefold division of, 1st,
--the branchial ; 2ndly, the tactile and locomotive ; and 3rd, the setae.

    Branchial Processes. In nearly all the species of the genus Serptila, the
true branchiae are grouped around the cephalic extremity, in two divisions,
one on either side of the mouth ; the feet in these tubicolous worms are com-
posed exclusively of the setae. The branchial processes are remarkably com-
plex in their minute structure (Plate IV. fig. 11, A). Projecting in a comb-
like form from the head, and tinted variously and beautifully in different
species, they ai-e admirably adapted for the exposure of the blood to the influ-
ence of the surrounding medium. Each process is supported by a camerated
frame or basis (fig. 1 1 , A, a), large and distinct in the back of the comb, from
which are sent off, on one side only, a double row of secondary processes,
corresponding to the teeth of the comb. This supporting framework is com-
posed of an extremely delicate and flexible cartilage, the chambers of which
are filled by a limpid fluid, which is in communication with that of the peri-
toneal cavity ; an afferent and efferent blood-vessel, in parallelism, accompany
this frame-structure. In the secondary processes (fig. 11, A") the two ves-
sels (b, b') are brought towards the inferior aspect, to which the vibratile cilia
are in some species limited.

   The cilia are large and vigorous, and cause the current, resulting from
their vibration, to set strongly in the direction of the mouth. The branchiae
therefore in the genus Serpula are rendered at once, by virtue of their pecu-
liar structure and situation, subservient to the two grand oftices of respira-
tion and prehension. By these sedentary Annelids, and that necessarily from
the nature of, and the mode in which they obtain their food, a large quantity

of water is swallowed ; this circumstance suggests an explanation of the fact
that in the Serpula and Sabellce the interior of intestine throughout the
rectal or posterior third of its extent, is lined by active vibratile epithelium.

By the ceaseless agency of these cilia, a projecting force is imparted to the

fluid emerging at the inferior orifice, which reacting against the bottom of
the tube, assumes the direction of an upward tending current, and maintains
the tube in the best sanitary condition, and the animal always, within and

without, in contact with a constantly renewed stream of fresh water. When

the animal is about to retire into its cell, the branchiae are furled into a
compact ball, which is drawn under cover of the strong membranous hood
situated at the base of the branchial tuft, and the whole compressed and pro-

tected by the retracted operculum. More minutely watched, the process of
furling the branchiae discovers other refinements of mechanism. Each
separate secondary process is first rolled upon itself into a minute concentric
coil ; this movement begins at the extreme end of each process, and rapidly
creeps towards the base, at which moment the axis or vertical shaft rolls
concentrically upon itself, and every trace of the gill disappears, so exqui-
sitely perfect is the packing. By this movement of folding, both the blood-
movement and the vibration are arrested. The process of unfurling is the

reverse of that described (fig. 11, A).

   The preceding description applies almost in every minute particular to the
ultimate structure of the branchial appendages of the Sabellce, in which

--geaus these organs affect a corresponding cephalic situation, in Sabella d

sang vert, S. vesiculosa, S. Unispira, and in Sabina Poppcea*. Like

those of the Serpulce, the branchiae in the Sabellce and Sabince subserve the

double office of determining an alimentary current towards the mouth, and

of aerating the blood. In these genera, the true-blood, in its proper vessels, is
the subject of the respiratory change, and not the peritonealfluid ; the branchiae
are organized with this express intention. This is a point of extreme intei-est,

to which attention will be drawn under each successive species, as the de-

scription proceeds.

   The genus Amphitrite is distinguished from the former by the distribution
of the branchiae over the dorsal aspect of the body. To this rule however

exceptions occur in some species, as in A.auricoma, in which the branchige

constitute comb-like appendages on either side of the third and fourth

cephalic rings of the body. In A. alveolata, which expresses the typical

structure, the branchial processes are situated on the dorsal surface of the

body, except the caudal portion, on which they do not exist. They may be

described as tapering, prominent, blood-red appendages (fig. 12, a, a'), carry-

ing in their interior, axiallj% a single longitudinal blood-vessel, which at the

distal extremity returns upon itself (fig. 12, b, b'). By Quatrefagesf this

vessel is figured and described as giving off lateral transverse branches, which

envelope the circumference of the appendage : such an arrangement does

not exist ; an appearance leading to such an error may be readily produced

by pressure. The axis of each process is hollow, and perforated by the fluid

of the visceral cavity ; it is along this hollow axis that the blood-vessel pro-
ceeds from the attached to the free end of the process (fig. 12, b, b'). So

great is the disproportion between the quantity of blood carried by these ves-

sels and the volume of the peritoneal fluid which penetrates the process, that

in this genus also the respiratory function may be affirmed to be limited almost

Aexclusively to the true-blood.  spirally arranged line of large vibratile cilia,

coiling from the base to the apex of each appendage, provides for the con-

stant renewal of the aerating medium (fig. 12, a). In Amphitrite, the tenta-

cles, grouped into tufts on either side of the mouth, are organized on a plan

not dissimilar from that of the branchiae-proper. They consist of fleshy fila-

ments, irritable and flexible in the highest degree, hollow on the axis, carrying

a single minute longitudinal blood-vessel returning upon itself, and penetrated

by the fluid of the visceral cavity. They differ from the branchiae in the im-

portant fact of the absence of cilia. In A. auricoma the branchial combs

are attached by a single root, expand and divide in a pectinated manner, each

tooth carrying only a single longitudinal vessel.

This species indicates a transition from the typical Amphitrite to the

Terebellce.

In the genus Terebella the branchial organs appear under the form of

blood-red tufts, proceeding from three separate root-vessels on either side
of the occiput. The vessels divide for the most part dichotomously, forming

an arborescent bunch of naked florid blood-vessels ; each ramusculus is

enclosed in a delicate cuticular envelope, perfectly destitute of cilia : each
ramusculus is also double, that is, it is composed of an aff"erent and efferent

vessel. Although extremely transparent and attenuated, the cuticular struc-
ture, embracing these branchial blood-vessels, must include some contractile
fibres, since each separate ramusculus may be emptied, rendered bloodless,

shrivelled, by the compression of the parietes. This provision for reinforcing

the circulating powers exists in various parts of the circulating system of the

Annelida. It may be affirmed generally, that in all true Terebellce the
branchiae occur under the character of naked uncilicUed blood-vessels

restricted to the occipital rings of the body.
    In Terebella nebulosa they form thick rich tufts ; in T. conchilega they

are less prominent ; in the small species they are scarcely visible, but in all
the structure is identical.

    The cephalic tentacles in the Terebellce constitute, unquestionably, auxiliary
organs of respiration, not for the aeration of the blood-proper, but for that
of the peritoneal fluid, by which they are freely and copiously penetrated.
They present a problem interesting alike to the physiologist and the mecha-
nician. From their extreme length and vast number, they expose an exten-
sive aggregate surface to the agency of the surrounding medium. They

 consist, in T. nebulosa, of hollowflattened tubular filaments, furnished with

strong muscular parietes. The band may be rolled longitudinally into a
 cylindrical form, so as to enclose a hollow cylindrical space, if the two edges
 of the band meet, or a semi-cylindrical space if they only imperfectly meet.
 This inimitable mechanism enables each filament to take up and firmly grasp,
 at any point of its length, a molecule of sand ; or if placed in a linear series,
 a roio of molecules. But so perfect is the disposition of the muscular fibres
 at the extreme free end of each filament, that it is gifted with the twofold
 power of acting on the sucking and on the muscular principle. When the
 tentacle is about to seize an object, the extremity is drawn in, in consequence
 of the sudden reflux of fluid in the hollow interior ; by this movement a

 cup-shaped cavity is formed, in wJiich the object is securely held by atmo-
 spheric pressure ; this pover is however immediately aided by the contraction
 of the circular muscular fibres. Such then are the marvellous instruments
 by which these peaceful worms construct their habitation, and probably
 sweep their vicinity for food. The inferior aspect of each of these tentacles
 is profusely clothed with cilia, and this side is thinner than the dorsal. The
 peritoneal fluid, which is so richly corpusculated, and which freely enters the
 hollow axes of all these tentacles, is thus brought into artful contact with

 the surrounding water. To deny to such a mechanism the express design of

 aerating the organic fluid by which they are distended, were indeed to argue
 against the strongest probability. The minute blood-vessel which runs in
 the hollow axial space along the whole extent of the filament is so dispro-
 portionately small in comparison with the volume of the peritoneal fluid by
 which this space is filled, that the former cannot reasonably be supposed to
 share in the respiratory function of these organs. In addition to the two
  important uses already assigned to the tentacles in the Terebella, they con-
 stitute also the leal agents of locomotion. They are first outstretched by
 the forcible injection into them of the peritoneal fluid, a process which is ac-
 complished by the undulatory contraction of the body from behind forwards

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

 they are then fixed, like so many microscopic cables, to a distant surface,
  and shortening in their lengths, they haul forwards a step or two the helpless
 carcass of the worm.

      In T. conchilega, the cephalic tentacles are inferior to those of the former

 species in number and size ; they are also difl'erently configurated. They
  approach the prismatic in outline ; in transverse section they present a trira-
  diate shape. In minute structure, mechanism of action and uses, they
 coincide in the most exact manner with the tentacles of T. nebulosa. It is
  not a little curious that in the Terebella, these organs, which are homologous

  with true cirri, should be so richly provided with vibratile cilia, while the
 true- blood branchiae are entirely destitute of these motive organisms. Nothing
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  195

but the view propounded in this memoir, with reference to the share taken
by the peritoneal fluid in the function of respiration, will enable the phy-

siologist to reconcile this apparent incongruity.

   The dorsibranchiate order comprehends a considerable proportion of the
class Annelida. Of them, Cuvier remarks, "Ont leur organs et surtout leur
branchies distribues a-peu-pres egalement le long de tout leur corps, ou au
moins de sa partie moyenne." In the Cuvierian arrangement, at the head
of this order stands the genus Arenicola. Respiration is performed in
Arenicola Piscatorwn by means of naked blood-vessels, projecting at the
root of the setiferous process upwards and outwards one-fourth of an inch
in the adult worm from the surface of the body (fig. 13). They are limited
in number and distribution to the fourteen or sixteen middle annuli of the
body. They are commonly described as forming an arborescent tuft ; the

division of the vessels is however regulated by a fixed principle. When fully

injected with blood, the vessels of each branchia form a single plane (fig. 13),
rising obliquely above and across the body, and immediately behind each
brush of setae. In the adult animal each gill is composed of from twelve to
sixteen primary branches (fig. 12, a, a), proceeding from a single trunk, which
arises from the great dorsal vessel ; the vessels in the branchial tuft describe
zigzag outlines ; the secondary branches project from the salient point, or the
outside of each angle of the zigzags ; and the tertiary from similar points on
the secondary branches. This mode of division, occurring in one plane, and
in all the smaller branches, results in a plexus of vessels of extreme beauty of
pattern or design. Each branchial tuft, and each individual vessel possess an in-
dependent power of contraction ; in the contracted state the tuftalmost entirely
disappears, so completely effected is the emptying of the vessels. The con-

traction, or systole, in any given tuft occurs at frequent but irregular inter-

vals ; this movement does not take place simultaneously in all the branchiae,
but at different periods in different tufts. As there is no heart-like dilata-

tion in the afferent vessels of the branchiae (fig. 10,/,/), the contractile
power with which the exposed branches are endowed, becomes an important

means of reinforcing the branchial circulation. The vessels appear quite
naked, and if examined in the living state, each ramuscule seems to consist
only of a single trunklet ; if this were really the case, it would of course re-
solve itself into a tube ending in a cul-de-sac, and the blood movement would
 be a flux and reflux ; but by injection it is easy to show that the finest divi-

 sion of the branchial arbuscle contains a double vessel (fig. 13, B), enveloped

in a common muscular, although extremely diaphanous sheath. That these

 vascular sheaths, which are only fine productions of the integuments, are
 furnished with voluntary muscular fibres, is proved by the rapid and simultane-

 ous retraction of all the branchiae into the interior of the body, which follows

 when the animal is touched. This sheathing of the blood-vessels with true
 muscular coats is a frequent character of the circulating system of the Anne-

 lida; it is a power which compensates the absence of a heart. It is extremely

 interesting to watch in the young Arenicola, the manner in which one little

 blood-vessel after another, in the progress of growth, shoots slowly from its

 stock-branch. In Arenicola, as in all Annelida in which the vessels of these

 organs are naked, the branchiae are destitute of vibratile cilia. It will be

 found that under such circumstances, viz. when the branchial vessels occur as
 naked projections from the external surface, the description now given of

  these organs in Arenicola will apply in every minute respect of structure to

  all other Annelida. It will prove exact in relation to the structure of the

  branchiae in the several species of the beautiful genus Euphrosyne of Savigny.

 In E.foliosa (M. E.) the branchial vessels form larger and richer tufts, having

                                                                          o2

a similar situation in relation to the setiferous feet. These organs assume

the same character in E. laureata (S.). The elegant worm described by Au-
douin and M.-Edwards* is furnished with branchial organs in form of ar-

buscles of naiied vessels, after the pattern of those of the dorsibranchiate

Annelids now described. Under the genus Amphinome, occurs Plerone tetrae-
dra (of Savignj'), in which the breathing organs assume the form of larger
florid bunches of naked blood-vessels, situated on the dorsal aspect of the
body, each tuft being protected in front by a bundle of strong bristles. These
organs assume a still more beautiful form in Chloeia capillata, in which the
division of the vessels occurs on the bipinnate principle.

   The genus Eunice presents another and diiferent type of branchial vessels.
Arranged in a prominent row of bright vessels, standing erect as minute
combs at the dorsal base of each foot in the body, the branchiae impart to all
the species of this genus a graceful and characteristic appearance. In every

species the branchial vessels divide on a uniform plan peculiar to this genus.

The primary trunk rises vertically along the inner side of the branchia, and
sends off from its outer side, at intervals, straight vessels, which gradually
decrease in size from below upwards : each branch forms a straight undi-
viding vessel, curving gently upwards and towards the median line: these
branches become in their number ciiaracteristic and distinctive of species.
In some of the smaller species inhabiting the British coasts, the branchiae are
composed only of a single vessel ; this is the case also with the young of the
larger species ; in others they vary from the single vessel to the number of six
and eight. In Eunice gigantea, according to the figures of Milne-Edwards,
the vessels of each branchia amount to thirty-six in number. These vessels,
although perfectly naked and unciliated, like those of Arenicola, are both
less contractile and retractile ; they extend in this genus from the head to
the tail, and equal in number the annular segments of the body. In the dor-
sibranchiate genera, the branchial organs of which have now been described,
the true-blood circulating in its proper vessels, has been proved to be exclu-
sively the seat and subject of the respiratory process. The fluid of the peri-
toneal cavity, abundant in quantity, and highly organized though it be in the

genera j^ist reviewed, does not in the least degree participate in this great
function. Judged by such a test, the genera of this grand order of worms
should be marshalled under two primary groups, of which one (embi'acing
the preceding species) would comprehend those in which the function of
breathing devolves exclusively on the true-h\oo(\, while the other would be
characterized by the fact that the branchiae are organized such as to permit
more or less completely the exposure, in conjunction with the blood-proper,
of the chyl-aqueous fluid of the visceral cavity, to the influence of the sur-
rounding aerating element. It will be seen in the succeeding description,
that when the branchial apparatus is penetrated thus by two separate and
distinct fluids, coordinate probably in organic properties, the vascular system

of the body generally will be found by so much the less developed by how
much the peritoneal fluid supplants the blood in the branchiae. The structure

--of the branchial organs becomes thus a significant test of the position of any

given species in the Annelidan scale, those being entitled to the highest
rank of which the respiratory organs are exclusively designed for the expo-
sure of the blood-proper to the action of the oxygenating medium, those to
the lowest in which the peritoneal fluid alone circulates in the branchiae.

The subgenera Lycidice, Aglaura, and (Enone, of the genus Eunice, are
distinguished in the circumstances now defined, from all the former genera
of the dorsibranchiate order. Naked, unciliated blood-vessels no longer in

them form exclusively the branchial organs : loose and large-celled tissue is

superadded to the proper blood-vessels, which are far less in relative size

than those in the former variety of branchiae ; into the cells of this tissue the
fluid of the visceral cavity insinuates itself, its course being marked by a slow

motion. There exists however another point of structural difference between

the branchial organs of this group and those of the former ; this difference

--admits of the following general expression, that whei'ever the fluid of the

peritoneal cavity is admitted into the interior of the branchial organs, the

latter are invariably supplied more or less profusely with vibratile cilia.

In the genus Lycidice the branchia consists of a flat, lanceolate process,

more or less developed, surrounded marginally by a blood-vessel, the mid-

space between the lines of the advancing and returning vessels being com-

posed of large-celled tissue, lacunose, into which the peritoneal fluid pene-

trates by a flux and reflux movement. The branchiae in L. Ninetta are situ-

ated dorsally, and are supplied at their bases with single rows of vibratile

cilia. Those of Aglaura fulgida are similarly constructed, although they

differ slightly from those of the former genus in size and figure. In CEnone

maculata they occur under a more developed form, constituting flattened,

pointed trowel-shaped processes, the plane of which is vertical with reference

Ato that of the body.  blood-vessel, as in the former cases, trends along the

borders, immediately beneath the cuticle. The course of these vessels is

followed by a row of large and prominent vibratile cilia.

In the branchial system of the genus Nereis (Cuv.), Lycoris (Savigny),

the minute anatomist encounters a structure strikingly different from any-

thing hitherto described. Whether round or laminated, the true branchiae

in this genus are always penetrated by the fluid of the visceral cavity, and

the blood-vessels assume a peculiar disposition. When the branchial pro-

cess is conical in shape, its base is embraced by a reticulated plexus of true

blood-vessels (fig. 14, a, a, a, a), which is situated quite superficially and

immediately beneath the epidermis. These vessels are most prominently

developed on the dorsal-most process, which therefore may be called the

Abranchial, but they extend more or less over all the cirri.  better charac-

teristic of the branchiae, both the conical and the foliaceous, in the Nereids,

is that of their being penetrated by the peritoneal fluid. In those species in

which the branchial process is round, the interior of the base is hollow, and
filled with the fluid of the visceral chamber. Floating in this fluid may be

seen, when viewed transparently,coils of naked blood-vessels; in those in which

they are laminated or foliaceous, as in Nereis renalis, the step of the exterior

surface does not extend beyond the limits of the base, the flat portion, how-

и ever, tunnelled by straight spacious canals (fig. 14, b, b), which radiate with

great regularity from the base to the expanded circumference of the process.

In these canals the corpuscles of the peritoneal fluid may be seen rolling to

and fro, advancing and returning in the same channel. These movements

are regulated by those of the great current in the chamber of the perito-

neum. This type of structure prevails in Nereis renalis, N. longissima,

and in a slightly modified form, in consequence of the less flattened shape of

the branchiae, in N. viridis. The round variety of branchial processes

obtains in N. margaritacea, N. Dumerillii, N. fucata, N. pelagica, and
N. brevimanus. It is a fact difficult to explain that the branchial organs

in the Nereids should be destitute in every species of vibratile cilia.

   The laminated or foliaceous type attains the point of its maximum deve-

lopment in the branchial appendages of the genus Phyllodoce (fig. 15).
It was difficult to assign any other than a respiratory use to the rich, leaf-

like projections in these beautiful worms. In the absence of all ideas

tending to a knowledge of the nature and capabilities of the fluid con-

tents of the visceral chamber, the real meaning of the radiating channels

(fig. 15, a, a, a) by which the respiratory laminae are perforated, and therefore

of the mechanism of the function of which they are the scene, never could

have been rightly apprehended. It was only by mistaking the peritoneal fluid

for blood that the branchial office of these appendages could have been pre-

dicated, and this very mistake has been committed by M. Quatrefages. The

branchiae in Phyllodoce viridis are prominent dorsal appendages : in this

worm the blood-system can be traced only by a few scanty vessels distributed

over the roots of these processes ; nor are the canals very spacious and di-
stinct ; they are more like lacunar in a spongy tissue. In P. bilineata and
P. lamelligera, the radiating passages, distinct from each other, and communi-

cating only indirectly through cells, are extremely obvious under the micro-

scope (fig. 15, Ф, a, a). They carry the fluid of the peritoneal cavity, the
corpuscles of which may be seen flowing and ebbing in the same channel.

Nothing can, however, more conclusively prove the true branchial character

of these laminae than the presence of cilia, the vibrations of which can be

observed only at the edges of the respiratory laminae. These are best seen

in P. lamelligera. This is a striking point of distinction between the Phyl-

lodoce and the Nereids, in which vibratile cilia on the branchiae have no

existence. The peritoneal fluid then may now be affirmed as that, in the

ceconomy of the Phyllodoce, which is the subject exclusively of the respira-

tory function, the true blood receiving its supply of oxygen from this fluid,

afterwards to convey it to the solid structures of the body.

In the genus Glycera the blood-proper is entirely excluded from the organs

of respiration. This office devolves exclusively on the chyl-aqueo.us fluid,

which in nearly all the species of this genus is profusely supplied with red

corpuscles. The gills consist of hollow cylindrical appendages (fig. 16, a),

emanating from the base of each dorsal foot at its superior aspect, filled in

the interior with the fluid of the visceral cavity ; but, what is remarkable in

the structure of these organs and quite peculiar to this genus, is that the

interior parietes of the cylindrical hollow of the branchiae is lined with

vibratile cilia ; these motive organules cause the corpuscles of the fluid by
which the branchiae are penetrated, to move with great rapidity in a definite

direction, viz. peripherally on one side and centrally along the other, each

corpuscle whirling on its own own axis as it proceeds. Ciliary vibration

cannot be detected on the outside of the branchial appendage.

It is a feature of structure more strikingly illustrated in Glycera than in

any other Annelid, that whenever the peritoneal fluid is the subject of the re-

spiratory function, it is brought into the branchial organ in much greater re-

lative proportion than the blood-proper when it is the subject of this process
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and the branchiae are always constructed in adaptation to this difference.

In the SyllidcB the branchial organs (fig. 17) are penetrated only by the

peritoneal fluid, but it can be detected in motion only in the bases of the feet,

and these parts only are furnished with vibratile cilia, which are large and

active. The long filiform and, in some species, moniliform appendages which

are described commonly as the branchiae of these worms, have no central

hollow (fig. 17, a) ; they are filled with large-celled tissues through which

the fluid parts of the contents of the visceral cavity slowly penetrate. But in

the spacious chambers occupying the bases of the feet (fig. 17, b), a whirl-
pool of the peritoneal fluid may be readily observed. The structure now de-

scribed is very perfectly typified in S. prolifera; the moniliform variety is

in the genera loida and Psamathe of Dr. Johnston. In the Syllidan family^

which excels all others in grace and beauty, the proper blood-system is almost
indetectable, in consequence of the colourlessness of the contents. It may be
stated with confidence that blood-vessels do not enter into the structure of
the branchial processes. The respiration therefore devolves exclusively on

the chyl-aqueous fluid.

   Amongst the family Ariciadce, first defined by Audouin and Milne-Ed-

wards, several other varieties in the configuration of the breathing organs
occur. In the genera Leucodore, Nerine and Aricia, the branchial appen-
dages affect a dorsal situation. In every species they are traversed from
base to apex by a single blood-vessel returning upon itself (fig. 18, a). This
vessel, however, is supported by a lobule of spongy tissue (fig. 18, b), into the

cells of which the fluid of the visceral chamber penetrates. The office of re-
spiration in this family is therefore discharged in part by the blood and in
part by the chyl-aqueous fluid. In every species of this family the branchiae
are supplied by vibratile cilia having a distinct disposition in each. Lincodore
ciliatus, on the dorsal aspect, and over the posterior two-thirds of the body,
is covered on either side with a row of flattened conical branchial processes,
blood-red in colour and richly ciliated. They are largest anteriorly and small-
est near the tail. The cilia are disposed in a spiral line from the attached to
the extreme end. Viewed with a high magnifying power, and transparently,
a camerated axis, composed of exquisitely fine hyaline cartilage, may be dis-
covered, fulfilling on the branchiae of this elegant little boring Annelid the
office of mechanical support, as a similar structure was formerly shown to

do in those of the Sabellcs.
   In the genus Spio or Nerine the respiratory organs occur under forms of

the highest beauty (Plate V. fig. 18). They constitute flat, membranous,
penknife-shaped appendages, curving gracefully over the back with the curve
of the " ring " of the body by which they are supported, and crossing over the
dorsal median line and alternating with the corresponding process of the other
side. The plane of each process is vertical in relation to the longitudinal
axis of the body ; they lie therefore one over the other in an imbricate
manner. They are less flat and close in N. vulgaris than in N.coniocephala.
They are largest in size towards the middle of the body ; smallest anteriorly
and posteriorly. The blood-vessels, the aff"erent and efferent (a, fig. 18),
run close to and parallel with the inferior border of the process ; the upper
part of each is composed of a membranous lobular addition to the inferior
and vascular portion. Into the cells of this lobule the chyl-aqueous fluid

slowly finds its way, and participates obviously in the office of respiration.
In N. coniocephala it is remarkable that the cilia should be limited in their
distribution to the margin along which the true blood-vessel runs. This
fact is less manifest in N. vulgaris in consequence of the smallness of the
membranous lobule. In Aricia Cuvieri the branchial appendages are more
conical in figure, more vertical in position, and developed only at the poste-
rior four-fifths of the body. They are covered with large vibratile cilia, which
likewise extend over that segment of the dorsum which separates the bases
of the branchiae. Like those of the preceding genera, they are supplied with

spongy tissue (fig. 18, b) for the exposure of the peritoneal fluid*. It may
have been remarked that in all the members of the preceding family the real

branchial organ has consisted of an evolved or exaggerated development of
the superior element of the dorsal foot. In the genus Nephthys, which
comes now under review, it is the inferior element of the dorsal foot which
 becomes the subject of this evolution. Nephthys Hombergii oi our coasts

    * I have described a species of Aricia in which these branchial organs are entirely sup-

pressed.
--200 REPORT 1851.

is a remarkably vigorous and active worm, and yet its organ of breathing
consists only of a comparative small curved ciliated process, situated under
cover of the dorsal foot, and carrying only a single-looped vessel. It may
be mentioned as an interesting proof of the real appropriation of this process
in Nephthys to the function of breathing, that the same process, although
similarly shaped, on the ventral or inferior foot, is not provided with cilia,
nor is it penetrated by any blood-vessel.

    The genus Cirrhatulus of Lamarck, and the allied group constituted by
Savigny under the name of Ophelia, introduces to the physiologist another

modification of the branchial organs within the limits of the dorsibranchiate

order. As in the preceding families, they are in these latter only ' develop-
ments' of the dorsal cirri. In Cirrhatulus Lamarckii (fig. 19, a, Ф), a linear
series of yellowish, and blood-red threads, remarkably irritable and contrac-
tile, project to a considerable distance, from either side of the body, through-
out its whole length ; at the occiput, however, they are arranged in a crown-
like form. These beautiful filaments, which are obviously designed to fulfil
the twofold office of touch and respiration, appear under the microscope to

consist only of a single blood-vessel enclosed in a delicate sheath of integu-
ment. Closer analysis, however, discovers ttvo vessels (fig. 19, a") in each
of these filaments, and traces of longitudinal and circular muscular fibres in

the investing sheath. By the contraction of this sheath, the enclosed vessels
may be completely emptied of their blood from one end of the filament to

the other. This contraction does not take place simultaneously in every
part, but undulatorily, the wave motion beginning at the extreme fore-end.
It is especially to be noted, that, in this variety of appendage, in which the
respiratory is only an incidental function, there exist 7io vibratile cilia. These
organs in Ophelia coarctata exhibit analogous characters, while they are less

numerous and much shorter*. The Aphroditacea constitute a group of An-
nelids to which the term " dorsibranchiate " by no means correctly applies
that is, in the majority of the species embraced in this order no branchial

appendages exist either on the dorsum, or any other part of the body. Respi-
ration is performed on a novel principle, of which no illustration occurs in
any other family of worms. In all Aphroditacece the blood is colourless.

The blood-system is in abeyance, while that of the chyl-aqueous is exagge-
rated. Although less charged with organic elements than that of other

orders, the fluid of the peritoneal cavity in this family is unquestionably the

exclusive medium through which oxygen is absorbed. The true Aphrodite
type of respiration occurs in Aphrodita acideata. In this species the tale of
the real uses of the ' elytra' or scales is plainly told. Supplied with a com-
plex apparatus of muscles, they exhibit periodical movements of elevation
and depression. Overspread by a coating of felt readily permeable to the
water, the space beneath the scales during their elevation becomes filled with
a large volume oi filtered water, which during the descent of the scales is
forcibly emitted at the posterior end of the body. It is important to remark

that the current thus established laves only the exterior of the dorsal region
of the body. It nowhere enters the internal cavities; the latter are every-

where shut out by a membranous partition from that spacious exterior
enclosure bounded above by the felt and the elytra. In this species the peri-
toneal chamber is very capacious, and filled by a fluid which only in a slight
degree contains organized particles. The complex and labyrinthic appen-
dages of the stomach We floating in this fluid, and in the chambers which

divide the roots of the feet. * From this relation of contact between the peri-
toneal fluid and the digestive CEeca, loMch are alioays Jilled hy a dark green

chyle, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that the contained fluid is
really a reservoir wherein the oxygen of the external respiratory current,

already described, becomes accumulated. From the peritoneal fluid the

aerating element extends in the direction of the caeca, and imparts to their
contents a higher character of organization. These contents, thus prepared
by a sojourn in the casca of the stomach, become the direct pabulum for
replenishing the true blood which is distributed in vessels over the parietes

of these chylous repositories. The sequence of events now indicated will
convey to the mind of the physiologist a clear idea of the mechanism of
the processes both of respiration and sanguification. It cannot have escaped
observation that there prevails a striking resemblance between the general
anatomy of Aphrodita aculeata and that of the Asteridse among the Echi-
noderms. The point of junction thus established between the Echinoderms
and Annelida is as obvious and natural as that which exists between the
SipuncididcB and the Nemertinidce. It is thus constantly observed by the
philosophical anatomist that in the animal kingdom adjacent classes are
linked together into a continuous series at more than one point.

   In the genus Palmyra no external respiratory appendage is provided
although theyee^ of the Aphrodite are absent, the elytra in the elegant Pal-

myra aurifera generate a true branchial current.
    This observation is also true of the family of the Polynoe. These worms

are destitute of external branchial processes. The fleshy cirri, by which the
true respiratory appendages of Sigalion Boa are represented in the Polynoe,
are solid, not hollow and ciliated, and further situated only on every third or
fourth foot. The f}.uid of the peritoneal cavity in these worms is voluminous
it is little corpusculated, like that of ^. aculeata, and moreover the stomach in
 the genus Polynoe is more or less extended laterally in form of diverticula.
 The organisation of the familiar Sea Mouse therefore conveys exact ideas
 with reference to the principles of structure on which nearly all the scale-
 clad worms are formed. In all ' the scales ' are mechanical, and very skil-

 fully contrived instruments for generating true branchial currents. In Siga-

lion Boa, however (fig. 20, Ф), which is a worm considerably more elon-

 gated than the Polynoe, an exception occurs to the principle observed in

 the other scale-clad worms ; i. e. express external organs of respiration are
 provided. They exist under the character of hollow, cylindrical and curved
 appendages (fig. 20, Ф) emanating by a mammilla under cover of the scales,
 and projecting a short distance beyond their outer edges. These processes are
 profusely lined within, but not without, by vibratile cilia. The corpuscles of the
 peritoneal fluid may be readily brought under the eye, while whirling in the

 interior. In Polynoe semisquamosa, Williams (fig. 21, a), a flat appendage

 is added to the base of the foot, presenting radiating canals for the exposure

 of the peritoneal fluid. It is thus then established by direct demonstration,

 that the fluid contained in the great visceral cavity is the real and exclusive

 subject of the process of oxygenation in these scale-armed Annelids. If this
 fluid consisted only of pure water, that is, if its specific gravity were iden-

 tical with that of the external element, those conditions would exist which
 are least favourable to the interchange of oxygen and carbonic acid. It is
 therefore no departure from cautious reasoning to infer that the oxygen
 received into the peritoneal fluid exerts upon the elements of the latter the
 effect of raising them in the scale of organic fluids, and of preparing them
 for the work of solid nutrition.

     It now remains to consider the mode in which the process of breathing
--202 REPORT 1851.

is accomplished in the Abranchiate Annelids. Of this division of worms,

 it is stated in all systematic works that the function of respiration de-
 volves on " the external cutaneous surface of the body," and this is re-
garded as expressing the principle on which the same function is performed
 in all Entozoa. It will be afterwards proved that between some ╗[)ecies
 of Abranchiate Annelids and some species of Entozoa there really does
 obtain almost an identity of structure, under a striking diversity of ex-

 ternal form. In the Entozoa, however, the space between the peritoneum

and integuments is much larger than in the corresponding species of
 Abranchiate Annelids. The difference affects materially the mechanism in
the two cases of the respiratory process. The Entozoa are remarkable for
 the large amount of the peritoneal fluid ; the true blood-system being in

 proportionate abeyance. In the Abranchiate Annelids, the system of the
 peritoneal fluid is suppressed proportionately to the greater development of

 that of the blood-proper. Here, as in other Annelids, the proportion
 between the system of the chyl-aqueous fluid and that of the true-blood is

 observed to be inverse.

    It may be affirmed as a law of the organization in all abranchiate worms,
 that the system of the blood-proper is more developed on the parietes of the

 intestinal canal than on the integuments. This fact, wherever the peritoneal
 space is obliterated by the adherence of the intestinal cylinder to that of the
 integument, transfers the office of respiration from the latter to the former
 region ; that is, as is practically demonstrable in the instance of Naisjiliformis,
 the large volume of water which is incessantly streaming throughout the
 length of the alimentary canal, holding atmospheric air in solution, while it
 ministers by its organic particles to the nutrition of the system, contributes
 also by the air with which it is mixed, to the great purpose of aerating the
 living fluids of the organism. This is accomplished partly by the exosmose
 of the dissolved air from the m^ra-intestinal into the peritoneal or extra-in-
 testinal space ; and partly by the absorption of it into the true-blood circu-
 lating in the vascular plexus by which the intestinal parietes are embraced.
 In the Entozoa it is not improbable that more of the aerating element is
 derived by the peritoneal fluid ab extra, from the medium on which they are
 parasitic, than ab intra from that which they swallow. Whichever of these
 two great systems of the body (intestinal and integumentary) be entitled to
 the o-reater share in the process of respiration in the Abranchiate Annelids,
 it should be remembered that in the Entozoa the structure of the integuments
 is almost entirely destitute of true-blood-vessels. This fact renders the infer-
 ence probable, that the partition of the integuments, which in the Entozoa is
 thin, is permeated by the gaseous elements without, and that they thus ewfer,

 without meeting much of the true-blood in transitu, into the fluid of the
 visceral cavity, by which it is brought into contact with the solids of the body.

     In the genera Lumbricus and Hirudo, the peritoneal fluid and space being
 very small, the function of breathing falls on the united structure of the
 intestine and integument. These two genera are remarkable for the great
 development of the reproductive organs, which occupy, to crowding, the inter-
 val of the peritoneal cavity ; and for the excessive elaboration of the system

 of the blood-proper.

    The genus Trophonia is characterized, as compared by the former, by an
 increase in the volume of the contents of the peritoneal fluid. Here also all

, traces of external branchiaj are wanting; life is maintained through the
 aerating influence of the chyl-aqueous fluid.
     In the Naides, observation proves beyond doubt, that breathing is accom-

 plished through the medium of the peritoneal fluid; its movements are
          ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.                              203

rapid, and composition highly organized ; in every sense it is organically and

chemically qualified for the discharge of this function.

   By Audouin and Milne-Edwards, in this place in the Annelidan series
is placed the anomalous genus Clymene. No attempt has been made by these

distinguished authors to unravel the anatomy of these eccentric worms. On

the head and body no vestige of external appendage (except the hooks) is

discoverable. At the tail, however, irregularly scalloped, membranous pro-

cesses may be observed, which are in every essential respect to these worms,

what the cephalic processes in them are to the SipunculidcB ; that is, they are

hollow membranous projections of the peritoneal cavity, admirably adapted

to expose the contents of this cavity to the influence of the surrounding

Amedium.  blood-vessel or two may be traced at the roots of these pro-

cesses, being only enough to prove that the system of the blood-proper in

these Annelids is very insufficiently developed to enact the great function of

respiration. The branchial processes of the Clymenidce are not provided with

cilia ; they afford the only illustration in the class Annelida of branchial

organs specialized around the outlet of the alimentary system.

It has now been shown that the branchial organs in the Annelida arrange

themselves under two leading divisions, between which a clearly legible line
of demarcation exists. Under one of these divisions, the blood-vessels bearing

branchiae occur ; under the other, those organized for the exposure of the
chyl-aqueous fluid. It was formerly demonstrated in detail that this fluid,

in larger or smaller volume, and in proportions varying in different species

relatively to those of the true-blood system, occurs in nearly every known
Annelid. When the contents of the latter are well exposed to the agency of

oxygen, no provision in general exists for the exposure of the former fluid ; and
conversely, when the appendages designed for the office of breathing are con-

structed with especial reference to the outspreading of the former to the
aerating medium, blood-vessels are seldom found to enter into their structure.

It is probable therefore that in the ceconomy of the Annelid these two fluids

are co-ordinate elements; they are convertible proximate principles; they

exhibit equal physiological capacities ; both are capable of discharging the

function of respiration, and both are capable of supplying the solids of the

body with the materials of increase.

  --Locomotive and tactile appendages. The cirri and setae of the feet are

included under this head. The former admit of subdivision into two varieties
of which one may be classed as the natatory and the other as the tactile.
 The setae, constituting in many species appendages to the body, of the most
 brilliantly ornamental character, are always important mechanical means of
locomotion. Sensation and locomotion are thus in the Annelida provided
 for by means of organs of elaborate construction. So numerously and inter-

 estingly diversified in number, proportions, and form, are these several parts
 of the feet, that a detailed description of them becomes here necessary in

 order that what is most characteristic in the anatomy of species may be fully-

 expounded. That element of the foot which is dedicated to the function of
 breathing has already been made the subject of minute inquiry. Under the
 present head therefore the branchice will receive no further notice.

    The branchicB and operculum which plume so richly the head in the ge-
 nus Serpula, are endowed with extreme sensibility. This provision super-
 sedes the necessity lor fleshy tactile appendages to the body, which is enclosed
 by the calcareous tube in which the worm lives : in structure and curvature
 these tubes differ in different species. The interior is smooth, not so smooth
 however as to be slippery, nor so hard as to render difficult or impossible the
fixing of the hooks and bristles of the feet, by which the animal is enabled to
--204 REPORT 1851.

rise or descend at will. The body of the Serpula is obviously distinguished into

two parts, of which one may be called the thoracic, and the other the abdomi-

nal. The former is provided with prominent feet, powerfully protrusile, and

a system of strong bristles (Plate VI. fig. 22, a), which during the movement
of the feet run to and fro in the axes of the feet. On the dorsal aspect of these

appendages, a row of microscopic hooks, marked by a minutely dark line,
extending transversely in part round the body, may be discerned (fig. 22, b).
It is by aid of these inimitable instruments that the worm grasps the interior

of the tube. They are wielded by means of long thread-like tendons, fixed

on artful mechanical principles, to the attached end of each hook. During

the action of the muscles, of indescribable delicacy, the hooks are pro-

jected to some distance beyond the plane of the surface on which they repose

"in the inactive state. These singular organs are formed after the pattern of

the common "bill-hook" of farmers, having the edge deeply notched into
teeth, directed downwards. Through the agency of these hooks the worm is

enabled to withdraw itself into its tube with extraordinary precision, rapidity,

and muscular force. In this movement, arithmetic would fail to compute the

number of these instruments, which is simultaneously extruded : their office

is exclusively that of pulling the animal back into its cell. Gifted with such

marvellous instruments, and alarmed by external danger, these elegant
Annelids will retreat with the rapidity of lightning. The advance move-

ment, in which it pushes itself out of its tube, is of course the reverse of the
former; but what is remarkable is, that this movement of emergence is per-

formed by means of organs quite distinct and diffei-ent from those used in

--the act of retreating. In principle of action and construction, these instru-

ments are strikingly dissimilar one is a pidling and the other is a pushing

machine. The setae or bristles, which are protrusile, are the pushing organs

(fig. 22, a). Nothing in nature is so perfect as the adaptation with which
these organules are fitted for the end in view. Each seta is composed of a

strong rigid and unresisting shaft, and an expanded shoulder, drawn out into

a point. On one side of this pointed shoulder may be remarked a double

row of serrations which are admirably calculated to catch against the surface

of contact, forming thereby a firm and fixed point of propelling force.

Computing the pushing force which each seta is capable of exerting, and

multiplying this amount by the number of setae in each foot, and this again

by the number of feet with which the worm is provided, a conception may

be formed of the aggregate of mechanical power with which the animal

Aexecutes its " march forwards."  similar calculation applied to the hooks,

will give a correspondingly prodigious resultant of power for retreat. The

mechanical principles thus imperfectly expounded, will correctly apply in

every particular to the instances of all tubicolous worms ; the hooks perform
one movement, the bristles another. Never before has the meaning of these

matchless instruments been differentially defined. The hooks and the
bristles are characteristic and distinctive of species. By one single micro-

scopic hook or seta, visible only under the highest powers of the microscope,

the naturalist may pronounce the species, and mentally reconstruct the indi-

--vidual no mean triumph for the science of observation I In the Serpuli-

dans, as in all the fixed tubicolous Annelids, the feet near the tail, acting

therefore at the bottom of the tube, are modified in structure with express

reference to the duties of mopping, sweeping, scraping, and wiping the caecal

end of the habitation. The organs for the discharge of these necessary

household duties will be afterwards described more at length in the Amphi-

tritans.

   The SabellcB, like the Serpulidce, are tubicolous ; the tubes of the SabelUs
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.                                      205

are however soft, tenacious, flexible, and muddy. Slimy mucus, furnished
by the integumentary glands of the body, is the mortar or cement, fine sand-
molecules are the ' stones ' or solid material of the architecture. In the

SabellcB, the lime of which the tubes are built is held in solution in the
mucus provided by the cutaneous glands. It is adjusted in the fluid form,
and moulded by appropriate tools into the required shape : it then solidifies ;
solidifies too under water, like the "Aberthaio lime ! " The tube of the Sabellce

fits closely round the body of the worm ; it is slightly elastic, and the interior

is smooth.
   It is a fact of singular mechanical interest, that the thoracicfeel, which vary

in number in different species, are disposed in a manner which is the exact
reverse of that in which the abdominal are arranged ; the latter being distri-
buted over the posterior iths or fths of the body. This remarkable pro-
vision confers manifestly on the inhabitant of the tube, which is frequently
unattached except at its inferior end, the power of rolling on its own axis, of
turning round, in order that it may sweep with its branchiae in search of

food and fresh portions of water, the whole circumference of the circle. This

disposition of the thoracic feet on the dorsal aspect of the body, while the
abdominal are placed on the ventral, with a simplicity of mechanism per-

fectly wonderful, arms the worm with the means oi fixing the tube whilst it
executes its complex movements. If all the feet were disposed on the same
side of the body, this important object, it must be at once obvious to the
mechanician, never could be accomplished. The W'Orm would be a palsied

prisoner in its self-constructed cell.

   The brushes of setae in the thoracic feet point dorsally, and the row of
hooks extend from their bases in the direction of the dorsal median line. The

brushes of the abdominal feet point ventrally, and the row of hooks extend

from their roots transversely in the direction of the ventral median line. It
is evident then that these classes of feet must act in opposite directions. The

hooks slightly vary in form in different species, but the setae in all the species

are constructed on one plan (fig. 23, a). In Sabella a sang vert (M. Edwards),

the hooks (fig. 23, B) are formed by the turning of a finely sharp beak very
much upon itself, the attached╗end or root expanding into a broad base.

From this latter part a very curious claw-like process, surmounting a straight

shaft, proceeds (fig. 23, B), the use of which must consist in tightening the

tube after the hook has been fixed, and that to render the hold of the latter
more secure. The setce present a leaf-like form, and margins strongly toothed

(fig. 23, a). Composed of an unyielding horny material, they are admirably

fitted for pushing ; the feet in these, as in other worms, act in obedience
to the principle of the composition of forces. The forces meeting and uniting

in the ideal axes of the body, or rather in the centre of the body of the

animal, produce a resultant expressed by its raoWon forward.

In Sabella vesiculosa (Montagu), the hooks are formed somewhat differ-

ently. The broad bases observed in the former instance, are replaced by a

tapering curved end to which the muscle is attached (fig. 23, B). The feet

are similarly distinguished into thoracic and abdominal : the setae are con-

structed upon the same precise type. The same disposition of the feet pre-

vails in Sabella unispira (M.-Edwards) ; here, however, the bases of the

hooks are broad, and the claw-like process described in S. a sang vert reap-

pears. The setae preserve the type of construction characteristic of the genus.

The feet in Terebellce are composed only of hooks and setae. The soft

appendages are transferred to the head, where, under the form of tentacles,

Athey assume an extreme degree of development.  full statement of the

history of these remarkable organs has already been given.
206 REPORT-- 1851.

   The Terebellce differ from the SabellcB in the uniformly abdominal position
of the feet and rugae for the hooks. Since the tube \s fixed, this arrange-
ment entails no inconvenience. In another essential respect the Terebellca
are distinguished from the SahellcB. In the former the cephalic tentacles are
powerful manual appendages, uniting in themselves the threefold office of
touch, prehension, z^wA pulling \ for it was shown that through their aid the
animal assists the operation of the hooked and setiferous feet in drawing
itself forwards; in the Sahella, the cephalic appendages are quite incapable
of any, the slightest motive act ; they are exclusively branchial. The duties of
locomotion therefore in this latter genus devolve exclusively on the feet.
In the Terebella, the setiferous feet are limited to the anterior end of the
body ; the posterior presenting the form only of hook-armed ridges. In
Terehella nebulosa these feet amount to twenty-three in number; the setae
with which these feet are furnished, are simple or unserrated lancet-shaped
and flattened hairs. The feet themselves are capable of only slight extrusion
beyond the plane of the body, serving more the purpose of trowelling,
plastering, and polishing the interior of the tube, than of moving the animal
in its cell. The hooks (fig. 24'), in nearly all species of Terebellis, are disposed
in double rows on the dorsum of each ridge. This arrangement exists inva-
riably on the " ridges " of the posterior |^ths of the body ; on the anterior

setiferous portion they are often in single rows. It is evidently designed as a
means for ^rm\jfixitig to the tube the tail end of the body, in order that

upon it as a pivot, the anterior portion and the head may enjoy perfect free-
dom of motion. Considering the extreme power of elongating and contract-
ing the body with which these ornamental worms are gifted, it is mechanically
clear, that upon such a basis a great range of movement is secured. The
hooks themselves are furnished with one long and large tooth, and several
smaller ones above the former ; the back presents a projecting spine, to which
a tendon is attached, the office of which is to /<ngrasp or loose the tooth from
its hold, and which may be called thelaxator hamuli. The attached conical
base of each hook is furnished with another tendon, the muscle of which may
be called the tensor hamuli, as through its agency the act of^a:m^ the hooks
is performed. On the ventral median line in Werehella nebulosa thick muscular
transverse scale-like rugae, mistaken by Montagu fur actual scales, are de-

veloped, forming in part afulcrumfor muscularaction,andin part steadying the
cephalic end of the body, with a view to the pulley-like operation of the ten-
tacles. In Terehella conchilega the setiferous feet are only sixteen in num-
ber, the hooks and setae differing very slightly in model from those of the
former species (fig. 25). The feet effect a similarly ventral situation, and
 the scale-like rugae under the thorax present a corresponding character,
 only that in Terebella conchilega the ventral median line is painted red by a
ba7id of cutaneous pigment, which is commonly mistaken by cursory observers

 for a large blood-vessel. In two other and nmch smaller species, which the
 author has recently added to those generally known, the setiferous feet in one
 are thirteen in number, and in the other eight ; in the latter they stand on
 prominent peduncles, and differ strikingly from those of the other species.
 The hooks vary only in the number of the teeth and in size (fig. 26).

    The tubeof the 7ere6eZ/Ф, according to the author's observation, is perforated,
 not caecal, at its inferior termination. The fajculence rejected by the animal
 is thus made to escape from the tube, by the force of a current of the external
 water which is admitted into the tube, between the tube and the body of the
 worm, and driven out through the posterior aperture of the tube by the sudden
 retreating and swelling of the animal in its tube. It is accordingly found

 that in the Terebellce there exists no provision, such as that which will after-
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  207

wards be explained in the Amphitriiee, for directing and impelling upwards
along the tube the rejectamenta. It is desirable to remark, at this place, that in
the TereMlcc the number of the setiferous feet consitates by far the best, most
constant, and most easily determined character for the establishment of the
boundaries of species. Between some of the species constituted by Montagu
no difference exists but that of age ; the same individual at two periods of its
growth is frequently referred to two distinct species. Having no fixed and
constant mark of species, his definitions are vague, and quite incapable of
verification. The tentacles undergo numerous variations with age, so like-

wise do the branchiae ; these organs are therefore valueless for classification.
    The genus Amphitrita is also tubicolous, and generally fixed ; some species,

as A. auricoma, are distinguished however for the power of carrying their
tubes about from place to place ; and though tubicolous, are not therefore
sedentary. In one species, A. alveolata, the branchiae appear as dorsal ap-
pendages of the annuli of the anterior -|ths of the body ; in another these
organs occur at two pectiniform vascular processes on either side of the neck.
 In a third and most beautiful species, which I have recently established under
 the name of Sabina, the branchiae assimilate themselves in structure and
 situation to those of the Serpulidans. In this genus, in addition to the hooks
 and setae, the feet are provided with tactile papillae or cirri. The hooks are
 disposed on elevated ridges extending round the body from the bases of the
 feet. First, in A. alveolata, a group of flexible tentacles is gathered round

 the occiput, which discharge the office of sensation and prehension. On the

 three first post-occipital rings, branchiae, cutting instruments, and hooks are
 developed ; each hook-bearing ridge supports at either end a brush of acutely

 cutting double-edged setae (fig. !27, a). These cutting tools are limited to the
 three first feet ; they are fitted in the most perfect manner for the uses of

 " dressing " the materials wherewith the architecture of the tube is raised. By
 them rough hewn stones are polished, rugged surfaces worn down, and angry
 projections from the interior of the tube smoothed off. At one extremity

 these ridges are elongated into branchial processes ; all the feet below these
 are furnished with setas, which are formed on a totally different plan of
 structure, and which are evidently intended for a distinct office. Each seta

  consists of a straight flattened shaft, terminating in an extremely fine point,
  from either side of which minute sharp teeth point towards the free end
  of the seta. These setae, from their construction, are obviously designed for

 pushing ; that is, they constitute the agents by which the worm advances
  towards the mouth of its tube. Below, and at the base of each setiferous ap-

  pendage, the three first excepted, a minute papilla is observed, which through-
  out the anterior |^ths of the body preserves its rudimentary proportions
  near the tail however these papillae augment rapidly in size, and assume the
  peculiar characters of club-shaped processes, perforated at the distal end by
  orifices leading into their hollow axes. In these axial channels lies a bunch
  of singularly formed setae, capable of protrusion to an immense distance
  beyond the club-ends of the fleshy processes ; each of these setae enlarges at
  its extremity into an oval sponge-body (fig. 27, 6), from the base of which, in
  one direction, there proceeds backwards (recurved) an acute seta, and from
  the end, another needle-like process directed towards the root, projects on
  the other side. Nothing in nature or art is comparable in perfection of
  mechanism to these exquisite organs.

      The work of scraping, scouring, planing, mopping and sponging, cecono-
   mic duties for the discharge of which art has never yet produced a single
   capable instrument, is performed by these marvellous implements alternately,
  successively or simultaneously with equal facility and completeness. They
 208 REPORT-- 1851.

 preserve the inferior end or bottom of their tube-house in a constant state
 of tenantable purity and cleanliness, for the tube inhabited by the Amphi-
 trite is caecal. Another provision, of a no less ingenious description, against
 feeculent and noxious accumulation, is remarked in the organization of the
 tail. At a given point the processes and branchiae abruptly terminate ; from
 this point, the true tail, under the form of a cylindrical, contracted and coiled
 portion, extends to some further distance, and then turns upwards parallel
 with the body of the worm, in order with the greater mechanical advantage
 to project in the direction of the upper orifice of the tube the faical refuse.
 This sagacious contrivance has not eluded the discriminating eye of Cuvier.

     In A. auricoma (fig. 28) the papillee and cirri of the feet are entirely
 absent ; tiie hooks, however, similarly disposed on transverse eminences, are
 stronger and larger, and the setse are serrated only on one side. The tail-
 like appendage to the inferior extremity of the body, in all respects but one,
 is formed on the model of that of the former species. One labium of the
 terminal orifice is here extended into a flap-like process, which by a sudden
 act of muscular contraction, imparts a smart blow to the fceculent mass as it
 escapes from the intestine, and thus effectively conveys it to the upper out-
 let of the tube. This terminal extreme of the alimentary canal is richly
provided with large and vigorous cilia. In Sabina Poppcea (Williams) the
 anal orifice is fringed with fleshy processes, which, clothed with vibratile
cilia, fulfil offices which in the former species devolved on a specially formed
tail. In all cases the office of the hooks is the same.

    It is here in alliance with the Amphitrite that the author would locate the
little rock-boring Leucodore ciliatus. Its occipital tentacles are only two in

--number long, muscular and mobile ; they are subservient to prehension.

The thoracic region of the body is definitively marked from the abdominal,
and is terminated by a foot much larger than any of the rest. The rows of
hooks (fig. 29, Ф) are placed dorsally ; each hook is double-toothed and
supported on a long stem. The branchiae are dorsal like those of Amphitrite
alveolata. The feet are biramous, carrying a double bunch of setas
(fig. 29, h). These latter occur under three varieties of form ; some are
awl-like for piercing ; some are pincer-like for grasping ; others are plain-
edged for scraping. Nothing in the structure of this little worm equals 'the
tail' in beauty and singularity. The lower extremity of the tube inhabited
by it is caecal and smooth, and not drawn out, as in other cases, into Zifine
conical cell. The tail is organized peculiarly and with express reference to
this formation of the bottom of the cell. It is expanded with geometrical

exactitude into a hollow cone, the anus occupying its receding apex. This
remarkable and most beautiful apparatus acts on the principle of the sucher.

Its sides are composed of a membranous muscle. When it is being applied
to its point of attachment, the worm lets down its weight upon the part, in
order to press out the water with which the bottom of the tube may be

filled. The tail is then suddenly drawn up, a movement by which the
apex of the cone is raised from the surface of contact. The pressure of the
water with which the tube is filled is now rendered operative, and the little
worm amid the raging billows is securely anchored to its cell. It is impos-
sible to discover in this wondrous vital mechanism a single particular in
which the principles of hydrostatic pressure are not minutely obeyed.

    In the organization of the feet of the familiar genus Arenicola, there
is little to call for remark. Formed to move readily through loose sand,
pedal appendages are scarcely required. The brushes of bright iridescent
setae (fig. 30), which arise on either side out of the twenty anterior rings of

the body, constitute the sole motor elements of the appendages. The thir-
                    ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.                 209

 teen last of these setae, though beautified by the branchial tufts, are identical
 in structure and action with the seven anterior. The setae consist of a long
 rigid flattened shaft, supporting on either side long, closely-adjusted and
 slender secondary setas, after the pattern of a joen. They are exactly penni-
form. Such a figure fits these organs most admirably for the practical work
 which they are required to perform. Moving through a loose, yielding,
 pulverulent soil, a smooth-edged seta would oppose too little resistance in

penetrating such a substance to enable the worm to make any forward
movement. Supplied, hovvever, with secondary setae, which expand and

separate from each other as the resistance of soil operates from the point
towards the root, each foot, although planted only into sand, becomes a firm

fulcrum on which the worm elongates its body and carries forward its snout

in its boring operations with considerable muscular power.

   A worm has lately fallen under the author's observation for the reception

of which he has ventured to constitute a new species under the name of Cly-

menoida arenicoida. The anterior part of the body in all essential characters
is closely similar to that of the Areiiicola. It is to this region of the body that
the setiferous feet are limited ; they amount to about seventeen in number
the setae are organized after the type of those of Arenicola ; the snout and
proboscis are also -analogous : there are no external branchiae. The poste-

rior four-fifths of the body is two-thirds embraced by strong muscular raised

rings, which support three lines of hooks (fig. 31), distinguished from all
those hitherto described in the Tubicola, in being sustained on a long stalk,

the whole forming the figure of S. These instruments are well calculated
to gain for the active and boring cephalic end of the body a firm basis of
movement, by securely anchoring the posterior portion to the walls of the

factitious tube in which the animal is generally found to be lodged.
   In these worms there are no specialized tactile organs under the form of

papillae or cirri.

In the kindred genera, however, oi Euphrosyne, Hipponoe,Pleione, Chlceia,

while the feet are furnished with denser and larger brushes of setae, cirri

more or less developed are found always to exist. Of these genera few
illustrative species are found on the English shores. The feet are organized

more for moving readily through water than a solid soil.
  -Several elegant representative species of the genus Eunice frequent the

British shores. They are organized to move in underground tunnels. In
structure the feet present an adaptation to the wants of such a mode of life.
In the largest species oi Eunice, as E. antennata, below the branchiae, which

are most dorsally placed of all the parts of the feet, a tapering fleshy process
is observed, the office of which is evidently to guard the root of the branchia ;
it is tactile. Next to this element, on the ventral side, is situated a broad fan-
shaped cirrus, fitted well for the work of rowing through water or liquid mud.
This lamellated cirrus is perforated irregularly by canals, into which the fluid
of the peritoneal cavity freely enters; it is also protected by two bunches of
bristles, which are arranged on a vertical plane. At the extreme end of each

seta is remarked a joint-like break, at which the junction occurs between the

end (sabre-shaped) of the seta and its shaft (fig. 32). The union between these

Atwo parts of the seta is not, however, an articulation.  true articulation

happens nowhere in the appendages of the Annelida. These quasi-articu-

lated setae act on a definite mechanical principle ; the extreme portion is
first firmly planted on the surrounding substance, on it then as a point

d'nppui the shaft revolves, and the body of the worm is moved forwards or
backwards, according to the direction of muscvilar action. The setae in
E. gigantea, of which no example has yet been found by the author on our

Coasts, are armed with an articulated seta, which is bi-edged, and some-

times serrated. In this species the foliaceous cirri are wanting. The sub-

genera Lycidice, Aglaura and CEnone, present, in the construction of the

mechanical constituents of the feet, examples of exquisite contrivance.

The solid elements entering into the composition of the feet of Lycidice

Ninetta, occur under two varieties: the first is limited to the superior foot,

the second to the inferior ; the superior foot consisting of the branchia, a pro-

trusile foot from the end of which the setse proceed, and in the axis of which

they run freely under muscular agency. These setae are constructed for

rowing (fig. 33) ; they include two forms of oars ; the first having a flat-
tened blade-like shape, and that in which the expanded extremity is abruptly

cut across spade-like (fig. 33, a). These oars are capable, while in action,

of being turned upon their own axes, in other words, of being " feathered."

The terminal edge of the spade-like variety is minutely serrated, adapting it

for scraping when required. The setae of the inferior foot are quite dif-

ferently formed. They are composed of a long strong stem expanded at its

extremity, to which is attached a second piece bifid at its remote end, and

designed for hooking or fixing or anchoring the body, according to the me-

Adium in which the animal may be moving.  ligament-like membrane ties

on one side this articulated piece to the shaft. It is not impossible that this

sort of joint may be the faint foreshadowing of the true articulations observed

in the members of Insects and Crustacea. The anatomist must not, how-

ever, misinterpret this statement. In the Annelids, as already stated, there

is no true articulated member; the pieces of the hard parts or setae are never

united together by joints properly so called. The setae, being in all cases

composed of a whalebone-like substance, remarkable for its elasticity and

tenacity, are readily modelled into innumerable forms without the necessity

of actual joints. In all cases the connected portion is continuous in sub-

stance with the supporting shaft. In some cases the weak point of union is

strengthened b(' a ligamentous membrane (jiever muscular), which is really

only a portion of the setae thinned off" into a membranous form. To such a

mechanism the word ' articulation,' in its correct anatomical sense, cannot

apply.

   Below the setiferous foot in Lycidice is observed two foliaceous blunt
cirri, useful in swimming and feeling. The author has discovered two or

three smaller species of Lycidice, in which the feet differ from the former in

the construction of the soft parts, retaining in the setae the same type of for-

mation, while the hooks present slight variations.

   The worm described by Savigny under the name oi Aglaura fulgida, oi

which no British specimen is known on our coast, exhibits the same type as

that of Lycidice in the organization of the appendages.

CEnone maculata is a graceful and active worm. Its feet are formed at

once with a view to ready and vigorous locomotion through loose soil or

through water. Each foot is composed of two flat fleshy appendages, of

which one is dedicated to respiration, and the other to tactile and mechanical

purposes. The setae, which are placed intermediately, supported on a pro-

trusile base, consist of long shafts, the ends of which are curved upwards

and club-shaped, the under surface being deeply notched into hooks which

recurve (fig. 34). An elastic membrane is also at this end of each seta, the

object of which seems to be that of wiping and cleansing the hooks by

passing over their plane surface. This worm is capable of creeping over a

hard surface at a very rapid pace. Each opposite pair of feet constitute

for its supporting annular segment an independent mechanism for progres-

sion ; the posterior part of the body is not therefore dragged or drawn
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  211

forwards by the anterior. Each ring throughout the bodj' has its own legs,
which move with perfect independence. Remarkably long and gracefully
slender, then, as the body of this worm may be, every part advances or recedes
at one and the same time, and locomotion is active and vigorous. Under
such a complicated repetition of oars, hooks, paddles and fins, a final result,
unerringly harmonious, is obtained, which man's ingenious handivvork would

attempt in vain to imitate.

   The Nereids constitute the most common and most obtrusive family of
sea-side Annelids. The majority of the species inhabit galleries, detectable

under every stone between tide-marks, along which they crawl like subter-
ranean beasts of prey. They are by no means inviting to the eye, either by
their colour or conformation. They are carnivorous in habits, and perpe-
tually on the watch for prey. In nearly all species the feet are constructed

with express reference to progression on solid surfaces. Among the Nereids,

in the classification of species, it is very important in determining the cha-
racters of the feet, that those compared in difi'erent individuals should be

selected as nearly as possible from the same region of the body. The ce-
phalic feet in one should be compared with those in another species from the
same division of the body ; those from mid-body with others from mid-body,
and those near the tail with others from the same part. If this be not done,
and done with exact and minute accuracy, it will be found quite impossible
to arrive at a clear knowledge of constant and invariable anatomical cha-
racters for the definition and limitation of species. In all Nereids the feet
are biramous, but coalescent at the base. Every foot, in every species,

consists of a superior and an inferior cirrus, three papillae, generally de-
scribed as branchial, and two tubercles armed with compound bristles.
The superior tubercles are always situated between the dorsal and second
papillae, and the inferior tubercle between this and the ventral papillae. In

Nereis margaritacea the setae are jointed, the articulated piece being serru-

lated, and seeming calculated only for walking. The setae of the superior
feet always, in the Nereids, differ in structure from those of the inferior feet.
In N. margaritacea the extreme portion is sabre-shaped and fine-edged
(fig. 35). In N. renalis the same portion presents a finely toothed edge
(fig. 36). In the superior foot the setae are strong, and the connected piece
is short, strong, curved, and always serrated ; while those of the inferior are
more slender, and longer, the connected piece being needle-shaped and pro-
longed. These worms are endowed with no mechanical means for the con-
struction of their galleries, unless they be those of the jaws and proboscis.
The feet are mainly constituted for walking ; the setae, if destined for such
work at all, can only scrape and polish the interior of the gallery when made.
Viewed by the light of mechanical principles, nothing can be so obvious as
the reason why the setae in these as in nearly all other Annelida arejointed.

If they consisted of rigid, unbending levers, it is manifest that they would
prove most awkward additions to the sides of the animals ; if fixed too deeply
in the surrounding soil, they would not act at all as levers ; if too super-
ficially, the worm would be compressed in its tube at the moment when the
setffi of the opposite feet would meet in a straight line. These difficulties are
effectually and skilfully obviated by the introduction of a joint or a point of
motion on each seta. This is one instance among many, which the eye of
the mechanician would detect in the organization of the Annelida, in which
nature takes adroit advantage of mechanical principles in the attainment of
her ends.

   The Phyllodocidce are by common consent the most ornamental worms
among the Nereidce (" Virgines pulcherriraae inter Nereides," Fab.). They

                                                                          p2

owe their beauty of form to a series of compressed foliaceous lamellae, which

attain in some species a considerable size, and which in all elegantly garnish

the sides of the body. The office of these appendages has already been

described  as  that  of                                                         ;  they are well fitted, however, to aid in

                         ' breathing '

progression through water. Following the motion of the feet, and capable

of being partially altered from a horizontal to a perpendicular position, they

operate as a brush of oars, and must pi-ove especially useful when the worm

glides from a solid surface, and finds itself unsustained in the water. Hence

the species are quick and lively, and swim with great mechanical facility.
" Currit egregie ; natare etiam valet lamellis suis retroversis oblique sursum
erectis," says old Fabricius of them in his ' Fauna Grcenlandica.' The occi-

put and snout are armed and ornamented by cylindrical tentacles, which are

the modified homologa of the lamellae of the feet. Observing the habits

of these worms, it becomes at once obvious that these appendages are acute

organs of touch.

In all the Phyllodoce the feet are uniramous. There is only one seti-

ferous process, and this is capable of elongation and retraction as usual.

The brush of bristles is always situated between the dorsal lamella and

the blunt ventral cirrus. The setae are jointed in all species (see figs.

37 and 38). The joint is apparently constructed on the ball-and-socket
principle. The base of tlie extreme piece is enlarged into a small knob,

while the end of the shaft is hollowed into a cavity, into which the former

accurately fits. These two parts are really tied together by means of a

ligamentous membrane extending from the margins of the acetabulum round

and over the ball, to embrace the stem ; and yet it is not a true articula-

tion ; its action is due to elasticity, not to any muscular voluntary agency.

In P. viridis, one admirably adapted for walking on solid surfaces, the

extreme articulated portion, pointed to the acuteness of a needle, is first

firmly fixed on the unhinged surface: the other now lifts the body of the

animal forwards, moving upon this as a fulcral pivot. In an undescribed

species, the stem of the seta at its distal end and on the under side, is
и' roughened " with strong teeth, for pushing purposes. Other minor varie-

ties in the structure of the bristles occur in other species. In P.lamelligera,

the most attractive of all, a second foliaceous lamella is superadded to the

respiratory one, and the setiferous process is ventralmost in situation. The

tail in the Phyllodoce, without exception, is provided with two flattened

styles, which exceed in size by three or four times the lateral appendages,

and which act on the principles of the caudal fin of the fish in sculling and

helming. It is a remarkable fact, proving their true homology, tliat the

styles in the Annelids, wherever they exist, are formed on the model of the

lateral cirri. When these last are blunt and clavate, as in a new species

which the author has lately established, the former are blunt and clavate

accordingly ; when acute and flattened, the latter are so also. The styles,

however, are always considerably larger in dimensions than the lateral cirri.

This correspondence of plan does not, indeed, obtain between the tentacles

and the lateral appendages. The former are nearly round and tapering, while

the latter may be flat.
   An exception to this rule occurs in the Syllidce, in Avhich the two orders

of appendages present the same character. In this interesting genus the

appendages are distinguished for their extreme length and slenderness.

The feet are uniramous or undivided. The superior cirrus it is, which

by its unusual length and tasteful figure and easy movements, procures for

these little Annelids their charm for the eye. Elongate and submouiliforra

these branchial cirri are beaded only through the distal half of their length.

The question of how far they are capable of fulfilling a lespiratory function
was formerly considered. That they are of great use in locomotion and
sensation admits of no doubt. The inferior cirrus in every species is short and
unjointed. Between these cirri is placed the setiferous process. No single
anatomical character is calculated to suggest so much with reference to the
habits and manners of the Annelidae as that derived from the structure of
the setae. Moreover, these characters are subject to no variation. They are

in the Annelids as fixed in their constancy as the teeth are in the higher
animals ; they form a magic key which unlocks the hidden secrets of the
ceconomy and organization of these worms. In S. armillaris, moving over
the hard surfaces of stones and shells, the setse are furnished only with a fine
shape-edged penknife-like articulated piece, well adapted to fit itself into
cracks and crevices, while the extremity of the supporting shaft is pointed
sharply, with an obvious view to catch the surface against which it is applied
during progression. Faithful to the inviolable law of "appropriate means

to intended ends," it may be remarked that in kindred species, differing in
scarcely any other respect than that of its habitat from the former, ingenious
nature, by a trifling modification in the figure of the setae, enables S. pro-
lifera to creep with ease and steadiness over the smooth and slippery surfaces
of the glutinous Algae. This object it accomplishes in the most artistic
manner, merely by curving downwards the extreme end of the articulated
portion of the seta. This is done twice ; so that each piece is furnished
with two minute hooks on the inferior side, by which, when planted into the
soft vegetable tissue, the worm is enabled to secure itself ' in place' with
strength and certainty. The author has recently discovered that in twct
species oi MyrianidcB which affect similar situations in Algae, the setas exhibit
a structure which is designed to secure the same object, which are no less

marvellously adapted to the exigences of the case than the feet of the house-

fly or those of the Polar Bear.
    In Psamathe fusca there prevails an arrangement of the setae which is

the exact reverse of the formation just described in the former species. In
this Annelid, which also lives on algae, the setae are constructed for pushing,

and not for pulling and fixing. The articulated piece is serrated in the
direction of its point. These teeth are well appointed for catching in the
soft surface while they are being protruded from their sheath. This worm
therefore accomplishes its locomotion by pushing, the feet being directed
backwards. The true Syllidoe walk by creeping, pulling themselves for-

wards, the feet being first thrown in advance of their respective rings.
   The genus Nerine or Spio exemplifies, in the disposition and actions of its

tactile and motive appendages, the principle which Paley has matchlessly

expounded, that every mechanical perfection realized in the animal organism

is attained in strict conformity with the laws of physics, illustrating the
subordination of the principles of one kingdom of creation to those of an-

othei*. The Nerine move with remarkable facility through sand or shingle.
They progress in water slowly and awkwardly, oscillating from side to side
without making scarcely any advance. This is the necessary result of a
bodily structure suited in none of its mechanical appliances for progression
in such an element. In loose sand, however, " the medium " in which they
are designed by nature to revel, they display the most vigorous agility. By
means of their pointed snout they burrow with great skill and effect, carrying
passively at the sides their long manual appendages. The mechanical
constituents of the feet are peculiarly adapted to aid in this operation. The
dorsal foot, situated below the branchia, is composed of a fan-shaped cirrus,
"the plane of which is vertical, that is, parallel with a line carried from the
214 REPORT 1851.

dorsal to the ventral median line round the body. On the posterior side

this cirrus is protected and strengthened by a brush of strong bristles, which
are opened into a fan-like form also, fortifying thus the fleshy cirrus from
one edge to the other, and rendering an injury to it almost impossible : the
ventral foot is an exact repetition of the former. The setae present a very
apposite figure for aiding in progression (figs. 39 and 40). During the oar-
like motion of the foot from before backwards, the setae go before the cirrus,

protecting it thus from injury. The setae resemble the common oar in

figure, differing from this instrument only in having on either side of the
blade a membranous process, hooked slightly at the end towards the middle
piece or shaft (fig. 39). In virtue of this beautiful formation, the resistance
offered by the little oar to the surrounding element is so perfectly graduated,
that it slowly passes through the sand, while it forms the fulcral point of
motion ; the longer setae are simply blade-like (fig. 39, a). The foot, in being
carried forward to reperform the step, revolves slightly on its axis, and thus
feathers the setae, a manoeuvre by which resistance to progression is very
materially diminished. In Nerine, the tail in all species is a broad semicir-
cular and horizontalJin, the anus being situated on its dorsal side. In con-
sequence of the vertical direction of the plane of the lateral fleshy appen-
dages, on that very account well qualified for aiding in progression through
loose sand, the animal is scantily and imperfectly pi'ovided with the means
of supporting itself in water ; under such circumstances the tail comes in as
an important instrument of locomotion. These observations are applicable
in every detail to the case of the larger species of Nerine, N. coniocephala.
This latter species differs from the former only in the structure of the
branchiae ; the other elements of the appendages are identically formed, and
the tail discovers the same ingenious construction. The author has added
another species of Nerine to those described, in which the fleshy cirri are
broader and larger, and better adapted for swimming, the tail having the
generic typical formation. There remains one remarkable and characteristic
 feature of structure, with reference to the " appendages " in these eccentric

worms, to be noticed. All the species of this genus may be immediately
 distinguished from all other Annelids by the extraordinary development
which occurs in the occipital tentacles. From the dorsal aspect of the first
 or occipital annulus, two long tojoe-like appendages arise. In N. vulgaris
 they equal in length one-third of the body ; in N. coniocephala they are not

 so long, but stouter and stronger.
    In the new species to which allusion has now been made, these branchial

 appendages extend as far as the middle point of the body, so remarkable are
 they in length. The branchial appendages are true prehensile organs, used

 almost exclusively in the search for food. On their under surface, in each

 species, they are transversely roughened with angularly raised edges, these
 again being armed by stiff gristly spinelets, a provision expressly introduced
 for scraping, for which description of manual labour no implement yet con-
 trived by the cunning of man can be better adapted. From the structure of
 the soil, that of a shelly fragile loose sand, in which the lot of these worms
 is cast, the perfect adaptation of these instruments to the end to be accom-
 plished may be readily predicted. Their history in an especial manner exem-

 plifies the rule, that even the humblest and meanest worm finds in its ap-

 pointed habitat the conditions of prosperous and felicitous existence.
      Glycera, although an inhabitant of the shingly sand, has yet received a

 special organization. It does not tunnel the soil into permanent subterra-
 nean passages like the Nereids ; it struggles through the sand by the batter-

 ing-ram operation of its proboscis. To the extremity of this vigorous organ
                                                        ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.                              215

four strong teeth are affixed, which perform the business of so many pickaxes,
in tearing and disintegrating the soil. This worm possesses no other instru-

ment for pioneering its way through the ground than the proboscis ; though

a part of the alimentary system, it has therefore been cursorily mentioned

here. The antennae, which exist in Glycera under the character of four

minute horns, crowning prettily the apex of the conical head, are exclusively

organs of touch. The feet are prominent, and supported on a long muscular

uniramous base. They are separated from each other by an appreciable

interval. The branchia, as already described, is dorsalmost. At the in-

ferior base of this appendage is situated the setiferous process of the dorsal

foot. The setae are very protrusile and jointed ; the articulated portion

being long and extremely finely pointed and penknife-shaped. In the centre

of the setae is observed a strong rigid spine, which, in all the Annelids in which

it exists, contributes materially to the mechanical strength of the foot (fig. 41).

Below the setiferous process is found a conical cirrus of a length equaling the

setae in their retracted position. This organ can be of little service in

swimming ; it is exclusively tactile. The inferior foot is an exact repetition

of the superior, wanting the branchial process, while the cirrus is larger and

flatter than the corresponding part of the dorsal. Two strong round taper-
ing styles are superadded to the tail, which materially assist the worm in

its progress through its native soil. Actual observation of its habits can

scarcely be required to convince the intelligent naturalist that Glycera is

almost entirely incapable even of sustaining itself in water. In this element

its movements are those of irregular contortions and oscillations from side to

side, convulsive struggles without progress. The study of its structure suf-

fices in proof of the inference that it was made for the exact place in

nature in which it is found. If the soil is too hard, its struggles to move are

fruitless ; if too dry, it is paralysed ; if too wet, the proboscis is rendered use-

less, and it shows immediate evidence of discomfort. Its organization fits it

only for a soil of peculiar consistence and structure ; and such exactly are
the circumstances under which it is found. The above considerations have

arisen out of those bearing on the mechanism of the appendages in this

merry and beautiful little worm.

Like Glycera, Nephthys is a frequenter of the sandy shore ; it selects

spots, however, in which the soil is quite different in several respects from

that ol' the native places of Glycera. Nephthys lives in fine sand saturated
with water. It advances through such a medium with a swimming motion.
It is admirably organized for progression in water. The cirri of its feet

consist of large fan-shaped processes, the plane of which is vertical and suitably

appointed for swimming. The setae are composed of two distinct layers, of

which one is placed anterior and the other on the posterior surface of the

cirral lamina (fig. 42). The brush of setae on both sides radiates from a

common centre at the root of the foot. The posterior setae are constructed

on the exact pattern of the flattened fibre of striped muscle, ending in a fine

point ; they are strong and elastic. Those anterior to the cirrus are much

longer than the former, and assume the shape of sharp-pointed, finely serrated,

bi-edged blades. From the inferior base of the superior foot the branchia

depends                                      from  the  same  point  of  the  inferior,  a  conical  cirrus.  The ventral

foot in all other characters is a precise repetition of the dorsal.

Nephthys is distinguishable from all other Annelids by its remarkable

tail. It is a median style, extending to a considerable distance backwards,

like the occipital ornament in the head-dress of the Chinese. It is singularly

flexible and mobile. Its use can scarcely be conceived, unless it be that of

defence for the posterior part of the body of the worm. In swimming, how-
216 REPORT 1851.

ever, it becomes a steering and a sculling-machine. Nephthys progresses in
water by throwing its body into a rapidly succeeding series of the most ele-
gant undulations, maintaining at the same time a steady position of the head,
advancing prettily like a fairy-wave through the fluid.

    The Annelids grouped under the Cuvierian genus of Ariciadm are little
known. In the sj'stematic portion of this Report, it will be seen that the
author has succeeded in multiplying this genus by the addition of several
iindescribed species. The body of Aricia Ctivieri is distinguished into two
distinct portions, one of M'hich, the cephalic or anterior, is characterized by
the absence of branchias, the presence of a double row of setiferous processes
on either of the dorsal aspects of the body, and of short conical cirri beneath
each ventral foot. This segment of the body is prominently annulated, and
vigorously muscular. It exceeds in diameter very much the posterior ; it is
the true motive apparatus of the worm. The posterior two- thirds of the
body is apparently motionless and lifeless, and scarcely at all capable of
voluntary motion. To this region the branchial organs are exclusively
limited. The setae of the inferior feet are of a bright mother-of-pearl ap-
pearance, strong (figs. 43, 44), short and curved ; they are carved on one
side in a very peculiar mannei*. This sculptured work can only be described

as resembling scales laid transversely one over another imbricately, each
scale being strengthened by a minute " corpus " on the mid-point of its free
edge. This variety, it is obvious from the structure, is designed for pushing.

The setae of the other feet are flat, blade-like, and unserrated in their edges.
The brushes of setae in the vicinity of the head are sessile, those near the

feet are pedunculate. Placed on the dorsal aspect of the body, the ventral
being smooth, it is easy to understand the manner and mechanism of loco-

motion. The soil is preparatorily channelled by the fore-part of the body,
expressly constructed for such description of work. Through the gallery
thus formed the posterior and passive moiety of the worm is slowly urged
along by the mechanical operation of the setiferous feet, which are dorsally
placed for this purpose. In this memoir, for the first time, several new

species of Aricia will be described, presenting the generic characteristic of
closely approximated ' rings ' at the oesophageal portion of the body. Within
the limits of this portion each segmental ring is furnished with four strong
setiferous feet, the posterior part of the body being intestiniform and desti-
tute of branchiae. In another species the posterior four-fifths of the body is
provided with ridges armed with three rows of stalked hooks.

   The appendages in the Opheliadce assume a new character ; they are
short fleshy threads attached to either side of the body, and chiefly to the
two posterior thirds. Ciirhatidns Lamarckii is the culminating perfection
of this type of structure. In this worm, elegant only for its long, wavy,
bright red and filiform appendages, the setiferous feet are thrown into abey-
ance. Frequenting concealed passages, under stones resting almost always
on a clayey soil, the presence of these worms can only be discovered by ob-
serving in the vacuity the tangled webs of red threads which seem gifted
with the power of independent voluntary motion ; these are at once motive
and branchial appendages. This worm seems to enjoy very little power of
locomotion. It rolls and coils itself in a self-emitted slime, if withdrawn
from its native habitat. It is furnished on the under surface of the body
with two rows of strong curved blunt spines, as if specifically intended for
walking or creeping. At some little distance on the side of the same seg-
ment, is observed another row of setae, much exceeding the former in length
and differing from them in structure, being only long, slightly curved and
flattened hairs ; they are well calculated to aid in progression by pane-
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  217

trating the adjacent soil. To the genus Cirrhatulus^ through the author's re-
searches, several new species have lately been added. Here the setae assume

the shape of elastic tape, ending in a fine point, affecting on each segment
a lateral situation. The lateral cirri are shorter and less numerous.

    In Aphrodita aculeaia, it is not difficult to discover every locomotive ap-

pliance required to move with facility through semi-fluid sand. The feet
form thirty-two pairs in number ; the anterior and posterior are minute, but
they gradually increase in size towards the middle of the body, where they
attain their greatest development. They are of two kinds; the squamiferous

--and cirrigerous, both varieties being divisible into two branches a ventral

and a dorsal. The ventral branch or proper foot forms a stout rough tuber-
culated conoid process, armed with a stout spine protruded from the pale
papillary apex, and with four or five firm bristles proceeding from under the
apex, and partially surrounding the spine. The spine tapers insensibly to
an obtuse point, is smooth and of a pale yellow colour : the bristles are of a
rich burnished brown colour, with a round shank which grows a little thicker
upwards, and is terminated with a curved cutting point, like a pruning-knife
 in most of them there is a tooth-like process on the inner side beneath this
point. The cirrus of the foot does not reach its apex, excepting that of the
 first pairs ; it is fleshy, setaceous, and of a pale colour. The dorsal branch
 of all the feet has an upward direction, and cannot be used as an organ of
 progression along the ground; that of the squamous feet is armed with two
 bundles of bristles, arranged in a fan-shaped manner : they are compara-
 tively short, curved like the italic letter/, and roughened with minute gra-
 nulations on the upper half; the bristles of the other brush, placed between
 the dorsal one and the proper foot, are remarkable for their stoutness and
 length ; they are of a rich dark brown colour, straight, and terminated with

 a lanceolate point, which is notched on each side with four reverted barbs
 so that the bristle resembles the barbed arrow or spear of the South Sea
 Islander. The notches are not opposite, but alternate, and they are enclosed
 within a plain sheath, consisting of two dilated valves which shut upon them.
 The cirrigerous foot has a single fan-shaped brush of bristles only ; the
 bristles are simple and curved like those of the dorsal fascicles of the squa-
 mous feet, but they are more numerous, slenderer, longer, of a paler colour,
 and quite smooth ; they are unequal in length, some of them very fine and

 hair-like, and the whole brush is usually matted and soiled with extraneous

 matters. This worm is generally an occupant of deep water. It crawls
 along the muddy bottom at a few fathoms below the surface. In motion on

 a hard surface its feet present an extremely interesting spectacle. It gives

 pleasure to watch the precision with which they are unsheathed, and the

 regularity and order with which each foot succeeds another in the slow and

 snail-like march.

     Polynoe are always found on the under surfaces of stones, over which they

--are capable of creeping with considerable freedom. Their swimming capa-

  city is very inferior sinking soon to the bottom to crawl along. In relation
 to the Polynoe generically it may be stated, that the feet are bifid, the supe-
  rior branch being small and almost confluent with the inferior, which is

  greatly developed ; that the superior cirri are long and the inferior short and

  conical ; that the bristles of the superior branch are short and always slenderer
  than those of the inferior, subulate and smooth at the point, or like the infe-
  rior bristles, somewhat thickened and serrulate along the edge. The spines
  present no peculiarity. The first pair of feet are destitute of bristles, but
  are terminated by two long tentacular cirri, which advance on each side of

  the head and resemble antennae ; while on the last segment we find filiform
218 REPORT 1851.

appendages formed by a mutation of the superior cirri, and constituting a

general terminal style. The setae are serrulated at their extremities, and

formed for pushing (figs. 45 and 46).

The Abranchiate Annelids, although destitute of outward organs of respi-

ration, are not all unprovided with external organs of locomotion. The

familiar Lumbricus exemplifies this statement. Tlie Eai-th-worm in its move-

ment displays great force of muscle. Its integumentary system is a complex

web of strong circular and longitudinal muscular fascicles. The whole force

of this machinery is brought to bear in progression on the stiff' advantageously

curved spines, which are planted in form of feet, in a double row on either

side, on the ventral aspect of each segmental annulus. These setae present the

form of the italic/ (fig. 47), only two of which exist in each foot. To the

inserted extremity of each seta an appropriate system of muscles is attached.

To the free end minute flexible hairs are added, the office of which is evi-

dently to prevent the gathering of dirt and earth on the part. These setae

will actually penetrate a deal board ; for if the path of a worm on the fine-

polished surface of a deal board be examined with the microscope four
series of minute perforations may be detected. In Lumbricus these setae

begin at the fourteenth annulus from the head. In the act of burrowing

into a fresh surface, as when the worm, irritated by the observer, strives to

return to the earth, the foremost feet are firmly planted in the ground, the

head retracted, and then thrust forwards with extraordinary force. It is

manifest from tlie mechanism of this operation, that feet placed nearer the

head, if such were the case, would rather obstruct than aid the burrowing

Aand thrusting power of this part.     sioollen wave of contracted rings may

be seen travelling from the tail towards the head while the worm is thus

engaged, showing the intermittent and successive manner in which the

" labour of contraction " falls on every segment of the body. While running

through its subterranean vaults, this Avorm continually plunges " into fresh

fields and pastures new," swallowing almost with the voracity of the Arenicola

the very substance of the earth which gives it shelter.

The little lively Naides, though terricolous in habits like the Earth-worm,

are very dissimilar in organization. Of the genus Nais there are several

marine and terrestrial and freshwater species. In all, the mechanical ele-

Aments of the feet conform to a common type of structure.  strong seta,

forked at the extremity for pushing (figs. 48 and 49), accompanied by one
or two plain hairs much longer than the former, composes the foot. This is

only a provision for enabling the worm to run up and down its soft tube,

which in N.filiformis is constructed in bottom-mud of freshwater pools, and

in the marine species in the substance of the hardest calcareous rocks. In

these latter Annelids, as will be afterwards shown, there is furnished no

special boring apparatus. The genus Chjmene is remarkable for the cha-

racter of its tube. The worm, in the instance of nearly every species, con-

structs a tube to envelope only the middle of the body ; the head and the
tail projecting beyond its limits. The worm, however, can by the retraction

of the two extremes of its body, conceal and protect itself within its tube.

These, like all other tubicolous Annelids, are provided with special mecha-

nical organs (hooks) for moving up and down its cell. In this genus the

hooks are supported on long stalks, and placed only at long distances on the

body. Each row of hooks comprehends hundreds of individual hooks, so

closely packed are they and microscopically minute.

The genera Hirudo and Linus are wholly destitute of external appen-

dages, even for mechanical purposes. The former progress on the rings

immediately, the latter by the undulatory swelling and tightening of sue-
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  219

cessive portions of the body. In all Annelids the swelling of certain por-
tions of body in progression is accomplished by aid of the fluids of the inte-
rior. This is driven to a given point of the containing cavity, and then
momentarily imprisoned there by the contraction of the circular integument-
ary muscles in front of it and behind it. Hereat, for a moment, the body

bulges. The muscles of the integument are then excited to action, and the
fluid is forcibly compressed forwards or backwards, according to the direc-
tion of the muscular agency. This is a summary exposition of the mecha-
nical uses of the chyl-aqueous fluids of the peritoneal cavity, of which the

vital and physiological meaning was formerly studied in extenso.
   Nearly all Annelids are struck with paralysis when this fluid is made to

escape from its cavity by a puncture through the external walls. The power
of voluntary motion is suspended. The body of the worm becomes passive
and flaccid. The peritoneal fluid is really the fulcrum on which all muscular
action is based. Without it the worm cannot direct the contraction of its
muscles with efficiency and precision. But its mechanical uses are not ex-
clusively limited to the aid aff"orded in progression. It prevents mutual and
injurious pressure amid the internal organs, without which the course of the
blood in its proper vessels is arrested. In the leech-tribe it is the fluid which
is contained within the stomach that accomplishes this important object.
This singular anatomical peculiarity is also observed in the Liniadce. Nothing
in the history of the Annelids can be conceived more wonderful than the
mechanically perfect and facile manner in which Linus longissimus, a worm
of many yards in length, performs the feat of locomotion, and that too over
 craggy and rugged rocks. Without the fluids of the body, its motor appa-
 ratus would be incapable of eff'ort.

     Alimentary system In the majority of Annelids the alimentary system

 constitutes a cylindrical tube, which bears a general resemblance of outline
 to the integumentary, this latter forming with respect to the former an ex-
 terior concentric or embracing cylinder. As formerly explained, these two
 cylinders are in no instance in agglutinated contact; a space intervenes,
 varying in capacity in different species, to designate which the term ' peri-
 toneal' or 'splanchnic' may be used with perfect anatomical propiiety. This
 space is occupied by a vital or organized fluid, charged with corpuscles,
 which discover under the microscope characters distinctive of species. In-
 dependently of its physiological uses, this fluid enacts mechanical functions

 indispensable to the well-being of the animal. On it, as upon a pivot, the

 vermicular motions of the intestinal cylinder are performed. In locomotion

 the shortening and lengthening of the body in many species are quite extraor-
 dinary. The alimentary canal participates in this longitudinal motion. In

 the small species, as the JVa'ides, having transparent integuments, the longi-

 tudinal play of the intestine, running as it were backwards and forwards

 through the integumeiitary cylinder with great rapidity and precision, may
 be readily observed. This motion, more or less appreciable, occurs even in
 those species least gifted with the power of elongation. The septa of the

 segments approximate under the action of the longitudinal muscles, and the
 included portion of the intestine is shortened. This process, multiplied by
 the number of segments in the body, will give a considerable resultant of
  aggregate longitudinal motion.

     Although as a whole forming a cylinder, in no instance does the ali-
 mentary canal present the figure of a smooth-walled tube. The parietes are
  invariably sacculated, and often superficially multiplied in the most elaborate

 manner. In the lumbriciform species each segment of the body has its own
 independent stomach. Those of contiguous segments communicate through
220 REPORT-- 1851.

an opening considerably more contracted in diameter tlian that portion of
the intestine from which it leads. Thus the intestine of the Errant Annelids
especially, may be aptly compared to a line of pears, the apex of each suc-

cessive pear being applied to the base of its predecessor in the series. If

these ' bases ' were prolonged on each side, the stomach of the leech would
result; if compressed, that of those species in which the tube is nearly
straight. The membranous bridles tying the intestine to the integument
are endowed with contractile muscular property, minute fascicles of muscu-

lar fibre being detectable amidst the elastic fibres which form the bulk of the

structure. In nearly all Annelids the alimentary tube is provided with two

Andistinct orifices.  exception to this rule occurs in the instance of the

Planarian family, in which the digestive apparatus is constructed on the

type of that of the Radiata. There exist other minor families of Annelids

in which the terminal outlet of the alimentary system is not seated at the
extreme end of the body, but at a point, at the side, more or less removed

backwards from the head, resembling intimately the pattern on which that

of the Sipunculidce is formed. These varieties will be afterwards studied in

detail.

   The digestive apparatus of the Annelid, considered as a whole, admits of
subdivision essentially only into two portions, distinct alike in structure and
function. The first would comprehend the proboscis and oesophagus, the
second the glandular portion of the canal. The proboscis is no other than

a modification of the oesophagus. It is analogous to the latter in structure

and uses. It is not always a merely prehensile instrument. Its parietes are
beset in many species with glands which contribute a salivary secretion.
The jaws are only evolutions of the epithelial layer. The proboscis is to
the worm what the whole buccal apparatus is to the mammal. The true
oesophagus is essentially a muscular tube, in some species capable of ex-
traordinary elongation, and destined only to convey the food from the mouth

to the glandular segment of the digestive canal.

   On the parietes of the glandular or intestinal segment only one class of
glands is distinguishable. From various considerations, it cannot be doubted

that this forms the true biliary system of the Annelid. These glands, viewed

collectively, constitute a layer, more or less thick, almost always brilliantly

Ayellow, embracing, like a membrane, the whole cylinder of the intestine.

separate glandule consists only of a minute bag, communicating by a separate

opening with the intestine, and filled with oil-molecules of a bright yellow

colour. These glandules become, as the posterior extremity of the canal is
approached, separated from each other by a more and more sensible interval,

enabling the eye to resolve them into their true elementary structure. Esti-

mated then by the evidence derived from anatomy, the zoo- chemist would

recognise only two classes of secretions in the digestive processes of the

Annelid ; first the salivary, and secondly the biliary. It is not without strong

reasons that the inquiry may be here suggested, whether a given secretion,

although physiologically identical in different orders of animals, is on that

Aaccount chemically identical.  secretion may be entitled to be called ' bile,'

and the organ secreting it may, in all cases, with strict anatomical propriety,
be called the liver, and yet the secretion, in ultimate analysis, may present

the most striking diversities. According to the most recent researches of

Strecker, for instance, the bile of diff'erent animals is found to contain dif-

ferent proportions of alkaline taurocholates and glycocholates. In the bile

of fishes the resinoid constituents consist almost entirely of taurocholates,

with mere traces only of glycocholates. In the bile of dogs scarcely any-

thing but taurocholate of soda is discovered ; and the same remark applies
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  221

to the bile of serpents. The observations of Strecker further show, that in
the case of the dog, the nature of the food exercises no influence on the

composition of the bile. Sheep's bile contains a great preponderance of
taurocholate over glycocholate of soda ; while the bile of the goose, accord-

ing to Marson, contains scarcely anything but taurocholic acid.
    This tendency to variation occurs even in the colouring elements of the

bile. The characteristic bile-pigment is present in all classes of animals ; in

--the Carnivora and Omnivora, including Man, it is brown in colour the cho-
--lepyrrhin of Berzelius ; while in Birds, Fishes and Amphibia, the same bile is

intensely green in colour the biliverdin of the chemist. The cholepyrrhin is
always combined with soda or lime ; most commonly with the former. These
two varieties of biliary pigments will be found in the Annelids. In most
animals, the bile of which has been hitherto examined, the taurocholate of

soda is the principal constituent.
   In every kind of bile there exist invariably two essential constituents, namely,

the resinoid and the colouring element ; the resinoid constituent is the soda-
salt of one of the conjugate acids (glycocholic and taurocholic), having either
glycine or taurine for its adjunct. Another extraordinary fact very recently
established by Bensch, and confirmed by Strecker, may here be mentioned,
to illustrate the observation that the same function may be discharged in
different animals by a secretion which exhibits as many special diversities in
composition as the organ by which it is formed varies morphologically.
This fact is, that the bile of salt-water fishes consists almost entirely of potash-
salts, while that of the herbivorous mammalia consists almost entirely of
soda-salts, the very reverse of that which the chemist would have antici-

pated. Thus, then, in terms in common use in physiology, implying an es-

sential unity of idea, particulars, essentially diverse, are utterly lost. In the
invertebrate animals fat-cells constitute the chief morphological elements of
the bile. There can be no doubt that between fat and bile, in the lower
invertebrata especially, there obtains an intimate relationship. In the biliary
glandules of the Annelida, Crustacea and Echinodermata, all that is visible

consists only of oil-cells. Whatever be the real office discharged by these
oleaginous principles, observation, chemical and microscopic, proves that they
exist also in the higher animals. The proportion of fatty matter which (for
instance, in man) is contained in the blood of the portal vein, is to that in
the blood of the hepatic vein as 3*225 is to 1*885. It is supposed by Schmidt,
that the oily matter brought to the biliary organ by the blood, resolves itself
into sugar and water on the one hand, and into cholic acid and water on the
other ; the two constituents of cholic acid, glycerine and oleic acid, with
certain proportions of oxygen, being equivalent to sugar and cholic acid. It
may be at present affirmed as most probable, that the essential agency of the
ultimate hepatic cells results in the production out of the blood of sugar and
cholic acid, the former being eliminated by the hepatic veins, while the latter
remains in the secretion, and may be regarded as bearing to the bile the same
essential relation as that which exists Ijetween the urea and the urine. It
must now be clear that the action of the bile on the contents of the aliment-
ary tube must vary with the' differences of chemical composition exhibited
by this secretion. This must also be the case with reference to other organic
secretions. The true gastric juice of the Annelid, however, or wherever
secreted, may, for example, diff'er in many striking respects from that of man,
and yet it may enact a part in the process of digestion essentially correspond-
ent to that of which the human stomach (not the moutK) is the scene. There
remains, however, another general proposition with reference to the chemistry
of the fluids in the inferior animals which should be enounced with precision

to the comparative physiologist. The processes of preparation which the

food is required to undergo in its transit from the mouth to the blood may

not, and observation proves that it cannot be, divisible into the salivary,

gastric, biliary and pancreatic stages, in the humble invertebrate organism

as in the higher orders of vertebrated animals. The function of one secre-

tion is in reality merged into, and confounded with that of another, and that

in a manner which zoo-chemistry cannot yet explain.

In the higher animals all proximate organic principles, such as albumeti,

fibrine, caseine and gelatine, from whatever source derived, must in the pre-

paratory processes, be first reduced to one common principle. Accordingly,

actual observation has i-epeatedly proved that the organic bases of chyme and

chyle consist of a soluble variety or phase of albumen. But in the lower

animal, if this object is accomplished at all in the digestive system, it may be

realized by the agency of some other products than phosphoric, hydrochlo-

ric or lactic acid and pepsin. In the higher animal the food first undergoes

the influence of the saliva, an alkaline fluid ; then that of the gastric juice,

an acid fluid ; and lastly, that of the biliary and pancreatic secretions, which
are alkaline again. In the Zoophytes and Medusae, the digestive and the

blood-making processes are conducted in one and the same system of chan-

Hownels.  striking the contrast when estimated by the standard of what

occurs in man ! The parietes of these channels may in some cases be or-

ganized such as to be capable of furnishing a secretion fitted to accomplish

the required changes in the vital and chemical composition of the contained

fluid. But observation, in many others, places beyond doubt the fact of the

absence of any such special organization in these parietes. In a memoir

recently submitted to the Royal Society, the author has recorded a large

mass of carefully collected evidence to prove that in invertebrated animals,

the circulating or nutrient fluids are charged in great profusion with highly

organized freely floating corpuscles; and that upon these moving-cells, and not

--upon any parietal system of glands, the function 'devolves oi elaborating \h&

nutrient fluids of raising them from a lower to a higher grade of vitality.

The parietes of the cavities of the body and polypidom in Zoophytes ex-

hibit no glandular formations. The corresponding parts in the Medusae are
little less specialized in structure. And this is also the case with the Echi-

nodermata. In the Annelida, as already observed, the anterior half of the

alimentary canal is furnished with an order of glands, obviously distinguish-

able from that prevailing over the posterior moiety. The Crustacea present

a still further specialization of the glandular systems engaged in the element-

ary functions. Now, if in these several cases the digestive agency consist

essentially of a process by which heteromorphous principles are reduced to

one common principle, this object must be accomplished with a facility pro-

portionate to the simplicity of the animal's structure and its degradation in

the zoological scale : the chemistry of the humblest being becomes thus more

wonderful, because more vigorous, than tiiat of the highest animal. This

reasoning must be necessarily conjectural until facts whereon to rest it are

collected, to prove in what and how many respects the ultimate product of

the digestive chemistry, the finished blood, differs in difl^erent animals. In

the memoir quoted, the attempt has been made to demonstrate that in Zoo-

phytes, Medusae, Echinodermata, and the Annelida, sea-water is admitted

through the digestive organs directly into the midst of the nutritive fluids

that the latter possess therefore a power of assimilating, vitalizing, this ex-

traneous substance with a facility quite unknown in the higher animal.

   It has never yet occurred to the physiologist to consider that a " simpli-

city " iu the architecture of the solids of the animal body must iuvolve a
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  223

correlative " simplicity " in the composition of \he fluids. If the solids are
reduced in their standard of organization, it follows that the fluids are re-
quired to be less elaborately prepared, in order to supply these solids with
the materials of increase and renewal. If the solids of the Zoophyte or

Medusa were complexly structured like those of the human body, the fluids
of the Zoophyte, in obedience to the law of correlation now expounded,
would present the same highly-wrought composition as those of the human
body. The position then may be defined as involving a physiological law,

that the processes of nutrition are simple in proportion as the animal is low
in rank in the zoological scale ; in other words, the fluids and solids are less
and less removed from the standard of lifeless, inorganic matter, as the ani-
mal nears more and more the primordial link in the zoological chain.

    These general observations will tend to remove the mystery of the absence
in inferior organisms of systems of solid parts on which, in the higher, the
most important functions devolve. They will also explain why it is that the
digestive and circulating systems are fused into and confounded in one
common order of channels; that special organs answering to the renal, of the
vertebrated animal, do not exist. It is probable, from the very chemical
nature of the inferiorly organized fluids of the lower grades in the inverte-
brate series, that there may exist in these fluids no urea to be removed ; a

Arenal apparatus would therefore prove superfluous and unnecessary.

separate order of gastric glands, supplying an acid fluid, may not exist in
 the Annelida, because that description of change which such a product is
 fitted to impress on the food, may not be required in order to its conversion

 into their blood*.
     This subject deserves the deepest study of the physiologist. It is obviously

 pregnant of valuable results. The real question is, whether the same organ,
 homologously, in the animal series produces the same secretion chemically,
 capable of doing the same work and no other ; for if, for example, the bile

 of the Annelid does the work, not only of bile, but also of gastric juice, then

 it follows, that, although the gland producing this fluid in the Annelid may

 be homologous with the liver of the higher animals, the secretion furnished
 by that gland is not the correlate of that afforded by the liver of the higher
 animals. Within the province of human physiological anatomy, it may indeed
 be argued, that although it may be proved by dissection that the group of
 salivary glands constitute truly one homogeneous apparatus, the parts of

  which bear by their texture a perfect analogy to each other, yet that physio-
  logical analysis and chemical experiments, on the contrary, by pointing out

  the diversity of the secreted fluids, and by causing the observer to notice the
  nervous force which regulates the secretions, teach us that each gland pre-
 sides over one special act, and that, although the structure may be the same,

  the functions are performed under the agency of distinct and independent

  influences. It cannot, for instance, at present be disputed, that although the
  different kinds of saliva are poured into the mouth simultaneously, their use

  remains nevertheless distinct; and experience proves that the principal

  function of the parotid gland is to secrete a fluid which is to favour masti-

  cation, that of the sub-maxillary gland for gustation, and of the sub-lingual

  gland and buccal follicles for deglutition. It is only by the assistance of
  these physiological data that the modifications which the salivary organs

  undergo in the different classes of vertebrated animals can be studied and
  understood according to their true meaning. The characters of salivary

  glands are not to be deduced from their anatomical structure, their volume

   on the very points to which attention is drawn in the text.
224 REPORT-- 1851.

or form, but from the nature of the functions to which they are subservient.
It would therefore prove a physiological error, such as has been committed
by J. F. Meckel, to look for parotid and sub-maxillary glands in birds, as those
organs cannot exist; since the two corresponding functions, mastication and
gustation, are generally wanting in this class of animals. It is thus clear that
the useof all the salivary glands which arefound in birds,should be looked upon
as ministering to the only function which with them accompanies the inges-
tion of food, viz. deglutition. The thick and viscous fluid which is secreted

by the glands of birds has nothing in common with the saliva of the parotid

and sub-maxillary glands, and is perfectly analogous to the fluid secreted by
the sub-lingual gland and buccal follicles of the Mammalia. The parotid is
found in its greatest degree of development in such of the Mammalia as ha-
bitually chew dry and hard substances, whilst it becomes atrophied in those
which live in water and feed upon moist food, though the salivary glands
preserve their normal development with reference to the functions with which

they are connected.

   The preceding principles, drawn from considerations resting on the evi-
dence of general physiology, will, it is hoped, prove of service in elucidating
some of the difficult questions which will arise in the attempt to resolve the
true meaning of the gland structures engaged in the alimentary system of the

Annelida.

    This class of animals, like all others, is distinguishable into those families
which subsist on animal food, and into those which are phytophagous ; in ad-

dition to which a smaller group may be recognised, whose food is the fluid
medium in which they live, extracting from it when swallowed all that it
may contain of matter suitable to their wants. The researches of modern
naturalists with reference to the Mollusca, have shown that all the species of
the same genus do not always inhabit the same kind of situation ; for in
many instances some are found on land, some on fresh water, and others in
salt. These researches would throw little light on the habitats of the Anne-
lida, since of them it may be stated at once that more than four-fifths of the
whole class are inhabitants of the sea and the sea-shore.

   The genus Nais is represented on land and freshwater by one species,
the genus Lumbricus, by the familiar Earth-worm ; while the genera, Ilirtido,
Hcemopis, Nephelis, Clepsina, Gordius and Planaria are almost entirely
land and freshwater in their habitats. With these exceptions it may be
stated of the Annelida as a class, that it is exclusively marine. The marine
Annelida are again subdivisible into the carnivorous and herbivorous groups

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and these again into minor groups, according to the varieties of these two

descriptions of food for which they exhibit an instinctive preference. Of the
phytophagous species, many affect particular families of Algte, near high-
water mark ; others those restricted to the ebb-line of the tide. The car-
nivorous species, as regards their mode of obtaining food, exhibit still more
numerous varieties. These may always be distinguished by the conformation

of the proboscis and of the alimentary canal. In few cases is it possible to
infer the nature of the food of any given worm, merely by the inspection of
the contents of the intestinal canal ; it is more practicable to predicate the
habits of an Annelid by the general structure of its digestive system in which
the proboscis, when present, is included.

   " The disposition of the alimentary canal," says Cuvier, " determines, in a
manner perfectly absolute, the kind of food by which the animal is nourished
but if the animal did not possess, in its senses and organs of motion, the

--means of distinguishing the kinds of aliment suited to its nature, it is obvious

it could not exist." Cuvier, Comp. Anat. vol. i. p. 55. Trans. It will be

necessary therefore to resort to the general principles of the science of Com-

parative Anatomy, while elucidating the uses of these divisions of the di-
gestive system in the Annelida which dissection discloses. The external
organs (tentacles) appended to the head, have already been shown to be

used by some species in the prehension of food. In others they subserve

only the purposes of touch and general protection to the head.

   The proboscis, though used also for the seizure of the I'ood, bears not to
the tentacles the remotest anatomical analogy. It is now proposed to enter

at length upon the consideration of the conformation, anatomical structure

and physiological meaning of the numerous varieties traceable in the organs

devoted to the processes of digestion and assimilation in this class of

animals.

The genera SerpulcB, Sabellce and Amphitritce, are distinguished by the

fact, that they subsist on fluid food ; if not absolutely so, on those minute

particles of organic matter which perchance may float on the surrounding

water. This water is directed in a perpetual stream towards the mouth, by
means of the vibratile cilia with which in part for this purpose the branchiae
are provided. The current thus dashed against the mouth is swallowed, and

the suspended particles of food arrested in the digestive organs, while the

water, which was used only as a mechanical vehicle for the conveyance of

the food into the interior of the body, is rapidly carried along the intestinal

canal, and ejected through the extreme outlet of the body, situated at the

bottom of the tube, in streams sustained in rapid motion by the ceaseless

vibration of definitely disposed cilia. This water current, traversing in the

manner indicated the whole interior length of the body, constitutes ' a fact

of great consequence in the ceconomy of these tubicolous Annelids. It is
through its agency that the feculent refuse is projected from the bottom to the

upper orifice of the tube, and that the habitation of the worm is maintained
in a state of never-varying cleanliness and purity. The rectum or tail extre-
mity of the intestine in these genera is lined internally, and to some distance

inwards from the anus, with large and vigorous cilia, which at this situation

reinforce the current descending along the intestine and drive it outwards

with great force.

   In the SerpulcB, the pharynx and oesophagus extend from the oral orifice

to the termination of what may be called the thoracic segment of the body
whereat is situated a crop-like dilatation of the canal. The pharynx and
oesophagus are beset on their internal surface with numerous minute follicles,
which contribute a secretion having some digestive property. The walls of
this segment are delicate and membranous. At the ' crop,' however, the

parietes present increased density, having become more strongly muscular.

The uses of this portion of the canal are manifestly those of crushing minute
fragments of stones, sand-particles, &c. which may be swallowed ; that this
description is swallowed by the Serpulce, may be proved conclusively by the

observation of the sandy and earthy contents of the intestine posterior to the

crop. Like the corresponding structure in graminivorous birds, it is in these
worms a crushing and grinding engine. It is curious, however, to remark,

that it does not exist in some few species of Sabellce, so nearly akin in organ-

ization to the Serpulce; it is present in Amphitrita alveolata (Plate XI.
fig. 50 a), absent in Sabella chlorema, absent also in S. vesiculosa. The pre-

sence of this dilatation of the canal is ordinarily indicated externally by a

bulge of the body. From the annulus, coinciding in situation with the crop,

the true intestine begins (fig. 50 h) ; this portion of the alimentary tract in
nearly all Annelids, is characterized by a bright yellow-coloured, streaked
by a rich network of strikingly red blood-vessels, composing a surface of

1851.                                                           Q

great beauty. At this point the true biliary apparatus begins ; it is the source
and cause of the yellow colour. The ultimate glandular cells of the liver are
disposed in minute groups, square or round, or oblong, according to the
figure of the space enclosed by the ultimate capillaries of the vascular mesh.

No part of the structure of the Annelid is so profusely supplied with blood

as the parietes of the biliary segment of the intestine. There are here de-
tectable in all species elaborate reticulations, while a blood-vessel can only
with difficulty be observed in other parts of the body. The group of oil-cells
contained in a separate involucrum, just large enough to occupy a mesh of
this rete mirabile, constitute the liver in real fact. This little group of oleous

molecules, floating in a semi-fluid substance of a brilliantly yellow colour,
represent the real elements of the biliary organ. In no instance, in any
species, is any departure from this type of structure exhibited ; the liver,
therefore, in these animals is diffused under the character of a bright yellow
flocculent stratum, over nearly the whole extent of the alimentary canal. It
is most developed near the raid-body, the elementary glandules becoming
gradually more distinct and removed from each other in proportion as the tail
is approached. In the Serpulidm, Sabellce, and Amphitrita, the rectal por-
tion of the intestine dilates, becomes greater in diameter, and the orifice itself

is a capacious opening. It is not difficult, in this provision, to perceive the
manifest indications of design; by it every obstacle to the free escape of the
contents of the intestine is removed ; no impediment, such as that would be
if the orifice were guarded by a sphincter muscle, is offered to the action of
the cilia, upon the efficient operation of which the well-being of the little
cell-prisoner so completely depends.

   The intestinal system of the Terehellce (fig. 51) differs in several material
respects from that of the Serpulm and Sahellce. The oesophagus, a strong
muscular tube, in this genus is remarkably long ; it is not however in the
least degree protrusile. These worms are distinguished for the strength and
muscularity of the lips, which are superiorly and inferiorly placed with re-
ference to the mouth. These appendages to the mouth are well-adapted in
a mechanical sense for swallowing mud, soft earth, clay, and dirty water.
During their slow, awkward and tedious locomotion, the Terebellce carry the
mouth close to the ground, the lips being actively at work in turning up
the soft soil. The posterior half (fig. 51 a) of the oesophageal tube is em-
braced by a bright yellow glandular mass, differing from the ordinary biliary
layer in being composed of larger, more prominent, lobulated masses. It is
quite indisputable, both from its structure and situation, that this is a true
glandular structure, and that it supplies a secreted product tributary to di-
gestion. From this structure the lesson may be drawn, that the comparative
physiologist should not feeKoo confident in assigning a biliary function to
any structure in the inferior animals merely because it possesses a yellow co-
lour. Other glandular structures generate the yellow pigment, while in-
stances might be multiplied in considerable number, in which true biliary
organs are not distinguished by a yellow colour, but by a green, or dark
brown. In the progress of our studies in the Annelidan class of Inverte-
brata, the varieties mentioned in the mere colour of the liver will soon fall
under description. From its position around the posterior end of the oeso-

phagus, the glandular organ in the TereheUa. supplies probably a fluid bear-
ing some analogy to saliva, and yet it is far too elaborate a structure to be
dedicated exclusively to a mere salivary function. Here again is an illus-
tration of the difficulty of determining the strict meaning of an organ on the
mere ground of a similarity in anatomical relations ; no less fallacious is that
resting on analogy of ultimate structure. These physiological difficulties are
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  227

not encountered in the anatomy of the higher and more specialized or-
ganisms ; but in inferior forms, fusions of organs and substitutions of func-

tions are frequent in their occurrence.
    In the TerehellcB, the CESophagus is succeeded by a segment of the canal,

distinguished by the absence of the yellow colour. It presents the charac-
teristics of an elongated gizzard (fig. 516); the parietes of this portion are
muscular and dense, and little vascular. It is generally found on examina-
tion to be devoid of contents ; the alimentary substance does not stop or
lodge in it. This gizzard-like portion is followed by the true biliary in-
testine, divided by constrictions into annular segments, equalling those of the
integument in number, although not similar in character. In intimate struc-
ture this portion answers with exactness to the Annelidan type. The bile-
gland consists essentially of minute lobuli of oleous molecules (fig. 51 c), en-

veloped in a common capsule, surrounded by a blood-vessel, and opening into
the intestine by a common orifice. It is remarkable that in these animals
there should exist such a monopoly of blood in the biliary apparatus, while
so little blood-proper is observed in the body as a whole. From this circum-
stance it may be reasonably argued that the bile in these inferior forms of
organization unites in itself some other function in the work of primary
assimilation than that limitedly defined office which is discharged by the bile
of the higher animal. The biliary glandular layer of the intestine becomes
thinner and thinner as the posterior termination is approximated ; and the
contents acquire more and more the excrementitious character. The rectum,

as in the Terebella, expands, and ends in a large anal outlet ; the interior of
this part of the intestine exhibiting, as in kindred genera, a rich lining of

vibratile cilia.

   Arenicola Piscatorum lives almost exclusively on sand. The ' coils ' ob-

served on soft sandy shores, supported always by a substratum of clay, are
caused by these familiar ' lugs.' The sand is swallowed as the animal
advances through the soil, traversing the whole extent of the body ; and

yielding up for the purposes of digestion what it happens to contain of
organic matter, it is finally rejected under the form of sand-coils, remarked
so commonly on the sea-shore. Arenicola is capable of exserting the pha-
ryngeal membrane to some distance beyond the extremity of the head

(fig. 52 a). When thus protruded it answers all the mechanical purposes of

a proboscis, although devoid of hard parts, or jaws. The mucous surface,

both of this part and of the oesophagus to some distance inwards, is thickly
beset with minute glandules projecting in relief above the surface. They

contribute the first organic fluid to the action of which the food is sub-
mitted. Deglutition is impracticable in this worm, unless the sand be almost

saturated with water ; dry sand cannot be swallowed, and if too wet, it is not
well grasped by the proboscis.

   The oesophagus (fig. 52 b) is a strongly muscular tube, surrounded by a

frame-work of four longitudinal vessels, with detached smaller branches for

the nutrition of this segment of the canal ; compared, however, with the in-

testinal segment of the canal, the oesophagus is scantily supplied with blood.

At the point of junction between the oesophagus and true intestine, and just
anterior to the cardiac centre of the blood-system, may be seen two pyriform

bodies (fig. 52 c), hollow in the interior, and communicating by a large
opening with the channel of the oesophagus. They are sometimes found to

contain a greenish yellow fluid, which tinges the surface over which it flows.
The microscope entirely fails to discover in the parietes of these diverticula

--of the oesophagus, any evidences of glandular formation, nothing to throw

light on the mechanism of their secreting function. It may be affirmed with

                                                                       q2

certainty that they do not enact any part concerned in the reproductive func-

tions. With the organs devoted to the hitter uses they exhibit no sort of

communication. The structure of the cesopliageal parietes are coloured by

no pigment. The intestine proper, however, coincides to the Annelidan law,

and displays the brightest yellow colour, streaked in every direction by the

plexiform blood-vessels, in the meshes of which the biliary gland-structure is

Alodged.  correct conception of the ultimate structure of intestinal parietes

may be derived from a close examination of the figure of the circulation of

Arenicola, formerly given (Plate III. fig. 7,/). At the commencement of the
posterior third of the body the digestive canal of this worm loses its enteric

character. The liver-enveloped tube degenerates into a smooth-walled,

straightened canal, stretching under this form from this point to the tail

the traces of segmentation so general in the digestive system of the Annelida

are here scarcely perceptible. Although destitute of biliary glandular

tissue in its coats, the posterior straight segment of the canal is surrounded by

a curious loose flocculent tissue, which both Lamarck and Cuvier have mis-

taken for a part of the reproductive system. Each elementary process of this

tissue consists ofashigle vessel, terminating in a culde-sac, and enveloped in a

layer of nucleated cells ; they project to the distance of about the eighth of

an inch from the exterior surface of the intestine ; they are also attached to
the interior surface of the integumentary cylinder, a few extending from the

one to the other. Milne-Edwards defines them as "appendices secreteurs
de la matiere faune, excretee par la peau " (vaisseaux biliares ?). Lamarck
has described them as ovaria. As already stated, they consist of a single

vessel (not a looped vessel), around which a layer of nucleated cells clusters.

If these cells produce anything, it must enter the blood-channel, which forms

the axis of the process, and thence mingle with the blood. If they do 7iot,

the blood-vessel must be regarded merely as a collateral receptacle into

which the blood may rush during the contortions of the animal, and as bear-'

ing some analogy to that system of vessels which surrounds the lungs of the

cetacean mammalia. If they are glands, they are most certainly destitute of

excretory ducts. If they are designed to supply a fluid tributive to diges-

tion, it is anomalous that they lie disposed over the hindmost segment of the

digestive canal. There is ho character detectible in the structure of the cells

suggestive of their true function. Neither these appendages, nor the pyri-

form diverticula attached to the oesophagus (Plate XI. fig. 52c), can in the

present state of knowledge be physiologically defined. It is not easy to ex-

plain, within the limits of the same class of animals, why the same secretion

should proceed in different species from organs so remarkably dissimilar in

structure. Between these pouches in Arenicola, for example, and the salivary

glandules which beset the proboscis and oesophagus of nearly all other

Annelids, there exists no homological affinity. Analogy therefore affords no

ground whereon to rest the supposition that their secretion consists of saliva.

Neither can it consist of bile, for already an extensively diffused gland is

furnished for the production of this fluid. It admits of no denial that special

necessities arise in some species of animals, from the nature of the food,.

obliging the provision of some special organ to supply peculiar wants. The

physiological signification of such organs cannot be explained on " general

principles." The peculiar want must first be understood, the peculiar cor-

relate of that want may then be defined.

In Arenicola the cutaneous system is very profusely supplied with mucus-

producing follicles. The slippery secretion by which the animal is externally

covered, must very materially facilitate its progress through the sandy soil

of the shore, by diminishing the friction between its sides and those of the

channel through which it is advancing. It requires little knowledge of the
composition of the sand of the sea-shore, saturated twice every twenty-four
hours by the tide, to understand that the food of these worms must share the
properties of the animal and the vegetable kind. The inferior forms of
life swarm in every minute mass of sand. The microscope detects thousands
of infusoria and entomostraca, and fragments of algaceous vegetables;
these organic substances constitute the food of these worms. The sand
swallowed " gives bulk," distends the canal, and sustains by mechanical con-
tact, the stimulus required for the due vermicular action of the tube.

    Clymene arenicoida displays a proboscis formed precisely on the same
model as that of Arenicola, and devoted to the same uses ; as this worm, like
Arenicola, lives on sand. The digestive system, however, is constructed
very differently from that of the latter. The oesophagus is short, the biliary
intestine begins near the head, and continues without any variety of struc-
ture to the tail. Neither the diverticular pouches of the oesophagus, nor

the gland-like flocculent vessels noticed in Arenicola, are detectible in this
species ; so that while the food and proboscis are identical, the digestive

system presents nothing in common in the two species. Another exemplifi-

cation is here given of the difficidty and danger of predicating the function

of an organ from the nature of its anatomical structure.
    The cognate genera of Amphinome, Chloe, Pleione, Euphrosyne, and

Hipponoe, far from common on the British coasts, in the pattern of the
alimentary canal, approach more or less intimately to the dorsibranchiate

type already described.

    The Euniciadcp. (Plate X. figs. 53, 54) are invariably armed with a power-
fully-jawed proboscis. It is capable of protrusion to a very slight degree beyond

the level of the mouth ; when fully extended it does not extend to the point of
the head. The jaws in all the species are very similarly formed and disposed
on the proboscis. Taking E. antennata for type, we observe that the jaws are
symmetrically bilateral, moved by strong muscles. The corneous processes
 on either side of the proboscis, which constitute the jaws, are seen to con-
sist of two denticulated plates or saws, the teeth being directed inwards, of
 a reaping-hook like piece, blacker in colour and stronger than the former,
 and presenting a sharp edge; and another straight, tapering, and acutely
pointed piece, which in some species is situated to the outside of the former,
and in some to the inside. In such an engine the mechanician may recog-
 nise the presence of the crushing, cutting, sawing, and piercing elements
 artfully designed to do the multifold labour which the proboscis of these
 rapacious worms is required to perform. In their native haunts they prowl

 under stones, and closely resemble the Nereids in their habits, affecting simi-
 lar situations. The oesophagus in this genus supports the tubular heart, and
 presents the characters of an elongated gizzard. The intestine is brilliantly
 yellow throughout the middle third of the body, and segmented by constric-
 tions corresponding with those of the external body. The ultimate anatomy

 of the biliary layer corresponds with those accounts of this organ already
 given : it is densely vascular. Although the biliary gland commences in

 front by an abrupt defined line, it very gradually disappears posteriorly, nor
 entirely until it reaches the caudal extreme of the body. The anal orifice is
 situated on the dorsal aspect of the tail, the latter being prolonged into two
 long styles. It is a fact of fixed constancy in the organization of the Anne-
 lida, that the outlet of the alimentary canal is situated dorsally whenever it

  is not terminal. In the Serpulce, Amphitritce, Terebellce, it is terminal, the

 mouth being also terminal. Whenever the anus is dorsally situated, the

 mouth is ventrally placed ; these are fixed quantities in the organization of

 the Annelids.
--330 REPORT 1851.

The genera Lycidice, Aglaura and (Enone, are distinguished readily from

all other Annelids by, the existence o{ four styles, two on either side of the

anal outlet. It is not a little to be wondered at that such exact observers as

Audouin and Milne-Edwards should have overlooked this most peculiar con-

formation. In all other respects the portraits of these worms given by these
distinguished authors in Crochard's edition of the ' Regne Animal,' are

faithful and characteristic. These genera, remarkable for the beauty of

the curves into which their very elongated bodies are thrown during loco-

motion, frequent, in search of food, all those situations in which the Euni-
ciadce are found. To the latter family they bear an intimate resemblance in

the structure of the jaws of the proboscis. Like that of Eunice, this organ

is short and armed with jaws of four separate plate-like pieces on either side
(fig. 55 a). The edge of each element presented towards the median-line is
denticulated with recurved short serrations. The two inferior portions are
drawn into the shape of a reaping-hook, the base being toothed. The descrip-
tion now given applies more especially to Aglaura fulgida of Savigny.

   In Lycidice Ninetta (fig. 54) the jaws comprise three elements, having each

a peculiar conformation. The inferior jaw is a flattened club-shaped instru-
ment adapted for slicing ; the next displays the form of an acutely-pointed

reaping-hook, while the next is bluntly serrated. These three peculiarly con-

structed instruments are evidently designed for three distinct mechanical pur-

poses in the seizure and mastication of food. In another species of Lycidice,

hitherto undescribed, the proboscis is furnished with jaws which are com-
posed of pyramidal pieces only, and adapted exclusively for piercing. The

hook-like and serrated elements are wanting. This species is found only on

certain Alga, and its food is probably of an exclusively vegetable nature.

   The proboscis in the genus (Enone coincides closely in character with that
of the two preceding genera. The jaws occur under the shape of curved

denticulated plates. In the conformation of the alimentary canal in these

genera there is nothing peculiar to be noticed. The oesophagus is long,
and terminates where the biliary segment begins. At this point it is em-

braced by a large circular vessel, by means of which a communication is

established between the ventral and dorsal moieties of the circulating system.

It is strong-walled and muscular. It is destitute of glandules ; these are

limited to the parietes of the proboscis.

In the biliary intestine of this, as indeed of nearly all other Annelids,

the stomach proper and intestine are confounded both in structure and in

function. It is not improbable from the disproportionately extensive tract

of surface over which this yellow glandular organ is distributed in the Anne-

lida, that the product secreted by it may unite the qualities of the gastric

Onand biliary digestive fluids.  the possibility of such fusion of functions,

observations have already been adduced.

Dr. Johnston observes with reference to the proboscides of the Nereids,

that "the pattern after which they (prickles of the proboscis) are arranged,

varies in some species ; but it is almost impossible to define those variations
in words, and the character fails us in the nearest allied species, where only
it is required. Such is also the case with the number of serratures along the

falcate edge of the jaws; though the character is one not to be neglected ;
but from the peculiar shape of the jaw, I have sometimes found a diflSculty
in determining the exact number of these serratures ; and in other instances
have had a doubt whether one or two of them, from their obsoleteness, ought

to be reckoned*." These difficulties do not accord with my experience.

With a good microscope it becomes quite clear always that different species,

however nearly allied, are characterized by proboscidian jaws of distinctive

* Annals and Magazine of Natural History, vol. iv.
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  231

 conformations. This, however, is only true with reference to adult indivi-
 duals, since it is easy to assign to distinct species individuals which really
 differ only in age, and that on the ground of an apparent difference in the

 form and shape of the proboscidean jaws.
    The Nereids (figs. 55, 56, 57, 58) swallow a considerable amount of clay

 and sand. Observation of the habits and habitats strongly suggest, however,
their carnivorous disposition. The proboscis is well- constructed, and the jawa
aptly disposed, for seizing a living prey. The intestine is filled always, espe-
 cially throughout the posterior half of the body, with a pulpy matter, of which
sand and clay form a large proportion. These worms frequent subterranean
channels constructed by themselves ; and this mechanical purpose is not the
least important of the uses to which their proboscides are devoted. Through
these haunts they move with great rapidity. They prowl on all animals which
perchance may be brought within the precincts of their territory by the

mechanical force of the tidal currents.

   As the British species in the genus Nereis amount to a considerable num-
ber, it were tedious in this place to enumerate all the specific variations from

the generic type which are found to occur in the figures of the proboscidean

jaws (figs. 55, 56, 57, 58). In the definition of species, these particulars may

hereafter prove of essential service.
    Assuming for type this organ as it occurs in Nereis margaritacea (fig. 55),

it is found to be capable of extrusion to some distance beyond the line of the
head; that the jaws are two in number, one on each side of the terminal
orifice of the proboscis ; that each jaw consists of a falcate, horny, dark pro-
cess, the internal curved edge of which is irregularly notched : the cha-
racters of these notches become distinctive of species. In some they are
uniformly round ; in others they are sharp and recurved ; in others these
serrations point forwards. This latter is the case in more than one of the
smaller species. It is important to remember that in no species of this genus
do the jaws exceed 'i\ie pair ' in number. In addition to the jaws, properly
so called, the proboscis in some species is pricked with minute corneous
points at various parts of its surface, for the purposes obviously of protec-
tion from external injury. In N. margaritacea the oesophagus extends back-
wards to the level of the seventh or eighth foot ; it is a straight muscular
tube as usual; but it is curious to observe that the two lateral pouches
communicating with the oesophagus already described in Arenicola, re-appear
in the genus Nereis. They are obviously identical in structure to those of
Arenicola, and subservient to similar purposes. At the distance of three or

four feet beyond the point of these pouches the biliary intestine begins. It

is strongly segmented. In the smaller species the interval of constriction

equals in length the sacculated portion. The only means of distinguishing

between the limits of the true ' digestive ' intestine and the colonic, consist
in the character of their respective contents ; true faecal matter never lodges

in the former, it always accumulates in the latter. In those Annelida, as the
Nerine, for ejcample, which are remarkable for the elongation of the body,
the posterior half or third of the intestinal canal is loaded with fseculent

accumulations, imparting their colour to the whole body. The system of
the blood-proper, as formerly indicated, is elaborately developed in the Ne-

reids, and the walls of the digestive canal are embraced by a dense tissue of

a closely reticulated plexus. In the Nereids, the integumentary structures

are far more vascular than those of any other known Annelid. This circum-
stance suffices to account for their proverbial muscular activity. The evi-

dences of structure and habits concur to support the view which assigns to

these worms an almost exclusively carnivorous character.
232 REPORT^--1851.

   The PhyllodocidtB unquestionably live exclusively on animal matter. They
are always found near low-water mark, amongst corallines, sponges, minute
Actiniae, shelled Mollusca, and Cirrhipeds. Phyllodoce viridis prowls amidst
the small Cirrhipeds of our rocks, and is frequently found in companionship
with the LiniadcE. These worms may be frequently observed to thrust their

heads between the valves of the shells, protruding their proboscides to suck
up the juices of the defunct prey, for they seldom attack the living inhabitants.
In all the species of this genus the proboscis is constructed with express refer-
ence to the operation of sucking. This instrument, in these worms quite
ceaseless in its operation, is edentulous. It is gifted with no means of grasp-

ing, or cutting or piercing ; circumstances from which it may be reasonably
inferred that the food upon which the worms subsist must be so fluid as to

admit of being sucked into tlie oral orifice seated at the extremity of the
proboscis. This instrument in Phyllodoce viridis equals a fourth of the

body in length when fully extended. The surface, which is exterior when
protruded, is beset profusely with mammillary glandules raised above the
plane of the surface. Under the higher powers of the microscope these

glandules resolve themselves into minute Florence flask-shape involucra,
filled with spherical oleous cells, which, unlike ordinary oil-molecules, are
charged with brownish molecules surrounding a central nucleus. It is im-
possible to trace with the eye the presence of an excretory channel in the
axis of the flask. It is therefore probable that the secretion furnished by
these proboscidian papillae (as at 58), considerable in quantity, evidently
from their vast number, results from the successive bursting of the contained
cells ; those dehiscing first which are situated nearest to the attached extre-

mity of the gland. When withdrawn into the interior of the body, the pro-
boscis may be seen in an inverted position embraced by the oesophagus. It
may be here remarked, that in every Annelid in which a proboscis exists, the

process of withdrawing it into the interior of the body is as beautiful as it
is perfect in a mechanical sense. The jaws, when they are present, first
meet at the mid-point of the terminal orifice of the proboscis ; they are then
reversed, that is, their extremities are directed backwards towards the tail of

the animal : they may now be seen moving backwards in the axis of the
oesophagus as the act of withdrawing the proboscis proceeds. To explain
the mechanism of this movement, it is required only to conceive the exist-
ence of two concentric cylinders of longitudinal muscular fibres ; one on the
outside of the proboscis under the papillae, and the other on the inside be-
neath the mucous lining. It is now easy to perceive, that when the exterior

cylinder retracts, its muscles contracting, the effect on the proboscis will be
that of everting or protruding it ; and when, conversely, the interior cylinder
of muscular fibres diminishes its length (the muscles contracting^, the pro-
boscis will be furled upon itself, as it were, and drawn backwards into the
interior of the body. The orifice at the extremity of the organ, whether
guarded or not with jaws, is surrounded by a sphincter muscle, by which the
alimentary object is firmly grasped while being carried back into the oeso-
phagus during the inversion and retraction of the proboscis. These move-

ments may be readily imitated by the finger of a glove. It is a curious ana-

tomical fact, that the glandules furnishing the secretion, to the agency of
which the food is first submitted, should be restricted to the parietes of the
 proboscis, since those of the oesophagus, properly so called, are generally
without a trace of them. Such glandular organization points to the pro-
boscis as the analogon of the mouth and pharynx, with their tributary glands
in the higher animals. For reasons, however, already advanced, it were
unsafe, on the ground of this apparent analogy, to rest the inference that
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  23S

the papillary glandules of the proboscis, like their elaborate representatives
in the mouth, furuished a fluid for the exclusive purpose of insalivation.

    In the Phyllododdce the biliary intestine begins where the mechanical oeso-
phagus ends. Neither a crop nor a gizzard intervenes between these two
divisions. It is on this account that the inference, denying to the probos-
cidian glandules an exclusively salivary office, is rendered probable. These
glandules in reality may supply a fluid, uniting in its chemical agency the
twofold properties of the gastric and the salivary.

   The segmentation of the body, exteriorly, is in these ornate worms very
deeply marked. This fact determines the degree in which the intestinal

canal is segmented. It is curious, however, that the oesophagus should in
no case conform in the outline of its structure to that. of the integuments.

In no known instance is it sacculated or annulated, like the intestine. This
latter division of the canal in these worms is quite moniliform in figure, the
contiguous sacculi being divided by an interval of constriction equal in length
to themselves. The biliary glandules, which in the PhyllodocidcB are charged

with a dark green pigment, are limited in their distribution to the dilated

portions of the intestine, and may be^ traced in diminishing numbers to the

extreme tail-end of the tube. It is probable that the absence of the charac-

teristic colour in the biliary layer of the intestine may depend in some way
upon entire absence of all red pigment from the blood. Such facts as these,

bearing to each other an evident though unresolved connection, suggest the
conclusion that all local pigmentary accumulations, whether occurring in
glandular organs or integumentary structures, are mere modifications of the
primary pigment matter of the blood. The blood in the Phyllodocid<s being
devoid of all colour, it is accordingly difficult to conceive the source whence

the materials of colour may be drawn by the biliary organs. In confirmation
of this doctrine the instance of Phyllodoce viridis may be mentioned. All
the structures in the body in this worm are strongly tinged with a grass-

green colour, and that probably because the blood is densely charged with

this pigment.

    The Syllidce (Plate XI. fig. 59) are proboscidian worms, and no known

--species presents an exception to this rule, in some they occur as minute

 transparent bodies on the inside of the orifice of the proboscis. This organ

 in S. prolifera (fig. 59) exhibits four of these little corneous formations (fig.
 59a); they are crenated at their distal end. In S.armillaris these piercing
 instruments are replaced by a single cup-shaped organ, of the mechanism of
 whose action it is difficult to form a correct conception. It is placed on the
 superior edge of the terminal orifice of the proboscis ; the edges of this orifice

 being fringed with fleshy papillae, which are obviously, from their situation,
 the seat of exaggerated tactile sensibility. In other species there is no corneous
 formation of any sort superadded to the proboscis. These Annelids are gene-

 rally found creeping over the surface of algaceous plants. From the absence

 of any structure bearing the semblance of browsing organs, or mechanical
 additions of any description to the proboscis calculated to cut and masticate

 vegetable substances, taken in conjunction with the circumstances under

 which these worms are commonly discovered, they may be classed \\ith con-
 fidence among the herbivorous Annelida. This conclusion is supported by

 the anatomical proofs derived from the character of the digestivecanal.

     In the Syllidce the proboscis (fig. 59 6) is capable of extrusion to a con-
 siderable distance beyond the mouth. Unlike that of nearly all other Anne-
 lids, it is quite smooth and destitute of all traces of parietal glandules. In this
 genus the papillary glands are transferred to the walls of the oesophagus

 (fig. 59 c). They may be readily seen projecting beyond the plane of the ex-
--234 REPORT 1851.

 ternal surface of this part of the tube, in form of transparent vesicular tubuli

 filled with minute cells. To the oesophagus in all SyllidcB succeeds an elon-

 gated highly glandulated gizzard-like portion peculiar to and characteristic of
 this genus (fig. 59 d). The parietes of this portion are not perhaps dense and
 muscular enough to claim for it the character of a true gizzard. The glan-
 dules are arranged in transverse or circular rows, and communicate with the
 interior by means of a minute excretory tube or orifice. One type of struc-
 ture prevails throughout all varieties of the secernent glandules, whether
 biliary or salivary, discoverable in the digestive system of the Annelida. They
 resolve themselves, in ultimate analysis, into membranous capsules filled with
 secondary cells, for the most part oleous. These cells are contained in a
 plasma, out of which they draw the material of their own formation and in-
 crease. They dehisce and contribute thus a perfected secretion, adapted to
 perform a part in the chemical and vital processes of digestion. The biliary
 intestine in these worms presents a deeply notched outline, approaching the
 moniliform (fig. 59 e). The segments of that part which immediately succeeds
 to the gizzards are very much elongated, while those nearer the tail present
 annulations corresponding with those of the integument. The biliary layer in
 these worms is not pigmented.bright yellow, but dull yellow, having a greenish
 tint. There is nothing demanding notice in the formation of the rectal
intestine in the Syllidce. The outlet is situated dorsally and above a small
median style. As the blood-proper is destitute of colour, there is little diflS-
 culty in explaining the absence of brilliant pigments from the solid glandular
 structures of the body.

    The genus Sjno or Nerine comprehends two well-known species, N. vul-
garis and N. coniocephala ; to which number the author has lately added
N. Marcella. These Annelids are notorious for the extraordinary accumu-
lation of faecal matter which occurs in the posterior half of the intestinal
canal, causing the whole of this moiety of the body to look closely like an
inanimate string of sand and earthy substance. This character is more
striking in the two last-named species than in the first. Spio vulgaris is an
active ivorm, and the posterior half of the body does not drag like a lifeless
appendage, as it does in *S'. coniocephala and S. Marcella, These worms
are improboscidean. The head terminates in a prolonged tapering snout.
The mouth is situated ventrally and a little behind the extreme end of the
head; the lining membrane of the pharynx is capable of being only very slightly

exserted. It is by the operation of the arms that food is conveyed to the
mouth. The chief part of this food consists of sand, fragments of shells, &c.
In consequence of the conical figure of the snout, these worms penetrate the
gravelly and shelly soil in which they are found with great facility. That
portion of the body which corresponds with the oesophagus, contrasts prettily
by its dull white colour with the rest of the body, which is dark green. The
oral two-thirds of the oesophagus is a smooth tube, unsupplied with glands
(Plate X. fig. 60 a) ; the remaining portion, as far as the intestine, embraced
by a flocculent layer consisting of a vast multitude of follicular glandules (b).
They coincide in structure with those which in the carnivorous Annelids
beset the proboscis. The first fifth of the true intestine is generally empty
and thickly furnished with parietal biliary glands. At this part the colour
is dark green. The perfect yellow does not appear in these worms. Next
to this portion occurs the colonic segment of the canal, which is distin-
guished by its earthy contents, the dark green of the integuments becoming

sensibly diminished, enabling the contents of the canal to contrast strongly

with the anterior portions of the body. The segmentations of the anterior

part of the intestinal canal are deeply marked, the tube being reduced at
ON THE BRITISH AMNELIDA.  339

the constricted intervals to a fine thread, through which, into the contiguous

segment, a minute portion of faecal matter periodically passes. The biliary

glandules on the parietes of the intestine present a definitively linear arrange-
ment ; that is, when traced around the cylinder they form circular rows of

glands.

    In (r/ycera a/ia (Plate XI. fig. 61), the alimentary canal is remarkably
moveable ; it is tied to the integumentary by bridles of muscular fibrillae.

This most attractive and lively little worm inhabits loose moist sand, tlirough
which it progresses by frequent thrusts forwards with its proboscis. The jaws

of this organ are four in number, hook-shaped (fig. 61 a), each presenting a
secondary piece projecting from the back; the base being strong and
broad. The extremity of the proboscis is smooth, while the posterior four-
fifths is thickly villose with papillary glandules (fig. 61 i). The oesophagus
exceeds the proboscis in length, enabling the latter to be packed upon the
former. The intestinal segmentations commence at the oesophagus ; there is
no proper stomach. The functions of the stomach are merged either in
those of the proboscis, or in those of the biliary intestine. In numerous ex-
amples it has already been shown that this conformation is frequent among

the Annelids. From the peculiar character of those ' zones ' of the sea-shore
in which this worm is ordinarily found, it is probable that it subsists on the

organic material contained in the soil, of which it swallows considerable

quantities.

   Nephthys Hombergii is commonly discovered in fine sand, saturated with
sea-water. It swims with facility. Its proboscis presents a formidable ap-
pearance. It is edentulous, the jaws being, however, replaced by fine but
strong fleshy bristly processes. The digestive canal is found in general
heavily laden with the sandy refuse of digestion. Its parietes are pigmented

with a bright yellow colour ; the oesophagus slightly exceeds in length the
extended proboscis ; the intestinal canal is annulated in correspondence with

the integumentary. The constrictions between the segments are only slightly

marked.

   I4 may with great probability be affirmed generally of those worms which
subsist by swallowing the soil in which they live, that the real food is a

mixture of animal and vegetable matter, since the soil of the sea-shore
abounds as much in minute fragments of algaceous vegetation as in living

and dead animal matter. No part of the body of these worms is coloured
by the contents of the intestine. The whole animal presents a general dirty

mother-of-pearl appearance. They attain a considerable size, and exhibit in

--the adult state extraordinary muscular power. The oesophagus in this worm

supports a very long single vessel the cylindrical heart. It is little vascular,
and quite devoid of follicular glandules ; these latter are restricted to the

proboscis. The oesophagus is a strongly muscular tube, in consequence of
the part which it is required to perform in the protrusion and retraction
 of the proboscis. The proboscis, being a large bulky appendage to the oeso-
phagus, gives to the latter, when withdrawn, an apparently greater diameter
 than any part of the intestine. The absence of a vascular web on the parietes
of the oesophagus, excludes it from the physiological actions of digestion ; it
is in this worm, as in many others, a mere mechanical tube. The biliary
 intestine is highly vascular; it is embraced, in conformity with the dorsi-
 branchiate type of the intestinal circulation, by four large longitudinal
 trunks, from which lateral vessels proceed to form a dense reticulation of
 capillaries. It is in the minute spaces between these ultimate vessels that

 the biliary glandules are lodged.

    In the organization of the digestive canal of the AriciadcB, there is little to
236 REPORT--1851.

remark which does not fall under the description already presented. The
intestine is of a bright yellow as far as the tail. The colour of the biliary

yellow pigment of the intestinal parietes blending with the dull white of the
integument, these worms appear as yellowish-white threads, twisting about
with great beauty. They are distinguished, like the Spios, by the fact that
the whole of the posterior three-fourths, or more, of the body hangs on, like
a lifeless coil of sand, to the cephalic and only active and locomotive part
of the body. The former is apparently dragged along by the latter in pro-
gression. Although supplied with feet and branchiae, they seem in this
region to take little part in the movements of the anterior part of the body.
This incapacity for muscular movement seems to depend upon the weight
of the earthy mass contained in the intestine. The blood being brightly red,
the branchiae form a pleasing contrast with the dark colour of the body;
These worms live on sand, and are destitute of proboscis. The head is
prolonged into a finely tapering snout, by means of which its march through
the sand is eflPected with tolerable facility.

   The preceding description will serve to convey a pretty exact idea of the

--character of the alimentary canal in the Opheliadce worms which are not

uncommon on the British coasts. The author recently made several additions
of species to the list of British Ariciadce ; they are distinguished from

the old species by a shorter body, by the presence at various points of fila-
mentary appendages, not unlike those of Cirrhatulus, by a far greater activity
in the posterior parts of the body in progression, and by the absence of the
earthy colour, and undue accumulation in the posterior moiety of the digestive

canal.

    Cirrhatulus Lamarckii, so abundant between tide-marks on the coast of
Swansea, subsists almost entirely by swallowing clay. Its long branchial
appendages are little subservient to, and less used for the prehension of food.
The mouth, a small circular orifice, is ventrally situated, and some little way
posterior to the tapering snout, in which the head terminates: it is well
adapted for sucking in semi-solid food. The pharynx is susceptible of ever-

sion in a slight degree. The native colours of this worm are beautifiully

variegated : the brilliant yellow of the intestine, which begins near the head
and continues to the tail, relieved by the greenish hue of the integuments of
the back, contrasts agreeably with the vermilion thread which spangles
every portion of the worm. The alimentary canal, from one end to the other,
is closely united, at short intervals, by means of minute septal bridles, to the
integuments ; the peritoneal fluid, on that account, is very limited in quantity.
The course of the intestine describes a zigzag from one extreme to the other.
The oesophagus is short, and the proboscis wanting. The biliary glandular
layer of the intestine is thick and flocculent, and densely supplied with blood.

This worm is capable of throwing out from the general cutaneous surface a
considerable amount of viscid adhesive secretion, which enables the worm to
roll itself in an impenetrable coat of mail. The mechanical act of applying
the surrounding substances to the body is accomplished by the thready
appendages. Nothing can be more exquisite than the perfect and yet rapid
manner in which these microscopic strings perform this work of protection.
In its natural state Cirrhatulus does not inhabit channels. It is commonly

found in soft semi-fluid clay, stretched under stones near the ebb-mark of
the tide.

   The family of Aphroditacece are uniformly proboscidean. Many mem-

bers are found in deep water, rendering it dilRcult to assign their exact

habitation. The Polynoe are inhabitants of the shores, and affect pro*
tected situations, such as the inferior surface of slates and stones, over the
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  237

surfaces of which they crawl in search of food. The oesophageal apparatus,
with its appended proboscis, is always powerfully muscular. Some anato-
mists have assigned the name of the " gizzard " to the true oesophagus in
Aphrodita aculeata. Whatever outward resemblance this part may pre-
sent to a gizzard, it possesses none of the structural characters of this latter
organ. Its parietes are powerfully muscular and dense, because they are the
engine by which the proboscis is thrust out and drawn in. The extended
proboscis of ^. aculeata is a savage-looking instrument; in size it is propor-
tionate to that of the animal, and is edentulous. The oral orifice of this
proboscis is encircled by a short and thick-set fringe of compound peni-
cillate filaments, divided into sets by a fissure on each side; each filament
has a short stalk, with a tuft of numerous forked papillae on its summit ; ex-

terior to the orifice of the proboscis there are four fleshy tubercles placed at

the angles. As the external surface of the proboscis and that of the oesopha-
gus are devoid of all glandular structure, the iiiternal lining membrane of both

these portions of the digestive tube is glandularly organized, that is, the

membrane is villose and highly vascular. It is important to remember this
 fact, for it denotes an anatomical feature which belongs to all the Aphrodi-
tacece, embraced in the four leading genera Aphrodita, Polynoe, Pholoe, and
 Sigalion. Plate X. fig. 62 illustrates the outline anatomy of the alimentary
 system of Polynoe squamata. It exhibits a striking approach in plan to
 that of Aphrodita aculeata (c, c, digestive caeca). From its position in
 the alimentary tube, it is manifest that this villose oesophageal membrane
 furnishes a fluid which is concerned in the process of digestion ; it does not
 extend in any species beyond the limits of the oesophagus. The true stomach
 is quite dissimilarly organized. The proper occasion has now arrived for
 explaining the real physiological meaning of the complicated csecal append-
 ages, so familiar to the comparative anatomist, by which the interior capacity

 of the digestive cavity is multiplied in the AphroditacecB.
     These appendages, in their mechanical arrangement, realized two import-

 ant objects :

     1st. They effect the purpose of lodging and detaining a considerable

 quantity of a dark-greenish chymous fluid.
     2nd. They are so disposed with reference to the large exterior current of

 water which rushes under the elytra or scales, as to bring their chymous
  contents as closely as possible into contact with this aerating medium.

     They perform, therefore, two supreme functions, namely, that of respi-
  ration and digestion. Perhaps this latter process, in this particular in-

  stance, should be designated as that of sanguification, since the fluid con-
  tained in these caeca is evidently the blood in its first stage of preparation

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

 it is' the fluid which, when absorbed into the circulating system, becomes
  the true blood. It is to the AphroditacecB what the chylo-aqueous con-

  tents of the peritoneal cavity is to all the other Annelids. This cavity in the

  Aphrodites, like that of the Echinoderms, is occupied by a fluid, which in
  appearance and composition closely approaches sea-water. It can scarcely
  be doubted that this cavity, thus tilled, becomes in these eccentric worms a
  reservoir wherein oxygen accumulates, and that from this store, in part at least,

  the fluid contained in the digestive caeca draws its supply of the aerating
  element. In the AphroditacecB, the blood-proper is colourless, and the blood-
  system of vessels is very inferiorly developed. The median tube of the
  stomach, which is straight and unsegmented, and from either side of which
   the casca proceed, is always found to be filled with a semi-solid faeculent
   matter, which is quite unlike that contained in the caeca. These two por-
   tions of the contents of the digestive system are kept apart by a sphincteric
   structure encircling the openings leading from the straight stomach into the
--238 REPORT 1851.

lateral csecal appendages, an arrangement, by which, in the most perfect

manner, everything but the digested chyme is excluded from the caeca, ex-
emplifying in humble life, the principle on which the " pylorus " acts in the

higiier animals. The above description will serve to convey a precise con-

ception of the conformation of the alimentary system in the other genera of

Aphrodites, namely, in Polynoe (Plate X. fig. 62), Pholoe, and Sigalion, In

these smaller Aphrodites, the true stomach is limited to the posterior -|rds of

the body ; the cesophageal portion, with its embraced proboscis, engaging the
anterior. It is necessary to observe, that, as in Sigalion Boa, the peritoneal

fluid, external to, and enveloping the digestive appendages, assumes a highly

organized and blood-like character, having express branchial organs provided

for its own exposure to the aerating element. This, however, is only a modi-

fication, not a violation, of the principle already enounced. It should be here

stated, that in the AphroditacecB, the true biliary apparatus is distributed in

form of a dark green glandular layer over the parietes of the digestive caeca,

and that it is exclusively limited to these situations.

In the genera Lumbricus and Nais (fig. 63), the digestive canal is a simple

segmented tube, brightly coloured yellow by the glandular biliary layer form-

ing one of its coats.

In relation to the mechanism of alimentation in the suctorial Annelids,

which comprise the subgenera Hcemocharis, Albione, Branchellion, Clepsina,

and Malacobdella, the following principle may be definitively enunciated,

that there exists in all species an inverse proportion, both as regards quantity

and quality, between the fluid contained in the peritoneal cavity and that

of the digestive caeca. It is accordingly found, that when the stomach

is reduced to the simplicity of a straight tube, unsupplied with lateral

caeca, the chamber of the peritoneum is spacious, and replete with a highly

organized fluid ; that, on the contrary, when the stomach is multiplied and

complicated by the addition of lateral appendages, filled with a chymous

fluid, the peritoneal space becomes reduced in capacity, and almost entirely

deprived of contents. The fluid, thus balanced, is not changed physiologically

when transferred from the peritoneal chamber into the interior of the digestive

caeca, or vice versa. Of the genus Hirudo, the following are subgenera, of

--which the digestive system is sacculated : the common Leech, in which

the sacculi are largest ; Hcemocharis, in which the hindmost pair only are

highly developed, the rest in front being small ; and Aulastoma nigrescens,

in which the whole of the anterior portion of the tube is perfectly straight,

having only two long caeca at the posterior extremity, on either side of the

rectum.

    Albione muricata presents a digestive tube perfectly devoid of all lateral

sacculations; this is also the case in the genus Branchellion, and that of Ma-

lacobdella. These Annelids are all suctorial. In some species a sucker

exists at both extremities, in others at the posterior only.

 --NemertinidcB. In the ' K egne Animal ' the genus Nemertes is thus cha-
--racterized : " C'est un ver d'une moUesse et d'un allongement extremes, lisse,

grele, aplati, termine a une extremite par une pointe mousse percee d'un

trou ; evase et largement ouvert a I'extremite opposee par ou il se fixe.

Son intestin traverse toute la longueur du corps. Un autre canal, probable-

ment relatif a la generation, serpente le long de ses parois, et finit a un

MM.tubercule du bord de I'ouverture large.  d'Orbigny et de Blainville,

qui ont vu cet animal vivant, assurent que c'est I'ouverture large qui est la

bouche."

   " La seule espece connue (^Nemertes Borlasii, Cuv.) a plus de quatre pieds

de long. Elle se tient enfoncee dans le sable, et attaque, dit-on, les anomies

qu'elle suce dans leur coquille. Je dois ce ver singulier, dont Borlase (Corn-

wall) seul fait mention a M. Dumeril, qui I'a trouve pres de Brest. M. Oken
en fait son genre Borlasia, M. Sowerby I'avait nomme Lineus."

In the preceding definition Cuvier commits himself to several important

points of structure, the incorrectness of which, it will be subsequently shown,

may now be proved by easy and direct demonstration. It is first stated that

the body in these worms terminates in a blunt point perforated by an anal
orifice. This is an unquestionable error. The posterior extremity of the

body in all the species of this genus is imperforate. It is next affirmed that

the intestine traverses the whole length of the body, and that " another canal,

probably concerned in generation, winds along the sides, and terminates by

a tubercle on the side, by a large orifice." The constituent elements of struc-

ture have thus been accurately recognised by Cuvier, but very erroneously

interpreted. It will be hereafter demonstrated that " the second canal," ter-

minating at the side, is concerned in digestion, not in generation. It is a

compound of oesophagus and proboscis. The figures by M. Quatrefages of

Nemertes Borlasii represent this worm as possessing several longitudinal

fissural oral orifices adapted for sucking. Nor does it appear that this saga-

cious naturalist had become at all acquainted with the existence in this

remarkable Annelid o^ a proboscis. His conception, therefore, of the mecha-

nism by which it obtains food must have been remote from the truth, since

the oral end of the alimentary system is not many-fissured, but composed

only of a single longitudinal slit underneath the conical rostrum : with such

an orifice it is manifest that the process of suction would be impracticable.

In the beautiful illustrations of the anatomy of Nemertes Camilla, published

from the inedited researches of M. Quatrefages in Crochard's edition of the

' Regne Animal,' this author describes the jaws, which are situated at the

extremity of the proboscis when protruded (an extraordinary organ in these

worms), as being contained in a pouch of the digestive cavity, " poches a

stylets en voie de formation." The dissections of this worm by M. Quatre^

fages are, notwithstanding this instance of a misinterpretation of structural

characters, accurately defined, and, as far as they have extended, confirmed

by those of the author. It is, however, not a little surprising, that the

real organic characteristic of these worms should have eluded the eye of an

ingenious observer, who bad attained to a point bordering closely on a true

solution of the problem, viz. the real mechanism of the proboscis and oeso-

phagus. And in relation to the function of that large glandular mass which

constitutes so considerable a proportion of the whole bulk of the worm,

M. Quatrefages shares the erroneous views already propounded by Cuvier, both

describing it as a reproductive (ovarian) organ.

In the year 1844? Prof. CErsted of Copenhagen published an important

contribution to the anatomy and systematic description of the JVemertini*.

The diagnostic descriptions of this observer prove beyond question that he

also missed the right clue to the secret of the true organization of these

worms                                he describes the buccal fissures as designed to admit water into con-
                                  ;

tact with the heart for the purposes of respiration. He describes the anal

orifice as having a terminal situation. He states that the proboscis is " nullum

exsertile," and, like Cuvier and Quatrefages, he falls into the error of charac-

terising the 'glandular organ,' which occupies nearly the whole length of the

body, as the reproductive apparatusf . In fact, the differences between the

results of the inquiries of QErsted and those obtained through the author's

investigation are so striking and irreconcileable, that one or other of them

must be egregiously false. Rathke has published descriptions of what he

announces as new species of NemertinidcE. As our desire is in this place only

to refer to sucli points of structure as relate to the alimentary system, it is

necessary merely to report, with reference to the descriptions of M. Rathke,

that some of the diagnostic characters are thus given. "At the anterior

margin of the body a small opening was found which Rathke did not regard

as a moutli, which lies further down on tlie abdominal side, and is represented
by a large longitudinal cleft. On the right and left of the anterior end of

the body is a boat-shaped, superficial, longitudinal furrow, to which a strong

bundle of nerve passes from the red ganglion of the brain                                                             The

intestine, running out straight at the posterior end of the body, contained a

whitish slimy fluid, from which circumstance thi<: author conjectures that the

worm sucks its nourishment from other white-blooded animals, as a great

number of small, thin, cuticular sacs, which were attached in a single row,

behind each other, on the inner side of tlie body of this worm, contained in

some individuals distinct eggs, and in others sperm-cells. Under the dorsum

runs a very long snow-white and spiral canal, which is very muscular, and

lies bulged out like a proboscis at the opening first mentioned. Rathke con-

fesses that he could not succeed in determining its use."

By Ehrenberg it is held that the part described by the preceding authors

as an alimentary canal is really an egg-passage, while he regards the white

spiral organ as the alimentary canal. Enougli has been cited historically, to

convey to the comparative anatomist some conception of the chaos and dark-

ness which brood over the problem of the organization of this genus of An-

nelids. The observations of Mr. H. Goodsir* on this subject must not be

omitted. By this author a description of two species of Nemertinidce is pub-

lished, one under the name of Serpentaria, the other under that of Nemertes.

With reference to the former species, Mr. Goodsir observes that the anterior

extremity of the body is pointed, with the proboscidean orifice obscure and im-

perfectly developed; the male generative apertures on each side, and the cloaca

on the abdominal surface immediately behind. Mr. Goodsir further states,

that as the animal has no true proboscis, the proboscidean orifice is very

small or imperfectly formed, which renders it difficult to be seen. On each

side of the rostrum there is to be seen a longitudinal narrow slit, generally

closed, and communicating with the male generative system. Immediately

behind these, and on the abdominal surface, is another larger orifice, which

the animal has the power of opening and shutting at pleasure. When open it

is of an ovoid shape. The edges are serrated. This leads to a large longitu-

dinal cavity which runs through the whole length of the body, but lor a

considerable extent anteriorly is continuous and very much dilated ; in the

remainder of its extent it is more confined and interrupted by the ovaries

statement given in  the  text of  the  anatomy of  Nemertinidie                                                       and, moreover, the inaccura-

cies into which Oersted has fallen exemplify the importance of resting all ' diagnoses ' on

carefully instituted dissections. Anatomy alone should be the basis of all correct specific

descriptions.

which lie on each side of it. All that portion of the body in which the

common cavity is continuous and dilated consists of one annulus, but the

succeeding or terminal is composed of a great many, each about the eighth

of an inch in length.
   Each of these separated annuli contains all the elements of the perfect or

original animal, viz. a male and female generative apparatus, the cavity com-

mon to the generative, digestive and respiratory Junctions. Serpentaria
therefore is a composite animal, each perfect individual consisting of numerous

and apparently still unformed or imperfectly formed individuals.

   With respect to Nemertes, Mr. Goodsir makes the following observations.
Anterior extremity of the body rounded, somewhat quadrilobate, M'ith the
proboscidean orifice in the centre. Male generative apertures on each side.
Cloaca or abdominal surface immediately behind. The anterior extremity
is slightly quadrilobate, and in the centre there is a small foramen, through
which a long, narrow, extensile, trumpet-shaped probos(;is can be protruded
at the will of the animal. On each side of these are two narrow longitudinal

slits similar to those in Serpentaria ; these, as already mentioned, are aper-
tures to the male generative apparatus, which consists of two long, narrow

cellular tubes, running down each side of the body. The cloaca on the
abdominal surface of the body is small and rounded, and opens into an oblong
cavity similar to that of Serpentaria. With reference to an alleged orifice
at \}s\^ posterior termination of the body, Mr. Goodsir states that the opening
was so large that it appeared in process of filling up after the last separation,

admitting thus the fact of the existence of a terminal anal orifice. This

excellent observer proceeds to remark, "that the leading features in the

structure of both these species are similar. The large common cavity in

both species is common to the respiratory, digestive and generative systems.
The water in which the animal lives is transmitted through this cavity, and
thus acts as a means of respiration. In Serpentaria it acts I would say al-

most altogether as an organ of digestion, and for this purpose its construction

is slightly different from that of Nemertes, in which animal the structure
approaches more to that of the true Planaria, in so far as it is endowed with
an extensile'trumpet-proboscis, which is continuous with a large puckered-up

tube running along the upper and central part of the common cavity, and

which, contrary to the supposition of Rathke and other naturalists, is, accord-

ing to the opinion already expressed by Ehrenberg, the intestinal canal. It

is tied down at intervals by strong filjrous or muscular bands (mesentery),
which, when unwound, allows the intestine to escape IVom its attachments.
The ovaries which run down on each side of the body have no means of
throwing off the ova except into the common cavity. It appears to me

therefore that Ehrenberg is correct in supposing that cavity to be an egg-

passage, and in Serpentaria this is more fully shown than in Nemertes."

From the preceding quotations it is obvious that Mr. Goodsir's ideas with

reference to the anatomy of the Nemertinidce are by no means clearly defined

he first states that there exists a terminal anal orifice, while at the same time

he describes the presence of a cloaca on the abdominal surface not far from

the head ; he affirms that the water is admitted directly into the great cavity
of the body, contending at the same time that in this cavity the threefold

office of respiration, digestion and generation is discharged. It will be here-

after shown that the views of Mr. Goodsir, in relation to the plan of structure
on which these eccentric Annelids are organized, differ most widely from
those to which the author of this Report has been conducted by his own

investigations, and which are now published for the first time.

--242 REPORT 1851.

In the recently published researches of M. Emile Blanchard * on the ana-

tomy of the Entozoa, physiological opinions are expressed which lend support

to the errors already exposed.

   This naturalist, to whom science is so much indebted, characterized the

voluminous spongy organ which constitutes by far the greatest part of the

bulk of each segment of Tcenia Solium as the true ovary, entering into mi-

nute details to prove the existence in each ring of an oviduct and vulva, and

asuperaddedsperm-producingapparatus, demonstrating thus the independence

of each segmental division, as regards at least the reproductive system. M.

Blanchard recognises in the minute, lateral, smooth-sided and wwsacculated tu-

bular threads, running straightly in parallelism with each border of the body,

what he calls the " gastric canals," communicating with each other by means

Aof commissural transverse branches.  system of true blood-vessels coin-

ciding in distribution with the former is also described by this anatomist.
   Now, if the views of M. Emile Blanchard be true with reference lo the

organization of the cestoid Entozoa, those now to be propounded in rela-

tion to the anatomy of the Nemertinidce must be untrue. Both cannot be

admitted into the category of truth ; they are irreconcileably opposed.

Though at variance with the fashionable doctrines of the schools, it may be

enounced as an absolute law, that in the ceconomy of all inferior organisms

the alimentary exceeds the reproductive system in size and importance. The

gastric and intestinal organs form in all instances a considerable part of the

bulk of the body. The dissections of M. Blanchard have reduced those of

Tcenia to dimensions of utter insignificance. His descriptions are sanctioned

by no analogy. It is not difficult to demonstrate that the zoological affinities

of the cestoid Entozoa suggest conclusions with regard to their organization

which the isolated and undirected results of dissections cannot disprove.

When however the mind of the anatomist is first awakened to a conception

of the typical principle of structure which prevails throughout the JVemerti-

nidce, Planarice, Trematoda, on the ground of their zoological consecutive-

ness in the scale, he will cease to doubt that the same principle of structure,

though opposed to his anatomical observations, obtains amongst the cestoid

Entozoa. It is really, however, in practical anatomy easy to establish a unity

of plan in the organization of this series. The direct continuity of the Ento-

zoan and Annelidan chains is rendered unquestionable by investigations thus
directed. Although the laborious researches of M. Emile Blanchard render

it probable that no oral orifice f exists in Tcenia, the digestive character of

    * Annales des Sciences Naturelles, 1848, 1849.

   f At the present stage of my investigations, I by no means'desire to commit myself to this
doctrine. On the faith of the trustworthiness of M. Blanchard as an observer, I concede for

the present, argumenti gratia, the probable truth of his results. But on this admission it is
not difficult to show that Tcenia is clearly within the boundaries of the plan of structure on
which the Nemertinidae (under which designation I would rank the freshwater Gordiusida,

the Planariada, the genera Borlasia, Lineus and Serpeniaria (Goodsir)) are organized. I

have hitherto enjoyed only an imperfect opportunity of dissecting tlie Tape-worm, my ob-

servations having been confined to a few segments from the mid-body ; but I have seen

enough of its structure to convince me that it falls witliin the type prevalent throughout the

Liniadds, Borlasia and Planaria ; that the great central organ, which hitherto all anatomists,
including M. Blanchard, have concurred in regarding as llie ovarian apparatus, is in truth a
great digestive cecum. If it be true, as affirmed by Prof. Owen, and after liim by M. Blan-
chard, that neither an orsd nor an anal orifice exists in Tienia, then the ahmentary fluid upon
which the parasite subsists must be drawn by suction through the suctorial discs, directly

into the interior of the digestive caecum ; aud as these suctorial discs are not perforated, but
covered by a porous membrane, the food is fllered a.s it is being drawn into the body. This
arrangement, however, by no means requires that any other than a digestive function should
be assigned to the spongy organ commonly known as the ovarium ; for in Borlasia, Lineus

the 90-calIed ovarium is rendered not the less probable. It will afterwards
become apparent that two distinct lines of inquiry converge upon the infer-
ence that this " ovarium " of authors is a true digestive caecum on a large
scale; that it is filled by a chylous fluid, charged with organized corpuscles
that its parietes are organized with especial view to supply a secretion by
which the fluid contents are assimilated ; and that the whole force of analogical
inquiry supports the view which assigns to other structures exterior to, and
independent of this organ, the functions of reproduction. It is proposed at
this place to enter into the details of the demonstrations which the author
has to ofler with reference to the anatomy of the genera Borlasia, Linens
and Gordius. The grounds will then become intelligible on which he enter-

tains the belief that the principles of structures developed by these researches,
when extended to the instances of the cestoid Entozoa, will prove no less

exact.

   The whole exterior of the body in these worms is one continued scene of
ciliary vibration. This extraordinary fact it is essential to remember, since
it will be found to bear corroboratively on the views afterwards to be ex-
plained, as to the uses of structures hitherto held as enigmatical*. At a
point a little posterior to the extreme end of the rostrum, and corresponding

with what CErsted has designated Jissurce respiratorice laterales, the cilia
assume an augmented size, appearing in this situation as though supplied to
guard fissural openings leading into cavities. These apparent openings are

really only depressions, spaces left between the cervical muscles, in order to
make room for the heart, which is situated on each side immediately under-
neath, to expand. The red colour of these two spots on either cheek is due
to the blood in the heart, which (Plate XI. fig. 64a, a) is a bilocular organ.
The blood colour of these spots has led nearly all observers to the mistake

of supposing that the office of respiration is circumscribed to these limited fis-

sures. The microscope, which resolves the part into its component elements,

furnishes a direct disproof to this view. In structures devoted to respiration,

the blood is uniformly divided and subdivided into the minutest streams.
In this part this fundamental law is violated, for here the blood is accumu-

lated into one large cardiac chamber. In these Annelids the proboscidean
orifice is not terminally but ventrally situated. It is slightly behind and on
the abdominal surface of the conical snout which forms the cephalic termi-

nation of the body. In itself this opening is a simple longitudinal slit, adapted
for no me*chanical purpose. Its sides are smooth, and armed with no mecha-

nical instruments. It is merely an opening through which, in Borlasia,
Lineus and Gordius, a powerful and an extremely long proboscis is pro-
truded (fig. 64 B). The extremity of this organ is armed with several sty-
leted jaws (fig. 64 c), which, from their construction, seem designed only to

fix the suctorial end, h^ perforating the alimentary object. When the pro-

boscis is withdrawn into the interior of the body, fitting admirably into a

and Gordius, the anatomy of which my dissections, I trust, have reduced to clear demonstra.

tion, the ' alimentary organ,' the great digestive caecum, which both in general and ultimate

structure is the exact counterpart of what is called in TeBnia " the ovary," has been proved

beyond dispute to have no direct external communication. Its contents, therefore, which

the microscope demonstrates to consist of an organized corpusculated fluid, of a milky

character (the correlate of that which in other Entozoaand Annelida occupies the jBenYowea/

chamber, i.e. exterior  to  the  aUmentary organ), cannot  be  excrementitious                                                                   it  is chylous.
                                                                                                                                              ;

It is the pabulum which in part supplies the materials out of which the blood-proper is formed,

and by which, in part probably, the work of solid organization is accomplished.
   * I have not yet succeeded in actually proving the existence of cilia on the integuments

of Gordius ; from the resemblance of its internal structiu-e, however, to that of the Liniadm,

of which the cutaneous surface is richly ciliated, it is scarcely rash to believe that in it also

these motive organules will be found to exist.

short oesophagus, these sharp instruments are packed and folded upon them-

selves. M. Quatrefages, ignorant of the protrusibility of these parts, wrongly-

conceived that this was the permanent and immoveable position of these parts,
and described the chambers in which the jaws were lodged as "poches a
stylets." The appearance of cavities or pouches is, however, altogether delu-
sive, and depends upon the closing round the jaws of the sides of the pro-
boscis. This organ in Lineus longissunus (Sowerby) is positively several
feet in length, and constitutes a formidable instrument of offence*.

    It is remarkable that the very existence of this proboscis has escaped the

observation of ihe many excellent observers by whom from time to time and

under different names it has been accurately described. This organ is pro-
vided with a thick stratum of papillose glands (PI. XI. fig. 64 d), by which
doubtless a secretion is furnished important to the digestive process. This
glandular salivary product is poured into the channel of the proboscis : thence
it finds its way, mingling with the fluid food, into the oesophagus (e), wherein
it sojourns for a short period, and thence tra7isudes, by exosmose, through the
purietes and reaches the cavity of the great alimentary organ (/), where it
assumes by slow assimilation a higher organic standard, becoming probably
fitted to nourish the solids of the body, and to replenish the contents of the
true blood-vessels. It will be seen that there is no direct open communication
between the oesophageal tube (e) and the great alimentary caecum (/,/}, nor
between the cavity of the latter and the exterior. The contents of this great
cavity must, therefore, in great part at least, be recrementitious, not excre-

mentitious.

    The oesophageal intestine terminates (fig. 64 g^ in a distinct papillose outlet,
which is situated at a short distance posterior to the cephalic end ; when the
proboscis is withdrawn into the interior of the body, the oesophagus lies in
the cavity of the great alimentary ceecum, being traceable back to some di-
stance in the direction of the tail. While in this position, this tube may be
readily, as it always has been, mistaken for a true intestine ; followed more
minutely, however, it may readily be observed to return upon itself and ter-
minate in the lateral outlet already indicated. In the mere mechanical dis-
position of these parts an intimate analogy may be remarked between the
Nemertinidce and the Sipunculidce, in which the alimentary canal coils upon
itself and ends in an outlet situated ventrally, about the anterior third of the
body. In this case, however, there is no other alimentary organ, in which
respect the Sipunculidce differ most fundamentally from the Nemertinidce.

    The great spongy mass which in the geneca Borlasia, Lineus and Gor-
dius, constitutes so considerable a portion of the whole bulk of the body, com-
mences anteriorly, immediately behind the hearts (fig. 64 a, a), under the cha-
racter of a ccecal end (h). Although the oesophagus enters {appears to per-

forate) into the contained cavity of this organ at this situation, yet the interior
of the latter is not laid open, for its parietes are reflected over and embrace
those of the oesophagus. Nor is it possible to discover at any part of the
course of this tube any direct opening of any sort leading from it into the
cavity of the digestive ccecum. It is, notwithstanding, from the relative con-
nexion of these parts, impossible to doubt that the food passes from the
oesophagus, after a short detention therein, for the purpose of insalivation,
into the interior of the digestive caecum. In the absence of all proofs of a
direct opening between these two cavities, the passage of the food can only
be accomplished by transudation through the parietes of the oesophagus.

   * Several specimens of this extraordinary worm have recently been found on the shores
of the Bristol Channel, one by Mr. Lewis Dillwyn, one by Mr. Moggridge, and several by

myself.

Having arrived in the chamber of this great caecum, it will of course follow

on the same ground, that the refuse matter can only escape by the same me-

chanism, for no direct outlet to this cavity can anywhere be discovered. It

is therefore a perfectly closed sac, filled with a milky fluid. But it must not

be overlooked that its interior cavity is considerably multiplied by the super-
addition o^ diverticula (fig. 64 e, i) to the sides. The parietes of these last parts

are more glandular, granular and darker than those of the ventral or dorsal

aspect of the tube. This granular character has been invariably misconstrued

by every observer into an evidence of the ovarian signification of these parts.

The microscope places the inaccuracy of this view beyond dispute by demon-

strating that these ova (otc) consist only of oil-globules.

This organ is tied at definite intervals, by means of minute bridles, to the

integument, according to the manner in which, in nearly all Annelida, the in-

^ttestine is connected with the cylinder of the integument,  its posterior,

caudal termination it has been proved, by repeated observations, that there

exists no orifice; of this fact there is no doubt. It is then proved by direct

demonstration that there is neither an inlet nor an outlet to this remarkable

organ, and it is hoped that evidence has been accumulated to superfluity, to

establish its digestive character. But through another line of inquiry these

proofs receive additional force. At short distances, along the whole line of
the body of these worms on either side, membranous sacculi may be defined

with readiness in the interval between the alimentary tube and that of the

integument. It is on these organs undoubtedly that the office of reproduction

devolves. If this be not their true function, no other can be assigned to them;

and if this be their real meaning, it follows that no other than that of digestion

remains for that organ, which the author has ventured to designate as the

great alimentary cmcum*.

The key to the real organization of this unfamiliar group of Annelids

having thus been forged by the demonstration of the structure of a few

typical and illustrative species, material assistance is aff'orded for unlocking

the difficult anatomy of all the allied genera. Taking for groundwork the
plan on which the Planarice are formed, the anatomist may trace the indica-

tions of the same constructional pi'inciple from the genus Litieus, through

that oiBorlasia, Gordius, Meckelia, Serpentaria and Prostoma, genera which

are characterized by the possession of a long proboscis and short oesophagus,

forming a system almost distinct from the great digestive ccecum. In passing

to the Planarice, these two prehensile structures disappear, and the mouth

opens directly, without any intermediate tubular arrangement, into the di-

gestive cavity. The caecal ramifications of the digestive system of the Pla-

narice are the precise equivalents of the great digestive ccecum with its se-

condary diverticula, as observed in the Nemertinida:.

The anatomy of the Planarice conveys an exact expression, in all its de-

tails, of that of the parenchymatous Entozoa. The digestive apparatus of the

genera Fasciola and Distoma is conformable to the same type. Like the

   * As it would be out of order to enter in this place into a detailed description of the re-
productive organs of these wpnns, no further proof can be adduced, bearing upon the ques-
tion of the digestive character of the organ which in the text I have denominated " the great

digestive caecum." In the second part of this Report, vphich I trust will appear in the next
year's Volume of the Transactions, some further observations on the reproductive organs will
be added in connexion with the subject of the Embryology of the Annelida. At present I
only desire to indicate the example of the Planarian family, as sufficient to prove that in
them at least, the digestive cseca, so exactly homologous with the alimentary caecum of the
Nemertinidrs, have been shovra incontestably to be wholly unconnected with, and indepen-
dent of, the reproductive system, the anatomy of which, in aU its minutest details, may be
defined vrith perfect clearness.

Nemertinida, the Planarice are provided with ciliated integuments. This

general distribution of vibratile cilia over the cutaneous surface, suggests the

inference that the milky contents of the digestive tubules, in common with
the blood-proper, undergoes a respiratory change. And lastly, a further

departure from the type of the Nemertinidce occurs in the Cestoid Entozoa,
for in Tania and Sothriocephalus, not only the proboscis and oesophagus
disappear, but the mouth also. The digestive system remains, notwithstand-

ing, essentially the same. By these observations, the author hopes that an
addition of some interest and importance is made to our knowledge of the
organization of some of the most curious forms of inferior life. The plan
of study which they are well calculated to suggest, may lead, in the hands of
others, to much further and more extensive results. They will suffice, he

trusts, to divert the attention of physiologists from the blood-proper as the

exclusive fluid element of nutrition, to the study of the characters of the
great chyl-aque^s system of fluid, of the existence and importance of which,
in nearly all invertebrate animals, ample evidence has been adduced in the

progress of this Report. They establish the principle formerly enounced,

that each constituent element of the living organism, whetlievfluid or solid,

in its generic and specific phases is governed by one undeviating law. The
fluids obey their law and the solids theirs. Thus the successive members of
 the zoological series are united at several points, all component systems of

 the organism displaying a consecutiveness of development, a unity of plan,

 such that the presence of each in its allotted position is essential to the re-

 sultant, symmetrical unity of the whole.

                           Reproductive System.

   No subject within the domain of comparative anatomy has experienced so
much neglect as that which relates to the structure of the organs of repro-

duction in the Annelida. The whole process of multiplication in these worms,

as explained by M. Duges and Sir E. Home, seems little else than a myth or

Aa fable.  romance or a fairy tale, woven in the picturesque language of a

modern fiction-writer, could not prove to the imagination of the practical ob-

server more full of mystery and marvel. Since the epoch of these two ana-

tomists, no attempt whatever has at any time been made to determine the true

characters of the reproductive organs of the Annelid. Milne-Edwards, to

whom science owes no ordinary gratitude, has indeed resolved the enigma

of the development of one solitary worm, viz. Terehella nehrdosa. It is to

be wondered at, however, that, while noting the embryological history of this

worm, he did not turn to the parent animal and describe the organization of

the parts engaged in the production of the new being. It were to serve no

purpose of historical interest to reproduce in this place the descriptions of

the earlier anatomists. They contain little of what is true and much of what

is false. This statement is not made in the spirit of reproach. Duges' instru-
ments of observation, used too on a little restless worm almost itself micro-

scopic, could not carry the eye to those details of structure through which alone

the real connection and dependence of organs was to be tracked. The ob-

servations of Sir E. Home, far less faithful and exact, are still less entitled to

repetition in this place.

The Annelida are commonly reputed to multiply the species, not alone by

the production of young, but also hj fission and gemmation. With cha--

racteristic gravity, for example, the learned Hunterian Professor* relates,
that " the power of repairing injuries and reproducing mutilated parts is

ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.                   ^Ajf

considerable in the Annelida, and especially in the species of Lumbricus and

Nais, in which it has been variously and extensively tested by the experi-

Aments of Bonnet and Spallanzani.  worm cut in two was found to repro-

duce the tail at the cut end of the cephalic half and form a new head upon

the caudal moiety. Bonnet* progressively increased the number of sections

in healthy individuals of a small worm (Lumbricus variegatus), and when one

of these had been divided into twenty-six parts, almost all of them reproduced

the head and tailU, and became so many new and perfect individuals. It

sometimes happened that both ends of a segment reproduced a tail. Wish-

ing to ascertain if the vegetative power was inexhaustible, Bonnet cut off the

head of one of these worms, and as soon as the new head was completed, he

repeated the act; after the eighth decapitation, the unhappy subject was re-

leased by death ; the execution tools effect, the reproductive virtue had been

worn out : this series of experiments occupied two summer months. Since

many of the smaller kinds of worms and Naids frequently or habitually ex-

pose a part of their body, the rest being buried in the earth, both they and
their enemies profit by the power of restoration of the parts which may be

bitten off I With this power of reproduction of lost extremities is associated

that of spontaneous fission in the genus Nais. In these little red-blooded

worms, the last joint of the body gradually extends and increases to the rest

of the animal ; its anterior part begins to thicken and to be marked off by a

deeper constriction from the penultimate link. In the JVais proboscidea a

proboscis shoots out from it like that on the head, and it is then detached

from the old JVais. It often shoots out, previously to its separation, another

young one from its own lost joint in a similar way, and three generations of

Naids may thus be organically connected, and forming one compound indi-

vidual."

   On the authority of hundreds of observations laboriously repeated at every

season of the year, the author of this Report can declare with deliberate firm-
ness, that there is not one word of truth in the above statement. It is because
accounts so fabulous have been rendered " respectable" by the fact, that Pro-

fessor Owen has thrown over them the aegis of his great authority, that they
demand a contradiction which may'displease by the strength of the language

in which it is given.
   The following is another illustration of the extraordinary degree to which

--the groundless fancies of the older observers have taken captive the imagina-

tion of the moderns : " In the class Annelida we still find that gemmation

performs a very important part in the act of reproduction ; the multiplica-

tion of similar segments, which is so remarkable in many members of this
group, being almost entirely due to it; and a spontaneous division some-
times taking place by which the parts thus produced are detached from one
another, sometimes in such a condition that they must be regarded as per-
fect individuals, whilst in other cases they seem little more elevated in the

Ascale of animality than are detached ovigerous segments of the Taenia.

complete reproduction by gemmation succeeding by spontaneous fission, may
be seen to take place in Nais, a worm which, though aquatic in its habits,
belongs to the order Terricolce. After the number of segments in the body

has been greatly multiplied by gemmation, a separation of those of the pos-
terior begins to take place ; a constriction forms itself about the beginning

of the posterior third of the body, in front of which the alimentary canal

undergoes a dilatation, whilst on the segment behind it, a proboscis and
eyes are developed, so as to form the head of the young animal which is to

be budded off; and in due time, by the narrowing of the constriction, a com-

* (Euvrep, vol.i. pp. 117-245. 4to, 1779.
248 REPORT-- 1851.

plete separation is effected and the j'oung animal thenceforth leads an inde-

pendent life. Not unfrequently, however, before its detachment, a new set

of segments is developed in front of it, which in like manner is provided with

a head and separated from the main body by a partial constriction ; and the
same process may be repeated a second and even a third time ; so that we may
have in this animal the extraordinary phsenomenon of four worms which are

afterwards to exist as separate individuals, united end to end, receiving

nourishment by one mouth and possessing one anal orifice. A similar phse-

nomenon has been observed in several genera of the dorsibranchiate order

but the gemniEe thus detached are not complete individuals, for each con-

sists of little else than a generative apparatus, with the addition of locomo-

tive organs ; thus bearing a similar rehition to the parent stock, which does

not form generative organs of its own, to that which is borne by the Medusae-

buds to the Polype-stock.

"In the one case, as in the other, it must be improper to reckon the gene-

rative segments of a new generation, since they are merely the ' complements'

of the organism that would be incomplete without them.
   " As many as six of these generative offsets have been seen in continuity

with each other, and with the parent stock, by Prof. Milne-Edwards, the

most posterior being evidently the oldest, and one in direct connection with

the parent, consisting an yet but of a few segments and being obviously the

Ayoungest.  similar detachment of a generative segment has been observed

among the Tubicolce. There are several Annelids which may be multiplied

by artificial sub-division, each part being able to grow up into the likeness

of the perfect animal, though they do not spontaneously reproduce them-

selves in this mode*."

The whole of this subject is not easy of proof; experiments conclusively

ai)d unexceptionably conducted must extend over a considerable time, and

should be followed out under the most favourable circumstances of leisure

and opportunity ; a very large portion of the subject may, however, even with

our present acquaintance with the habits of the Annelida, be very confidently

--disposed of. 1st, as to the spontanemis division of the body. It is true that

towards the latter end of every summer two species of worms are multiplied

by a cutting across of the body at one or more points. If the fission occurs
at more than one point, the animal becomes of course divided into more than

two pieces. This circumstance seldom occurs. The fission in Arenicola

generally occurs somewhere within the middle third of the body, securing a

few branchial tufts for each fragment. The tail however is sometimes de-

tached, and sometimes the division happens very near the head. This pro-
cess, both in Nois and Arenicola, happens during July and August. The

cephalic and caudal pieces in Arenicola continue for some time to writhe in
the S'and, somewhat further down in the soil from the surface than the per-
fect individuals. Towards September, the fragments, both that attached to

the head and that belonging to the tail, dissolve away ring by ring, and

finally disappear by decomposition. If the fragment examined be that of

the tail, it will be observed, at the point of separation, to exhibit an eversion

of the edges, placing the alimentary canal exteriorly ; and a very evident in-

crease of size in the vessels also occurs, accompanied by a tumified state of

all the structures of the part. From this latter fact it is easy to be misled

into the idea that the vessels can become enlarged for no other purpose than

that of repairing the injury done by the fission, or perchance of reproducing

the part detached by that process. Such would naturally be the meaning

which a physiologist would attach to the swollen appearance of the blood-

vessels. But such is not the conclusion to which the careful practical observer

is conducted by the study of the actual phsenomena of the process. It is of

course indisputable that nature accomplishes some adequate object by the

fission of the body of the worm ; but that object, whatever else it be, is un-

questionably not that of multiplying the species. The tail-fragment never,

as can be proved by easy observation, produces a single new ring or segment

of the body. If this be true, how completely improbable must be the state-

ment that the headless piece is capable of reconstructing a new headl In

Arenicola and Nais the author can confidently declare that such reproduc-

tive properties as those implied in the reformation, and that too by a remnant

of an integral part of the body, do not exist. It is equally inaccurate to

maintain that a new tail is formed by the cephalic fragment. This half of

the divided worm, like the former, gradually presents evidences of decay ; it
becomes less and less irritable, the muscles and integuments begin to decom-

pose, the blood-vessels of the branchiae become blacii, and the whole disap-

pears by the dissolution of the structures.

If, as is commonly affirmed by zootomists, each individual ring of the body

constituted a real organic submultiple of the entire animal, the possibility of

its iadependent existence could be readily conceived. This however is not

the case. In Arenicola, Nais and Terebella, and many other species, the

reproductive organs are limited to the anterior two-thirds of the body. They

do not exist in the caudal segment. When this latter part therefore is de-

tached from the cephalic extremity, it is evident that it cannot be regarded

as a totuyn irdegrum, a perfect animal in miniature. It wants the most im-

--portant and essential components of a perfect organism the generative ap-

paratus, without which the mind cannot realise the conception of distinct

individuality. In Nais Jiliformis the division most frequently happens at a

short distance from the head, through the very middle of the glandular mass

of the reproductive organs, tubes being cut across, and the testicular glands

being bisected. These extraordinary facts, correctly interpreted, prove clearly

that there can be no method in this spontaneous fission of the body, no one

situation selected in preference to another, no including of one system of

organs and an excluding of another, no definite intelligible ruling principle.

What then can be the meaning of such an extraordinary freak of nature?

Is it an accident which befalls only a few luckless individuals ? The sand of
the sea-shore and the mud of the freshwater pools are thickly strewn with

the mutilated bodies of these worms, the former situation of the Lug, and

the latter of the Naiades. It is a catastrophe, in which every autumn in-
volves the whole community.

   The following interpretation of the above facts, the truth of which cannot
be disputed, may be presented as best accordant with what is at present
known with reference to the history of the reproductive process in these
worms :

1st.  These  Annelids  are  annuals                                     the  term  of  existence  is  completed  when
                                                                     ;

the organic cycle is once accomplished. They are born during the latter

months of one summer, and survive the winter, attain to the maturity of

growth, reproduce the species, and die by the spontaneous subdivision of the

body into fragments on the arrival of the same season of the succeeding year.

This brief round comprehends the history of each individual. Since these

worms are monoecious, each shai-es the common fate. Each contributes by

its own death to the multiplication of the species ; the species being multi-

plied, the ends of its own existence are accomplished.

2nd. For some time before the fission of the body occurs, the process of

the maturation of the ova is proceeding. Arrived at the matured phase, they
250 REPORT--1851.

 escape from the ovarian system into the free space of the peritoneal cavity,
wherein they sojourn until the next phase of their growth has been attained.
It is during the period marked by the presence of true ova in the chamber
 of the peritoneum, floating in the contained fluid, that the division of the
body of the parent animal takes place. In each fragment is nestled, incu-
bated, a considerable number of ova. Filled still by the fluid of the perito-
neal cavity, each fragment becomes subservient to the end of hatching the
young. It resists decomposition only for the period required for the ac-

complishment of this purpose. When the ova are committed to the sand,
the fragment rapidly disappears by putrefaction. The fission of the body,

thus interpreted, becomes the last act of the parental worm, since the portions
into which the body is subdivided by fission, never take food. The proboscis
of the cephalic fragment is never more protruded to take in sand. With the
fission the necessity for food terminates. If, on the contrary, the division of
the body were the first step of a real reproductive operation, characterized
by the superaddition of new segments to the body, the reconstruction of lost
heads, and the manufacture anew of departed tails, a resort to physiological
arguments were little required to prove that each fragment should grow vo-
racious, and consume extra supplies of nourishment, in order to provide the
necessary pabulum for the reparation of the mutilated parts. As this is not the
fact, the inference is clear that the division of the body is not the prelude to
a series of reconstructive operations by which parts are made " wholes," or
mutilations repaired. The experiment of artificially bisecting the body of a
Nereid or an Earth-worm, replacing the divided halves with care again in

their native habitats, invariably, in the author's hands, has led to the follow-

ing results.

    The cephalic half, by this division of the body, does not lose the power of
locomotion. In a few days after the operation it begins to grow less active
and vigorous in its movements ; the annulus at the point of division begins

--to contract and wither ; in process of a few more hours it dies it mortifies

away. This process of dissolution creeps in the direction of tlie head from
one segmental ring of the body to the other, until finally the cephalic remnant
ceases to manifest any signs of life.

    The tail-half immediately loses the power of advancing; it writhes on one
spot, and that only on contact of some external body ; its motions become
excited, not voluntary ; it never reacquires the power of swallowing earth.
The process of decay begins much sooner than in the cephalic half, and
extends in the direction of the tail, implicating one ring after another more
rapidly, until the whole is involved in decay*.

    If the Annelid were really endowed with the reproductive properties, which
by the most recent and distinguished naturalists they are reputed to possess,
such marvellous powers would undeniably have been called into activity by

the artificial division of the body.

   From the analogy of the two species, viz. Arenicola and Nais, on which
the author's observations have been chiefly conducted, the conclusion may
be deduced that the "fission of the body" in every other species of Annelida
in which it occurs, has for object in like manner to protect and incubate the

   * I have a distinct remembrance that many years ago, whilst studying physiology under
the zealous teachership of Mr. Grainger, experiments were related by that distinguished
physiologist, and oonducted by himself, with a view to resolve the enigma of the " myste-
rious tales" popularly prevalent with reference to the reproductive powers of the worms,
from which he drew conclusions precisely the same as those expressed iu the text. I can
now add ray testimony to the correctness of the observations, instituted for a diflferent pur-
pose, and so long ago, by one who has contributed not a little to the advance of physiological

science.

ova. In this indirect sense, and that alone, can the "spontaneous division"
of the body in the Annelid be regarded as participating in the reproductive

operations.

   All that is known of the embryology of the Annelida has been within re-
cent years only contributed by Milne-Edwards. The illustrations given by
hira delineate the successive stages presented by the young of Terebella
nebulosa in the process of growth. As the author of this Report has yet
enjoyed few opportunities of studying the development of the young, he pro-
poses for the present to omit entirely that department of his subject, hoping
that on some future occasion he shall be able to complete the history of the
British Annelids by the addition, to the embryology of the worms, of the
results of his own personal inquiries. Nothing would be here gained by
the further repetition of the oft-repeated descriptions of Duges with reference
to the structure of the generative organs of the Leech and the Naid. It is
remarkable to relate, that no anatomist, from the epochs of Duges and Sir

Everard Home to the present time, has perceived that these descriptions

comprise only one-half of the sexual organs of these worms. It is extraor-
dinaiy that none could discover the physiological necessity, even in herma-
phrodite organisms, for a feminine system, for some ovarian apparatus. These
descriptions relate only, and that not by any means accurately, to the mascu-

 line elements.

    It will be afterwards proved that every anatomist who has ever investigated

 the organization of the Annelida, has mistaken the true utricular ovaria for

 the respiratory sacculi. If the ultimate structure of these so-called sacculi

had at any time been made the subject of minute examination, their real
 nature as the female generative system could not have eluded the eye.
M. Quatrefages, whose figures have been copied into the last and best edition
 (Crochard's) of the ' Regne Animal,' described these ovarian sacculi as " les
 poches secretrices venant s'ouvrir sur le dos par les canaux renflis." The
 same author figures in the same great work the corresponding organs of the
 Leech, and speaks of them as "les poches secretrices laterales avec leur
 caecum." Both the figures and the description prove that M. Quatrefages

 could not have attained to the remotest conception of the true significance

 of these organs. Nor do the figures given in the 'Regne Animal,' costly
 and beautiful as they are as works of art, convey any but the most egre-
 giously erroneous view of the structure and anatomical relations of these

 organs. All observers are liable to error, but the errors of distinguished
 men, at once ornaments and authorities in the walks to which their genius

 may have been dedicated, are mischievous in proportion to the height from

 which they descend, and should be combated at once with unmeasured
 strength of language. Numerous examples might be quoted from every
 branch of science, of the pernicious influence which an undue reverence for

 authority has exercised on the progress of knowledge. In no department of
 observational science has hereditary error grown so venerable by repetition

 as in that which embraces the Annelidan division of comparative anatomy.
     The title of the author of this Report to the merit of having added some-

 thing new to the traditionary lore transmitted through a long succession of

 systematic writers, can only be determined by a comparison of his descrip-
  tions and figures with those given in the works of the best and most recent

  writers. In the succeeding account he is desirous to describe minutely and
  at length the results of his own investigations. This will prove more accept-

  able to science than the repetition of that which has already been so often
  repeated. The dissection of the reproductive organs in these animals is
 attended by^ many practical difficulties ; it has therefore proved impossible

to describe in minute detail the specific varieties under which these organs
occur in the class. Leading generic types will however be described, which
will serve to convey to the mind a clear conception of the structural laws
according to which this system of organs is constructed.

    Those of the Leech, Lumbricus, Nats, Arenicola, Terebella and Albione,
will conduct the physiologist far towards a full and complete conception of
the ultimate anatomy and relations of the reproductive organs in all other
Annelida. Each description will be preceded by a summary of what has
been up to the present date taught by the best systematic authors with re-
ference to these organs. The succeeding account is transferred from the
work of Mr. Rymer Jones, the best digest of comparative anatomy at pre-
sent known. "In the Leech, the glands which furnish the masculine fluid
are about eighteen in number, arranged in pairs upon the floor of the visceral

cavity. Along the external edge of each series there runs a common canal,
or vas deferens, which receives the secretion furnished by all the testicular
masses, placed upon the same side of the median line, and conveys it to a
receptacle whence it accumulates. The two reservoirs, or vesiculce seminales,
if we may so call them, communicate with a muscular bulb situated at the

root of the male organ. This organ is frequently found protruded from the
body after death; it is a slender tubular filament which communicates by its
origin with a contractile bulb, and when retracted, is lodged in a muscular
sheath. The male apparatus is thus complete. The fecundating secretion
derived from the double row of testes is collected by the two t^asa deferentia
and lodged in two globular receptacles situated on either side of the bulb
it is thence conveyed into the muscular cavity which is placed at the root of
the male organ of excitement, through which it is ultimately ejected.*"

   The foregoing description, quoted from the work of Mr. Rymer Jones, is
founded upon the original dissections of M. Duges; it relates exclusively to

the male apparatus, and to its general accuracy the author can testify from
the results of his own dissections. The passage which now follows purports
to be descriptive of the correlative feminine system of the Leech, and is
taken from the same excellent work. To it special attention is invited. " The
ovigerous or female organs of the Leech are more simple in their structure
than those which constitute the male system ; they open externally by a small
orifice situated immediately behind the aperture ; the penis is protruded, the
two openings being separated by the intervention of about five of the ventral
rings of the body. The vulva or external canal, leads into a pear-shaped
membranous bag, which is usually, but improperly, named the uterus. Ap-
pended to the bottom of this organ is a convoluted canal which communicates
with two round whitish bodies ; these are ovaria. The germs, therefore,
which are formed in the ovarian corpuscles, escape through the tortuous
duct into the uterus, where they are detained for some time prior to their
ultimate expulsion from the body. The exact nature of the uterine sacculus,
as it is called, is imperfectly understood ; some regard it as a mere receptacle
wherein the seminal fluid of the male is received and retained until the ova
come in contact with it as they pass out of the body, and thus subjected to
its vivifying influence ; other physiologists believe that the germs escape
from the ovaria in a very immature condition, and suppose that during their
sojourn in this cavity they attain to more complete development before they
are ripe for exclusion; while some writers go so far as to assert that leeches
are strictly viviparous, inasmuch as living young have been detected in the in-
terior of this viscus ; but all these suppositions are easily reconcileable with
each other : there is no doubt the seminal liquor is deposited in this reservoir

during the congress of two individuals ; neither would any one dispute that
the ova are collected in the same cavity before they are expelled from the
body ; as to the discussion whether the young are born alive or not, or, as it
is generally expressed, whether leeches are oviparous or viviparous, it is in
this case merely a question of words, for in a physiological point of view
it can make not the slightest difference whether the ova are expelled as such,
or whether, owing to tijeir being retained by accidental circumstances until
they are hatched internally, the young leeches make their appearance in a

living state*."

   What is described in the preceding passage is rightly described. There is

--in nature what it purports to define a median pear-shaped sacculus, from

the fundus of which a small coiled caecal process depends. But is it possi-

ble, on any physiological principle, that this simple sacculus can be the femi-

nine correlate of that complex, elaborate and highly-developed testicular

apparatus previously described in the same animal ? Is it not a priori impro-

bable that one moiety of the reproductive system should coincide to the An-

nelidan type, namely, that of exhibiting a tendency to segmental repetition in

--a longitudinal series, while the other, and unquestionably the more important

half, should be concentrated into the narrow limits of a solitary sacculus ap-
pended only to one ring of the body ? The median sacculus originally disco-

vered by M. Duges does exist, but is constituted, as will afterwards be shown,

the least important constituent of the generative system. Desirous to assign to

M. Duges the credit to which he is really entitled, it is now proposed to quote

the description given by this anatomist of those organs in the Leech which

he was the first to discover, and which he, and, after him, all subsequent com-

parative anatomists have designated ''the respiratory sacculi." It will be

seen that his descriptive statement, with reference to these "respiratory sac-

culi," agrees in its leading points with the anatomical account which the

author will afterwards have to present of the true and indisputable feminine

element of the reproductive system of the Leech.
    " It has already been mentioned, that in the Abranchiate Annelidans, the

organs provided for respiration are a series of membranous pouches, commu-
nicating externally by narrow ducts or spiracles, as they might be termed, into
which aerated water is freely admitted. These respiratory sacculi in the Leech

are about thirty-four in number, seventeen being visible on each side of the

body ; they are extremely vascular; and in connection with every one of them

there is a long glandular-looking appendage, which was looked upon until

lately as being intended to furnish some important secretion, but which re-

cent discoveries have shown to be connected with the propulsion of the blood

over the walls of the breathing vesicle." " On examining minutely one of

the respiratory pouches, its membranous walls will be seen to be covered with

very fine vascular ramifications, derived from two sources : the latero-abdo-

minal vessel gives off a branch, which is distributed upon the respiratory

sacculus; and there is another very flexuous vsscular loop, derived from the

lateral vessel itself, which terminates by ramifying upon the vesicle in a

similar manner. The walls of the loop are extremely thick and highly irri-

table                      but on tearing across,  the internal cavity or  canal by which it is per-
                        ;

forated, is seen to be of comparatively small diameter, so that we are not sur-

prised that, although such appendages to the respiratory sacs were detected

and well delineated by Delle Chiaje and Moquin-Tandon, their nature was
unknown, and they were supposed to be glandular bodies appropriated to
some undiscovered use. From the arrangement above described, it is evident

that small circular currents of blood exist, which are independent, to a certain

                                                   * Qp. Ф7. p. 201.

extent, of the general circulation ; since opposite to each membranous bag a
portion of the fluid contained in the lateral vessel is given oflp through the
muscular tube, which thus resembles a pulmonary heart, and after being dis-
tributed over the walls of the respiratory sacculi, and in this manner exposed
to the influence of oxygen, the blood returns into the general circulation*."
While the description of M. Duges, just cited, does not very untruly represent
the mere anatomical characters of the parts to which it relates, the error of
interpretation involved in his views, the fact that he saw in the wondrous
structure displayed by these parts a fantastic mechanism for respiration, is
as extraordinary as any false conception ever known in the history of compa-
rative anatomy.

    It will subsequently be found that his marvellous muscular fusiform hearts
for circulating the blood over the so-called respiratory sacculi, are true and
unquestionable ovarian utricles, proved to be such by the discovery in them
of veritable ova.

   The respiratory sacculus (of Duges), scrutinized through the searching
eye of the modern microscope, resolves itself into a simple vesicle pendent
to the ovario-uterine system ; and the extraordinary blood-vessels of M.
Duges appear only as tubes connected with these two parts of the female ap-

paratus.

   The author will now proceed to describe the whole reproductive system of
the Leech as deciphered by his own investigations. Having once seized the
true key to the interpretation of the physiological meaning of the several
component elements of this system, the mere anatomical process of deter-
mining its limits became easy of execution. In the ordinary medicinal leech
the whole apparatus presents the same characters in every individual. The
leech is therefore monoecious or hermaphrodite. The union of two indivi-
duals is however essential to impregnation. This rule may be stated to be

applicable to the great majority, if not absolutely to all, of the Annelida.

The masculine and feminine moieties of the system bear to each other a pro-
portion of equality. The testicular bodies and ovario-uterine organules are
nearly equal in number, the latter slightly preponderating over the former.

    The testes are observed under the character of small white granular bodies,

disposed at short distances in a longitudinal series on c Ither side of the ventral

median line of the body (Plate VIII. fig. 65 a, a, a, &c.). When forcibly

 compressed, a white fluid exudes, which under the microscope is found to

consist of nothing but sperm-cells (C.) in various stages of evolution. To
 each of these testicular bodies two (fig. 65 erf, cd, &c.) minute threads are
 attached. The larger and more obvious of these threads (fig. 65 c) extends

 outwards at right angles with the median line, and joins a considerable chord
 running parallel with the median line (/). Examined in section, both the
 transverse threads and longitudinal chord prove to be tubes filled with fluid
 thickly charged with sperm-cells, a true male secretion. The longitudinal

 tube (f) is common to all the testicular bodies ; it begins at the most pos-

 teriorly situated of these bodies, and ends in that most anteriorly placed,
 median and azygos (J), to which the intromittent organ is appended ; meeting
 at this mesial organ the corresponding duct of the opposite side. In addition
 to the tubulus just described as proceeding from the testes, another and

 much smaller one (d, d, &c.) may be detected on minute dissection running

 directly outwards, crossing underneath the large longitudinal duct (/,/) and
 becoming united (as a.tff,ff, g) to the base of the ovarian utricle. Traced in
 the direction of the head, the longitudinal duct is seen to enter into a glan-
 dular body (h)y which in size is considerably greater than the testes situated

                                                               * Op. cit, p. 198,
ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.                                       255

posteriorly to it on the same side. In minute structure this body is precisely

the same as the bodies of the testicular series ; like them it is filled with sperm-
fluid ; the interior is a cavity. The secreting glandular structure is disposed
around the circumference ; the secreted product is thrown into the enclosed

hollow. This description applies also in every particular to the other testi-

cular bodies, which are like the former, hollow orbicular glands. The large
longitudinal duct which serves as a common channel of communication be-

tween all the testes, emerges out of the gland (Ji) under the character of a

duct of greatly reduced size (i). This small tubular thread, traced with

minute care, may be followed into the median glandule {j) to which the
penis (k) is appended. In the median line also, and some little distance pos-

teriorly to the body just described, may be remarked a pear-shaped sac-

culus (/) from the unattached fundus of which a caecal coiled tubule (m) is
prolonged. Between this saccular and the other parts of the reproductive

system, no communication of any description can be discovered. It seems

simply destined to receive the intromittent organ developed in connexion with

the gland situated in advance of it on the median line.

It may be inferred from the character of the whole system of the testicular

bodies, that the penis is not an ejaculatory organ ; it seems subservient only

to the purposes of sexual stimulation. By all anatomists, from the date of

the first description of M. Duges, this sacculus has been regarded as a uterus,

and as, in fact, constituting the whole of the female element of the generative

system. The convoluted caecal tubule pendent from the fundus of this sac-

culus, including some undiscoverable gland structures on either side of it,

are commonly indicated as the ovaria. Such anatomists, whilst entertaining

opinions so remote from the truth, and withal so little probable on physiolo-

gical grounds, never could have seen these parts. An ovarian system so

utterly disproportionate to the testicular, if it were true, would find no prece-

dent or parallel in the whole series of invertebrate animals.

In all hermaphrodite animals the female elements of the generative organs

are invariably superior in size, more elaborately organized, and more important

as constituent parts of the whole organism, than the male : wherefore should

Athe converse of this rule obtain in the Annelida ?  cursory glance at the or-

ganic necessities of the animal system should have sufficed to convince the

physiologist that such a simply organized sac, so uncomplicated in structure,

so unprovided with stromatous tissue for the production and development of

ova, could not have proved adequate to those profound functions involving in

intimate sympathy every other of the organism which are concerned in the

continuation of the species. It was the necessity, thus perceived on theo-

retical grounds, for some series of organs which would reasonably answer to

the general characters of a female system, which first led the author to the

discovery of that which now remains to be explained.

In the Leech, the female system consists of a greater number of separate

parts than the male, amounting to fifteen or seventeen on either side, while the

testicular bodies are only nine. This system is composed of a linear succes-

sion of a bag-pipe shape, membranous sacculi (fig. 65 b, b, b, &c.), contracting

at both ends into two separate ducts. One of these ducts {I, I, I, &c.) termi-
nates an orifice communicating externally. It is through this orifice that the
ova and young escape from the ovarian utricle into the external medium. In

the Leech, the ova in this duct, in every case yet examined, present an ob-

viously greater degree of development than those which are found in the duct
(.9i9^ B) which communicates with the neighbouring testis. At certain sea-

sons of the year, in the Earth-worm, this duct, which may be called the

inferior duct of the ovario<uteriue organ, is crowded with living young, emer-
256 REPORT-- 1851.

ging from the ova, and in process of final extrusion through the external
orifice. The hatched young in the Leech have never yet been seen actually
by the author in this situation, although the parts are accurately corre-

spondent in the two worms. He cannot yet therefore state of the Leech what

he can from actual observation of the Earth-worm, that it is viviparous : the
superior duct (rf, d, &c.) of each ovarian uterus passes underneath the com-

mon longitudinal chord (//) and opens into the true testicular duct (c, c,

&c.), the two channels becoming united into one just before entering the
substance of the gland. It is desirable here to warn the anatomist, that in
practice the demonstration of this fact demands great patience and minute-
ness of dissection. At B, fig. 65, the ovarian uterus is seen still further
magnified.

   The author now desires to solicit special attention while he attempts to

explain the nature of the connexion which, according to his view, subsists
between the male organ or testis (fig. (iS, Ф, a) on the one hand, and the egg-
producing and egg-incubating organ (fig. 65, h, b, &c.) or ovarian uterus on
the other. It will, he trusts, suffice to elucidate satisfactorily the mechanism

of self-impregnation. The testicular bodies (a, a) secrete a true sperm fluid,
the cells of which can readily be detected by the eye both in the duct (c, c)
which leads to the great longitudinal chord, and in that (rf, d) which conducts
(as seen at g, g and B, g) into the ovarian uterus. The male seminal fluid
travels from the testes into the ovarian uterus along the superior of these
ducts. It may be actually detected in the cavity of this latter organ, where
it comes into immediate contact with the ova, whereby impregnation results.
The ova thus fertilized travel gradually onwards and reach the inferior half
(B, m) of the ovarian uterus. As in the Leech, these ova may be discovered
as ova at a point in the oviduct very near the outlet, it is probable that this
Annelid is oviparous. This fact, vvhich is little material, may be readily
determined by examination instituted at the right season. The curved
ovario-uterine membranous organ is really the part to which Duges applied
the name of " the cardiac vasiform heart," and which M. Quatrefages has
denominated " la poche secretrice ! ! " Duges made a near approach to a
correct descriptive anatomy of this organ. Quatrefages' delineations are
extravagantly erroneous. To each ovarian uterus a beautifully delicate
vesicle (e, e, e and B, o) is attached. It is connected with the superior duct,
or that which leads directly from the testis into the ovario-uterine saccule by
means of a very slender tubule (B, ii) rising from the vesicle (B, o). This
vesicle is the far-famed " respiratory sacculus" of the Leech; the duct (Ф)
communicating between it and the superior half (B) of the ovarian uterus
is the wondrous respiratory heart-vessel, which for half a century has chal-

lenged the admiration of anatomists !

   Let it now be seen what rational and probable physiological explanation

these parts will bear. In the first place, it is obvious that there exists in this
Annelid a direct communication by means of an open duct between the male
and female elements of the reproductive system ; that this system opens ex-
ternally only at the orifice of the oviduct (/, / and B, q) ; that these orifices
are designed for the extrusion of the ova or young from the body of the
parent, and not for the reception of the sperm-fluid into the ovario-uterine

dtract ; that the male fertilizing secretion passes directly along the duct (d,

and B,g) into the ovarian uterus (b, b) ; and that thus the process of self-im-
pregnation is literally accomplished, for it is not the sperm-fluid of another
individual that, fecundates the ova, but that of the same individual.

   This conclusion may be affirmed with confidence, since the median copu-

lative saccule (/, fig. Q5) into which the intromittent organ (k) of another
       ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.                                      257

individual is inserted terminates In a convoluted ccecal tubulus. Between           '
this median organ and the great bilateral series of ovario-uterine organs there
is no communication Avhatever. If therefore during the union of two indi-
viduals a fluid is emitted by the male organ (k) into the interior of the sac-
culus (/), it requires no further argument to show that it can proceed no
further, that it can reach no other part of the reproductive system. In con-
gress therefore these two parts can subserve no other than the purposes of
first mechanically uniting the individuals, and secondly of stimulating the
sexual organs. During those periods when the fertilizing fluid is not required
for the oflfice of fecundation, it is probably discharged externally as a super-
fluous excretion in part through the intromittent organ (k). According to
this explanation, to the larger testicular bodies (h, h andy) should be assigned
the mechanical uses only of seminal receptacles, compressing what they may-
contain, either backwards into the ovario-uterine organs, or forwards to be
expelled through the penis as an excretion. The penis therefore is the only-
means common to the whole male system by which it communicates with the
exterior, the so-called " respiratory sacculi," as subsequently to be explained,
being the means by which each testis separately communicates with the ex-

terior.

   The sperm-cells of the Leech are represented at C (fig. 65) in their several

phases of evolution.
   It is here essential to add that the ova are first produced in a stromatous

layer which constitutes one of the coats of the ovarian uterus (B), and that a

large number of them are contained in a common capsule (B, p) until they
attain a certain degree of development, after which they may be recognised

near the outlet of the oviduct in a single and free state.
    Ova are never found in the so-called " respiratory sacculus " (B, o, e, e, e),

but, on the contrary and invariably, a small quantity o^ sperm-fluid : each of
these sacs is perforated (as at r, B) at the point where it is attached to the
integument by an orifice which opens directly externally. This vesicle, which

from the date of the writings of M. Duges has been rapturously described as

the " respiratory sac " of the Leech, correctly interpreted, is a true vesicula
seminalis. It is designed to receive the superfluous portion of the sperm
secretion as it passes from the testis to the ovarian uterus. Through the orifice
(r, B) this unrequired portion is discharged externally. Spermatozoa can

always be discovered in the interior of these vesicles.

   Their parietes are very scantily supplied with blood-vessels! What then

becomes of the blood so profusely poured over these parts by the contractile

thick-walled vessels of Duges?

On the authority of Mr. Brightwell of Norwich, it is generally held that the

leeches are oviparous. His description bears the stamp of circumstantial

accuracy and truth, and tends to confirm the inferences which the author of

this Report has ventured to draw from anatomical investigations.

Mr. Brightwell relates that "early in March of the present year (1841)

about seventy specimens of a small leech were taken from the back fin of a

roach caught in the river Wensum. They were the Hcemocharis piscium

and H. geometra of authors. These leeches being placed by themselves in a

glass vessel, and having fresh water put to them every morning, several in-

stances of sexual connexion were observed to take place immediately after

the fresh water was added, one of the leeches suddenly twisting itself round

the neck of another, and closing upon a longitudinal opening which at this

time was very conspicuous in the neck of each. During this union a white

substance could be perceived on the side of the part where the bodies were

connected. They continued united generally several hours, and in one case

1851.                                                             s
258 REPORT 1851.

during the whole day. When the leeches separated, a white filmy substance

was detached from the parts where they had been united, which in one case

had the appearance of eggs, but from subsequent observation it was found to

be a film in which the eggs were enveloped. Within twenty-four hours after

the union took place, eggs were deposited and were found firmly attached to

the sides of the glass vessel. By an experiment made with a pair which were

kept separate for that purpose, twelve eggs were found to proceed from two

individuals. These eggs were semitransparent, of a reddish brown colour,

oblong-oval, with one end truncated ; they were covered with a white filmy

web-like secretion, and had longitudinal elevated ridges on the sides. The

shells of the eggs were found, on dissection, to be extremely hard. On the

thirtieth day after the eggs were deposited the first young leech made its

appearance. Each egg produced only one leech ; this was ascertained by

detaching an egg and keeping it in a glass by itself, when one leech only

proceeded from it. The young leeches were of the size of a small thread,

about one-third of an inch long, and appeared perfectly formed ; the brown

annular markings of the body, the longitudinal lines upon the posterior disc,

and the four eyes in the anterior disc or sucker being clearly visible."

Mr. Brightwell remarks with reference to the Horse-leech, HcBinopis San-

guisorba (Sav.), which is common in our ponds and ditches, "that it is pro-

Webably oviparous.          have found its young, in an early stage, in the same

places as the adult, but never adhering to the parent." He further states

with regard to the medicinal leech, " that a dealer in Norwich keeps a stock

of about 50,000 in two large tanks of water, floored with soft clay, in which the

leeches burrow. On examining these tanks we found many capsules or ova de-

posits of the leech, which the owner, ignorant of their nature, stated to be at

times very numerous, but which he had neglected and generally destroyed."

   Of another species of leech (Nephelis vulgaris, Sav.), he states, " This

species abounds in all our fresh waters, and the brown capsules containing

the ova may be constantly found on the underside of the leaves of water-

Weplants among the ova of the freshwater helices.  have kept several spe-

cies through the summer, and the following are our notes as to the deposit of

the ova and the development of the young. On the 2nd of June II. vulgaris

deposited one capsule containing ova ; on the 5th another ; on the 10th an-
other ; and on the 15th two more, each of them containing from seven to ten

eggs. On the 22nd the young appeared in the capsule deposited on the 2nd,

and on the 13th of July they emerged from the capsule, and in six weeks
were fully developed and left the capsule. Examining the young of this
species with a power of about sixty linear, we detected a Cypris and four
specimens of a common rotiferous animalcule in its stomach, one of the Ro-

tifera being still alive."

Of Nephelis tessellata the same observer states, " Miiller says the female is

sometimes filled with 300 young ones. The abdomen of our species was,

when captured, covered with young, which adhered solely to the posterior

Wedisc.  kept this specimen from the 24'th of June to the 28th of August,

when it died. The young remained attached to the parent during all this

time, and we took some pains to ascertain their exact number, and found

Wethey amounted to 143.     never saw the parents or the young ones take

any food. The young differed altogether in colour from the parent., the

latter being a deep green, the former a light ash-colour. The abdomen of

the parent had no pouch, but was much expanded by the adhesion of so

numerous a progeny, so much so as to make the form appear very different

from the young *."

About many of the foregoing observations cited on the authority of Mr.

Brightwell, there is an air oi a priori improbability. They certainly cannot

be admitted in science until confirmed by other observers aware of the ana-

tomical discoveries announced in this memoir. Since each ovario -uterine

organ has its own oviduct through which it extrudes its ova, it is reasonable

to suppose that these ova, when extruded, would not be found as a defined

ring-like mass encircling the mid-region of the body as commonly stated,

and which is said to be thrown off by violent efforts on the part of the ani-

Amal, the body being withdrawn from within it.  sort of cocoon, open at

both extremities, is said thus to be produced, which contains from twelve to
fourteen ova, enclosed in a protecting substance furnished by the mucous

glands of the parent ; and the young, after their escape from the ova, quit

the cocoon through the openings left by its body. It must be repeated that

all this account requires to be confirmed by a trustworthy observer.

The author has been more fortunate in unravelling the reproductive ope-

rations of the Earth-worm. Between this worm and the Leech there exists a

most remarkable resemblance as regards the structure and distribution of the

utero-ovarian system. In Lumbricus however one prominent and essential

point of difference is at once observed. Here the testicular bodies are

arranged in a longitudinal series as in the Leech, but concentrated into a

considerable glandular mass around the cesophagus and in front of the giz-

zard. It is quite evident from this arrangement that a bisection transversely

of this worm would leave two halves, both of which would be wanting in a

paramount constituent of the organism.
   Before proceeding to describe the results to which the author has been

led by his recent investigations into the anatomy of the Earth-worm, it is
desirable, first, to present a summary of what has been taught on this subject

up to the date of the present Report. Mr. Rymer Jones observes*, " Few

points connected with the history of the Earth-worm have given rise to so
much speculation as the manner of their reproduction. The generative
organs have long been known to be lodged in the anterior part of the body,
their position being indicated externally by a considerable enlargement or
swelling which extends from the seventh to about the fourteenth "segment,

counting from that in which the mouth is situated. On opening this portion

of the animal, a variable number of white masses are found attached to the
sides of a crop and gizzard, which have long, by general consent, been looked
upon as forming the reproductive system ; some having been regarded as re-

presenting the testes, others as the ovaria ; yet so delicate are the connexions
which unite these glandular masses, and such is the difficulty of tracing the
ducts by which they communicate with the interior of the body, that the
functions to which they are individually appropriated have given rise to

much discussion. The Lumbrici have been generally acknowledged to be

hermaphrodite, that is, possessed of organs adapted both to the formation
and the fertilization of the ova ; and it is likewise well understood that the
congress of two individuals is essential to the fecundity of both, as in the

earlier months ; the mode in which they copulate is a matter of constant ob-
servation. At such times two of these animals are found to come partially
out of the ground from contiguous holes, and applying together those seg-
ments of their bodies in which the generative organs are situated, are ob-
served to remain for a considerable time in contact, joined to each other by
a quantity of frothy spume which is poured out in the neighbourhood of the
sexual organs. No organs of intromission, however, have ever been distin-
guished, neither until recently had the canals communicating between the

sexual orifices and the testicular or ovarian masses been satisfactorily traced ;

so that Sir Everard Home was induced to believe that in the kind of inter-

course above alluded to, there was no transmission of impref!;nating fluid from
one animal to another, but that the excitement produced by mutual contact
caused both the ovaria and the testes to burst*, so tliat the ovaria escaping into
the cells of the body become there mingled with the spermatic secretion, and
being thus fertilized, the ova were hatciied internally, and the young, having
been retained for some time in the cells between the intestine and the skin,
Avere ultimately ejected through apertures which were supposed to exist in

the vicinity of the tail.

   " There is however little doubt that what SirE. Home conceived to be young
earth-worms were parasitic Entozoa, and that in the mode of their propaga-
tion, the animals we are describing exhibit but little deviation from what we

have alread}' seen in the Leech.

   "According to M.Duges the testes are placed in successive segments of the
body, from the seventh backwards ; they vary in number in different indivi-
duals from two to seven ; but whether this variety depends upon a difference
of species, or is only caused by the posterior pairs becoming atrophied when
not in use, is undetermined. Each testis is fixed to the bottom of the ring,
in which it is placed by a short tubular pedicle, that opens externally by a
very minute pore through which a milky fluid can be squeezed. The testi-
cular vesicles of the same side of the body all communicate by a common

canal, and the seminal fluid, which, like the seminal secretion of other ani-
mals, contains animalcules, can readily be made to pass from one to the

other.

" The ovaria are eight large white masses of a glandular texture, from which

arise two delicate tubes or oviducts ; these have no connexion with the testes,

but running backwards, they become dilated into two small vesicles at their

termination, and open by two apertures or mdvce seen externally upon the

sixteenth segment of the body ; in these ducts eggs have been detected as large
as pins' heads! The eggs are laid when two or three lines in length. In

Affig. 85,  , one of them, enclosing a mature embryo, is delineated ; its top is

seen to be closed by a peculiar valve-like structure adapted to facilitate the

escape of the worm, and opening (fig. 85, B) to permit its egress. Another

remarkable circumstance observable in these eggs is, that they very generally

contain double yolks, and consequently two germs, so that a couple of young

ones is generally produced from each."

   By another distinguished systematic writer the following account is given

--with reference to the mechanism of reproduction in the Earth-worm : " In

the Earth-worm, towards the end of the summer, there is developed around

the body a thick and broad belt ; this is an apparatus for suction, by which

the worms are held together during congress. It is remarkable that the ova

do not escape through the ducts which serve to convey the spermatic fluid to

the ovaria; but the ovaria hurst when distended with mature ova, and allow

their contents to be dispersed through the interior of the animal. In this

respect the process of reproduction in the Earth-worm bears a striking ana-

logy to that which we have witnessed in the flowering plants ; for in the latter

the fertilizing influence is transmitted down the minute canals of the style,

and the seeds escape when ripe by the dehiscence of the walls of their enve-

lope. The ova of the Earth-worm pass backwards between the integument

and intestine to the anal extremity ; and in their progress they gradually

undergo their development and are expelled from their parent, either as com-

pletely formed worms, or surrounded by a dense and tough case which gives
them the character of pupae. Whether they are produced in the perfect or
in the pupal form, depends on the nature of the soil which the worms inhabit.
In alight and loose soil the young quit the parent prepared to act for them-
selves ; but in a tough clayey soil they continue the pupal form for some
time, so as to arrive at a still higher degree of development, before commen-

cing to maintain an independent existence*." It is thus seen that Mr.Rymer
Jones has copied from Sir E. Home and M- Duges, and Dr. Carpenter has
copied from Mr. Rymer Jones, neither writer having attempted to deter-

mine the truth or falsehood of the statements which he was transmitting to

another generation. Thus ever has error been propagated.
   All that is true in the original description of Duges with regard to the re-

productive organs of the Earth-worm, amounts to no more than what the most
cursory dissector may readily verify, viz. that there exists near the base of the
oesophagus a mass of glandular bodies, which are described as ovaria, and
which, when the contents are mature, are said to burst. It is no severity of
criticism to remark that this latter idea indicates a very rude state of physio-

logical knowledge on the part of those by whom it is entertained. The de-

hiscence of large vital organs, like the ovaria, is an occurrence which has

never been credibly authenticated in the animal kingdom. In the vegetable

kingdom it may be a normal event. The researches of Quatrefages have

thrown no additional light whatever on the anatomy of this system, having

mistaken the true utero-ovaria for lateral secreting pouches. Amid so little
that was clear, and so much that was confused, it became obvious therefore

that nothing less than independent and patient dissections would solve the
enigma as to the mechanism of reproduction in this worm. The author
trusts that he will be able to show that he has satisfactorily accomplished

this object.

   The first part of the reproductive system observed on opening the body
along the dorsal median line, is the glandular white mass which embraces
the oesophagus (as shown in Plate IX. fig. 66 a, a, in a pregnant individual).
The component lobuli of this mass vary in size and number, according to
the age of the specimen under inspection. They are tied down to the in-
tersegmental partitions, and communicate (fig. 67 a, in an individual not
pregnant) with minute ducts which run longitudinally on either side of the

median line, from one end of the body to the other (fig. 66 b, b). When

compressed they discharge a milky fluid, which is their proper secretion. It
is true seminal fluid ; it is not emitted directly externally, but into the longitu-

dinal ducts (b, b, fig. 66 and b, b, fig. 67) through the excretory channels (a, a),

which are common to the whole utero-ovarian system. From these longi-

tudinal conduits the fertilizing fluid passes laterally along still minuter ducts

(b, b, b, fig. 67, and a, fig. 68), which open directly into the utero-ovarian
sacculus. In fig. 68 spermatic animalcules are represented in progress of
passage from the longitudinal ducts into the lateral duct (a), which conveys

them immediately into contact with the ova (6). This fact of the actual
presence of sperm-cells in this duct of the female system dispels every obscu-
rity with respect to the mechanism of self-impregnation, probably in all An-
nelida. In fig. 67 is represented the copulative pouches, so called because no
other probable use can be assigned to them (c, c). They are unquestionably
an integral part of the generative apparatus, though their functions may only
be mechanical. In the Earth-worm they are concealed by the testicular

masses. These latter organs in fig. 67 are removed in order to display the
copulative pouches (c, c, c), which amount to four or six in number on either

side of the median line, and open externally by orifices (fig. 69), seen outside
on the abdominal surface. They are simple csecal vesicles, communicating

with no detectable duct. It is not improbable, from the analogy of the in-

tromittent organs, which will be subsequently shown to be contained within
vesicles of a similar character in Nais, that they may lodge an intromittent

instrument of some sort, though its presence has not yet been proved by actual

observations. It is only on the supposition that some such organ is con-

tained witliin these pouches that their mechanical functions can be under-

tube (a, fig. 68) proceeding from the common testicular duct (b, b, fig. 66)

runs along the upper part of the segmental dissepiment, which serves, as al-

ready explained, to convey the sperm-fluid into the uterine cavity. This tube

is embraced, as at a', a" (fig. 68), by stromatous tissue, which is densely

charged with ova. These ova seem successively to be thrown into the channel

of duct a, (fig. 68) where they are brought under the direct agency of the

fertilizing fluid ; thus fecundated they travel onwards in the line of the cir-

cumference of the ovarian uterus, b, b', b", b'", undergoing greater and greater

development, until finally in the passaged, terminating in the outlet rf', they

dehisce, and the young appear alive and active. After a sojourn of variable

duration in this passage, the young escape externally through the outlet d', D.

To the concavity of this organ a pouch or marsupium is appended. This

part, during the breeding season, is crowded with ova on the point of giving

escape to the young, c'. From this marsupium the ova descend as at b'",

in a very advanced state of development. It may be designated the true

uterine segment of the utero-ovarian organ, the place wherein the ova un-

dergo the process of incubation, that in which the young are hatched. The

whole of the interior (except the marsupium) of the ovario-uterine passages

are lined with vibratile epithelium. The cilia are active and vigorous during

the season of reproduction, but undistinguishable during the rest of the year.

A comparison of this organ with that of the Leech will show that the so-

called " respiratory sacculus" (Duges) of the Leech is altogether absent in

the Earth-worm. Considering the difference in the disposition of the male

organs in the two species, the absence of this singular appendage in Lum-

bricus can excite no surprise. With this exception the reproductive systems

of these two worms are formed on one and the same principle.

During the reproductive season, in the Earth-worm it is a matter of easy

observation to trace the evolution of the ova throughout all its phases. It

appears first (1, fig. 70) under the character of a minute, pellucid, nucleated,

orbicular cell, of which the germinal vesicle and its contained germinal spot

exceed very slightly in transparency the surrounding vitelline mass. The

first appreciable departure from this unimpregnated type, which occurs in

consequence of fertilization, consists in a thickening of the vitellus (2), by
which, by contrast, the germinal vesicle is rendered much more distinct, the

germinal spot at this stage being only obscurely perceptible.

Under the succeeding phase (3) the germinal spot presents itself under

the character of a double-cell, surrounded by a pellucid zone, which is evi-
dently still the germinal vesicle. At the next stage (4) the double-cell has

multiplied into a series, arranged linearly and slightly curved to conform to

the circumference of the vitelline membrane. This line of cells is still sepa-

rated from the material of the yolk by a very transparent interval, definedly

bounded, evidently by a membrane. This membrane must be the involu-

crum of the germinal vesicle.
ON THE BRITISH ANNKLIDA.  263

   The succeeding stage (5) is marked by a still further development of this
curved line of cells. At a subsequent phase (6) these cells assume the un-
questionable character of young worms having the power of independent
motion while yet in the midst of vitelline mass. What is remarkable is, that
the ovum, while the young is thus being evolved, undergoes a great increase
of size. This can only occur by absorption of nutrient fluid from without.

   At(b"", fig. 68) the inferior uterine duct, it will be seen that the young
escape out of the ova before they finally leave the parent, and that they are
endowed with independent capabilityof locomotion ; 7,8,9, 10, fig.71, illustrate
the minute anatomy of the young at this stage (intra-uterine) of growth.
Minute groups of molecules are first seen (7) in the axis of the body, which
subsequently become fused (8) into a continuous series, in which it is im-
possible to discern a channel. At another age, however, a distinct intesti-
nal canal (9) appears ; this is surrounded on either side by a longitudinal
row of cells which indicate the future blood-vessels. Still further developed
(10), this canal exhibits incipient evidences of segmental contractions; and
what should be expressly noted, the interval between the intestine and inte-
gument becomes filled with a fluid, already corpusculated, the motions of
which may be distinctly and unmistakeably discerned. Thus the physiologist
has attained to a knowledge of one definitive /ac< in relation to the embryo-
logical history of the chylo-aqueous fluid of the peritoneal cavity of the An-
nelida, that it begins its functions in the embryo before the true-blood. This

latter is a system of subsequent development. So simple is the first stage of
nutrition that it is accomplished exclusively by the chylo-peritoneal fluid.

It may be here affirmed (what may hereafter prove to be embryologically
true of all worms, and probably of all articulated animals) of the Earth-worm,
that the younger the individual the greater the volume of the chylo-perito-

neal fluid, the older the less ; the proportion of this fluid, in other words, is
inversely as the age. It is thus established by actual demonstration, that the
Earth-worm is viviparous, and that it is hermaphrodite and self-impregnating,
although only under the condition of being united to another individual.

    Illustrations of the generative organs of NaisJiliformis adorn the pages of
almost every systematic work on comparative anatomy, published since the
date of the researches of M. Duges. Each author in long succession, as usual,
adopts reverently the original of M. Duges ; where he is wrong they are
wrong, where right they are so. The researches of M. Duges into the ana-

tomy of the generative system of this little worm constitute undoubtedly his
master-performance in minute investigation. At the period of his inquiries

it was by no means easy to unravel the reproductive organs of Nais. Itself
of microscopic minuteness, it demands the use of the highest and the clearest
powers, and that too in a living specimen, ceaselessly in motion, that the
problem may be satisfactorily solved. The descriptions amount to a credit-
able approximation to the results obtained through aid of the best modern
microscope *. They are notwithstanding deficient, in respect that they
omit all allusion to parts which are indispensable to the sexual system as a

whole.

lished for the first time in connexion with this Memoir, will enable the phy-

productive organs of Nais filiformis. During this period thousands of separate individuals

siologist at once to perceive that the ivhole system is limited by M. Duges to

the glandular mass which is so readily observed about the anterior third of
the body, whereas in reality this only constitutes one segmental unit, more
developed only than those are repeated in every ring of the body. Moreover
those singular intromittent organs lodged within pyriform vesicles, now first

described, were wholly unknown to M. Duges, Nor was this anatomist aware
that in this worm the oi^ipassages open by means of a fimbriated, ciliated

extremity freely into the cavity of the peritoneum.

   Expounding the views of M. Duges, Mr. Rynier Jones observes*, "The

generative system of the Nais presents a somewhat difi'erent arrangement to
that which exists in the Earth-worm. The swollen part of the body, in which

the sexual organs are placed, occupies a space of from five or six rings, be-

ginning at the eleventh. On each side of the eleventh segment is a minute

transverse slit, communicating with a slightly flexuous canal, which terminates
in a transparent pyriform pouch or vesicle ; the latter contains a clear fluid,
in which minute vermiform bodies are seen to float, and most probably repre-
sent the testis. The twelfth segment likewise exhibits two openings, each
placed upon the centre of a little nipple ; these are the orifices leading to the
female portions of the sexual system. The ovaria are composed of four large,
and several smaller masses of a granular character, and from them proceed

long and tortuous oviducts, which just before their terminations at the lateral

openings become thick and granular. These animals most likely copulate

Welike the Earth-worms, and lay their eggs in a similar manner.  have

already seen in Lumhricus terrestris ova containing two yolks, and conse-

quently giving birth to two animals ; but in the Nais every egg produces ten
or twelve young ones ; or perhaps we ought rather to say, that what appears
to be a single egg is in fact merely a capsule enclosing distinct ova, from
which a numerous progeny arises. The manner in which these compounds
are formed is easily understood when we consider the structure of the oviduct
described above. The granular germs escape no doubt separately from the

ovaria, and remain distinct from each other, as they pass along the tortuous

canal whicii leads to the external opening ; but at length arriving at the
thick and glandular portion of the oviferous tube, several of them become

enclosed in a common investment secreted by the walls of the oviduct, and

are expelled from the body with the outward appearance of a simple egg."

This is the account of M. Duges with reference to the reproductive organs
of Nais fiiiformis.

   The author of this Report will now proceed to state the results of his own

examination, conducted at great cost of time and labour.

   Every Nais, in relation to this system, is identically constituted ; this worm
therefore, like the preceding, is androgynous. Every individual tovi atAs the
latter end of tiie summer dies by the bisection of the body. It is not true,
as reported by Duges, and before him by Spallanzani, that the fragments into
which the body of each worm becomes resolved, is again reconstructed into

a perfect wliole. Although tlie sexual system exhibits a tendency to seg-
mental repetition, there devolves upon the large anterior portion described
by Duges a special function, which the rest cannot perform ; and, on the
contrary, a duty falls on the posterior segmental units of the system which

the anterior cannot discharge. It is consequently evident that neither of the
moieties into which the body is resolved during the crisis of the reproductive
season can be organically perfect. Such fragmentary organism is wanting

in elements paramountly essential to individuality.

ON THE BRITISH ANNELIDA.  265

     In order to facilitate the comprehension of the succeeding description, it
 is proposed to enumerate the component parts of the sexual apparatus of
 Nais in the order of their position from before backwards.

    The two pear-shaped sacculi (a, a, Plate VIII. fig. 72) are sufficiently promi-
 nent and defined in outline to be traced satisfactorily by the eye. The fundus
 of these sacculi exhibits no traceable orifice of communication with the glandu-
 lar bodies (c, c, c', c') by which they are enreloped ; it is quite certain, however,
 that this communication exists. The interior of these sacculi is not lined by
 vibratile epithelium ; they lodge a peculiar, flexible, arrow-headed organ (b,b),
 which is often seen extruded through the orifice (a') to a considerable di-

 stance ; this organ is an indisputable intromittent instrument. Its axis is
 hollow, and its root is structurally identified with the parietes of the vesicle

 in which it is contained. The large-celled glandular masses (c', c) are tes-
 ticular, and contribute the fluid which is emitted by the penis (b') through

 the orifice (a') into the vulva (d), if not of the same, of another individual.

No other parts than these masses (c', c), discoverable in Nais, are charged

 with sperm-cells, or, as Dr. Farre has designated them, ciliated corpuscles
 (╗╗). These organs, therefore, are evidently the sole male apparatus of JVais
 they furnish the secretion which, when introduced into the uteri (c?'), fecun-
 date the ova contained in the large masses (g). These last masses are ulti-
 mately composed of the elements (n), which consist of vitelline, nucleated,
orbicular cells. Through a channel, not yet clearly defined, these ova find
 their way into the convoluted duct (/), which is prolonged from the fundus
 of the uterus (d), and terminates in a remarkable fimbriated extremity (e),
through which the fertilized ova escape into the open cavity of the perito-

neum. This singular organ, which may be divided into the uterine ca-

vity, the fallopian duct, and inorsus diaholi, is repeated in every segment,

 as seen at i, k, &c. In the posterior units, however, of this system the
large ovarian masses (g) are not reproduced; they are peculiar to the first
 and most anterior of the system. In the posterior they are replaced by an-
 other description of stroma tons tissue (as seen a,tj,J), which embraces the
 mid-portion of each duct. In the absence of any demonstrable male appa-

 ratus in connexion with these posterior utero-ovarian organs, there remains
 no alternative but to believe that the fimbriated extremities (k, k)JIoating
freely and loosely in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity, and lined internally
 with active cilia, take up sperm-cells from the fluid of the peritoneal cavity,

in which they may be seen suspended, conveying them through the duct
 until they reach that portion (^j) which is embraced by the ovarian tissue.
At this stage the ova from this tissue are detached into the duct, where they
come into direct contact with the spermatic elements. The ova thus ferti-
lized travel onwards under ciliary agency, for which these parts are quite

remarkable, and finally escape at the outer orifice (?', i) ; they escape as ova.

Nais is therefore an oviparous worm. Young worms are never found in any
part of the body, nor at any time have true ova been seen in the fluid of the

 peritoneal cavity.

   Nais is the only worm jet known in which the sexual organs commu-

nicate thus directly with the peritoneal cavity, and in which the fluid contents
 of this cavity enacts a mechanical part in propagating throughout the female
elements of the reproductive system the fecundating fluid. It is not, how-
 ever, the only Annelid in which the female moiety only of the sexual system
 is segmentally repeated. In the Earth-worm, the testicular masses were
shown to be circumscribed to one region of the body, while the utero-ovaria
were reproduced in every segment. The Terebellce also exhibit the tendency
to repetition only in the female elements of this system. The male glands
266 REPORT-- 1851.

are grouped into a lobulated mass at the median line. The utero-ovaria
occur as segmentally repeated sacculi, communicating on the ventral surface
of the body by perceptible orifices. In Terebella nebulosa the whole of the
sexual system may be readily demonstrated ; it lies underneath the alimentary
canal. To expose it to view this latter must therefore be removed. Along
the median line is accumulated under the form of white lobulated masses
the testicular glands. The secretion furnished by these masses is conveyed by
means of a common duct to a receptacle, a sacculus, situated at its anterior
extremity. This organ communicates externally by an orifice or two, through
which the spermatic fluid is emitted. During the contact of two individuals,
this fluid passes outside along the abdominal surface of the body, and thence
finds its way into the ovario-uterine organs, which exist to the number of
ten on either side of the abdominal median line, and which communicate by

corresponding orifices externally.

   The minute anatomy of these utero-ovarian organs in Terebella nebulosa,
is well calculated to elucidate the mechanism of reproduction in several other

species of Annelida.
    Each lateral utriculus is divided longitudinally into two distinct com-

partments, of which one is thicker (in the parietes) at the attached end, and

more vascular and redder in colour than the other, which is a mere mem-
branous receptacle. A small glandular mass exists at the attached end

of each of these organs, which during the reproductive season undergo a

remarkable increase of size ; they are true ova-producing bodies. From this

stromatous structure the ova escape into one of the compartments of the
utricle, where they fall under the influence of the spermatic fluid contained
(received from without) in the other. They sojourn for some time in this
receptacle, and finally escape as ova. The TerebellcB are therefore oviparous.

   The sexual system of Arenicola is organized on a plan which intimately

resembles that just described in T. nebulosa ; there are, however, in this

worm no median testicular masses. The male and female elements are at-

tached to the lateral sacculi, which in this worm, like T. nebulosa, are
arranged in lateral series, and divisible into two portions by a median parti-
tion. During the reproductive season these organs become highly vascular
and prominent. The Nereids are constructed, as regards their reproductive
sj-stem, very much on the type of that oi Lumbricus. Each segment is fur-
nished with its utero-ovarium. The Phyllodoce are organized on the same

principle*.

                   Senses, Instinctive Actions, and Nervous System.

   The nervous system of the Annelida is constructed in conformity with the
articulated type. It is characterized essentially by the presence of a ganglion
on the dorsal aspect of the oesophagus, and hence called the cephalic or supra-
cesophageal; and another on the ventral surface of the oesophagus, known as
the infra-oesophageal. These two ganglia are united by means of intermediate
threads which descend on either side of the oesophagus, such as to embrace

this tube in the enclosed span and forming the oesophageal ring. From the
infracesophageal ganglion the abdominal cord proceeds backward along the

ventral median line. In some species this cord is double, in others single ; in
some it is nodulated at intervals, corresponding with the annuli of the body,

and by ganglia ; in others it seems to consist only of a continuous cord. When

the former conformation prevails, the ganglia always bear reference in size

and number to those of the segmental divisions of the body. Whatever may
be the degree to which these ganglia are multiplied, they constitute only
repetitions of one another. The cephalic ganglion, representing in situation
and importance the brain of the higher Articulata, is distinguished from the

rest. It originates nerves to the organs of sense.. It is gifted, like a brain,
with the distinctive power of directing, controlling and coordinating the
movements of the entire body, whilst the influence of each ganglion of the

trunk is confined only to its own segment. The longitudinal ganglionic cord
occupies a position from which at first sight it may be inferred that it is not
the honiologon of the spinal cord of vertebrated animals. The spinal cord

affects, in relation to the body, a dorsal situation, the ganglionic chain of the
Articulata a ventral. This difference of locality has been supposed to be at
variance with the doctrine of the equwalence of these several forms of nervous

system. From the history of the development of articulate animals, however,
it has been suggested that the whole body of these animals may be considered
as in an inverted position ; the part in which the segmentation is first distin-
guished in insects being the equivalent of the dorsal region of vertebrata, and
that over which the germinal membrane is the last to close in, being homo-
logous with the ventral region. Regarded under this aspect, the longitudinal

nervous tract of Articulata corresponds with the spinal cord of vertebrated

Weanimals in position, as it will be afterwards seen that it does in function.

are indebted to Dr. Carpenter for an exact description of the ultimate

--structural characters of these ganglia: "When the structure of the chain

of ganglia is more particularly examined, it is found to consist of two distinct
tracts ; one of which is composed of nerve-Jibres only, and passes backwards
from the cephalic ganglion, over the surface of all the ganglia of the trunk,
giving off branches to the nerves proceeding from them, while the other
includes the ganglia themselves. Hence, as in the MoUusca, every part of
the body has two sorts of nervous connexions ; one with the cephalic gan-
glion, and the other with the ganglion of its own segment. Impressions
made upon the afferent fibres, which proceed from any part of the body to
the cephalic ganglia, harmonize and direct the general movements of the
body, by means of the efferent nerves proceeding from them. For the

purely reflex operations, on the other hand, the ganglia of the ventral cord

are sufficient, each one ministering to the actions of its own segment, and to

a certain extent also to those of the other segments. It has been ascertained

by the careful dissections of Mr. Newport, to whom we owe all our most

accurate knowledge ot the structure of the nervous system in articulated
animals, that of the fibres constituting the roots by which the nerves are im-

planted in the ganglia, some pass into the vesicular matter of the ganglion,

and after coming into relation with its vesicular substance, pass out again on
the same side ; whilst a second set, after traversing the vesicular matter, pass
out by the trunks proceeding from the opposite side of the same ganglion

and a third set run along the portion of the cord which connects the ganglia
of different segments, and enter the nervous trunks th&t issue from them at
a distance of one or more ganglia above or below. Thus it appears, that an
impression conveyed by an afferent fibre of any ganglion, may excite a
motion in the muscles of the same side of its own segment ; or in those of
--268 REPORT 1851.

the opposite side; or in those of segments at a greater or less distance,
according to the point at which the efferent fibres leave the cord." The
degree of development exhibited by the nervous system in this class of ani-
mals, as in all others, bears a direct ratio to that of the muscular system, the
distinctness of the organs of sense, and the complication of the pedal and

tactile appendages. When these last are entirely wanting, the ventral cord

exhibits no ganglia ; when they are highly developed, these are completely
and powerfully formed. This rule however is liable to exception, since the
nervous systems of the Leech and the Earth-worm are more prominently gan-

glionic than that of the Nereids.
    In the Leech the nervous system consists of a long series of minute ganglia

joined by internuncial cords ; these ganglia amount to about 24* in number.
The anterior pair, or that immediately beneath the oesophagus, is larger than
the rest, forming a minute heart-shaped mass, which is circled by a delicate
nervous collar embracing the gullet, with two small nodules of neurine
situated upon the dorsal aspect of the mouth. The diminutive bodies last
mentioned constitute that portion of the nervous system most immediately
connected with sensation ; for while the nervous filaments given off from the
abdominal ganglia are distributed to the muscular integuments of the body,
the nerves which issue from the supracesophageal pair supply the oral sucker
where the organs of sense are situated. In all homogangliata, indeed, it is
 exclusively from this cephalic pair of ganglia that the nerves appropriated to
 the instruments of the senses are derived ; the name of brain may therefore
 be aptly applied to this part, since it is the physiological correlate, if not the
 anatomical homologon of the cerebral mass of more highly organized beings.
 In consequence of the rudimentary character of these centres, the apparatus
 of sensation associated therewith must be proportionably rudimentary. The
 material machinery of an organ of sense can only be utilized by a corre-
 sponding amount of nervous influence, and where the latter exists the former
 is commonly present. In the Hirudinis, as in other Annelida, distinct ocelli
 have indeed been described by several anatomists. Although characterized
 by the utmost simplicity of structure, they are stated nevertheless to present,
 in the degree of their development, a proportion corresponding to the condition
 of the cerebral centres with which they are in relation. The eyes of the
 Leech are eight or ten in number, and are easily detected by the assistance of
 a lens, under the form of a semicircular row of blaclc points, situated above
 the mouth upon the sucking surface of the oral disc, a position evidently
 calculated to render them efficient agents in detecting the presence of food.
 The structure of these simple eyes, according to Prof. Miiller, does not as
 yet present any apparatus of transparent lenses adapted to collect or con-
 centrate the rays of light ; but each ocellus or visual speck would seem to be
 merely expansions of the terminal extremity of a nerve derived immediately
 from the brain, spread out beneath a kind of cornea formed by a delicate
 and transparent cuticle ; behind this is a layer of black pigment, to which
 the dark colour of each ocular point is due. These ocelli are detectable in
 nearly all Annelida in ultimate organization ; in all instances, however, they
 fall under the description above presented. In the Nemertinidte these or-
 ganules are prominently visible, amounting to 12 or \6 in number. The
 Nereids are distinguished for the large size of the eyes, which stand in relief
 at the bases of the tentacles as two black spots. Those who have watched
  the habits of the Nereids will scarcely doubt that they are gifted with the
 power of discriminating external objects, of making towards some point, and of
 avoiding others. In the absence of such an optical arrangement as may be
 fitted to collect the rays of light, the physiologist, however, can form no con-

ception of the mechanism oflight in these animals ; if this endowment really is

conferred upon them., under the conditions and in conformity with the laws
which affect these organs in all the higher animals. It were however by no
means irreconcileable with the views entertained at present as probable by

many philosophers with reference to the properties of light, to suppose that
this subtile agent may be rendered perceptible to the sensorium of the hum-

blest animals, by means of a mechanism very different from that which aria-

tomists and opticians recognize in the apparatus of an eye. It is not essential
to the practical purposes of the lowest forms of life that the objects of the
external world should be seen, that pictures of them should be painted upon

the retina ; it were enough that the mere presence or absence of an objective

body should become evident to the sensations of the animal by the positive-

Aness or negativeness of the impressions received.  refinedly exalted sense of

touch, tactile sensibility, would suffice to accomplish this object. It is not

easy for those who have never enjoyed the spectacle of the ' feat of touch,'

performed by the tentaculated worms, to estimate adequately the extreme

acuteness of the sensibility which resides at the extremities of the living and

sagacious threads with which tiie head and sides of the body are garnished.

They select, reject, move towards and recede from minute external objects

with all the precision of microscopic animals gifted with the surest eagle-

sight. The necessity therefore of ordinary organs of sight, in the present

state of physical and physiological science, it is by no means essential to

admit, while acknowledging that under agency and stimulus of light the

humblest beings, though unendowed with normal visual organs, may yet

steer themselves harmlessly, readily and unerringly through the thickly-

tangled labyrinth of mud and stone and gravel and weed, amid the twilight

of which the habitat of many of them may have been cast.

It is a remarkable fact in the history of the Annelida, that scarcely any

species, however organized, whether furnished or not with external locomo-

tive organs, in its numerous and varied muscular evolutions ever moves

directly backwards. The movements consist always of serpeiitiform pranks,

or those of elaborate coiling. It is by the head however that the movement

is invariably initiated. The tail is always in the rear, never in the van. The

animal never marches backwards. The head never delegates to the tail the

authority of leading, directing or controlling the evolutions of the frame;

not even in the Clymenidm, in which the caudal ganglion exceeds the ce-

phalic in dimensions. The power of retreat however, by exception, does

exist in the tubicolous worms, and they are ingeniously provided with loco-

motive appendages by which the back-movement is performed with as much

facility as the forward. These curious facts are well calculated to elucidate

many points of great interest in the physiology of the nervous system of these

annulose forms. The elaborate dissections of Mr. Newport have already

proved beyond doubt that fibres of communication, from every part of the

body of the articulated animal, converge upon, while others radiate from, the

central cephalic ganglia. Through the intervention of such cords, these

masses become the controllers of all the consensual muscular actions of the

body. As Dr. Carpenter has argued with masterly clearness, sensation, the

rousing of consciousness, is involved in such movements. Although excited

--by external impressions, they are not automatic they are raised in character

one degree above the purely automatic. Although stimulated by influences

from without, the cephalic ganglia, unlike the abdominal, yet possess the

power of subordinating and coordinating a complex succession of muscular

evolutions with a view to the attainment of a definite end. This is instinct I

This regulating power does not however reside, even in its lowest form, in the
--270 REPORT 1851.

abdominal ganglia. These last act unquestionably on a purely physical
principle. Their agency is exclusively excito-motory. Each ganglion is
limited in its influence to the annulus to which it belongs. The stimulus
of external contact aflecting the extremities of its afferent fibres determines
the return force, the reaction, conveyed to the muscles through the medium
of the efferent nerves. Though thus automatic in the principle of their
action, the cephalic masses nevertheless exercise over the abdominal ganglia
an interfering influence. The force of the former mingles with that of the
latter with a view to its guidance and direction ; muscular agency is thus
moderated and governed. The automatic force originating in the abdominal
ganglia confers on the muscles the power of contraction ; the sensational or
instinctive influence of the cephalic masses directs this blind power, such as

that consensual harmony and coordination may result from the intricate

evolutions.

   The laborious researches of Mr. Newport on the Nervous System of the
Myriapoda* apply with equal exactness to that of the Annelida. Expound-
ing the views of Mr. Newport and announcing his results, Dr. Carpenter
observes-}-, " The general conformation of the articulated animals and the
arrangements of the parts of their nervous system render them peculiarly
favourable subjects for the study of the reflex actions, some of the principal
phsenomena of which will now be described. The Mantis religiosa customa-
rily places itself in a curious position, especially when threatened or attacked,
resting upon its two posterior pair of legs and elevating its thorax with the

anterior pair, which are armed with powerful claws. Now if the anterior

segment of the thorax with its attached members be removed, the posterior
part of the body will still remain balanced upon the four legs which belong
to it, resisting any attempt to overthrow it, recovering its position when dis-
turbed, and performing the same agitated movements of the wings and elytra
as when the unmutilated insect is irritated ; on the other hand, the detached
portion of the thorax, which contains a ganglion, will, when separated from
the head, set in motion its long arms and impress their hooks on the fingers
which hold it. If the head of a Centipede be cut off whilst it is in motion,
the body M'ill continue to move onward by the action of the legs ; and the
same will take place in the separate parts if the body be divided into several
distinct portions. After these actions have come to an end they may "be
exerted again by irritating any part of the nervous centres or the cut ex-
tremities of the nervous cord. The body is moved forwards by the regular
and successive actions of the legs, as in the natural state ; but its movements
are always forwards, never backwards, and are only directed- to one side
when the forward movement is checked by an interposed obstacle. Hence,
although they might seem to indicate consciousness and a guiding will, they
do not so in reality, for they ai-e carried on as it were mechanically, and show
no direction of object, no avoidance of danger. If the body be opposed in
its progress by an obstacle of not more than half of its own height, it mounts
over it and moves directly onwards as in its natural state ; but if the obstacle
be equal to its own height, its progress is arrested, and cut extremities of the
body remain forced up against the opposing substance, the legs still con-
tinuing to move. If, again, the nervous cord of a Centipede be divided in the
middle of the ti-unk, so that the hinder legs are cut oft' from connexion with
the cephalic ganglia, they will continue to move, but not in harmony with

those of the fore-part of the body, being completely paralysed, so far as the
animal's controlling power is concerned, though still capable of performing

                         * See Newport in the Philosophical Transactions for 1843.

reflex movements by the influence of their own ganglia, which may thus con-
tinue to propel the body in opposition to the determinations of the animal
itself. The case is still more remarkable when the nervous cord is not
merely divided, but a portion of it is entirely removed from the middle of

the trunk, for the anterior legs still remain obedient to the animal's control
the legs of the segments from which the nervous cord has been removed are
altogether motionless, whilst those of the posterior segments continue to act,

through the reflex power of their own ganglia, in a manner which shows that
the animal has no power of checking or directing them."

    Parallel experiments to the preceding, performed on any of the Annelida,

lead invariably to corresponding results. From these and similar observa-
tions, the conclusion may be safely drawn that the ordinary movements of
the locomotive appendages of annulose and articulated animals are reflex in
character, and may take place under the exclusive agency of the ganglia of
the segments to which they may be superadded, whilst in the perfect being
these movements are harmonized, controlled and directed by impulses which
act through the cephalic ganglia and the nerves proceeding from them. As

formerly stated, the operations to which these latter ganglia are subservient
are entirely of a consensual nature, being immediately prompted by sen-
sations, chic-fly those of sight and hunger, and never by any processes of
a truly rational character. The habits of the Annelida, however atten-
tively watched, suggest irresistibly the inference, that, although evidently
directed to the attainment of certain ends, they are very far from being of
the same spontaneous nature, far from indicating the same designed adapta-
tion of means to ends, as those of the higher and more intelligent animals.
The actions of these little humble beings are uniform and unvarying, for

--ever repetitions the different individuals of the same species executing pre-

--cisely the same movements when the circumstances are the same and by

 the very elaborate nature of the mental operations which would be required,
in many instances, to arrive at the same results by an effort of reason. The
 Sabellce in the construction of their tubes repeat the same invariable ' round
 of actions ; they obey an impulsive principle which discovers no change of
plan. The Terebellce gather the shell-fragments for the manufacture of their
tubes on principles of the same monotonous uniformity. The Sand-lug un-
 dermines the strand, generation after generation, with exact and undeviating
 regularity. Though governed only by the unreasoning impulses of instinct,
 these little worms yet construct for themselves habitations, which, in elegance
of arrangement or appropriateness of structure, the most enlightened human

 intelligence, working on the most refined geometrical principles, could not

 surpass.

    It is not easy to express the pleasure which is excited in the mind of the
 observer of nature while contemplating the habits and manners of the An-
 nelida. Every movement exemplifies the curve of beauty ; every tentacle

 winds ceaselessly and rapidly through a thousand forms of matchless grace.
 Whether coiling round a visible object, or picking up a microscopic molecule
 for the construction of the cell, it exhibits a delicacy and precision of aim
 which the erudite finger of the most skilful artisan never equalled. The re-

 fined perfection of its muscular performances is matched only by its exquisite
 sensibility. Like the human hand, of which the manifold endowments have
 exhausted the admiring eloquence of philosophers and theologians, it unites

 in its little self the most varied capacities. It is at once an eye, an ear, a
 nose and a finger ; it sees, it hears, it smells, it touches ! Leading for the
 most part a subaqueous or subterranean life, the sense of sight in the Annelid

 is little required ; and gifted in every part of the body with a superlative

tenderness of touch, the sense of hearing is rendered unnecessary. Anatomy

accordingly demonstrates only the obscurest rudiments of an organ ot vision,
while that of hearing has eluded the scrutiny of the minutest examination.
Is it not to be marvelled at that these humble beings should see without eyes,
hear without ears, and smell without a nose? It is not affirmed that this is
literally and entirely true, but it is exact to a degree enough to prove the
wondrous manner in which the sense of touch is made to supersede all the
otliGP senses

tunneling the sand, advancing or retreating in its tube, the Annelid performs

of phffinomenaTof    which (more or less varied)          every earthquake consists, and

the transit through the earth's crust of a wave of elastic compression," though

received at first with some hesitation, perhaps with doubt, appear rapidly to
have claimed tlie general assent that verisimilitude warranted, and indeed now
have been admitted as a portion of our systematic knowledge in the works

of Somerville, De la Beche, Lyell, and others. It always however appeared
desirable to me that the truth should be submitted to an " experimentum

crucis," and in the original paper above noticed, as also in the ' Admiralty

Manual,' I proposed, as an important object to physical experimentalists, to
determine the actual rate and other conditions of propagation of elastic waves

or pulses through the various formations of the earth's crust when artificially
produced by the explosion of gunpowder, to be fired at known distances from
the points of observation by means of the galvanic battery, the time of wave

transit to be noted.

The subject not having been taken up by others, doubtless, amongst other

reasons, because few competent experimenters are found in circumstances of

locality suited for such experiments, or can command the time and personal

labour demanded for conducting them, not to speak of the large expenditure

in money which such operations require, I undertook the task, and with the

able and zealous assistance of my eldest son, William Mallet, whose help,

efficient beyond the promise of his years, I acknowledge, with I trust a par-

donable pride, have been enabled to complete it during the summers and

autumns of the years 1849-50.

   The precise object, then, that I set before me was to measure the transit

rate of pulses in two different media, such as might be considered to give

the extreme limits of speed, viz. the fastest and the slowest, likely to be found
in any of the formations occupying considerable tracts of the earth's crust.

It would doubtless be found that the limits of wave slowness should occur

in some discontinuous medium, and in this the most rapid extinction of impulse

would also occur. Preliminary knowledge already pointed out solid granite

or other crystalline rock as the medium giving the limits of loave fastness,

and that in what the impulse would be transferred furthest.
   It fortunately happened that both these media could be commanded at the

distance of a few miles from Dublin, at a point of the coast easily accessible
by railway, and offering the requisite conditions of uniformity of medium

--over a sufficient range and depth for experiment, nearly level surface for

admeasurement of the ranges, and a locality such that the required explo-

sions could be made free from danger to other persons and without inter-

ruption.

Killihey Bay, on the coast of the County of Dublin, offered, along its

widely extended beach, a mass of wet sand admirably circumstanced and

suited for one limit, while the granite of Dalkey Island, closely adjacent and
not half a mile from the shore, about a mile northward, gave as a medium

the other limit of wave transit which is not likely to be exceeded by at least

any European formation.
   The map (Plate XII.) shows the positions finally chosen for both sets of

experiments, the directions and lengths of the two measured ranges being in-

dicated by dark lines : AB, the Killiney Bay range in sand ; CD, the Dalkey

Island range in granite.

   The sites being determined, I made application to the commanding officers

of Engineers, and to those of the Coast Guard, to obtain the assistance of

the non-commissioned officers and men of both services, stationed in the

several batteries along the line of adjacent coast, and for permission to use
one or more of the batteries as places of deposit for our instruments ; and I

have to acknowledge the prompt and cordial manner in which my requests

were acceded to, and the efficient assistance that was rendered us by the

extremely intelligent men both of the Artillery and Coast Guard services

whose cooperation we obtained.

I now proceed to describe the operations and instruments used in the ex-

periments as to the

          Bate of Wave-transit in the Killiney Bay Sand.

The site for this class of experiments was chosen on the shore of Killiney

Bay, where a straight and almost perfectly level range of strand, consisting

wholly of deep and dead sand, of particles, chiefly of quartz, from the size of

small pins' heads to large mustard seed, resting on a deep bed of hard clay

and gravel, is found stretching along more than five miles of shore, free from

all rock in situ, and with but very few small-sized granite boulders at one or

two spots imbedded in the sand.

The sand contains from 80 to 90 per cent, of white and yellow quartz,

about 6 or 8 per cent, of gray and green slate, 3 or 4 per cent, of black ar-

gillaceous limestone, effervescing with acids, all in grains, and occasional

fragments of felspar, schorl, and mica. The specific gravity of the whole

Ataken in water is 2*481 и  cubic foot of its solid materials would therefore

Aweigh 1 55*06 lbs. avoir.  cubic foot of the moist sand was ascertained by

experiment to weigh, when compressed to about the same extent as it is found

on the strand, 1 1 1*05 lbs. The degree of porosity, or the amount of intersti-

tial space in the sand to its solid material in a given bulk, is in the ratio of

44'*01 : 111*05, or very nearly as 1 : 2*5.

  --Measuring the Base. On the 18th of July, 1849, a range of a statute

mile =5280 feet, was roughly marked out, staked and chained over by myself,

William Mallet and Prof. Downing, T.C.D., who kindly assisted us in the
measurement. Two accurately made fir-wood measuring-rods were prepared,

each of 2| inches square in the middle, lessening to 1^ inch at each end, and

of 35 feet in length, shod with brass at both ends, which tapered to \ inch

square (see Diag. 1.). These were accurately adjusted by a brass two-foot

Standard, made by Troughton, in the possession of Mr. George Yeates of
Dublin, mathematical instrument maker, and said to be a copy of the old
Exchequer standard, which he lent for the purpose. The final adjustments
were made by a micrometer, dividing on the varnished face of the wood and
on the straight side, both the rods lying parallel on a bench prepared to sup-
port them level and straight. The adjustment was compared on the day of
measurement and found correct. The wood was straight-grained yellow

pine-fir, quite dry and seasoned.
   The mile to be measured accurately, having been now exactly ranged out

by the theodolite and pegged in line, a heavy oak stake of 6 inches square was
driven down 4 feet into the sand, at the northern extremity of the range
(just under the battery. No. 7, Killiney Bay), and a brass composition nail
was driven into the centre of the head of the stake when level with the sur-

face of the sand.

   A cord of about 250 yards in length was now stretched by hand from this

lie on the surface. One of the 35-foot rods was now laid down upon the
level sand along the line (wiiich the cord served accurately to mark), the

extremity of the rod being over the centre of the brass nail in the stake head.
Three pieces of deal board of 12 inches square each and f inch thick, were
provided, and one of these was placed flat on the sand with its centre under

the other extremity of the 35-foot rod.

   The other rod was now placed along the cord in line with the former, one

of its extremities being laid within an inch or so of that of the former rod,

and the other upon a similar piece of board (see Diag. 2). One person

(Downing) stooping, now brought the ends of the two rods gently together
and into contact upon the board A.

   Another person (the writer) observed that the extremity of the second

rod upon the board B was not deranged or brought out of line in doing this,

and that it was not shifted until the first rod had been again applied to it in

advance.

As soon as the visual contact was made at A, Downing gave the word

(lift), and two gunners, placed at the positions jv, x, lifted the first rod pa-

rallel to itself, carried it forward, and deposited it in advance with its rear-

ward extremity again on the board B, and within an inch or so of the second

rod ; the other end being laid down on the third board (C), which was carried

Aforward by another assistant in readiness, and who ran back for the board

as soon as he had deposited C. Downing now again brought the rods' ends

into visual contact and gave the word (lift), when the rear rod was lifted and

carried forward by two other gunners placed at y and z ; and thus the mea-

surement proceeded, the rods being alternately carried forward and their

extremities brought into contact as described, guided in range by the cord

and stakes, the cord itself being strained afresh when its end was nearly reached.

  A third assistant (William Mallet) kept account of the number of appli-

cations of the rods, or rods' lengths, as a check upon the counting of Downing

and myself. The rate of progress thus made was extremely rapid, nearly if
not quite as fast, when the men became accustomed to it, as common chain

measurement, and its accuracy seemed very great.

feet, there were only 38 permutations to reach a quarter of a mile. As soon

as the 38th rod was laid down and brought into contact it was "let lie," and

then from its rearward extremity, 25 feet was counted off" along the rod, and

a fine string was passed across the 25 foot-mark, at right angles to the rod,

reaching about 6 feet each way; a stake was driven temporarily in at each

end of this to fi.x the string ; the string loosed and the 35-foot rod removed,
and the string again replaced. The intersection of this string. A, B, with

the ranging cord, C, D, gave then the exact spot of the termination of the

first quarter-mile (see Diag. 3). Both the cords were now laid aside, and the

permanent 6-inch square oak terminal stake driven 4 feet to a level with the

sand. The ranging cord and transverse string were now replaced, and at

their point of intersection over the stake-head a brass composition nail was

driven into the oak, which marked the precise termination of the first quarter-

mile. The measurement then of the second quarter- mile proceeded in the

   This work was done on the 18th and 19th of July, 184-9. The only diffi-

S5-foot rods had to be carried over the water on stakes temporarily driven in,
the several parties operating wading in the water, and a possible error of
perhaps two inches may have occurred here ; but from the checking of
this operation over the rest of the line with the steel chain, and with the
same operation repeated over parts of the line with the rods, I believe the
whole mile to be measured correctly within an error of 4- or 5 inches at most.
The first half-mile, going from north to south, is almost perfectly level ; in

the next quarter-mile the surface of the sand descends with almost perfect
uniformity from about the level of high water to that of low water of ordi-
nary tides, say nearly 10 feet, and again as gradually rises up to the extre-
mity of the mile at the south. This arose from the base line being a chord

to the curved line of beach of the bay. As the measurement was made along
the surface of the sand all the way, except crossing Shanganagh River, an
allowance must be made for this dip and rise again.

    This, when calculated, gives a difference between the line measured along
the surface of the sand and the true straight line carried through from end
to end, of rather less than \\ inch.

    Subsequent remarks will show that this part of the base line became wholly
unimportant to the experiments.

    The preparation of the several instruments and materials, with some ine-
vitable delays, occupied the time between this and the 25th of October, ISiO,
when, all being complete and the powder, with the galvanic batteries for
firing deposited at the tower No. 9 and battery No. 7, a set of preliminary
experiments was made to ascertain what quantity of powder it would be ne-
cessary to explode in order to render the pulse perceptible by the seismoscope

at the distance of a mile.

    To this end twelve canisters of tin plate were made, each of which con-
tained two pounds of powder, with room for the priming powder and wires,

&c. These canisters were cylinders of about 8 inches long by 4- inches dia-
 meter, with an opening of 1^ inch diameter at each end, prepared with a neck I
to be closed by a bung-cork. The primings were made of M'ood; a copper

side ; a fine platina wire streched between and soldered to both ; the diameter
of the platina wire that answered best was found to be such that 2 inches of

it weighed 1*62 grain =0*01 4<75, or nearly ^^^th of an inch diameter, larger
wire requiring too much time and energy of battery to heat properly, and a
finer wire losing heat so rapidly by conduction as to be uncertain of firing
the powder.

    Taking the hint from this fact, it was found that the ignition was both
made certain and quickened by wrapping the wire round with gun-cotton,
whose bad conducting property and low temperature of ignition make it

valuable in the galvanic priming for common powder. This being done, the

Ahollow of the wood frame was filled with fine glazed rifle powder, well-dried,

and then a piece of fine thin paper was pasted round over all. This priming
cartridge being inserted through the apertures in the ends of the canisters,
the copper wires extending out at each end, a perforated bung-cork was
slipped over one wire and secured in the neck of the canister, which was then
filled up with Dartford blasting powder ; the other bung was then inserted.
The two wires outside, each about 5 feet long, were now wrapped round
spirally with calico dipped in lac varnish, to insulate them ; and finally, the
bung-corks at each end were dipped into or coated with resinous cement, so
as to make the whole canister water-light. The wires being then coiled
loosely up, they were complete.

   I was indebted to Mr. Bergin of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, for
the use of his powerful and convenient modification of Davison's galvanic
battery*, of which I had two troughs, consisting of six double cells each,
of cast iron and zinc elements.

   The cast-iron plates were immersed in strong commercial nitric acid mixed
with commercial sulphuric acid and placed in porous earthen troughs, and
opposed on each side by a zinc plate immersed outside the porous troughs in
commercial sulphuric acid diluted with water. The surface in action, when
this battery was in train, was for both sides of each cast-iron plate 168"75
square inches, and for the two opposed zinc surfaces S-t'SY square inches in

each element. It is unnecessary to enter into details here as to the very
convenient arrangements for uniting and disconnecting the plates.

   The igniting or deflagrating powers of this form of battery are enormous
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

with 12 cells in action, a solid copper wire of nearly a quarter of an inch in
diameter could be almost instantly soldered on to a shilling laid on one of the

binding screws of the opposite terminal plate. The exciting fluids, as actually

used, will be stated hereafter.

                                                                              Canister complete.

   It will now be convenient to describe the instrument which I had con-

structed for the purpose of rendering visible to the eye the very feeblest

impulses or shocks, when communicated from the shaken ground to the in-

strument.

   The original idea of this instrument, which I have named the Seismoscope,
and to whose sensibility much of the success of these experiments is due,
suggested itself to me from observing the facility with which the image of a
fixed star was obliterated when reflected from the surface of still water by
the slightest disturbance of the fluid ; and I at first proposed to observe through
a telescope the image of the flame of a candle reflected at an incident angle of
45░ from a trough of mercury, and take the moment of its disturbance from
the disappearance of the flame. On communicating this however to my friend
Dr. Robinson, Astronomer Royal, Armagh, who has throughout taken a
lively interest in these experiments, and to whom I am indebted for many
valuable suggestions and aid in the discussion of our results, he proposed
to substitute for the candle-flame the image of a pair of cross wires placed in
the focus of an achromatic object-glass, incident at 45░ on the mercury, and
received by another achromatic telescope at an equal angle, provided with
one or two crossed wires intersecting the image of the former, and to note the
total disappearance of the former at the moment of impulse.

   The importance of this improvement was evident, and the instrument was

constructed accordingly.

    The Seismoscope (PI. XIII. fig. 3) consists of a cast-iron base plate, a a,
of 20 inches in length and 8 inches in width, and ^ an inch in thickness ; on
the centre of the surface of which is placed a cast-iron rectangular trough, b,
of 12 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches in depth, accurately planed
and brought true in all its surfaces, and black varnished externally. At
either end of this trough a brass vertical sliding pillar is screwed in, one of
which carries a tube, c, provided with an achromatic object-glass at its lower
ON THE FACTS OF EARTHQUAKE PHiGNOMENA.  279

end, and a pair of cross wires at its focus. The other carries a small achro>
matic telescope, d, of the same aperture and provided with one vertical wire.
Both tube and telescope are jointed so as to admit of motion in the vertical
angle, and by means of the sliding pillars and screw-collars on them, can
either be rotated round the axis of the pillars or moved up and down parallel

therewith.

   When the cast-iron trough is filled to the depth of 1 inch with clean

mercury, and the perforated blackened tin cover, e, e, shown in dotted lines,
laid on it, which excludes all light except what can reach the surface of mer-
cury through the tube or telescope, and when the latter are placed in the
same plane, and at angles of 45░ to the surface of the mercury =90░ to each
other ; then, while the cast-iron base plate and trough are perfectly still, the
image of the cross wires of the tube are seen steadily reflected in the surface
of the mercurial mirror, and intersected by the vertical wire of the telescope
but the slightest movement communicated to the whole instrument, or to
any part of it, causes this image either to flicker or to disappear wholly for
the moment.

    In daylight the image is produced of course by the light of the sun ; but
as it was thought possible that these experiments would require to be con-
ducted during the silence and quiet of night, a lamp, k, sliding upon a move-
able iron rod, was added parallel rays, transmitted through a screen of oiled

                                                                                                                          ;

parchment from this lamp, were adapted to pass into the tube, c. This part
of the arrangement also was suggested by Dr. Robinson, but we never found

night observations requisite.

   As the movement or disappearance of the image is caused by the momen-
tary passage of a small wave across the face of the otherwise undisturbed
mercury, and as the front and rear slopes of this wave in their passage across
the field act as the surfaces of a mirror whose angles of inclination to the

line of collimation of the cross-wire tube are variable, so, the angles of inci-
dence and reflexion being always equal, any deviation produced is doubled
when seen in the axis of the collimating telescope.

   This telescope has a focal length of 740 inches. If F=this focal length,
V=the distance of distinct vision=(for R. Mallet) 12 inches, and M=the

magnifying power of the telescope, then

    Mx -- =the magnifying of an object seen in the apparatus,

                                    7-4 7-4

Hence the total power of the instrument to magnify any small disturbance

and make it apparent is 2x ll"39=i22*78, or nearly 23 times.

    Its actual sensibility is very great, such, that resting upon solid granite
rock, a blow of a light hammer on the rock can be perceived at 100 yards
 off; a stamp with the foot at 50 or 60 yards, and on compact sand or clay, a
 horse trotting can be observed at a quarter of a mile away. In towns the
 motion of the most solid buildings or of the ground is so continual that it
 is not possible anywhere to see the cross wires at all.

    As the transit of any elastic wave or pulse is rendered evident by this in-
 strument, in virtue of the production and transit of a small fluid wave through
 the mercury of the trough and along its surface (a small wave of translation),
 and as this wave is observed at the moment of its transit across the middle
 point of the trough, which is intersected by the optic axes of the two tele-
 scopes, and as the time occupifd by the raising and transmitting of this
--280 REPORT 1851.

mercurial wave requires to be known, in order that the one half of the time
of production aud transit may become a constant, which will enter into the
result of every observation made with the instrument, it was necessary rigidly

to determine this time.
   It was conceived, in the first instance, that as the length of the trough was

in direction with the line of transit of the elastic wave producing the dis-
turbance, the mercurial wave would be produced by the stroke of the end of
the trough against the mercury, and that the time of mercurial wave pro-
duction and transit might be obtained by providing another much longer
trough of precisely equal transverse section and equal depth of mercury, and
whose length should be a giveu multiple, say 10 times that of the trough of
the seismoscope. Then by producing a longitudinally traversing wave of
translation in this trough, by means of a wood plunger at one end, or of a
blow, and observing how many times in 60" this wave traversed the length
of the trough, the time of the wave in the seismoscope trough could be got

by the following formula :

     Let the length of the shorter canal or trough                       =1
     That of the longer a multiple of it                                 = w.

     The whole time of transit of the wave in the shorter trough, i. e.
                                                     =. T.
      the time both of production and transit

     The true time of transit only                                       ^ t-
                                                                         = t'.
     The whole time of transit in the longer trough

Then

      t'--T=(n-l)t,

and

                                                                          ,

Therefore, if R=the time of producing the wave,

                                 T-t=R.

   On trial, however, it was at once found that the effect of a blow, either on

any part of the seismoscope or upon any support thereof, in whatever direc-
tion, was to produce not a mere longitudinal wave only, but a combination of
waves emanating at the same moment from all sides of the trough, and again
receding towards them, and so coming to rest, that in fact all sides of the
trough vibrated and transmitted the vibration.

    After several other methods had been attempted, it was found that upon
placing the instrument upon a perfectly firm and immoveable base, such as
the solid rock, and on gently tapping the latter with a rod of iron or metal
while observing the cross wires, it was possible so to time the recurrence of
the blows, that a recurrent disturbance could be kept up, so as just to keep

the cross wires out of view.

   If the number of blows in a minute was reduced one or two beats, the
cross wires reappeared at certain determinate intervals; and if the number
of blows was increased, they remained invisible, except at certain intervals
(or beats), until the increased number became a multiple of that number
which completely kept them out of view.

   It was therefore obvious, that by ascertaining this number correctly by
repeated observations, thenumber of pulses, divided into the time=60", would
give twice the time of producing and transmitting the wave in the mercurial
trough, viz. the time of its production and advance, and recession and extinc-
tion, and that half this again would be the time of i transit sought.

   Accordingly a great number of such observations were made with the in-

strument resting on solid granite, the temperature of the mercury and instru-
ment being 64P Fahr. The following gives some of the results, being one

set of observations :

                                     231-

   From this it may be concluded that 230 beats per minute just keep the
cross wires out of view. The time of wave production and transit then is

half this, or          -- =-2firn''

                                     "fi^n" =0-13 of one second ;

                       230 X 2 460

but as the image of the cross wires is reflected from the centre of the trough
or from a point half way of its length or breadth, one half of the foregoing

is tlie constant of correction due to wave-transit of the seisraoscope, or

                       ^i^^=0-065" in time
                          2

and as this will, in every observation with the seismoscope, appear to delat/

the arrival of the earth-wave at the instrument, this time converted into di-

stance must be added to the rate of earth-wave transit otherwise obtained.

  We now return to the preliminary trials as to the charge of powder re-

quired for each mine in the sand.

Twelve of the two-pound tin plate cartridges, before described, and one of

Mr. Bergin's large batteries of six cells being prepared, (of which, however,

only two cells were found requisite to fire the powder,) on the 25th of

October 1849, the seismoscope was adjusted at the terminal north stake,

and a cartridge was buried 4 feet in the sand, at the distance of half a mile,

keeping it about 60 yards clear of the half-mile stake (to right or left), and

fired. The two pounds of powder exploded, but was unable to lift out any

sand at that depth, or to produce a shock sensible at the distance of half a

Amile.    second cartridge was buried 3 feet and fired ; it blew out a column

of sand, but no pulse was perceptible at the seismoscope, nor was any sound

Aheard there through the air.        third cartridge was then buried 3 feet at a

quarter of a mile distance from the seismoscope, but no pulse was perceptible

on several repetitions. At one furlong therefore from the instrument another

was buried 3 feet and fired ; this was found on repetition to be distinctly

perceptible by the seismoscope, causing the cross wires to disappear in the

most distinct manner.

  A rough approximation was thus made as to the quantity of powder re-

quired ; for as the intensity of the pulse will vary, with the same original im-
pulse, nearly as the square of the distance inversely, so it may be inferred,

that to produce equal pulses at variable distances, the original impulse must

vary in the same ratio ; and taking the impulse of fired powder to be directly

as its weight, if 2 lbs. produced a wave visible with the seismoscope, at ^th of

a mile it would require (8)^ x 2 to produce one equally visible at a mile, or

128 lbs.
--282 REPORT 1851.

   Hence the quantity of powder was found to be so large that I determined

to abandon my original intention of experimenting at a mile range, and to

limit myself to half a mile, and for this chose the best half of the range, viz.
the northern half mile, which was quite level and free from any error as to

measurement, being all to the north of Shanganah River.

   I also concluded that less than (4)^ X 2 lbs.=32 lbs. of powder would pro-
bably do, as the impulse given to the seismoscope by the 2 lbs. at a furlong
range was more powerful than requisite for distinct observations. Subse-

quent trial on the 29th of October, 1849, proved this to be correct, and that
25 lbs. of powder gave an impulse distinctly visible at half-mile range*.

   * It is of some importance to refer to the effects in concussion of the earth and air that
have been occasionally observed to result from the explosion of known quantities of powder
at determinate distances, because we thus get some measure (though a very inadequate one)
of the amount of explosive or elastic force that must be concerned in the production of
such concussive movements of the ground and of such subterranean noises, or sounds con-
veyed thence through the air, as have been actually noted by earthquake narrators.

   The slight shocks frequently observed at Dublin by Professor Lloyd, and only capable of
observation through the refined instruments of the magnetic observatory, as well as those so
long and so continuously experienced at places such as Comrie in Perthshire, East Haddam in
Connecticut, and Bale in Switzerland, are probably not due to true explosive efforts beneath,
but rather to successive fracturing of beds of rock under the slow and gradual process of
elevation or of depression, taking place either immediately beneath or perhaps at a considerable
distance away ; but our present experiments show how comparatively insignificant an explo-
sive origin may be sufficient to transmit an instrumentally appreciable shock to a considerable

distance.

   I have referred in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxi., to the undula-
tion of the ground, felt for several miles, when the large powder magazine was blown up in
Sir John Moore's retreat to Corunna. Sir Christopher Wren demolished the great centre
tower of old St. Paul's by a small mine of only 18 pounds weight of powder buried beneath
one of the angles. The explosion, he informs us, lifted bodily through some inches above
3000 tons of masonry, and " the fall of so great a weight from a height of 200 feet gave a
concussion to the ground that the inhabitants round about took for an earthquake."
JVren's Parentalia, pp. 283, 285.

   When the great chalk cliff at Seaford was thrown down by the explosion of nearly 26,000
lbs. of powder (Sept. 1850), it is stated, " The rumbling noise was probably not heard half a
mile off. Those who were in boats a little way out from the cliff state that they felt a slight
shock. It was much stronger on the top of the cliff persons standing there felt staggered

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

by the shaking of the ground, and one of the batteries (galvanic) was thrown down by it."
   " In Seaford, three quarters of a mile off, glasses upon the table were shaken, and one

chimney fell. At New Haven, a distance of three miles, the shock was sensibly felt ; about

300,000 tons of chalk was said to be an approximation to the weight moved." Times, Sept.
1850.

   When the late fatal explosion occurred at Hounslow Powder Mills, the following circum-

stances are narrated.

   " A correspondent at Brighton informs us that the late fatal explosion at Hounslow was

distinctly felt and heard at Sussex, a distance from Hounslow of between 50 and 60 -miles.
At Petworth, upwards of 40 miles off, three reports were distinctly heard, and a corre-
sponding number of shocks were felt, so that the inhabitants ran out of their houses,
imagining that they had felt shocks of an earthquake. Mr. Heslop, a teacher of languages,
while walking near the mansion of Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, at Hove, near Brighton, heard
a noise as of distant thunder, but as the sky was clear he imagined that he must have heard
a roar of artillerj'. It was then 25 minutes to 4 by his watch. Mr. Smith, a gardener and
nurseryman, at the north part of Brighton, also distinctly heard the noise. The most con-
clusive evidence, however, that the explosion was felt between 50 and 60 miles from the spot
is furnished by the following paragraph, copied from the Sussex Advertiser of Tuesday, a
paper which was printed and in town before the news of the explosion reached Lewes :
' Accounts have reached this office from several persons, living in different parts of Lewes, who
 depose to having experienced a slight shock, as if of an earthquake, at about 20 minutes to
 4 o'clock on Monday afternoon. There was no train passing through the tunnel at that
hour. Moreover, the shock was felt in parts of the town not affected by the passage of
trains. All the persons alluded to experienced the shock at the same period of time.' From
 various other places there are similar accounts, all agreeing as to time, but varying a little in

Nine casks of powder were fired in all ; and this may be as convenient a

place as any other to describe the arrangements made for their ignition, &c.

Each cask held 25 lbs. weight of best Dartford, highly-glazed, coarse-grained
commercial blasting powder, and was prepared for firing in the following way.
The head of each cask was taken out by knocking off the hoops at one end.

Two holes were bored through the head at 4 inches apart, each hole half an

inch in diameter. Priming cartridges were made as already described for

the tin plate cartridges, but with longer wires.

The ends of the two wires (which were brought parallel to each other at

a distance of 4 inches) were passed up throughh e holes in the loose head of

the cask, until the priming cartridge was a       Section of cask and priming.

of the powder was now replaced in the cask,

pouring it over the priming cartridge, the

two wires being held up vertically ; the head

of the cask was now replaced, coopered up

and hooped, the wires projecting through the

holes in the head ; two pine-wood conical

plugs were now driven hard one into each

hole in the head, beside the copper wire, so

as to confine each in its own hole and keep

all strain off the priming cartridge. The wires
outside the cask were now insulated with

calico and lac varnish as before and coiled

up, and the casks were ready for firing, save

that before each was buried, the hoops on

the lower end only were nicked nearly through

with a saw, and all removed but two, so that

description. Some heard a noise, others felt a shock, while still others both heard and felt

the effects of the explosion." Times.

   Very much of the effect in transferring the shock of the explosion of powder to a distance
depends upon the sort of fulcrum upon which the explosion immediately acts. Thus I found,
by a rough experiment made in Kingstown Harbour, that a single pound of powder, in a flat

tin canister lying on the sand bottom, within about 60 feet of one of the granite piers and
under about 35 feet in depth of sea-water, when exploded, actually shook the whole mass of
the pier, or at least of the inner breast wall, on the coping of which we stood, so as to convey
the idea at the moment that the whole was founded on a quagmire or peat bog. This re-
markable effect I consider was due to the complete resistance afforded by the solid mass of
water above the focus, so that the whole force of the explosion was expended in shaking the
less homogeneous mass of the bottom on which the pier is built.

   As to the distance to which the sound of explosion has been heard through the air, or
through it and the earth in combination, the greatest on record is that of the tremendous
eruption of Sumbava in April 1815, when the subten-aneous noises were heard at Sumatra,
970 geographical miles away, and at Ternate, 720 geographical miles off, in the opposite di-
rection nearly (Raffles's ' Java') ; next to which is that of the reverberations of the volcano at
St. Vincent's, which are said to have been heard at Deraerara, a distance of 345 miles.

   The noise of the cannonade at the battle of Jena, in 1806, was heard as a low murmur in
the fields about Dresden, 92 miles away. It is almost certain that in this case the sound
was transmitted through the earth, for it was heard with perfect distinctness in the case-
mates of the fortifications, where the vaults acted as acoustic instruments to collect the
sound from the. earth and convey it to the ear. It was stated at the time, but on what au-
thority I cannot now say, that the cannonade at the siege of the Citadel of Antwerp, in 1832,

it should blow outwards the staves at the bottom, and thus most effec-
tually act upon the superincumbent sand.

   The following section shows the dimensions and form (which was a beau-
tifully perfect paraboloid) of the holes blown out by each explosion in the
sand, after being again partially filled up by the subsequent falling shower of

sand.

   Each cask was sunk as nearly as possible 6 feet 6 inches below the original
surface, and about 1 foot deep of sand was heaped and rammed over the sur-
face, making a total depth over centre of explosion of 7 feet 6 inches.

   The next point of arrangement was to devise instrumental means for de-
termining with perfect precision, the minute intervals of time that would

--elapse, 1, between the moment of ignition of the gunpowder and its com-

plete explosion, or the time of " hang fire ;" 2, the interval of time between
the moment of ignition and the arrival at the seismoscope of the wave of im-
pulse produced by the explosion, the difference in time between these two
being the gross time of transit of the impulse through the given distance.

   The beautiful instrument devised by Professor Wheatstone, and called by
him the Chronograph, with some suitable additions and modifications, supplied
all we required in this respect.

   I had the advantage of Professor Wbeatstone's own suggestions and advice,
and a loan of one of his own instruments ; a second I had constructed, by one
whose subsequent loss science still deplores, the late Mr. Richard Sharp,
chronometer-maker in Dublin.

    As the construction of the chronograph has been fully described by its
inventor in the Transactions of the Royal Society, it is needless here to repeat
the details. It consists in fact of a small and finely-made clock deprived of
its pendulum, but provided with a suitable catch by which the action of the
weight upon it can be instantly arrested, or as immediately permitted to again
act in giving it motion. The running down of the weight causes the anchor
and pallets of the escapement rapidly to pass the teeth of the escapement-
wheel, so that the clock " runs down" by a succession of minute descents,

was heard in the Saxon mines, which are 370 miles away ; here the sound must also have tra-
velled through the earth.

    It would be desirable that those who have opportunity would extend our observations of
this sort as to the relations between known percussive or explosive efforts, and the transfer

 of their efforts to ascertained distauces through solid or fluid media, or tlirough air. See
 also some observations on this subject in former Report on Earthquakes, and compare with
the few records we as yet possess of the actual extent of movement of the earth's crust in
 eartliquake shocks, &c.
ON THE FACTS OF EARTHQUAKE PHiENOMENA.  285

each an accelerated one, and each equal to the preceding, and hence the
run down is practically an uniform motion of the clock. It follows, that in
proportion as the weight is a<ided to, the velocity with which the clock runs

down is increased, and hence by such additions the instrument may be made

a measurer of more and more minute fractions of time.

   Two dials and two hands register the revolutions, and parts of revolutions,
made by the instrument. One hand is fixed upon the axis of the escapement-

wheel (a, figs. 4, 5, 6, PI. XIII.), and its dial is divided into 30 smaller and
6 larger divisions. The pinion on this axis has one-twelfth the number of
teeth in the wheel {b) upon the weight barrel shaft, which carries the other

hand, and hence one division of its dial (which has twelve divisions) corre-

ponds to a whole revolution of the former dial.
    I devoted Prof. Wheatstone's instrument to determining the time of " hang

fire," and distinguished it as the Firing Chronograph ; Sharp's chronograph was
used for determining the time of wave transit, and became known as the Ob-

server's Chronograph.

    I now proceed to describe the peculiar additions made to these instruments

 for the purpose of starting and stopping their motions at the required instants ;
and first as to the Firing Chronograph. In PI. XIII. fig. 2. is shown a front
elevation of the whole instrument, a. The front of the clock and dials.
b. The weight composed of shot poured into a small brass bucket attached by

a silk string to the barrel and descending in the inside of the small clock
 case, the front door of which is removed in the figure, c c. The base of ma-
 hogany upon which the whole is secured. At the back of the instrument is

 a small lever, d, shown at full size in fig. 6, which is fixed on the arbor e,

 which carries also the lever ef.

    The large brass lever g (figs. 2 and 6) is maintained always, except while
 under pressure from the hand, by means of a stout spring h, in close contact

 at the end next the clock with the lever e d, and while so in contact, the

 lever e/is held down upon the anchor k of the escapement, so as to prevent
 any motion in the clock although wound up ; but as soon as the lever g is
 pressed down by the application of the hand on the end m, the small spring
 n pushes back the lever ef from the anchor k, and the clock begins to run

 down. The moment again that the hand is removed from m, the lever m g
 flies up, pushes back e d, and with it restores ef to its former position on

 the anchor k, and so instantly stops the clock.

     But besides this, it was necessary that the same motion of the hand that
 started the clock into motion, should " make contact" with two separate gal-

 vanic batteries, one of which should act upon the other chronograph, and the
 second fire the mine.

   mThe lever g is of brass; it carries an adjustable copper wire o, dipping

 at its lower extremity into a cup of mercury p, into which is also inserted the
 long wire/)*, which leads to one pole of the "firing battery"; r^ is the wire
 from the other pole dipping into the mercury cup r, which is connected by a
 fixed wire with another flat and shallow mercury cup s placed on the top of
 the wood pillar r s, and at such a level, that the hooked or turned down ex-
 tremity t of the lever g m, hangs just clear by a quarter of an inch above the
 surface of the mercury when the chronograph is at rest.

     The extremity of the lever at t is amalgamated, as are also all other con-
 nexions. It is now obvious that the instant the lever g in is depressed a
  quarter of an inch, by placing the hand upon it at m, contact is completed

 pthrough r^, r, s, t, m, o, and p*, and the mine or other charge fired.

     But for reasons hereafter to be described, contact required to be made at
  precisely the same instant with a second galvanic battery also; for this
286 REPORT-- 1851.

purpose a second brass lever v w, moving on the centre to, is provided, placed

mparallel to the other lever g, and as close behind it as possible without

Atouching, and on the same level, both on top.  mercury cup x, behind the

mlever g, is provided, to receive the hooked or hanging down outer end of

the lever to v, and the lever is kept up, except at the moment of and after de-

wpression, by the spring z. When therefore the lever v is pressed down,

contact is made between the poles of a second battery through y- conducting

wire, the mercury cup y, the fixed wire y x, the lever itself dipping its amal-
gamated extremity v into the cup x, while its other end is connected by the

mercury cup of brass and binding screw lo, with the conducting wire w'^.

As it was necessary tliat this contact, when made, should be for some time

wvmaintained, the latch z* catches the top edge of the lever     as soon as it

is depressed, and holds it down into the mercury until relieved, when the

spring z throws and holds it up again.

  m wThe backs or top edges of both levers, g and i', are covered with

grooved slips of baked mahogany, to prevent electric contact with the hand.

Both are pressed down with perfect ease, and in the most absolutely simul-

taneous manner, by a sharp stroke or pressure from the flat palm of the hand

pronated over them, and the instant the hand is removed, the clock already set

in motion is again stopped.

I now proceed to describe the construction of the Observer's Chronograph,

shown in Plate XIII. fig. 1. This chronograph required to be released or

set in motion by the depression of the lever lo v just described, and to be

stopped by the hand of the observer at the seismoscope on the instant that

the passage of the wave or impulse was seen in that instrument.

a is the clock and dial as before, h the weight in its case. At the back of

the clock is a little iron flat lever (fig. 5, c rf), on the same arbor with

yc e, which, as in the other case, presses on the anchor of the escapement,

and being constantly held upon it by the spring g, prevents any motion

until it is withdrawn.

   h (fig. 5 and fig. 1) is a round bar of iron 4tbs of an inch in diameter
and 8 inches long, placed horizontally and secured by an iron arm to the

clock case, so that one of its ends shall be within about yo^h of an inch of

the surface of the little lever c d.

Round this bar is coiled about 500 feet of insulated copper wire placed

between terminal discs of wood ; when a galvanic current is passed through
this coil, the bar h becomes a temporary magnet of considerable power, and

acting on the lever c d as its armatisre, forcibly pulls its moveable extremity

d towards the pole of the magnet, by which the lever c e is withdrawn from

the anchor^, and the chronograph is set in motion.

The wires w^ and y"^ in fig. 2 are supposed in continuation with those

similarly lettered in fig. 1 ; and thus when the contact before described is

wmade by pressing down the lever v, electric communication takes place

(through a mile or more of wire) through w"^, I, one end of the copper coil

k, the other extremity of it ; and y"^, the battery, being supposed somewhere

between.

This completes the arrangement for releasing or starting the Observer's

Chronograph. For stopping it, a spring / is placed just above the anchor,

in a convenient position to be kept under the point of the index finger of the

observer while engaged in looking into the seismoscope ; the instant he sees

the disappearance of the cross wires therein, a slight pressure on the spring

brings it into contact with the anchor and stops the qhronograph ; a binding

mscrew was provided above this, for the purpose of fixing the instrument

from all chance of motion until the dials were read off and noted: this was
ON THE FACTS OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA.  287

found however scarcely needful. Both the chronographs were screened
from wind by being used within the fir-wood cases in which they were
transported, the front sides of the cases being alone removed, or occasionally
by a canvas screen ; the weights of course descended in the closed maho-

gany clock cases of the instruments.
   From what has been stated as to the effect of changing the moving

weights of these instruments, it will be obvious that with any given weight
it becomes necessary to rate the instrument, or to ascertain to what interval
of actual time each revolution of the dials corresponds. This was done
by winding up each instrument a given number of revolutions of the weight
barrel, and having placed the instrument firmly before a good seconds' clock,
noting repeatedly in how many seconds and parts of seconds it ran down
the same number of revolutions ; the clock used had a loud beat and a gra-
duated arc to the pendulum, so as to enable a second to be divided by the

eye into four parts at least.

   The general arrangement at first contemplated was as follows :

^ C2  Diag.9.

          s

  AThe range of half a mile extending from to B, the powder was buried

at P, one extreme ; at the other was placed the seismoscope S and a chrono-

graph C^, so arranged, (see detail plate of apparatus) that on my releasing
wit, contact was made right through the whole line of both wires v" and

through the firing batteries at B, and through a magnetic coil attached to the

second chronograph at C (Sharp's), and so arranged that it released this
chronograph at the moment contact was made by me : the wires, each of 3

twisted galvanized iron wires severally of No. 13 wire-gauge, were soldered
together, and at first lying upon the sand, but afterwards insulated on wood-

stakes. According to this arrangement, when contact was made at C^ both
chronographs were released at once. The moment the explosion took place,

an assistant (William Mallet) stopped the chronograph C, placed within 150

yards or so of the charge ; and as soon as the wave reached me and was

seen in the seismoscope S, 1 stopped the second chronograph C'^ ; the first
chronograph C- showed the time of hang-fire, and the difference of these

chronographs the gross time of wave transit.

   On the 25th of October 1 84.9 this scheme was tried, the battery power being

12 cells of Bergin's battery, the surface in action of each plate being already

given. The cast iron in NOs-HSOg-^- HO, opposed to two zincs inSOg-f HO;

but it was found quite impossible either to release the chronograph C, or to
fire the powder at this range. It could not be done even when both wires

were completely insulated on wood stakes 4 or 5 feet high, driven into the

sand ; the battery wanted intensity.

   On consideration, it was determined wholly to alter this arrangement and

to fire from within a very short distance of the charge, and having two
batteries at this point, one (Bergin's) to fire the powder, and another (one of

Smee's with a large series of plates) to release by a magnetic coil the chro-
nograph at the seismoscope end at the moment that contact was made simul-

taneously through both batteries and the whole range of insulated wire, the
apparatus being such as to release the chronograph at the batteries to show

the hang fire also.
    Bergin's battery, as before, was used with 12 cells in action, the acids used

being for the cast iron porous cells equal volumes of commercial nitrous acid
and of commercial sulphuric acid and of water; and for the cells containing
the zinc, one volume of sulphuric acid of commerce and eight volumes of
water. Smee's battery consisted of 7 troughs in action, of silver and double
zincs, 6 series in each, each plate having an acting surface (one side) of 2^
inches wide x 3^ inches deep, or in all a series of 42 pair of plates acting in
SOg-i-HO, diluted in the ratio of 1 volume of acid to 20 volum.es of water.

   On preliminary trials with priming cartridges only, this entire arrangement

was found to act perfectly in all respects, firing the powder and releasing the

chronographs with ease and certainty.

   The following code of signals was fixed upon, as the length of the range

precluded communication by the voice. Three bannerols, blue, red and
white, being provided for each end, a signal man (Sergeant Maberly, R.A.
at the firing end, and a Gunner at the observing end), each with a look-out
man provided with a telescope, was stationed at either extreme. All signals
made were repeated in the same form to show that they had been observed
and understood.

  A man was stationed at half-distance to go to either end on being signalled.

These signals were found sufficient, and after a little practice to work well
but on the latter days of experiment I found it convenient to have a led saddle-
horse at hand to ride, if requisite, rapidly from end to end, to avoid the
fatigue of walking through the deep loose sand. These preliminaries, inclu-
ding the operations of measuring the base line, were attended with so much
labour and difficulty, everything having to be done on an exposed beach of
deep sand peculiarly oppressive for walking on, and liable to frequent interrup-
tion from broken weather, that although commenced in July, the latter part
of October had arrived before they were complete ; fortunately, this month
is ordinarily a peculiarly fine and steady one in Ireland, and that of 184<9
was more than usually serene and calm ; so that our experiments, when at
length fairly commenced, promised well for success.

    Everything being complete and the insulating stakes for the mile of con-
ducting wires driven on the night of the 29th of October 1849, the following
results were obtained on the 30th and 31st of October and on the 2nd of

water, as was also the case with experiments Nos. 3 and 4, made on the 31 St
of October, when the hour of high water was 10** 30" a.m.

   The sand in both these cases was thoroughly ivel along the base line, but

its interstices were notfilled with sea-water higher than within perhaps 8 feet

of the surface.

   The experiments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, the 2nd of November, when the time
of flood tidewas 1 1*^ 57TM A.M.,were,on the contrary,made nearly at high water,

and in these cases the sand was saturated to within 2 or 3 feet of the surface.

   Of the above eight experiments the only two upon which the least suspi-
cion of inaccuracy can rest, are those of No. 3 and No. 5, in which I am rather
doubtful of having stopped my chronograph with absolutely the same promp-

titude as in all the rest.

   The error in excess of time, if any, however, could not amount to 3 divisions
of the small dial=3 X0"-013914 in time, an amount so small and so much

within the probable errors of observation, that I retain all the experiments

as good results.
   Deducting column the third in the above table from column the second, we

get the following table No. 2, each column being previously brought separately

into time, recollecting that the value of one division is different in each chro-

And possibly a correction may arise from the time actually consumed in

the progress of the explosion of each mine ; for although an explosion conveys
popularly the notion of instantaneous or momentary action only, yet, as we
shall see, a very appreciable time is required to explode {i. e. consume) a

large mass of powder.

gency ; and having stated their results, I shall reserve the application of any
corrections until after the description of our further experiments made in the

    I now proceed to record the results of the experiments made as to this
ttTTie of hang fire, viz. the whole time from the moment of making contact
with the firing battery to that of the explosion, as seen by the person firing
experiments being made both by firing primings only, as figured and de-
scribed at page 277, and by primings and service charges of 25 lbs. of powder

together.

    The preceding table gives the results obtained by firing on each occasion
of experiment a certain number of priming cartridges only, just after the
service charges or mines, and hence with the batteries in as nearly as pos-
sible the same condition, and noting the time of burning of these by means

 of the chronograph.

   Dividing each sum by the number of experiments, we get the following

 averages :

    A. 2"'5554!l2 =0"'31 94-27= average time of hang fire service charges.
                     8

     C. 0"'362253_Q,,.Qg^>.5l =average difierences.

And deducting B from A, we find the average time for the explosion of 25 lbs.

of powder, as fired under our conditions, was

                                        0"-3 19427

                                       0""050513=time of explosion,

 which is a little more than -j-^odths, or about J^th of a second.
     I shall reserve such considerations as these experiments suggest until a

 subsequent period, when about to apply the several corrections to both
 classes of our experiments, and now proceed to describe the operations of

 the second series of

                               Experiments made in the Granite.

    The experiments in the sand at Killiney being completed, a position was
 looked for to conduct those proposed to be made in the granite rock. After
 examining various possible ranges about Killiney Hills, &c., the Island of
 Dalkey was chosen as upon the whole the best locality presented.

    This island is altogether of massive granite, very uniform in texture. The
 granite of which Killiney Hills and a large tract to the north-west, together
 with Dalkey Island, and seaward to the Mugglins Rocks, consist, is in mass

 of various tints of yellowish-white passing into grey. It is not quite so hard
 as Peterhead granite, sometimes found porphyritic, with large crystals of
 felspar, but more usually in a pretty equally difi'used mass of rather fine grain,
 consisting of crystals of quartz, felspar and mica, often to a considerable ex-
 tent replaced by schorl; solid masses present in working little "grain" or
 tendency to split more easily in one direction than another. It parts from
 the quarry usually in masses of an irregular trapezoidal form, averaging
 from 4? to 7 feet across ; but solid blocks are easily got of eight times this

 mass. It is much intersected with quartz veins of various successive epochs,
 usually thin and perfectly adherent to their walls. The commoner imbedded

--minerals are black schorl, garnet, killinite, spodumene, and more rarely

 apatite, beryl and fluorspar ; some few others are much rarer. Three spe-

--cimens of this granite of different size of grain had the following specific

gravities :

                                    2-676

Mean specific gravity =2*64-l.

     In its greatest length from north to south, the island admits of a tolerably-
level range of above 1600 feet. The general run of the beds, or rather fis-
sures of the granite (or master joints), is about N.W. and S,E., while the best
position presented for the experimental range is about N.N.W. and S.S.E,
thus giving as much solidity and freedom from the effects of discontinuity as
the case admitted of (see map, PI. XIV., and section, Plate XV.).

    The island is owned by Government, and under the control of the Board
of Ordnance, the grazing of the surface being rented from that Board.

   By application through the favour of General Sir John F. Burgoyne,
K.C.B., I obtained permission to make my experiments, subject to the ap-
proval of the local engineer officers at Dublin. The rentor of the grazing,

a farmer, was next to be dealt with, and his permission was only had by
paying him a sum of money and undertaking to make good all surface
damage.

   I then applied to the Board of Ordnance to permit me to purchase a suffi-
cient quantity of the best government cannon gunpowder, finding it stated by
Sir John Burgoyne, in his ' Treatise on Blasting,' that government powder

is stronger and better than the best merchant powder, in the ratio of about

13 : 9.

    Through the kind assistance of Sir John Burgoyne this permission was
given, and the powder obtained from the Ordnance magazine. Phoenix Park.

    I then roughly measured by the chain the best range I could lay out upon
the island. I found I could get one excellent range of 1166 feet, or the
choice of another and shorter one of 900 feet. In the former one, the end was
not visible from the other extreme; but a ruined old church on the island,
within about 4<00 feet of the firing end and visible from both extremities,
gave the means of elevating the batteries for firing, &c., and the signal man,
so as to answer as well as if the whole range were in view together.

   Arrangements were now made for getting the holes jumped in the granite
rock wherein to place the charges ; and in order to form some notion of the
quantity of powder that would be necessary to fire in each, a few preliminary
experiments were made with blasts fired in the ordinary way in the granite
of Glasthule Quarry, at Sandycove, near Kingstown Harbour, wrought by
the Commissioners of Public Works, with a view to determine the effects upon
the Seismoscope of various moderate charges. Three blasts were fired of
the following depths of hole and charges. The two smaller holes were 2
inches diameter, the largest 2^ inches diameter :

 6 feet depth of hole  6 lbs. powder,
 8 feet depth of hole  7 lbs. powder,
10 feet depth of hole  8 lbs. powder,

tamped with clay in the ordinary way and fired with Bickford's patent fuse.
   The Seismoscope was placed upon the solid granite rock, about 15 feet

above the level of the holes, and at an average distance from them of ] 50

measured yards. On the 3rd of August, 1850, they were fired.

   The wave of impulse through the granite produced in each of the explo-
sions was distinctly visible in the seismoscope, but those of the two latter
--296 REPORT 1851.

charges more so than the first. The interval in time between the explo-
sion and the disappearance of the cross wires of the Seismoscope was quite,

perceptible, notwithstanding the verj' short range, and gave the first indica-
tion of what experiment afterwards revealed as to the comparatively slow

rate in which the pulse-wave moves even in granite rock.

   These experiments led me to conclude that a single pound of powder

would have given more than suflScient shock to have been perceptible in the
Seismoscope at 300 feet range ; and as the charge for equal pulses may be
assumed (as before at Killiney) to vary as the square of the distance, then-

                    lib. : 300ft. : : X : 1500ft.,

or the charges should be as 5- : l-=25 : 1, or for 1500 feet range, 25 lbs.
of same sort of powder, as used at Glasthule, viz. from Ballincollig Mills.
This however might be reduced at Dalkey for the government powder, in

the ratio of 9 : 13, i.e. in the inverse ratio of their explosive powers, or the

sufficient charge would be 17'3 lbs.
   It was therefore determined to form the jumper-holes of a depth and size

suitable to receive a charge of 20 lbs. of powder, and 12 feet in depth was
fixed upon for each, with a diameter of cylinder of 3^ inches nearly, being
that made by a jumper of 3-inch gauge or width of edge.

   The next operation was to mark out the positions most suitable for the
several holes to be jumped. This was done, and contracts made through
Mr. Foot, foreman of works at Kingstown Harbour ; boring tools being lent

by the contractor for the harbour, Mr. M. B. Mullins, C.E., to whom I am '

indebted for this assistance.

   On the 30th of September, 1850, the jumper-holes were finished; they

were all nearly vertical, not many feet different in level from each other, and
situated as in the map of the northern end of the island (Plate XIV.) and

in section of range (Plate XV.).

  AThe datum stone remained a fixed point of solid rock to measure from,
Aand an ordinate, b, having been stretched out by a cord in the line of range,

the position of each hole was found and referred to it by measured abscissae ;
so that when, after the explosions, the whole surface of the rock constituting

that part of the island should have been shattered and destroyed, the distances
and positions at which the holes had been, should still be known.

   From the 1st to the 25th of September was occupied in landing instru-
ments and stores of various sorts upon the island, in which some difficulty
was found, owing to the period of the year, the stormy state of the weather,
and the powerful run of tide and heavy sea that sets through Dalkey Sound.

   The arrangements for firing and for noting the times were precisely simi-
lar to those used at Killiney Strand. Two distinct batteries, one of Bergin's
of 12 pair of plates, being used for firing, and 5 tioughs, or 30 pair of plates
of Smee's batterj', for releasing the chronograph at the observer's end. The
batteries were placed at the ruined church (see Map) upon a scaffold covered
by a temporary splinter proof, and placed nearly at the top of the old church

upon its walls, thus :

                                                                              Diag. 10.

The distance from the congeries of jumper-holes to the church was about
400 feet. On the 2nd of October, 1850, a preliminary experiment was made
as to the firing power upon priming cartridges, when it was found that the
intensity of 12 pairs of Bergin's battery (reduced by the low temperature of
ON THE FACTS OF EARTHQUAKE PH^ENOMENA.  297

this advanced season) was too feeble to fire at this distance, and accordingly
12 more pairs of plates were added, and the whole of the apparatus removed
from the church to a point a little to the westward and within about 250 feet

of the most remote hole (A in map, Plate XIV.), where it was found that

signals could be seen and repeated from the remoter end of the range by
taking advantage of some elevated points of rock. The whole of the scaf-
folding, which had cost so much labour and trouble, thus became useless,
and a new splinter proof had to be constructed from its materials.

   On the 3rd of October, these new arrangements having been completed, a

second preliminary experiment was made, when it was found that the priming

cartridges could be instantly and certainly fired with the increased power of

Bergin's battery, and that the Smee's battery also released the chronograph

at the remote end wall ; in a word, that all was perfect.
   The positions of the instruments were now precisely as already described

at Killiney Bay, except that all the firing batteries and apparatus were placed
upon a convenient table or platform about 2^ feet from the ground, formed
out of the abandoned scaffolding of the church.

   Both the conducting wires were supported on dry wood stakes, from which
they hung by loops of gutta percha through the entire distance. The position
for the chronograph at the observer's or seismoscope end having been fixed
upon, a flat table was cut down upon the face of the solid rock at nearly the
most elevated spot upon the island to form an efficient bed for the Seismo-

scope, the bottom plate of which was so let into the rock as to be firmly

grasped by it, as seen in PI. XV., lower figure.

   Four holes, 1^ in. diam. and 6 in. deep, were jumped in the rock round the

Seismoscope, and a canvas screen, stretched on upright inch-round iron

rods socketed into the holes, was erected to keep off all wind from the Seismo-
scope ; which was found of great service.

   The priming cartridges for firing the blasts had been prepared in a pecu-

liar manner, inserted in sticks of dry pine of 8 feet in length, in a groove

down one side of which the e+ wire passed, and up a similar groove at the
other the e-- wire passed, both imbedded in a cement composed of pitch
and wax. The priming powder was fine rifle-glazed gunpowder, the
copper wires yij^^th of an inch diameter (16 wire-gauge). The platina wire

was such that 2 inches weighed 1 '62 grain ; it was wrapped round with gun-
cotton, the powder poured round it ; one side of the recess or mortice, which
was cut quite through the wood, being closed by brown paper pasted on, and
the whole then closed by brown paper pasted over, and also over the whole
stick, which was then roughly varnished over witli pitch and wax, laid ou
hot so as to exclude moisture (see PI. XVI.). One side of each stick was
rounded to fit the curved side of the cylindrical jumper-hole, so as to admit
of the tamping being driven well home ; and the enlarged lower extremity was
cut wedge-shaped, so as to bind in the tamping when the blast should be

fired.

   The priming was so placed in each hole as to be a little below the centre
of the depth of the powder, which occupied about 6 feet in depth of each
hole, leaving about 6 feet for tamping. The tamping was dry yellow loamy
clay, the same as used at the Killiney quarries in the operations for getting
granite stone for Kingstown Harbour. The tamping was driven home after the
first few inches of clay over the powder with a round iron bar of about |ths of
an inch diameter, which was found to work most effectively, and the priming
sticks were not found to offer any obstruction to the perfect tamping of each
hole. The priming sticks themselves gave a most complete resistance to the
explosions for their own section of each hole, as their subsequent condition
proved, each stick, with but one exception, being pounded on end into ch?iff.
--298 REPORT 1851.

in which the priming-stick was launched to a surprising height in the air.
The final junctions between the batteries and the priming cartridge wires
were made by brass binding screws, leaving but one point of broken contact
to be made good, namely that at the firing chronograph.

    Previous to the two chronographs being brought out and landed on Dalkey
Island, they were both timed by the seconds' clock in Dublin as before.
The following is a record of these timings.

   The chronograph was wound and let run down a known number of com-
plete revolutions in each experiment, and the seconds and fractions in the
time taken to do so noted by reckoning the beats of the seconds' clock and
observing the place of the pendulum over the graduated arc at the moment

of completing the revolutions.

    Eight experiments were made in each case, in four of which the writer
started and stopped the chronograph and William Mallet observed the clock,
and in the other four he started and stopped and the writer observed the clock.
Then, averaging the whole, the personal error was got rid of in each case.

    The personal equations for both observers were also arrived at from these
experiments, but require repetition before a result applicable to the main

purpose of these experiments themselves can be had.

    The following table gives the results of the experiments for timing of
Wheatstone's chronograph, which was that used at the firing end of the range,
and Sharp's chronograph at the transit or observing end.

   The timing of Sharp's chronograph was now proceeded with, and as the
whole period to be measured (in the granite) was expected to be much
Bhorter than in the Killiney sand, and hence greater accuracy was needed,
some weight was added to make this chronograph run faster than on occasion

of the experiments there, on principles already explained.

   Everything being now prepared,'and a remarkably calm and fine day pre-
senting on the 3rd of October, 1850, the several workmen and gunners were
collected on the island, and the experiments actually commenced at about
10 o'clock A.M. were completed by 6 o'clock p.m., the accurate admeasurement
of the base line or range from the datum stone A, near the blasts, to the

observation station at seismoscopc, being left for a future day.

   Ten holes in all had been prepared for blasts, and five were charged and
tamped at once to avoid damping the powder by its remaining too long in the
holes. Each hole received from 18 to 20 lbs. of powder. They were fired
(the first five first, and then the last five) in the order or number of the expe-
riments in the following table. The letters attached in the second column
refer to the Map, and show the position of the blasts in the order in which
they were fired, it having been deemed expedient to fire in succession those
least likely to run into each other, and so, by the fractures produced, spoil

the eff'ect of the subsequent ones.
   There was one hole (G) a " wet one," i. e. a run of water into it ; but it

nevertheless fired well and gave a good result, having been stopped with clay
before charging. Only two of the holes " threw " much rock to any distance,
the whole force of the' charge being expended in all the others only in rend-
ing and shaking the rock. Not one gave a loud report ; nothing beyond a low,
hollow groan. In one case (D), a solid mass of rock, weighing by measure-

 --WhyIt will at once occur to the reader,

riments into two separate sets ? This requires explanation. If the medium

(granite) in which these or any similar experiments were made, were of

perfect homogeneity, the results of every separate experiment should closely

approximate within the limits of probable experimental error. The results

given in the preceding tables however are divisible at a glance into two

sets, each respectively very closely approximating ; viz. the sets A, C, D, E,

G KF, on the one part, and those of H, I and on the other ; while these re-

spectively differ, on the average, in the ratio of 4"3263 to 3*3847.

This result had been anticipated before the experiments were made.

The granite chosen for all the explosions was the most homogeneous that

could be commanded, still none of it was absolutely so ; nor probably does

a mass of rock exist upon the earth's surface that is homogeneous, i. e. free

from master joints, clefts and fissures, for a quarter of a mile in extent in

any direction ; and of the ten jumper-holes here employed, those from A

Gto inclusive were of necessity placed in granite of a more fissured or shat-

tered character than the three others, viz. H, I and K. These three last

ones, as may be seen by the Map, were driven into one vast boss (roche
moutonee) of granite absolutely free, so far as it was exposed to view from
immediate fractures, and from its appearance extending down to a great

depth into the very foundations of the island before reaching any great fis-

sures. Thus it follows that the transit rate ascertained (or the experiments

A Hto inclusive) belongs to an impulse wave transmitted through granite of

the ordinary degree of fissuring found in the great mass of European granites,

H Kwhile that of to belongs to the same rock in a more solid condition, and

approaching much more nearly to the transit rate that would be due to the

same granite, if for the whole length of range it constituted one unbroken,

Weperfect and homogeneous mass of rock.     will return to this when finally

discussing the results of our experiments, and now proceed to describe some

subsidiary experiments, the propriety of making which was suggested by the

results obtained in those devised as principal.

   The large difference in transit time between the wave in loose sand, as

found at Killiney, and that in granite, as found at Dalkey, viz. between

906 feet per second in round numbers, and 1 220 feet per second the average

minimum in granite, might seem suflScient to establish at once that the

pulses observed in each case in the Seismoscope must have been truly due

to vibrations propagated through the earth, and could not be due to any

commotions of the air above, produced by the report or concussion of the

powder. But Бis both these transit times do not differ enormously from the

admitted transit period of the ordinary sound-wave in air,it seemed desirable to

put beyond doubt any question as to this source of fallacy in the experiments.

It is to be borne in mind that at Killiney Bay the noise or report of the

explosions was in every case so deafened by the dead sand, as to be scarcely

heard at the seismoscope ; and that at Dalkey, although the reports were
more distinct, there was no explosion heard at the seismoscope louder than

that of two or three muskets at, say 100 yards off, and not nearly as sharp

or ringing; nor this but from two of the blasts, the others producing as

little report as any mine at Killiney Bay. Aerial commotion is therefore

at the outset improbable.

   To set the matter experimentally at rest, however, eight jumper-holes
--304 REPORT 1851.

were formed at Glasthule Quarry in granite, at the same place at which the
first preliminary trial blasts were fired, and the same station as then was again
chosen for the Seismoseope, being at a range or distance of 150 yards.

    Upon the top edge or lip of the mercurial trough of the seismoseope a
thick plate of glass was ground air-tight, and an exhausting syringe was so
attached that a pretty good vacuum could be formed between the level plate

of glass covering the mercurial trough and the mercury therein, and the
whole so arranged that disturbance of the mercurial surface caused the cross
\i ires to disappear as usual, when seen through the glass plate reflected from
the mercury.

   A wooden box of 3 feet square and 15 inches deep was also prepared, and

filled evenly and carefully with well " teased out " curled hair, such as is
used for stuffing cushions ; upon the top of which was placed a square flat
board of one inch thick, whose surface dimensions were an inch less each
way than those of the box inside. The box, when resting level on the rock,
was so adjusted that the seismoseope could be sustained in a level position
(floating as it were on the curled hair-spring mattress) on the centre of this

square board.

    These preparations having been made (the latter end of October), a very
calm day was chosen, and the jumper-holes having been charged with about
4 lbs. of powder each, the seismoseope was first placed upon the bare solid
granite, the plate of glass and the telescopes adjusted, and the air exhausted
from above the mercury. Then four of the blasts were fired in succession,
and the amount of disturbance of the cross wires noticed. The range was
too short to count the time of wave-transit by any method, and the shock
was sufficient to cause the cross wires to disappear completely more than once,

generally twice, at each explosion.

    The double disappearance is a very interesting fact. It is most probably
the transit of the normal, and then of the transversal wave, rendered visible to
the eye for the first time, and seems to indicate that by a sufficiently delicate
modification of the Seismoseope and chronographic apparatus the interval
in time between their consecutive arrivals might be ascertained, and thus
much insight gained to the so far obscure or unknown relations that subsist
in a vibrating mass between the mutual displacements and the elastic com-
pressions of its molecules, in virtue of which, even in homogeneous bodies,
the wave becomes one of two sheets.

    This being done, the box of curled hair was placed upon the solid granite,
the Seismoseope upon it, the plate of glass removed, and the whole adjusted,
the air havnig free access to the mercury. In this condition the other four
jumper-holes were fired, and the amount of disturbance of the cross wires
observed ; an attempt also was made to note the brief interval of time elapsing
between the flash or smoke (observed in the former and latter case by an
assistant and chronograph) and the disappearance of the cross wires, when
announced by the observer.

    In the former condition of the instrument, the mercury cut off" from any
direct contact with the atmosphere and resting on the solid rock, was in the
best possible position for being afl'ected by the wave through the earth, and
in the worst possible position for being moved by'the wave through the air
while in the latter condition it was, as far as possible, cut off" from any di-
rect contact or hold on the solid ground by the supporting cushion of curled
hair, and the mercury itself was freely exposed to the vibrations of the air,
while the whole instrument, resting upon a large flat, dry, deal sounding
board, was in the best position to be powerfully affected by pulses if commu*.
nicated through the atmosphere.
       ON THE FACTS OF EARTHQUAKE PH^ENOMENA.                      305

    The result of these experiments was, that

   1. No perceptible difference in time or transit period could be estimated

        between the flash or explosion and disappearance of the cross wires, in

         either condition of the instrument.

   2. The actual amount of motion of the mercury was perceptibly greater
        in the case where the seismoscope stood on the solid rock, with the air
        exhausted above the mercury.

   3. The cross wires were longer in coming again to rest in the second
        case, where the instrument stood on the curled hair-box and was freely

        exposed to air.

   Hence I conclude that in each case the whole effect was due to the stroke
conveyed through the earth, and none of it to that conveyed through the
air, which seemed too feeble to affect the instrument, though greatly louder
than at either Killiney or Dalkey.

    Lastly, to put at rest the possibility of the mercury in the Seismoscope
being disturbed by even a pretty loud and near atmospheric concussion, I
adjusted it on a surface perfectly at rest in the open air, and fired a rifle gun
(No. 14* bore of barrel) with about four drachms of powder for each charge
of blank cartridge, repeatedly at various distances and in various directions
with respect to the instrument, the report in each case being fully as loud

and sharp as that of a common musket. The results were, that up to within
SO feet or thereabouts of the instrument no disturbance was produced in the
image of the cross wires, when the rifle was held horizontally and loosely in
the hands, and pointed away from the instrument. At or within this distance,
if pointed towards the instrument and held to the shoulder, or still more if

held to the shoulder firmly and pointed vertically upwards, a very slight
disturbance could be noficed ; but beyond 30 or 40 feet radius round the
seismoscope the effects of the discharge were nil. As in each case these
explosions were enormously louder and more ringing than any one of those
heard either in the experiments at Killiney Bay or at Dalkey Island, I con-
clude it impossible that any movement or commotion of the air due to the
experimental explosions can have in any way interfered with or perplexed
our results.

   From the construction of our instruments and nature of the experiments

already recorded, it will have been remarked, that the degree of accuracy
attainable, independently of mere instrumental error, i. e. the probable ob-
servational error, depends upon the degree of consent between signal by the
eye and hand, as respects both observers, viz. the firing party and the ob-

--serving party the first of whom stopped his chronograph by hand on seeing

the explosion, while the latter stopped that instrument at the further end of the
range, by hand on seeing the disappearance of the cross wires of the Seismo-
scope. Some experiments therefore of a sufficiently like character, to deter-
mine the degree of accuracy to which this consenting action of eye and hand
existed, in both observers, and in what relation to each other, seem necessary.
These are as follow.

   In the first case one observer counted 30" by the clock, pronouncing the
word now at the beginning of the first and end of the last second, while the

other obserer started and stopped the chronograph, and then the two ob-

   These results seem to agree pretty well with the American ones as to
the degree of consent between eye and ear, or eye and hand, in observa-
tional experiments, which gave a probable error for the same observer of
about 0"01 of a second ; the mean of the error for both the preceding expe-
riments would be

                                                            0-0155

or nearly double the American error. But the error for observation'with

the chronographs, where stopped by hand on seeing the seismoscope wave,

would be less, probably not more than the American results on experiments

to ascertain difference of longitude by the electric telegraph ; and as two

observers were engaged at the same experiments, viz. William and myself
each at his own chronograph, the probable error of these experiments may

V^ V2be expressed by  x 0-0252, according to which mean time

error be taken.

  We are now in a position to apply the necessary corrections to the first

results ascertained for the transit periods both in the sand and in the granite.

The first correction (see ante), viz. for the time lost by the transit of the

galvanic current through the conducting wires used in our experiment, may

be neglected ; for assuming Wheatstone's coefficient of 288,000 miles in 1"

as its velocity, the total time in the first series is only gss^ooo ^^b ^^ ^ second,
and in the second only about one-half of this, both being portions of time

far within the limits of possible observation or of instrumentad error.

   The details which have preceded as to the experimental determinations of
the probable observational errors, show that any corrections for personal
equation are also here a needless refinement. The personal errors indeed
were of such a character as to tend to their mutual extermination.

   The only correction then to be made resolves itself into that for the time
lost in the production and transmission (through half the length of the mer-
eurial trough of the instrument) of the wave in the seismoscope.

   Referring to page 281 we found that the time lost in forming and trans-
mitting this wave of the seismoscope, amounted to 0"-065 ; this appears
to delay the arrival of the earth-wave or elastic pulse through the me-
dium under experiment in its arrival at the instrument. Hence the cor-
rection is to convert this time into distance, and add it to the first result
given by experiment.

  We found that the gross rate of wave-transit in the sand was

906-705 feet per second.

Converting 0"-065 in time into distance, at this rate we have

and we thus get the final result,

  We have now experimentally ascertained, with considerable accuracy, the

rate at which an elastic wave of impulse is transmitted through two distinct
media, sand and granite, which, as being perhaps the worst and the best for
the rapid transmission of such movements to be met with in extensive
masses on the surface of the earth, may be viewed as those in which the limits
of wave motions, analogous to those of earthquake waves, are to be found.

   The results are as unexpected as remarkable. In the original memoir upon
this subject, published in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol.
xxi. part 1, on the hypothesis that earthquake waves were true waves of

elastic compression, I ventured to conclude that their transit rates in various
solid and homogeneous media would be found to be proportionate to the

square roots of their moduli of elasticity. What the transit rate might be in

discontinuous or interrupted media, I could not venture even to guess. It
was not without surprise, however, that I found it in sand reduced so low
as under 966 feet per second; and this was again increased, when it proved

in granite not to exceed a maximum of 1662 feet per second ; the former
falling below the rate of ordinary sound in air about as much as the latter
rises above it. Had I been asked beforehand what velocity I expected to
find in solid granite, I should have replied, possibly 8000 feet per second, or
more ; but the extremely low velocity previously found in the sand had in
some degree prepared me to expect one of lower value in the granite, and
on careful review of the whole research I am disposed to consider the results
given as true answers to questions truly put to nature. Whence then this

apparent discrepancy between hypothesis and experiment? I believe the ex-

planation is twofold.

   No such thing as an absolutely solid and homogeneous rock formation exists
anywhere on the earth's surface. Whatever may be the rate of wave-transit

in any one solid block or mass of rock, the transit rate through the whole
depends not only upon the density and elasticity of the minerals, but upon
the extent and degree to which its mass is broken and fissured, and upon
the nature and direction of these fissures. If the fissures be but fractures
M'ith closely abutting surfaces, and these surfaces, chiefly either in planes

perpendicular to, or in the direction of the wave's transit, they will produce

the least degree of retardation in the velocity of the wave, and have the least
effect in the extinction of its volume ; but when such fissures are either alter-
nations of bedding filled in with thick or thin layers of material, heterogene-
ous to the mass of the formation of invaded rock, or shatterings in various
planes at many and uncertain angles of direction to that of the wave's mo-
tion, and with surfaces loosely approximating, or even altogether out of con-
tact, then the effect, of loss of vis viva, at every such alternation of medium,

in retarding the velocity of the wave, and by innumerable reflexions and

alterations in direction, dispersing its volume, will be enormous.

   In some instances, where the angle at which the new medium meets the
line of transit of the emergent wave is suitable, reflexion (as in the case of
ON THK FACTS OF EARTHQUAKE PHiENOMENA.  309

light) will no doubt be total, and thus an earthquake shock may emerge from
the surface at a point totally different from that indicated by its original path.

   An analogous phaenomenon of continued reflexion seems to be the pro-

bable solution of the frequently-observed case of shocks felt in mines at cer-
tain depths, and yet not at the surface or still deeper in the mine. Thus, if
o, b constitute a couche of formation of a certain elasticity and density, lying

upon another of very different and perhaps much lower elasticity, and with
a third different formation superimposed, a wave transmitted at a certain
angle in the direction of the arrow from a, may be reflected downwards and
upwards alternately until extinguished, and while scarcely or not at all
perceptible in the beds above or below, may produce a powerful shock
throughout the intermediate beds Ф, h. The Saxon and South American

mines afford frequent record of this phaenomenon.

   But to return. To these causes I ascribe the great deficiency in velocity
which we have ascertained, below that due to the probable moduli of the
materials. In the lower limit, the sand, which may be viewed as only the

extreme case of a rock formation shattered and broken up indefinitely, the

velocity due to its material would theoretically be the high one due to the

highly elastic quartz of which its particles mainly consist ; but the extreme
want of continuity occurring at every fraction of an inch through which the
path of the wave lies and the imperfect juxtaposition of the particles, neu-
tralize all this ; and the low conducting power of sand for impulse (elastic
waves) is matter of even popular knowledge : thus we find sand-bags for this
reason employed to form the breastworks of batteries, as the best material to
absorb and neutralize the stroke of cannon-shot.

   The retarding effects of heterogeneity of medium have been well shown by
the results of Mr. Goldingham's elaborate experiments at Madras upon the
rate of sound in dry and in damp air, from which he concluded that sound
in common air suffered a retardation of I'^Ofoot per second for each degree

of his hygrometer, due to the admixture of moisture. If water in the state of
intimate suspension, in which it exists invisibly dissolved in air, has such an

effect, how much more might we look for it in sand mixed with air and water 1
    It would be premature and useless in the as yet imperfect state, both ex-

perimental and theoretic, of what we may hereafter call Stereo-acoustics,

or knowledge of the nature of sound in solids, to affirm that these are all

the conditions that may modify the transit rate of waves in such media, or
that if we had presented to our experiments extended formations of mineral
matter, absolutely homogeneous and unbroken, we then should find the
transit rate of longitudinal propagation of the wave such as theory has
hitherto predicted it, or that it would be the same as the transit rate of/ree
vibration in the same medium. On the contrary, there is reason already to
believe that hereafter it may prove to be otherwise.

  We may recall the experiments made long since by M. Biot, upon the

transit rate of sound in the cast iron water-pipes of Paris. He announced as

his result that sound in cast iron travels longitudinally with a velocity 10-5
--310 REPORT 1851.

times that in air ; but the velocity that would be deduced from the ittean
modulus of elasticity of cast iron gives 12'2 times that in air.

   Much more recently MM. Wertheim and Breguet have made some most

interesting experiments upon the rate of sound in malleable iron, namely,
in the wires of the electric telegraph on the Versailles Railway, with a range
of no less than 4050 metres. The method of experiment is remarkable for
its simplicity and accuracy. It consisted in placing an observer and assistant
at either end of the range, provided each with a chronometer, both of which
were accurately rated together, and also with a delicate stop-watch, by which
time could be noted to ygth of a second. At a predetermined moment the
observer struck a sharp blow of a hammer on the wire at one end ; the as-
sistant at the other noted the moment of arrival of the sound. This process
was repeated back from the other end, and so on. Thus the personal errors,
and those of the chronometers, became eliminated, and the length of range

practically doubled.
    Their results are, that sound travelled linearly in the wrought iron wire at

the rate of only 3485 metres=11433"936 feet per second.
    They then stretched two metres of the wire as a musical chord, and by

Chladni's method determined the velocity of transversal vibration to be 4634
inetres= 15233*721 feet per second. Hence the experimental velocity of the
sound-wave propagated longitudinally is much less than that of free or trans-
versal vibration, and still less than that deducible from the mean modulus of
wrought iron. The latter, however, would be abundantly uncertain in appli-

cation, as the state of annealing of the wires, or their density, &c., are not
given. (Comp. Rend. t. xxxii. p. 293.)

    Should this indicate a general fact, as seems highly probable, then we have
a theoretic cause, whose action coincides with that of want of homogeneity,

in producing retardation of the elastic waves of our experiments.

    In applying our results to any speculation as to the actual velocity of earth-
quake waves, the effects of the direction and depth from which they are prd*
pagated from the origin must be held in view.

   As we descend deeper in every rocky formation of the earth's crust, we
may expect to find the material not only denser (greater sp. gr.), but less

and less shattered ; and hence the velocity of the earth-wave will be greater

in the same formation in proportion as its path lies deeper. When an emergent

earth-wave reaches the surface, then its actual velocity, if transmitted from

a great depth and at no very large angle from the vertical, may be very much

greater than would be due to the surface rock ; for theory at present does
not admit of our determining how far into a second medium of lower elasti-
city the wave transmitted from another more elastic medium will penetrate
the former with a velocity due to the first medium, or in what way and to what
extent the velocity of the wave will be affected with reference to the distance
traversed beyond the junction of the media ; still less will theory yet enable
us to predict the effects of gradual change of elastic coefficient of the medium
through which the wave passes.

    Again, if we assume the formation homogeneous in depth, and vibration
propagated linearly in all directions alike from a centre of impulse; owing
to the compression of the mass from the effects of gravitation thus acting at
great depths, it is possible that the rate of wave transit may vary at different
levels as some function of the depth, bearing an analogy to the case of a liquid
confined in a tube, which Wertheim finds to transmit sound at a different rate
(its transversal vibrations being confined) from a boundless mass of the same
liquid. (Comp. Rend. t. xxviii. p. 151.)

    The discussion of many earthquake narratives in the progress of the cata-
ON THE PACTS OP EARTHQUAKE PHiENOMENA.  311

logue of the present Report, indicates that as a fact, earth-waves transmitted
nearly vertically and hence probably from great depths, are most remarkable
for the intense violence and velocity of the shock. Humboldt's account oi:
the great earthquake at Riobamba (see preceding Report, and Humboldt's

Personal Narrative), may be especially noticed in confirmation, where the
velocity was stated to be such as to project the bodies of men and animals
many feet into the air.

    For this reason I have deemed it worth while to prepare a diagram,
in which, taking the extreme horizontal or surface limits within which
some of the greatest earthquakes on record have been observed to extend,
and assuming that the emergent wave at each of those limits had no deeper
origin than would be found by the chord of a great circle connecting
them, which is certainly below the truth, I have endeavoured to show the
depth within the earth's crust at which the origin might lie, equal in each

case to the versed sine of the arc cut off. On this supposition the depth
of origin of many of the great earthquakes may not have been very great

.(though it is likely in most of these cases the wave was an acutely emergent
one over the whole area shaken) ; but in some others the depth of origin,
even upon our most disadvantageous data, must have been very great ; while
in one extremely curious, though unfortunately doubtful case, there is some
ground for believing that one and the same shock of earthquake was felt on
Nov. 16, 1827, at places nearly antipodal, viz. at Ochotsk and at Columbia,
in South America ; and, if so, had its origin not very remote from the centre

of the earth.
    Coincident earthquakes in time at very distant places on the earth's sur-

face have been by no means rare, as at Iceland and Norway, Poland and
Constantinople, &c. (See Catalogue.)

   The preceding remarks as to the different velocity of the normal, and the
transversal wave in elastic solids, suggest future inquiries of great interest
and importance in relation to the so- often recorded double shock of earth-

quake. In frequently shaken regions popular belief attests the fact, that very
soon after each shock another of less intensity and of a somewhat different
character follows it, with however a very perceptible interval between, and
which is fancied to be greater in proportion as the first shock is more powerful.

    Admitting a sufficiently distant origin, the laws of normal and transversal
vibration, as interpreted by Poisson wpon his hypothesis, would be suffi-
cient to account for the perception of a double blow ; the probability of its
arising truly from the successive emergence, first of the normal and then of

the transversal wave, due to the one originating impulse, is rendered much

greater on taking into consideration the facts above noticed, as ascertained
by Wertheim and Breguet.

    Another source of double shock is highly probable, but remains to be as-
certained by further researches. In the more perfectly laminated and bedded
slates, it is likely that both the normal and transversal waves will be divided,
each into a pair having new paths of motion, each separating into what we
may denominate the ordinary and the extraordinary, normal and transversal
waves ; the peculiar molecular arrangement of such rocks producing effects
analogous to those of the ordinary and extraordinary rays of light in double

refracting crystals.

    Amongst the vast mass of recorded earthquakes that form the succeeding
catalogue, it is to be regretted that not half-a-dozen out of nearly as many
thousands, give any data by which the time of superficial transit of the shock
in passing from one spot on the earth's surface to another could be ascertained.
In a very few instances howeyer sufficient data have been collected to ascer-
312 REPORT 1851.

tain this in a rudely approximate way, and subject also to this additional

source of error and uncertainty, that having no observation of the angle of

emergence of the wave of shock at the place of observation (and indeed very

seldom any apparent surface direction even given), and the apparent direction

of shock being almost always very far from identical with its real direction,

it becomes impossible to make the requisite trigonometrical allowance for the

change, from apparent to true direction, in modifying the observed velocity,

or rather the velocity as calculated, on the assumption that the wave travei'sed

a great circle of the earth's surface between the two points at which the times

of its transit had been observed ; still it is of value to compare such rude
approximations as we can yet command with the results we have already

experimentally obtained. 1 proceed to do so.

In the Lisbon earthquake of 1761, the shock was recorded at the following

times and places :

At Corunna, felt at noon.

At Cork, felt at 121^ 15"" p.m.

At Santa Cruz, Barbary, at noon.

As all these places are nearly in the same longitude, the clocks require no

correction for true time. The distances then are

The greatest of these transit rates occurs in a range under the Bay of

Biscay, consisting probably to a great extent of hard consistent slates or other

still more elastic rocks.

M. Peri'ey, in his Memoir on Earthquakes in the Antilles (Mem. Acad, de

Dijon, 1845-46, p. 367), in recording the well-known shocks of Pointe a Pitre

in Guadaloupe, of February 8, 1843, says, и' M. Itier is of opinion that the

shock in a direction from N.W. to S.E. took thirteen minutes to travel from

Guadaloupe to Cayenne in South America. This distance is nearly 14░=840

=geographical 973 statute miles, which is at the rate of 74*84 statute miles

per minute."

M. Perrey attaches the greatest possible doubt to the correctness of M.

Itier's records and observations in this matter. The superficial material

forming the intermediate range is probably principally of soft diluvial or

detrital material ; but if the shock were transferred laterally, as is probable, at

a great depth, and was felt transversal to its principal line of transit at

Cayenne, it is likely to have had its range in very hard and elastic rock,

though of what precise character there is no information.

The two following East Indian earthquakes are of much interest in refer-

ence to the point before us. The skeleton map of India (PI. XVII.) I have

prepared by reduction from Allen's great map, and approximately divided its

surface into coloured geological divisions, having reference, not so much to

recognised geological formations, as to the classification of formations to-

gether under one tint, that possess something like a general equality of pro-

bable transmissive power for earthquake-waves, so that the whole surface

has been massed under six divisions, viz.--1 , crystalline, schistose, or granitoid

 rocks, coloured blue ; 2, older stratified and carboniferous rocks, coloured
/dark gray ; 3, secondary rocks, from carboniferous to cretaceous inclusive,
 coloured green ; 4, the tertiary formations, coloured yellow ; 5, allu vial plains,
 detritus, &c., coloured brown; and 6, igneous rocks, modern porphyries,
 diorites, &c., coloured red. The data have been principally derived from
 Johnston's ' Physical Atlas,' and no attempt at exact definition of boundary
 has been attempted, the object in view being to give some notion of the
 class of formations through which the ranges of the shocks now about being

 mentioned lay.
    The places at which the shocks were felt and recorded are marked along

 with some of the greater physical features of the country, and the observed
 directions of the shocks are marked by arrows.

    The first Indian earthquake referred to is that of June 16, 1819, the
night on which Cutch was wholly destroyed, the Run of Cutch submerged,
 and the great Ullah Bund (a vast elevated bank of sand and slob) thrown
 up ; there were two great shocks, which were felt more or less almost over

 all Central India.

    On the same night, with the same interval of two minutes between them,

 two slight shocks were felt at Calcutta upon the opposite side of that great
 continent, where they were suflftcient to cause suspended lamps, &c. to vibrate.
 These, there can be no rational doubt, were due to the same original impulse
 that produced such devastation at Cutch more than 1000 miles off".

    They were observed at Calcutta at half- past eight o'clock, which is 90
 minutes later than the great shocks were noted at Cutch. The distance on
 a great circle is about 1200 statute miles, which reduced gives a transit rate

 of only 13*33 miles per minute (Roy. As. Journ. vol. ix. p. 70).

   A considerable distance at both extremities of this long range consists of

 loose diluvial material of the lowest possible transit coefficient, but a large

 portion of the central tract traversed appears to consist of formations pos-

 sessing a much higher elasticity.
    On the 26th of August, 1 834, the great earthquake of Nepaul occurred,

 which convulsed the whole of that region, and was felt throughout the Pun-

jaub and over a large part of central India. No important information has

 been obtained as to its phaenomena nearer to its probable origin, which appears
 to have been somewhere in Thibet or Lassa, to the north and east of the
 Himalayan chain. The Journ. Roy. As. Soc. vol. xiii. p. 158, contains a
 summary of the events as experienced in Nepaul, where it seems to have been
 very formidable. The direction there generally appeared to be from N.E.
 to S.W.

     The principal shocks were at 6 o'clock p.m.; half-past 6 o'clock; half-past
 1 1 o'clock ; and 55 minutes past noon, all Calcutta time ; and vibrations were
 almost continuous the whole day (24' hours) of the 26th of August, 1834 ; in
 1829 such vibrations continued for 40 days or more.

     Dr. Campbell, at Katmandu, says, " The shock at 6 o'clock lasted about
 40 seconds ; its sound was like that of heavy ordnance passing over a draw-
 bridge rapidly." " I felt that it was travelling with the speed of lightning

 towards the west and just under my feet;" "trees waved to the roots as it

 passed." Dr. C. was at the time at his house on the hills, about a mile away
  from Katmandu, the capital of Nepaul ; and at the coming on of the third
 shock, the murmured prayers of the vast multitude in the city reached his
 ear with a terrible sublimity like the voice of many waters; above 100
 houses were levelled there in a moment. All the shocks seemed to come
  from the E. and N.E.

     Places to the east of Katmandu suflTered still more; at Bhatgaun 1000
--314 REPORT 1851.

houses were levelled and 300 people killed, with 500 persons more in the
valley. " At Monghyr, Rungpur, MozufFerpur, Mallai, all in the direct line
of influence, many houses have been destroyed."

   At Calcutta three shocks were felt. Hanging lamps were moved, but no
damage was done. At Agra the shocks were rapid and strong, lasting a few
seconds each. At Lucknow four shocks were perceived ; " the tremulous
motion was like that of a steam vessel " (probably meaning that tremulous

motion sometimes produced by the draft of the steam-boiler fires), the beams

creaked and cornices fell down.

   At Tyrhut the movement was from E. to W. ; water in a tank 4- feet deep,

whose surface was 3 feet below the edge or brim of the tank, was thrown

out.

   At Purneah the shock was the severest ever felt there ; houses were thrown
down, birds flew frightened from their roosts, sleeping horses were wakened

and rose in alarm, an astronomical clock was stopped ; and from observa-
tions on it and some other circumstances, it was concluded that the shock
thei'e came from the south, and travelled east (a very singular and sudden

change of purpose if it were so).
   At Buxar the direction was apparently from N. to S ; it is added, " the

motion  seemed  a  good  deal  bounded  by  the  Ganges,  as  at   Koruntadhee                                                  just
                                                                                                                             ;

opposite to Buxar much less motion was felt than on the right bank of the

river." At Monghyr seven distinct shocks were felt between 5 and half-past

8 o'clock A.M. of the 27th of August, and there had been more than 25 felt

during the night.

   At Patna, at 30 minutes past eleven p.m. of the 26th of August, a great

shock was felt from east to west, and another at midnight ; eighteen shocks

were counted by some observers.

All the country about Bankipoor, Dinapore, Diggah, &c. was shaken.

   These rather incoherent accounts must serve to give some general notion
of the power and extent of this earthquake. The precise moment of the oc-

currence of the second shock was noted at Calcutta by its stopping an astro-

nomical clock. The moment of shock at several other distant places was also

noted and the observed time corrected, for Calcutta time, as referred to this

particular clock.

The following is a list of those places and the times of shock corrected for

longitude :

   From the extremely conflicting or imperfect accounts given, as to the di-
rections in which the shocks were observed, and hence the uncertainty as to
what places may be taken as extremes of each range, I am only able from
the above list to select four cases in which we can arrive at any conclusion

worthy of reliance as to the approximate rate of transit of this shock.

These are

  =Rungpur to Arrah, 290 statute miles, in 1 1 minutes 26-363 miles per

minute.

  =Monghyr to Gorackpur, 200 statute miles in 5 minutes 40 miles per

minute : this was in granite a part of the way.

  =Rungpur to Monghyr, 180 miles in 16 minutes 11-25 statute miles per

minute.

  =Rungpur to Calcutta, 220 miles in 16 minutes 13-75 statute miles per

minute : this was chiefly in low alluvial deposits.
   The last instance I shall at present advert to is that of two ships at sea,

both of which experienced a shock within half-an-hour ; it has been pointed

out to me by my respected friend Dr. Robinson as noticed in the Nautical
Magazine for March 1851, p. 165. Lieut. Maurj^ of the National Obser-

vatory at Washington, in noticing the existence of a submarine volcano, .as
observed by Captain Ballard of the ship Rambler, from Calcutta, on the 30th
of October, in lat. 16░ 30' N., long. 54░ 30' W., and Captain Potter of the
barque Millwood, last from Rio, half-an-hour later on the same day, when
in lat. 23░ 30' N. and long. 58░ 0' W., remarks, " These vessels M-ere about
520 miles apart ; supposing them in the direct line in which the earthquake
was travelling, its rate will appear to be about 1 mile in 5 seconds, which is
only a little slower than sound (at the rate of 1 mile in 4-6 seconds) travels

through air."

   It is possible there may have been two shocks, and that each ship's com-
pany felt a separate one ; but this is very improbable ; for as the ships were
only 520 miles apart, had there been, each vessel could scarcely have escaped
being sensible of two shocks ; assuming then it to have been a single earth-
quake, the rate is 520 miles in 30 minutes, or only 17-3 miles per minute.

In this case it is probable that the shock traversed (^quam prox.) horizontally
beds of loose material of vast depth at the bottom of the sea, and that the shock
thence was conveyed transversely upwards through the water to the ships.

    In the following Table I have placed together the results of all the pre-
ceding data as to the approximate rates of earthquake waves from obser-

vation. The value of this at present is simply that it affords strong pre-

sumptive confirmation of the correctness of the results of the preceding ex-

periments, and that both make it almost certain that the actual rate of transit
of earthquake-waves, when hereafter there shall be the means of their perfect
observation, as occurring in nature, will be found very much slower indeed

than I myself and others anticipated on theoretic grounds, based on the elastic
moduli of the rocky crust, considered as everywhere an unbroken elastic solid.
 But as giving yet awhile correct ideas of the actual rates, the following

 Table must be received as but most rudely approximate.

    With the exception of the Guadaloupe earthquake, upon which much

 doubt rests, the greatest rate of transit in the foregoing Table falls greatly
below what would have been anticipated, on the assumption of the wave

 passing through perfectly solid elastic bodies, while the general character of

 the rates coordinate pretty well with the limits experimentally given in the
 preceding pages.

   It seems highly probable that future instrumental determinations of the
rates of natural earthquake-waves will show that

   1. In cases where the line of movement of the wave is not far from vertical,
occurring in hard crystalline and very solid rock of one sort, and having an
origin at a considerable depth, the rate of wave transit will approximate nearly
to that of a normal wave due to the modulus of the formation, the rate of the
wave being also probably affected by the limits of the mass in which it moves.

   2. That in every superficial rock formation, as being all more or less
shattered and none homogeneous, and in any given extensive range several
different formations intervening, the rate of transit will be found probably
seldom or never to approach the preceding velocity.

   3. While in discontinuous media, such as sand, gravel, diluvial clays, mud,
&c., the rate of transit will be the slowest of all, although for reasons given
in the former Report, the destructive effects of the wave in such materials may
be greater than in any other.

   It follows, from the conclusions that we have so far arrived at, that while

experiments in the closet to ascertain the moduli of elasticity of various rocks

or other mineral masses cannot but be of great interest and value to

science, they will be of less direct importance to seismology than was at

first anticipated, and that no determinations of the transit rate of earthquake

--waves can be made in a trustworthy manner, except 1st, by multiplying ex-

periments in various rocks or discontinuous formations of different degrees

of heterogeneity and homogeneity, by the method described in the preceding

MM.pages, by that of  Wertheim and Breguet, which is applicable in some

instances with great advantage and convenience, or by some other which may

be devised ; and 2nd, by actual instrumental determinations of the rate of

earthquake-waves as they occur in nature : this can only be done by self-re-

gistering instruments such as that at present attempted to be constructed.

It is scarcely necessary further to revert to the deep interest that attaches

to such researches, affording, as they do, the most direct and likely means of

acquiring some information as to the

1. Depth below the surface of the great seats of volcanic action, and their

identity or not, in position and nature, with the great forces of elevation.

2. Depth of the solid crust of the earth.

3. Nature of the great oceanic beds.

To the following gentlemen my especial thanks are due for aid rendered

to me and to my son William, who assisted throughout in these experiments.

To Sir John F. Burgoyne, K.C.B., the Master- General, and the respective

Officers of Ordnance ; to Dr. Robinson, for the kindest interest and encou-

ragement and much valuable suggestion and information ; to Professor

Wheatstone, for the use of his chronograph and communication of his expe-

rience as to the best modes of bringing it into use ; to the Directors of the

Dublin and Kingstown Railway, for the use of the telegraph wires at Dalkey

and their officer Mr. Bergin, for the loan of his galvanic batteries ; to Pro-

fessor Downing, for aid in the admeasurement of the first base line ; and to

Barry D. Gibbons, Esq., C.E. and M. B. Mullins, Esq., Contractor of Kings-

town Harbour, for assistance in the operations upon the granite ; with others,

whose assistance, if less defined, was highly important.

  I now proceed to the EARTHQUAKE CATALOGUE, and the re-

sults obtained by its discussion.

                        Of the Construction of the Catalogue.

   Former partial catalogues, more especially those of Von Hoff, Cotte,
Hoffman, Merian, and Perrey, have formed the basis of the present, as I be-
lieve first attempt, to complete a catalogue that shall embrace all recorded
earthquakes. By the first and last of the preceding authors our labours have
been most lightened. In Von Hoff's Catalogue (Gesch. d. Verand. &c. vol. iii.)
a total break occurs from the year 1806 to 1820 inclusive, and it ends with 1832.
M. Perrey's numerous and valuable local catalogues are scattered through va-

rious foreign journals ; he has latterly produced and still continues to publish
a current annual catalogue, for which he is anxious to receive contributions
from observers of intelligence situated in all parts of the world, addressed to
him at Dijon. Besides the above and some minor catalogues, our work has
been compiled from multitudes of scattered sources, collected in foreign and in

British libraries, the accessions from which have at least amounted to as much

as from all prior catalogues.

   Notwithstanding much labour and time, it is not for a moment to be as-
sumed that the present catalogue is complete, that it embraces all known
records of earthquakes ; such a work would probably be impracticable ; in
--318 REPORT 1851.

any case it would involve the associated labour of several persons for many
years to produce. But the number of instances now catalogued is so large,
and the mode of collection and arrangement such, that I believe science
would derive no very material or proportionate advantage from the bestowal
of much more time and labour to increase it.

    The hase of induction now produced embraces between 5000 and 6000
separate eai'thquakes, and as this is the main use of an extended catalogue,
if that number be deemed sufficient, the object is answered, although some or
even many recorded earthquakes within our period had remained unadded to
the list. That some might be so added I doubt not. It is possible that many

trustworthy records of these events exist in Russia, as respects the north-west
of North America and Northern Asia. In Central and Northern India such

may also be found ; while there is little doubt that in the ancient libraries of

the Levantine monasteries, and in those of Spain and Portugal, a rich mine
of such information remains yet unexplored, to which we had no access.
For other portions of the inhabited earth's surface, records are almost or
altogether wanting. Of these the most important and interesting are, Mada-
gascar, and the interior, indeed the whole, of Africa including Abyssinia,
except its northern coast and the Cape of Good Hope, Greenland and La-
brador, Northern and Eastern Asia, Northern Australia, and the Pacific

Islands generally.

   The constructors of former catalogues have usually been at no pains to
make any systematic arrangement of their materials ; each is a mere chronicle

of events, in partial sequence of date, but otherwise mixed with such disre-
gard of order or relative importance, that reference to any special class of

phaenomena, except by exhausting it from the mass by reading it all through,
was impossible.

   The succeeding catalogue aims at a tabular arrangement, in which the
more important elements of earthquake facts are placed in separate columns
for each instance, and thus reference facilitated. The catalogue is divided

into six columns, embracing

1. The date and time, as nearly as recorded.
2. The locality or place of occurrence.

3. The direction, duration, and number of shocks in each case, so far as

these are recorded.

4.  Phaenomena connected with the sea great sea or other waves, tides, &c.
                                                                                                                                                               ;

5. Phenomena belonging to the land ; meteorological phaenomena pre-

ceding and succeeding, and all secondary phaenomena. This embraces all

those minor although occasionally important facts, that are mixed in earth-
quake narratives with the principal facts, which we might call the " elements

of the earthquake," as here comprised in our first three columns.

6. The authority for the record.

   Many of the dates in the earliest periods of the catalogue and up to about

A.D. 1000, are extremely doubtful ; on collating separate authorities for the

same earthquake, even at much later periods, and in cases of occurrences
the most remarkable, and one would suppose well known, the discrepancies

that are found are marvellous.
   The dates of the eighteenth century have not been attempted to be altered

to new or old style, but in each case, as far as possible, the style (old or new)
as mentioned by the original author is given ; very many of the dates are
given however by narrators of this period without any intimation of whether
they refer to old or new style.

   The time of day is not often given in a reliable form. In times and cquq-.
ON THE FACTS OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA.  319

tries under the Romish church it is often given in such vague form as " at
vespers," " after the morning mass," &c.

   The locality is the recorded place of occurrence, but it is obvious that in
most cases many other places were also more or less entitled to be recorded
as shaken; the place set down however has been, in the vast majority of in-

stances, either the most violently affected, or one of them; and, at least in the

absence of better information, must be viewed, unless otherwise stated, as

about the centre of disturbance.

   The direction, duration, and number of shocks, are seldom given ; the
scanty records of those most important elements best show how much we
must expect yet from future observations aided by instruments. Duration

also is often given in the middle ages in a strange and loose form, as in such
phrases as " during one Credo," or " while saying the Ave."

   In recording the phaenomena belonging to the sea and to the land deemed
worthy of notice, it may be remarked

    Effects (secondary phaenomena) are only given, either as measures of the

violence of the shock, or as presenting some fact likely to be of importance

in earthquake dynamics.

    All phaenomena recorded as ha,\ing possible/ been due to earthquakes, of
which there are many, even in the catalogues of Von Hoff and Perrey, such
as landslips, abnormal tides, &c., are omitted, unless there exist some good
reason (such as an earthquake occurring at the same or nearly the time in some

other part of the world) to suppose a real connection with seismic causes.

And in selecting the phaenomena recorded, choice has been made of those of

most scientific importance, rather than those most curious to the mere general

reader.

   Wherever opportunity was had of consulting the original author or authors,

it has been endeavoured not to mention subsequently as an authority any
mere copyist from such original. It is to be regretted that in some other

catalogues this has not been attended to, and hence an event often appears
to be supported by a number of independent authorities, that, upon research,

all resolve themselves into copiers from one amongst them. Where there
are various accounts of the same event by different authors, attention has
been directed in choosing amongst them ; first of all, to the proximity of the
recorder both in time and in place, to the event, taking also into account the
general standard of authority or credibility of his works, as far as known
to us, and also the number of independent concurrent testimonies to the
event in more important cases. Where, as is often the case in older records,
the same historian is quoted indifferently under two or more names, one
name or title has been adhered to invariably. For example, Abulfaradsch
and Bar Hebraeus are two names for the same historian used indifferentlv by
Von Hoff.

   Some of the very early authors, such as Julius Obsequens, and many of

those about the decline of the eastern empire, appear, at least as regards our
subject, of very doubtful authority, and it is scarcely necessary to say that

the same remark may apply to many records of Chinese and Japanese earth-
quakes. The records multiply in number and increase in accuracy and au-
thority as we pass down the stream of time ; and within the last 200 years is

embraced a mass of earthquake incident, probably from these causes, equal
in scientific value to the whole of the preceding parts of the catalogue.

    The influence of commerce and navigation in modern times upon obser-
vational science, and of the disenthralment of mankind, in Europe at least,
from much of the superstition and tyranny of the middle ages, could scarceljr

 be more strikingly shown than by the curves produced from the discussion
 of the present catalogue referred to hereafter.

    Where the volume and page of an author are not quoted, the event will
 be found in its chronological order in the note referred to.

    Where access to the original work has been impossible, and we have
merely quoted from some other compiler or narrator, we are only responsible
for having accurately transcribed ; our experience seems to show that other

transcribers have usually been very accurate.
    In the characteristic expressions used in the fourth and fifth columns, and

transcribed from other authors, they must be taken with reference to degree,
as only giving the author's own opinion of the fact, whatever it may be, and
such expressions are often extremely difficult, either to attach a true value
to or compare together. Thus such phrases as " violent," " very violent,"

depend much for their import upon where and by whom they were used.
An earthquake described as " very violent" by an inhabitant of Norway or

of Great Britain, might seem but a very slight and insignificant affair to a
dweller at Lima or Quito, though both were equally discreet and trustworthy

observers.

    There has been also experienced much difficulty in some cases of long-

continued vibratory jars at a given locality, such as those of Bale, East

Haddam and Comrie, &c., in deciding whether one such epoch was to be re-

cognised as one earthquake, or as more than one.
   Any further observations however will be best reserved for the conclusion

of the catalogue, when referring to the discussion by curves of the distribution
of earthquakes in time, and by the large map of their distribution in space.

Letter from Professor Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian InstitU'
    tion at Washington, to Colonel Sabine, General Secretary of the

    British Association, on the System of Meteorological Observations
   proposed to be established in the United States.

                                                                                                       Smithsonian Institution,
                                                                                        Washington, March 22, 1851.

 --Dear Sir, The meteorological system in the process of being established

in the United States, is intended to embrace as far as possible the whole area
of the North American continent, including the Isthmus of Central America,
the West India Islands, Bermuda, and Newfoundland.

    It is to consist of three classes of observers :
   I. Those without instruments, to record

          1. The changes in the aspect of the sky.
          2. The direction and approximate force of the wind and the time of

                       its changes.

          3. The beginning and ending of rain, snow, &c.
          4. The appearance of the Aurora Borealis.
          5. The time and direction of approach, and other phsenomena of

                       thunder-storms.

          6. The registration of phaenomena relative to plants and animals,
                     such as the first appearance of leaves and of flowers in plants ;
                     the dates of appearance and disappearance of migratory or hy-
                    bernating animals, as Mammalia, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, Insects,
                    &c. ; the times of nesting of Birds, of moulting, and littering of
ON PROPOSED AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 321

            Mammalia, of utterance of characteristic cries among Reptiles
            and Insects, and anything else which may be deemed note-

            worthy.

II. To record, in addition to the foregoing, the changes of atmospheric

temperature as indicated by a standard thermometer.
    III. This class to be furnished with a full set of instruments for recording

all the changes deemed important in the study of meteorology, exclusive of

magnetism.

To carry on this system, the Institution has received, or expects to receive,

cooperation from the following resources :

   1. From the small appropriation made by Congress to be expended under

the direction of this Institution and the Navy department conjointly.
   2. From the appropriations made by different States of the Union.

3. From the observations made under the direction of the Medical depart-

ment of the U.S. Army.
   4. From observations made by institutions and individuals on different parts

of the Continent, who report immediately to the Smithsonian Institution.
   5. From officers of Her Britannic Majesty's Service in different parts of

the British Possessions in North America.

The following is an account of what has been actually accomplished, ex-

tracted from the last Report of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to

Congress.

  A" small appropriation has been made by Congress for two years past, to

be expended under the direction of the Navy department, for meteorological

purposes, and Professor Espy, engaged under the Act authorizing this appro-

priation, has been directed to cooperate with the Institution in the promotion

of the common object. Besides the aid which we have received from the know-

ledge of Professor Espy on this subject, the general system has been benefited

from that source by the use of instruments purchased by the surplus of the

appropriatioji, after paying the salary of Professor Espy, and other expenses.
   " During the last year Mr. Espy has been engaged in a series of interesting

and valuable experiments on the change of temperature, produced by a

sudden change in the density of the air. The results which he has obtained

are interesting to science in general, and directly applicable to meteorology.
   " These experiments were all made in one of the rooms of the Smithsoniaa

Institution, and with articles of apparatus belonging to the collection which

constituted the liberal donation of Dr. Hare of Philadelphia. An account of

these experiments will be given to the Secretary of the Navy in Mr. Espy's

report.

   " It was mentioned in the last report, that the regents of the University of

the State of New York in 1849, made a liberal appropriation of funds for

the reorganization of the meteorological system of observations established

in 1825, and that Dr. T. Romeyn Beck, and the Hon. Gideon Hawley, to
whom the enterprise was entrusted, had adopted the instruments prepared

under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution. Another appropriation

has been made for 1850, and the system has been carried during the last

year into successful operation by Professor Guyot, late of Neufchatel in

Switzerland. This gentleman, who has established a wide reputation as a

meteorological observer by his labours in his own country, was recommended
to Dr. Beck and Mr. Hawley by this Institution, and employed by them to

superintend the fitting up'of the instruments, to instruct the observers in the
minute details of their duty, and to determine the topographical character,

and elevation above the sea, of each station.

" The whole number of stations which have been established in the State

of New York is thirty-eighl, including those which have been furnished with

instruments by the Smithsonian Institution, and the Adirondac station by
the liberality of Archibald M'Intyre Esq. of Albany. This number gives
one station to 1270 square miles, or about one in each square of about 35y
miles on a side. These stations are at very different heights from the level
of the sea, up to 2000 feet. They were selected in conference with Dr. Beck,
Professor Guyot, and myself. The State is naturally divided into the follow-
ing topographical regions, namely :

     " 1. Southern, or maritime region.
    " 2. Eastern, or region of the Highlands, and Catskill mountains, with the

valleys of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers.
    " 3. The northern, or region of the Adirondac mountains, isolated by the

deep valleys of the Mohawk, Lake Charaplain, St. Lawrence, and Lake

Ontario.

    " 4. The western, or region of the western plateau, with the small lakes,

and sources of the rivers.
    " 5. The regions of the great Lakes Erie and Ontario.

   We" regret to state tliat no efficient steps have as yet been taken to organize

the system of Massachusetts, for which an appropriation was made by the
legislature at its last session. I have lately written to Governor Briggs
urging immediate action, and offering on the part of the Institution to render
any assistance in our power towards furthering so laudable an enterprise.

No answer has yet been received *.

    " The observations made at the different military stations, under the direc-
tion of the Medical department of the U.S. Army, have been partially re-
organized, and a number of new stations, and several of the old ones,
furnished with the improved instruments made under the direction of this

institution.

    " The head of the Medical department of the Army, Dr. Lawson, has
 assigned the general direction of the system of observations to Dr. Morrer

of New York, to whom we are indebted for the valuable aid which this ex-

 tended set of observations will furnish the general system. The immediate
 superintendence of the reduction of these observations is in charge of Dr.
 A. S. Wotherspoon, U.S.A., to whose zeal and scientific abilities the cause
 of meteorology bids fair to be much indebted.

    " The most important service the Smithsonian Institution has rendered to
 meteorology during the past year, has been the general introduction into
 the country of a more accurate set of instruments at a reasonable price. It
 has been enabled to effect this through the aid of Professor Guyot. The set
 consists of a barometer, thermometer, hygrometer, wind-vane, and siiow and

 rain-gauge.

    " The barometer is made by James Green, No. 422 Broadway, New York,

 under the direction of the Institution. It has a glass cistern, with an ad-
 justable bottom enclosed in a brass cylinder. The barometer tube is also
 enclosed in a brass cylinder which carries the Vernier ; the whole is suspended
 freely from a ring at the top, so as to adjust itself to the vertical position.
 The bulb of the attached thermometer is inclosed in a brass envelope, com-
 municating with the interior of the brass tube, so as to be in the same condition
 with the mercury, and to indicate truly its temperature. Each instrument made
 accordingto this pattern is numbered and accurately compared with a standard.
 In the comparisons made by Professor Guyot, a standard Fortin barometer,

     * Since the above was иwritten, a communication has been received from the Governor of
 Massachusetts, placing tlie organization of its system of meteorology under the direction of
 the Smithsonian Institution.
ON PROPOSED AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 323

made by Ernst of Paris, was used, and also a standard English barometer by
Newman of London, belonging to this Institution. These instruments, for

greater certainty, have been compared with the standard of Cambridge

Observatory, and of Columbia College, both by Newman, and with the

standard of the observatory of Toronto, Canada West. The results of these

examinations prove the barometers made by Mr. Green, according to the

plan adopted by the Smithsonian Institution, to be trustworthy instruments.

The thermometers are by the same maker, and those intended for the State

of New York were compared with a standard by Bunten of Paris, and

another by Troughton and Simms of London. Those found to differ more

than a given quantity from the standard were rejected.

" The instruments for detecting the variation of the hygrometrical condition

of the atmosphere consists of two thermometers of the same dimensions ac-

curately graduated. The bulb of one of these is enveloped in a covering of

muslin and moistened with water, and that of the other is naked.

" The rain and snow-gauges, and also the wind-vanes, are made under the

direction of this Institution by Messrs. Benj. Pike and Son, 166 Broadway,

New York. The rain-gauge is an inverted cone of sheet zinc, of which the

area of the base is exactly 100 square inches. This cone or funnel ter-

minates in a tube which carries the water into a receiving vessel until the

end of the rain. The water which has fallen is measured by pouring it into

Aa cylinder so graduated as to indicate hundredths of inches of rain.

smaller cylinder is also provided which gives the thousandths of inches of

rain, and may serve in case of accident as a substitute for the larger cylinder.

The rain-gauge is placed in a cask sunk in the earth with its mouth near the

level of the ground.

" The-snow gauge is a cylinder of zinc of the same diameter as the mouth

of the rain-gauge. The measurement is made by pressing it mouth down-

ward to the bottom of the snow where it has fallen on a level surface, and then

carefully inverting it, retaining the snow by passing under it a thin plate of

metal. The snow is afterwards melted, and the water produced is measured

in one of the glass graduated cylinders of the rain-gauge.
   " The wind- vane is a thin sheet of metal (it might be of wood) about three

feet long, carefully balanced by a ball of lead, and supported on the top of a

long wooden rod, which descends along the wall of the building to the sill of

the window of the observer. It terminates in the centre of a fixed dial plate,

and indicates in its movements the direction of the wind by a pointer at-

tached to the rod.

" The observer is by this arrangement enabled to determine the course of

the wind by looking down on the dial plate through the glass of the window,

without exposing himself to the storm.

   " Besides the full sets of instruments furnished by the State of New York

from the appropriation of the Regents of the University, the Smithsonian In-

stitution has furnished a number of sets to important stations ; and in order

that the instruments may be more widely disseminated, have directed Mr.

Green to dispose of sets to individuals at a reduced price, on condition that

they will give copies of the results of their observations ; the remainder of

Atheir cost being paid by this Institution.  number of persons have availed

themselves of this privilege.

   " To accompany the instruments, and for the use of those who take part in

the Smithsonian system of meteorological observations, a series of minute

directions, prepared by Professor Guyot, has been printed by us, occupying

forty octavo pages, with woodcut representations of the instruments. This

is accompanied by two lithographic engravings to illustrate the different

forms of clouds and to facilitate their notation on the journal, in accordance

with the nomenclature adopted by meteorologists.
   "The following collection of tables, to be used in reducing the observations,

has been prepared by Professor Guyot at the expense of the Institution :

Thermometrical Tables.

Barometrical             ,,
Hygrometrical            ,,

Hypsometrical ,,

" Besides these it is proposed to furnish a set of tables for determining

Weheights by means of the barometer.         may also mention, in connexion

with this subject, that a series of preliminary experiments have been made in

the laboratory of this Institution for the purpose of constructing from direct

observation a scale of boiling temperatures corresponding to different degrees

of rarefaction of the air. With a thermometer, each degree of which occu-

pies one inch in length of the scale, the variations of the boiling corresponding

to a slight change in altitude are found to be more perceptible than those of

Avariations in altitude of the barometrical column.  series of experiments

has also been made for testing the performance of the aneroid barometer

under extremes of atmospheric pressure. The instrument, however, has not

been found from these experiments very reliable, though it may serve as a

baryscope or an indicator of atmospheric changes. It will by no means

serve for the determination of atmospheric pressure, particularly when sub-

jected to ranges of considerable magnitude.

" For the better comprehension of the relative position of the several places

of observation now embraced in our system of meteorology, an outline map

of North America has been constructed by Dr. Foreman. This map is in-

tended also to be used for presenting the successive phases of the sky over

the whole country as far as reported to us at different epochs, and we have

been waiting for its completion by the engraver to commence a series of

investigations with the materials now on hand relative to the progress of

storms.

  A" valuable collection of returns relative to the aurora has been received

in accordance with the special instructions which we have issued for the
observation of this interesting phasnoraenon. These are to be placed in the

hands of Capt. Lefroy of the Toronto Observatory, and incorporated with
observations of a similar kind which he has collected in the British Posses-
sions of North America. Abstracts of the whole series will be presented

by Capt. Lefroy, to be published in the Smithsonian ' Contributions to

Knowledge.'

   " The whole number of observers on which we may now depend, including

those of all classes, is about 200 ; these are, however, very irregularly distri-

buted over the face of the country. By far the greater number are in New

WeYork and New England.  hope, however, to be enabled to enlist a

number of other States, and to carry out the plan more efficiently in behalf

of the Institution as soon as our income will warrant a larger expenditure of

means for this purpose.
   " The number of stations must be left to yourself*, and their distribution

had best be determined by consultation with Capt. Lefroy. I would, how-

zation prior to the beginning of 1853.

Report on the Kew Magnetograplis. By Colonel Sabine, R.A.

At the request of the Council Colonel Sabine gave a brief account of the
experimental trial now making at the Kew Observatory of Mr. Ronalds's

Instruments for the self-registry of the Variations of Terrestrial Magnet-

ism by means of Photography.

The general principle of these instruments and tlieir mechanical details

have been already described at former Meetings, and have been printed in

the Reports of the Association. But until instruments have been tested by

actual performance, no certain opinion of their fitness for the purposes for

which  they were designed  can  be confidently pronounced                                                                                                                 and  the  super-
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

intending Committee at Kew have for some time past felt a rather anxious

desire, that the preparation of these instruments should reach the stage at

which a fair practical trial might be made of their efficiency, as a means of

recording the magnetic phecnomena in any part of the world where science

might require that they should be known. Before this could be done how-

--ever, before a correct estimate could be formed of the degree in which

they might be useful, either as auxiliaries, or as superseding the method of

observation previously in use, it was necessary that three instruments should

be provided, one for the variations of the declination, and two for those of

the horizontal and vertical components of the force. From the limited funds

which the British Association has had it in its power to appropriate to the

furtherance of the objects of the Kew Observatory, it had been just barely

possible to complete two of the three instruments between the years 1846

and 1850, and the third must yet have been waited for, had not a resource

presented itself in the Government grant in 1850 placed at the disposal of

the President and Council of the Royal Society, to be applied in aiding the

Aprogress of the experimental sciences.  portion of this grant was obtained,

and the three instruments being at length by its aid completed, Mr. Ronalds,

with the sanction of the superintending Committee, proposed to the Council

of the Royal Society that the instruments should be subjected to an experi-

mental trial by being worked precisely as in an observatory, for a period of

six months (that period being considered as likely to be sufficient for a due

appreciation of their merits or deficiencies in reference to the present re-

quirements of magnetical science); and that every item of expense incurred

in carrying on the self-registry for that period should be carefully noted and

stated. This proposition having been approved by the Council of the Royal

Society, a grant of Б100, for the purpose of carrying it into execution, was
made to Mr. Ronalds from the donation fund, the property of the Royal
Society. The six months' trial commenced in April last, and a full account

of its results will be presented to the Royal Society ; meantime the Council
of the British Association have deemed that a brief account of the nature
of the trial might not be unacceptable to its members.
--326 REPORT 1851.

    The magnetic variations are recorded by Mr. Ronalds's instruments either
on silvered plates or on prepared paper. The silvered plates are supposed
to have the advantages of greater sensibility to the impressions of light, and

 pf requiring in consequence a less time of exposure to the light, so that

movements of a more rapid character or of more transient duration may be

--recorded by them ; and also of producing more sharply defined traces, and

 of being free from the defects occasioned by the inequalities of surface to which
 paper is subject, and by those caused by the stretching and shrinking of
 paper when moistened and when dry. The paper, on the other hand, is sup-
 posed to have an advantage in the circumstance that the actual traces them-
 selves can be preserved, whereas the preservation of the original traces made
 on the plates would be out of the question on account of the expense, ex-
 cept on very particular occasions. Towards a just appreciation of the prefer-
 ence due to the plates or to the paper in this application of Photometry, it
 is necessary to take into the account the practical purposes for which the
 record is obtained and has to be employed. The mere inspection of the
 trace, as shown either on the plate or on paper, no doubt, possesses an in-
 terest both to the uninstructed and to those more familiar with the magnetic
 phaenomena ; and it may be, that amidst the great variety of those phaeno-

 mena there may be some which may have light thrown upon them by pecu-
 liarities only discoverable by a very close examination of the trace itself.
 But as in astronomy the advancement of the science has more particularly

 followed from the combination of measuring apparatus with optical power,
 so in terrestrial magnetism the analysis of the various periodical and other
 causes, which in their joint action produce the variations which the photo-
 graphical traces record, requires that the traces should undergo tabulation as
 a preliminary step to their practical application ; arrangements for rapid and
 exact tabulation are therefore as necessary as the photographic means of
 making a trace*.

     Mr. Ronalds has adopted for the trial which is now in progress the plan,
 which as far as can be judged at present appears the most advantageous, of
 taking the trace? on plates, from which they are tabulated with great accu-
 racy and with tolerable rapidity by the aid of ingeniously contrived appa-
 ratus, and when the tabulation is completed the traces themselves are copied
 by the hand with a graver's tool on transparent gelatine paper, an operation

  which requires about a quarter of an iiour for each trace of twenty-four
 hours, and can be done after a little practice with very considerable accuracy.

 The copies thus made are arranged in a journal and preserved. The gela-
  tine paper, which is of French manufacture, but is easily obtained in London,
 is found to answer extremely well for the purpose, is durable, and bears

  handling well ; so well indeed that impressions are freely taken on this paper
 by means of printer's ink and a small press, from the copies of the trace
 on gelatine paper employed as if it were a metal plate. These impressions
 are useful to send by post on days of unusual disturbance to other obser-

  vatories.

     * In the application to Government made in 1845 by the President of the British Asso-
  ciation (Sir John Herschel) to " encourage by specific pecuniary rewards the improvement
  of self-recordini^ magnetic and meteorological instruments," the following were stated as the
 reasons which had induced the British Association to direct the application to be made :

     1. " The great ultimate saving of time and expense which would take place in observa-
  tories established for the purpose of magnetical and meteorological determinations, if such
  apparatus were improved to a degree admitting its indications to be confidently trusted in
  the absence of an observer, and recorded in a manner suitable for scientific use.

     2. "The advantages which would accrue to those sciences from continuous registry of

 their phaenomena, instead of observations taken, as at present, at intervals of time."

ON THE KEW MAGNETOGRAPHS.  32?

    The tabulation is a far more serious matter as regards the time consumed
in the operation. Where traces vary from day to day so much as magnetic
traces are liable to do, the time required in tabulation must also be liable to
vary considerably; but it is found on a general average by Mr. Welsh, to
whose able and careful management Mr. Ronalds has confided this depart-
ment of the experimental trial, that the trace of each instrument in twenty-
four hours takes about three-quarters of an hour to measure and tabulate,
both sides of the trace being measured, and a mean taken between them.
The extent to which tabulation is carried is so calculated as to meet the va-
rious inquiries for which it is likely to be required, and generally sj)eaking
to reproduce the trace, though not of course perfectly in all cases. When
the processes of tabulation and copying are completed, the plate is cleaned

and is ready to be used again.
    Taking into account the labour of the photographist and that of the person

charged with the operations that have been just described, the work of a
photographical magnetic observatory in the present state of the apparatus
can by no means be deemed light ; but it has the advantage, and it is a great

one, of producing a continuous record.

   The plates are prepared and changed once in every twenty-four hours
the length of the plate is twelve inches, and as this corresponds to the time-

scale, which is an inch an hour, each plate is inverted at the expiration of
twelve hours, and thus at the expiration of the twenty-four hours each plate

is charged with a double trace, each trace having also its attendant zero line.

The width of the plates employed at Kew is three inches, being deemed a

fair ordinary width. In parts of the globe where great disturbances prevail,
and where at the same time great precision is required in the variations of

sjnall amount, a larger field than that of three inches may be desirable, and
may be given, but for moderate variations three inches seems an ample field.

It has been found by the concurrent experience of several persons that the

traces on the plates can be read off with full confidence to the 500th of an
inch; consequently the three-inch plate gives a scale of 1500 distinctly re-
cognizable parts. Taking the Declinometer as an example which will be
most generally understood, if a single division of the scale is made equal to

=six seconds, the range of the scale will extend to 1500X6 9000 seconds,

or 2░ 30'.

   Mr. Ronalds's instruments have a great advantage in the general stability
and freedom from sliake of the apparatus ; all parts which have a reference
to each other are bound together with marble and metal, the only wood em-
ployed being used strictly for exterior casing only. They have also a great
advantage in the constancy of the zero line, which is assured by mechanical
contrivance. The zero line has thus a permanent absolute magnetic value,
wliich remains unchanged from day to day, as well as at all times of the
same day.

   The time of exposure to the light by which each part of the trace has
been formed is one minute and a half. It is probable that by improvements
in photographical preparations the trace may hereafter be formed by an ex-
posure of much less duration, and that the length of the magnets, which is
now twelve or fifteen inches, may also be greatly reduced. Both j;hese im-
provements appear to be required if we desire that the trace should indi-
vidualize perturbations succeeding each other with great rapidity. If Mr.
Ronalds should succeed in substituting for the silvered plates a less costly
material, on which the traces might be taken with equal sharpness, and with
equal or greater rapidity, the photographic part of his invention would
seem to need scarcely any further improvement,---Jit??/ 1851.

Report to Francis Ronalds, Esq., on the Performance of his three
   Magnetographs during the Experimental Trial at the Kew Observa-
   tory, April 1 till October 1, 1851. By John Welsh, Esq.

In making a preliminary report on the performance of the three Magneto-
graphs during the experimental trial of them which lias just expired, I shall

--confine myself to a statement of 1st, the methods adopted for adjustment

of the several instruments; 2nd, the means of preserving a record, nume-
rical and grapliical, of the photographic registers ; and 3rd, the general
capabilities of the instruments of affording data for magnetical investigation.
The instruments having been already minutely described in your various
reports on the Observatory, it is unnecessary to make any reference to their

mechanical construction.

                              I. Adjustments, &c.

--Declination Magnetograph. This instrument was put into adjustment on

March 27-29. The suspending thread, of untwisted silk, was examined

throughout its whole extent, and found to have retained its original condition.

The magnet having been removed, a brass bar of the same weight was in-

serted in its place, and the amount of torsion existing in the thread examined.

This amounted to only 10░ and was eliminated.

 --The value in arc corresponding to a given ordinate on the registering

plate depends upon, first, the distance from the centre of motion of the

magnet and its appendages to the slit in the moveable shield; and second,

the number of times by which the image of a certain motion of the slit is

magnified when represented upon the registering plate. The first of these

is obtained by direct measurement with a beam compass; for the determi-
-- Anation of the second, the following contrivance was resorted to :
                                                                                scale

divided on plane glass to joth of an inch was placed in such a position that the

lines of the graduation were at the same distance from the lens as the slit in

Athe moveable shield when the magnet is in full adjustment. scale of the same

value divided on ground glass was placed in the sliding plate-frame, and upon

it the magnified image of the first scale was received at the proper focus.

Both the scales were in this way visible on the same surface: the one

magnified, and the other of the natural size. It was then easy to observe

the value of the one in terms of the other; the number of divisions of the

real scale corresponding to one division of the apparent scale representing

the magnifying power of the lens. If a be the required arc value correspond-

ing to an ordinate d on the plate, r the distance of the slit from the centre

mof motion of the magnet, and the magnifying power of the lens, we have

              d         when                              ,, <^
o=tan~i             or        the  ang░ular  motions are  small, a:=arc~'       very
                                                                           m.r  и'
              m.r,

nearly. The value of r was found by measurement to be 18'0 inches ; and
that of m, by the process above-described, 6*706 ; whence we have the arc-

value of an ordinate of one inch=28''48.

By turning the arms of the torsion-circle through different angles, it was

found that a twist of 90░ in the thread deflected the magnet through 44'

    This torsion effect being taken into account, the arc-value of one inch
^28'*71. The scale employed in the process of tabulation being divided
to j'^th of an inch, the factor for converting the recorded numbers into
minutes of arc is 0''574.
ON THE KEW MAGNETOGRAPHS.  329

   The same observations which determine the magnifying power of the lens,
afford also a means of estimating the amount of its spherical aberration. For
this purpose we have merely to examine whether the value of the apparent

scale in terms of the real scale remains constant at different portions of the

field. Observations of this kind having been made for all the instruments,
there is no reason to believe that, within the adopted range of motion, any
irregularity of scale exists. The scale divided on ground glass, which is
fixed permanently in each of the sliding plate-frames, supplies a means of
observing the positions of the magnets when the photographic registration

is not in action, and has been found of essential service in the preliminary
adjustments of the instruments. The scales are of the same value as that

employed in tabulating the numerical results : the zero division of the scale
can also be adjusted to correspond with the edge of the spot of light which
gives the zero-line on the plate ; observations taken in this way are there-

fore at once comparable with the photographic measurements.

   The length of time during which the light is allowed to act upon the plate
when the instrument is in action, is found by measuring the width of the dia-
phragm at the image end of the camera; or more accurately by measuring
the length of the impression produced by the light from the moveable slit
when the plate is at rest. This was found to correspond to about &\ mi-

nutes.

   The series of registrations by this instrument has been on several occa-
sions interrupted by derangements in the adjustments : these have been
shown in alterations of the relative positions of the fixed and moveable shields.
The moveable shield ought always to overlap, by a small quantity, the fixed

one, so as to stop all light except such as passes through the slits. It has
several times occurred that the shields have become so far separated as to
allow the light to spread across the plate and thus to prevent the appearance

of the curves. At other times the contrary has happened, the moveable
shield so much overlapping the fixed one as to obliterate the light from the
slit which produces the zero-line, the curve line being however still recorded.
On one occasion, about the end of July, it was found that the fixed shield
had become too high relatively to the image-diaphragm. For some days
previous to this being discovered, the registers were very faint, owing to the
great loss of light arising from this cause. These errors were always removed

--by opening up the instrument and readjusting the parts deranged an ope-

ration which always renders doubtful the connexion between the observa-
tions before and after the adjustments. The derangements now stated have
been ascribed to alterations in the condition of the wooden supports of the

instrument, arising from changes of temperature or humidity. They may

also be partly owing to the expansion and contraction of the very long sus-

--pending string.
    Horizontal-Force Magnetograph. The value in arc of the ordinates for
this instrument was found in the manner already described for the declina-
tion. The radius of the moveable shield ^9"08 inches, and the magnifying

=power of the lens 3*46 ; whence the arc-value of jJ^th of an inch=2'*188.

 The arc-value was also determined on September 20th, 1850, by a different
process, as follows. The magnet having been removed, an equal weight was
 suspended from the stirrup. There being then no magnetic directive force,
 and the torsion-force of the bifilar suspension being considerable, when the
 arms of the torsion-circle are turned through any angle, the arm carrying the
 shield should move through the same angle. The image of the slit being
 observed upon a divided scale placed at the focus, its motions corresponding
 to certain changes of the circle reading were observed. From the mean of
--880 REPORT 1851.

several observations it was found that the ordinate of j^th of an inch
 =2'"192, agreeing very closely with the value obtained by the other method.
The optical value for joth of an inch=2'*19.

    The value of the angle of torsion of the suspending wires was determined
by a method quite similar to that described in the ' Report of the Committee
of the Royal Society.' The arm carrying the moveable shield has a motion

in azimuth similar to that of the collimator in Dr. Lloyd's form of the bifilar
magnetometer ; the position of the image of the slit, with reference to the

divisions of the ground-glass scale, serving all the purposes of the telescope

and scale. The angle of torsion in the present adjustment was found to be
e^" 45'. By the usual formula, we find the value, in parts of the whole hori-
zontal force, of an ordinate of ^^th of an inch=0'000300.

   The effect of temperature upon the magnetic moment of the bar was exa-
mined in December 1850 by the usual method of deflections. The results

--were At temperature 55░'3, the effect of one degree =0'0003 12 ; and at

temperature 76░'7, the effect of one degree=0*00034'4'.
   The temperature of the magnet is obtained by a thermometer whose bulb

is within the box. Observations of the thermometer were taken generally
every three hours, rather more frequently during the day, and not so often
at night. They were taken usually by myself during the day and until mid-

night ; whilst Mr. Nicklin, whom I had instructed so as to observe the ther-
mometer with accuracy, took them at early morning or during my occasional

absence.

   The effect of the illuminating lamp in heating the air within the magnet
box has been found to be rather considerable. At the commencement of
the series, when no precautions had been adopted to prevent this effect, the
thermometer showed that the air was heated about 4 or 5 degrees above
what it would have been had the lamp been away ; wooden screens were
afterwards interposed for the purpose of preventing radiation from the lamp,
but the effect was still about 2 or 2^ degrees.

   The effect of the new copper damper in checking mechanical oscillation
was found to be very striking, a large arc of vibration being reduced to

nothing in four or five swings.

   The length of time during which the light of the registering image acts

--upon the plate is about 1| minute.
    Vertical-Force Magnetograph. The agate planes, upon which the knife-
edges of the magnet rest, were made horizontal by means of a level supplied
for the purpose by Mr. Barrow, and the instrument brought into approxi-
mate adjustment. The distance from the centre of motion (the knife-edge)
to that portion of the slit in the moveable shield which produces the image

--on the plate, was thus obtained : a brass rod carrying a shield, with a slit

similar to that attached to the magnet, was made to rest, in an upright posi-
tion, upon the agate planes, by means of a cross piece having a flat base
which occupied the same position as the knife-edge of the magnet when ia
adjustment. The image of a portion of the slit is formed upon the focua
glass : a fine point was then moved slowly along the slit by one person until

Aanother observed the image of the slit bisected by that of the point. mark

was there made on the shield. The distance of this point from the base is

equal to the distance from the centre of motion to the effective portion of
the slit in the moveable shield, and may readily be determined by a scale and
square. It was found to be ir93 inches. The magnifying power of the

lens was found by the method already described to be 3*78. From these
quantities we have the value in arc corresponding to an ordinate of j^th of

au =1inch 'и525.
ON THE KBW MAGNET06RAPHS.                                           331

The coefficient, for converting the angular motions of the magnet into

variations of the whole vertical force, has been obtained by the usual method

of vibration in the horizontal and vertical planes. The magnet, with its ap-

pendages, having been first brought into approximate adjustment, was re-

moved and slung horizontally by a slight loop of thread attached to a silk

suspension. It was defended from currents of air by being enclosed in a

Acylindrical box with lids, the thread bein"- alone exposed.        microscope

with cross wires was fixed to one side of this box, and so adjusted that a mark

Aon the shield carried by the magnet was visible.  vibration of about 2░

was given to the magnet, and the times of transit of the mark across the wire

noted by a chronometer. On March 31st the time of one oscillation was found

to be 17*90 seconds, the temperature being 52░. The time of vibration in

the vertical plane was observed by watching the motion of the image on

the ground-glass scale, the initial arc being generally nearly 2░.

Owing to the arrangement of the stone pier upon which the apparatus

rests, and the position of the window from which light was obtained, the

magnet could not be conveniently mounted either in the magnetic meridian

or at right angles to it. It was in fact mounted at right angles to the astro-

nomical meridian, the north end being directed to about 67░ west of the

magnetic north. The mode of adjusting the horizontality of the magnet was

the same as in Dr. Lloyd's original balance-magnets, namely, a screw attached

near the south end working horizontally.

The adjustment for the height of the centre of gravity was effected at first

by altering the position of the weight which counterpoises the vertical arm

carrying the moveable shield. After August 8th this adjustment was made

by a screw working vertically in the same frame as the horizontal adjusting

screw, the former method having been found very inconvenient.

In the beginning of August, the instrument, having been for some weeks

performing very indifferently, was returned to Mr. Barrow for alteration.

He stated that the knife-edges had become much deteriorated and even

somewhat rusted ; they were therefore re-ground : he was desired at the

same time to alter the mode of adjusting for the position of the centre of

gravity. The counterpoise weight below was permanently fixed; and a

screw working vertically attached to the south end, an equal weight being

added at the north end. On the magnet being returned it was again vibrated

horizontally ; and the time of one oscillation found to be 18*52 seconds, the

temperature being 72░.

   The temperature correction for this magnet was determined at the same

--time as that for the horizontal force. The results were At temperature

50░*4, the effect of one degree =0000283; at temperature 71░*5, the effect of

one degree=0*000319.

   The thermometer for this instrument was observed at the same time as
that of the horizontal force. The effect of the lamp in heating the air in

the magnet box was very trifling.

    Several circumstances have tended to prevent the satisfactory performance

of this instrument. When it was first put into action, the marble slab which

carries the magnet and its supports was suspended from the upper slab, upon

which were placed the camera, the lens, and the clock apparatus. This

upper slab again was merely laid upon the corbel supports, and not fastened
down to them. It was almost constantly noticed, during the month of April,

that the photographic trace exhibited sudden breaks or dislocations in the

curve, accompanied by oscillation of the magnet. These breaks could nearly
always be referred to periods when something was done in connexion with the

instrument, especially about sunset and sunrise, when the lamp was placed
--332 REPORT 1851.

or removed ; and also at noon and midnight, when the registering plates were

changed or reversed. It having been noticed on one or two occasions with

certainty, that a disturbance of the magnet occurred at the times of" chan-

ging the plates, it was conjectured that these anomalous motions might be due

to concussions generated in the apparatus by the necessary manipulations,

and that those at sunset and sunrise might arise from a similar cause. In

the end of April the instrument was fixed more securely to its supports. The

four brass columns which connected the lower slab to the upper were re-

moved, and the slab cemented to an additional massive corbel : the upper

slab was at the same time cemented to its supporting corbels. Care was

taken to preserve as nearly as possible the previous relative positions of the

different parts. The effect of this change was at once to remove the disturb-

ances which had occurred about noon and midnight; those at the placing

and removal of the lamp, however, still remained. Whilst making a more

careful trial, as to whether there was any magnetic action connected with the

lamp,  the  real  cause  of  this  particular  class  of  disturbance  occurred to  me
                                                                                                 ;

and in a few minutes it was traced to the different positions of the iron bars

of the window-shutters, when these were closed or opened. It had, in fact,

been remarked previously, that the disturbances at sunrise and sunset oc-

curred always in opposite directions. This source of error having been dis-

covered, it was remedied by the immediate removal of all the shutter-bars to

the basement story. These anomalous dislocations in the curves were after

this time scarcely ever experienced.

   Other errors have exhibited themselves, the causes of which we have not

--yet discovered ; one of these is, a tendency of the magnet to change its

mean position from day to day, and always in one direction, showing an ap-

parent gradual diminution of the vertical force. This change has generally

been to an extent which quite precludes the idea of its being due, either to
a real magnetic change, or to a loss of magnetism in the needle. That the

latter is not the cause, we have only to refer to the two observations of the
time of oscillation in the horizontal plane given above : from these we see

that, considering the higher temperature at the time of the second observa-

tion, and the fact that an additional weight had in the interim been put on

the magnet, the loss of magnetism has been trifling.

Another, and perhaps a more serious error is the inconstancy of the

height of the centre of gravity, as shown by variation of the time of vibra-

tion in a vertical plane. In nearly every case of adjustment during the six
months, it has been found that, after some days, the time of one vibration

has diminished to a very large extent. The following are a few of the cases

in which this has been shown :

Very remarkable changes of this nature have been previously observed ia
ON THE KEW MAGNETOGRAPHS.  333

balance-magnets, but in no case that I am aware of, has the variation been

to such an extent as is shown above. Observations have been taken of the
time of vibration for dififerent inclinations of the magnet, with the view of
ascertaining whether this diminution could be owing to variations in the
bearing-points of the knife-edges. These differences have in some cases been
considerable, but not nearly so great as to account for such excessive changes.
I cannot venture as yet to give any opinion as to the probable cause. With
the occasionally excellent performance of the magnet (as shown, for example,
in the magnetic disturbance of Sept. 3-4) before us, it is difficult to con-
ceive that it can be wholly due to imperfection of the knife-edges *.

                   II. Tabulation of Numerical Results, &c.

    In preserving a numerical I'ecord of the changes as shown by the mag-

--netographs, the objects kept in view have been, 1st, to obtain data for

deducing mean results, such as the diurnal changes, daily and monthly means,
&c. ; 2nd, to record all the changes which can be said to come under the
class of disturbances ; and 3rd, generally, to possess in a numerical form, as
far as is practicable, the means of producing the complete curves, either as
originally recorded photographically, or in the true form of declination, in-
clination, and total magnetic force.

   The positions of all the magnets have been measured for every hour of
Greenwich time during which we have had records ; in almost all cases the po-
sition for each half-hour has also been noted. Whenever the fluctuation has

been at all marked, the turning-points of the fluctuation with the corre-
sponding epochs have been measured ; very few motions exceeding two scale
divisions will be found omitted. Attention has been paid, as far as possible,
to have simultaneous measurements of all the instruments, but especially of
the two components of force. Both edges of the photographic trace have
always been measured, and the mean of the two entered ; by this means the
effects of mechanical oscillation and of variable breadth of the trace from
whatever cause, are eliminated. The number of measurements for each in-

strument during twenty-four hours has of course varied very much ; it may
be said, however, that the lowest number is 48, whilst in some cases of great
disturbance as many as 150 measurements have been taken ; the average
is probably somewhat more than 60. Any unusual appearance in the curves,
such as small and rapid fluctuation with little change of mean position, has
been mentioned. The attempt has been made throughout to leave no phae-
nomenon of any consequence unrepresented.

    In taking these measurements, the edge of the scale is brought very near

to the surface of the plate, in order, as much as possible, to prevent error
from parallax ; a compound magnifying lens with a flat field being used in
reading off. From my own experience, supported by the opinions of several
gentlemen accustomed to observation, I estimate the accuracy with which

the better defined traces can be measured at about j-^th of an inch, or one-
tenth of a division of the measuring scale. In the case of the declination,
the trace not being so distinct, probably j-roth of an inch should be consi-
dered as the extent of accuracy. These estimates give for the probable error

of a measurement of the declination about 0'*1, and for the horizontal force
about 0*00003 of the whole force. The adjustments of the vertical force in-

   * Shortly after the date of this report it was discovered that a spot of rust had formed
upon one of the knife-edges : this had not been perceived when the magnet was examined
about the beginning of October ; although it may have been already in operation, but to so
small an extent as to be imperceptible to the eye. It seems highly probable that a consi-
derable share of the irregularities complained of may be ascribed to this cause.
--334 REPORT 1851.

strument having been so variable, no constant estimate can be given for it
in an average adjustment, however, it is believed that the probable error of
a measurement will not exceed 0"000015 of the whole vertical force.

    Failures in the registration have been mentioned whenever they have oc-

curred, and a note taken of the cause when such is known. On examination

of these records, I find that, in the case of the declination, there are about
seventy-five hours in the six months during which no registrations have been
obtained, owing to insufficiency of the photographic process ; in the horizon-

tal force there are about fifty hours. No failures whatever have taken place

in the photographic process during the last ten weeks of the trial. Failures
have occasionally occurred from causes purely accidental, such as omitting
to wind the clocks, not properly adjusting the sliding plate-frames, forgetting
to open the valve of the declination lamp, and such like. These, however,
must be considered rather as personal than instrumental errors.

   All the photographic registrations have been copied upon gelatine tracing-

paper. I am not yet prepared to give any estimate as to the accuracy with

which these copies are made.

III. General Remarks on the Capabilities of the Instruments.

In forming an opinion as to the powers of the instruments, it is necessary

to take into consideration the circumstances connected with their construc-

tion. The declination magnetograph was the first instrument constructed

according to your design, and consequently cannot be expected to equal in

accuracy or convenience those afterwards made. From the essential portions

of its structure being altogether of wood, it would be too much to expect

from it a long-continued series of trustworthy records, where steadiness and

permanency of adjustment are so necessary. The large dimensions of the

magnet and its appendages would, on any system of observation, present great

Adifficulties whenever the more rapid magnetic changes occur.  consider-

able loss of light is sustained by the position of the instrument requiring the

daylight to be reflected, and the photographic difficulties are accordingly in-

creased. The want of a copper damper sufficiently powerful to eliminate

the mechanical oscillation of the magnet, by permitting an almost continu-

ous minute vibration, tends to diminish the sharpness of outline in the

trace. It has accordingly been found that, owing to changes taking place in

the framework of the apparatus, a series of more than a few weeks cannot be

obtained without some slight adjustments of the instrument. When the

magnetic changes become very rapid and extensive, it fails to aiFord all the

information which is desirable. Instances of failure in this respect will be

found in some of the larger disturbances which have occurred during the

trial, as, for example, in those of the 3rd and 29th of September, when,

from the excessive abruptness of the magnetic motions, and the want of

delicacy in what may be styled the registering-pencil, the interpretation of

the photographic records becomes very difficult and uncertain. Notwith-

standing the defects which I have alluded to, it is, however, certain that

the instrument is capable of aff"ording a large amount of information. It

exhibits with much exactness all the common fluctuations ; and there can

be no doubt that very trustworthy results, as to the mean diurnal move-

ments, could be obtained from it. Even disturbances of considerable

amount, especially those which, although of large extent, are not of an ab-

rupt character, are recorded with as much accuracy as seems to be desirable.

In short, the instrument, even in its present state, is capable of providing a

very great porportion of the data required for magnetical investigation.

In the horizontal-force magnetograph, the defects of construction in the
ON THE KEW OBSERVATORY.  335

declination have been in a great degree remedied. All the essential parts of
the apparatus being of metal or stone, the permanency of the adjustments is

secured. The light being admitted directly to the instrument, and the op-
tical power not being so great, the photographic means are increased. The
dimensions of the magnet and its appendages being much smaller, the me-
chanical inertia is diminished ; and by the use of a very powerful copper
damper, the inconvenience arising from vibration is almost wholly got rid
of. The results of these improvements are such as might be expected. It
has been found that a long series of registrations can be obtained without
the occurrence of a single case of mechanical derangement requiring re-ad-
justment of any portion of the apparatus. The instrument has been found
capable of recording, in a perfectly distinct manner, almost all the magnetic
changes which occur, and with a delicacy of scale quite sufficient to repre-
sent even the most minute movement. In only one instance during the six
months has it been unable to overtake the most rapid motions. In the dis-
turbance of September 29, it certainly has been found deficient in power to
represent with distinctness those very violent and extensive changes which

--occasionally do occur. This deficiency seems to have arisen 1st, from the

length of time during which the plate is exposed to the action of the light
being sufficient for more than one motion to take place; and 2nd, from
the mechanical inertia being still so great, as in some instances to carry the
magnet farther in the direction of a sudden magnetic change than is strictly
due to such change. These defects seem to point to the desirability of
further improvements in the same direction as those already made, namely,
greater photographic power and less mechanical inertia. It should be re-
marked also, that in the larger disturbances the extent of scale adopted for
all the instruments has been insufficient to contain the extreme excursions.

    The performance of the vertical force instrument has unfortunately been
so little satisfactory, from causes apparently unconnected with the means ne-
cessary to adapt it to photographic registration, that it is impossible to come
to a distinct conclusion as to its value. Its performance for some time after
being repaired by the maker was, however, so good, and its power of exhi-
biting such great and sudden motions as occurred during the disturbance of
September 3-4 so considerable, as to hold out the expectation that, when-
ever the source of the errors already noticed shall have been discovered, it
may be found to be a really efficient and trustworthy instrument.

iIt is hoped that this eighth annual summary relative to the status and pro-

[ceedings of the Kew Observatory will evince our sincere desire to promote

'the liberal views of the British Association, and that our diligence has been
 commensurate with the augmented funds which have been kindly granted by

 Her Majesty's Government and the Royal Society, and with the increased

 interest which gentlemen of the highest scientific acquirements and repu-
 tation, both at home and abroad, have manifested in the success of the Esta-
 blishment.
336 REPORT 1851.

   The principal means which I have employed in its composition have been
references to my former Reports of a like kind ; examinations of the various

instruments, &c. spoken of; descriptions, &c. from my own portfolios ; the

Electro-meteorological Journal ; the tabulations and tracings of the magnetic

curves, &c., and the Kew Diary.

The materials which I have used for supplying some omissions in our

Diary have been three manuscripts concerning tlie Meteorological Journal,

the Barometrograph, and the Hygrometers, drawn up by Mr. Welsh (our

observer). In making use of the Diary and all other documents, endeavours

have constantly been made to record shortly only such facts as may be, or

may become useful, and to do this in the words themselves of those docu-

ments wlienever a due regard to brevity permitted.

 --The subjects are arranged under four heads : 1st, tliose which relate to

the Building, Instruments, &c. ;  2ndly, those referable to the Observations
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

Srdly, experimental (and analogous) subjects ; and lastly, those which do

not properly belong to any of the former.

               I. THE BUILDING, INSTRUMENTS, &c.

    The edifice* has undergone no change of importance this year. The an-
nexation of three new corbels to the wall of the great mural quadrant, for
the support of a new Vertical-force Magnetograph, is probably a temporary
expedient. The custody of a large quantity of apparatus, consigned to our
care by the Royal Society, and of which a portion is highly valued, from the
circumstances of its having been- invented, or made, or even possessed by
such men as Boyle, Huygens, Newton, Cook, Cavendish, Coulomb, Le Roy,
Sabine, Kater, &c., renders a little reparation (of damage by dry rot) and
painting very desirable (a long time has elapsed since any interior painting
has been done) ; and it has frequently been thought advisable that the wall
of the great quadrant, which instrument has long since been dismantled, and

will never be again employed, should be converted into piers, pedestals, &c.
for the support of experimental instruments requiring scrupulous regard to
immutability of position and exemption from extraneous vibration f.

    In speaking of the Instruments, I refer principally to those which have
been more or less used in this year.

                                         Electrical Apparatus.

    The Principal Conductor, &c. on, and in, the Dome, and all the electrical
apparatus which has been employed for the observations of atmospheric
electricity, are in working order. The Rod, Lantern, &c., the Volta-
Electrometers, Henley-Electrometer, Discharger and Distinguisher, retain
the forms described at p. 123 {et seq.) of the Report for 1844', The Ob-
server's Clock and its scale remain as described at p. 178 of the Report for

1850.

   The Galvanometer of M. Goujon gives strong indications when connected

with the conductor, in times of violent rain, &c., but is not to be depended
upon as to measures.

   * Described at p. 120, Report for 1844.

      Two of the magnetographs, although solidly, are inconveniently placed. The photo-

          иf-

barometrograph requires a much better foundation than boards and joists can afford (as will
be seen) ; and for the due prosecution of projected observations of standard and other ba-

rometers, pendulums, &c., extremely solid bases cannot (obviously) be dispensed with.

    The three Night-Registering Electrometers, described at p. 139 of the Re-
port for 1844, are effective, but little employed. They were very useful
formerly, but will soon give place to the Photo-Electrograph.

    The Gold-leaf Electroscope itself remains nearly as described at p. 125 of
the same volume. The little additional apparatus for preserving its insulating
power, afterwards alluded to, and now described more particularly, has been
found very convenient and effective.

  A (Plate XVIII. fig. 2) is a thick plate of well-ground and polished glass.

    B, a kind of annular tin trough, coated with sealing-wax varnish, and con-

taining chloride of calcium.

    C, the electroscope.

   On the central part of A, not occupied by B, stands C ; which, together
Awith B, is covered by a glass receiver, fitting air-tight upon when C is not

in use.

   By this means the electroscope may be preserved in a dry and clean state,
and quite ready for use at any moment ; and it is evident that a similar
drying arrangement may be adopted in respect of a Volta, or any other de-

tached electrometer or electrical instrument, &c.

The pair of Portable f^olta-Electrometers, occasionally used on the leaden

roof of the building for experiments on induction, absorption, &c. of atmo-

spheric electricity, are in the original state alluded to at p. 140 of the Report

for 1844; they were not particularly described there, because, with the ex-

ception of a few additions and alterations, they are similar to the instruments

used in the dome ; but several eminent meteorologists having thought that

these instruments would, if used with proper precautions, afford better ap-

proximative results in observations, on moimtains, &c., tiian the portable

instruments which have been usually employed, the following short but com-

plete account of them may possibly be found convenient.

  A (Plate XVIII. fig. 1) is the lower part of one of them.

   a', a little hollow pedestal, the side, base, and upper surface of which are

formed out of one brass casting. It is about S inches high and 2 inches

square.

a^, a cupola of cast brass screwed firmly into its upper surface.

a^, a lamina of thin plate-glass polished and attached, by a frame of brass

and screws, to a* : a lamina of ground glass is fixed in like manner to the back

of a'.

a*, a tube of thick glass well-coated with shell-lac, applied by heating the

glass until it is capable of melting the lac, but not of carbonizing it. It

passes through and is firmly cemented to a cover which is screwed into a'^.

Its lower end projects about an inch below the cover, and on the upper end

Ais cemented a brass cap and screw.  wire, forming a continuation of that

screw, passes through the bore of a*, in which it is securely fixed ; this wire

terminates below in a flattened part, which has two minute perforations at the

distance of half a Paris line from each other.

a% a pair of Volta's straw penduletti, two Paris inches long. In their

upper ends are fixed hooks of fine copper wire, which pass through the per-

forations and suspend the straws freely : their lengths and diameters are in

strict conformity with Volta's prescription for his standard instrument

(No. 1).

a^, an ivory scale fixed in front of a^ ; its upper edge is an arc whose

radius is equal to the lengths of a=, and it is graduated in half Paris lines
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

the zero-point being opposite to the line where the straws nearly touch each
other when unelectrified.

    cO is a small brass tube or cap fitted upon the cap of a'*, but whose interior
cylindrical surface stands at the distance of about ^'Ca of an inch from the
coating of lac on a* ; it* can be removed at pleasure*.

   B Ais an electrometer, similar to in all respects, excepting as regards its

pair of straws 6^, which are rendered so much heavier than the straws of A,
by filling their cavities with the prolonged wire of their hooks, as to diverge
(when both are equally electrified) exactly ^th as much. This arrangement
agrees with Volta's prescription for his electrometer No. 2, and the exact
accordance of the two instruments is ascertained by his halving process^f.

   C is the conductor, consisting of a very light conical tube of copper about

3 feet 6 inches long, and furnished with a brass cap below, which screws
upon the cap of a*.

   c' (fig. P) is a helix of small copper wire, the lower and smaller part of
which fits upon the upper extremity of C ; the upper part being considerably

larger.

    c^, a solfanello (of Volta), i. e. a sulphur candle, composed of about 10
threads of lamp-cotton coated and imbued with sulphur whilst in a melted

state. It is placed in the larger part of c'.

  D is a mahogany case placed upon a portable staft'or table, or a post.

   d' d', &c. grooved pieces, between which the lower parts of A and B may

be slid, and the instruments be thus properly packed for transport.
    d^, a little drawer containing a supply of solfanelli, &c.

   A hollow walking-cane may contain C, disjointed for the sake of porta-

bility ; and tubes might be occasionally slid through the bottoms of a' and i'
to embrace a^ and 6\ thus preventing their violent vibration, &c. in transport.

   When these instruments are to be used in Volta's or Bennet's manner, c'
may be shd upon C, and c- (lighted) into c' ; when in Saussure's manner, a
pointed wire may be substituted for c' and c- ; when in Cavallo's, Erman's,
or Peltier's (inductive) manner, a ball may be attached to the end of C, or C
may be disjointed and a ball attached to its lower joint ; or the instrument
may be used without any such conductor, as may be most suitable to cir-

cumstances of locality, &c.

    In all cases where the atmospheric charge is not extremely minute, straws

are infinitely preferable to gold leaves, which can never be safely transported

in their instrument.

   The Peltier Electrometer, or (rather) Erman's, which has been particularly
described by both inventors, can scarcely be said to be in working order, its

insulating capacity having greatly diminished.

--Electrical Observatory for transport. The expense and difficulty of con-

veying to distant stations apparatus for electrical observations so large and

heavy as is ours, have furnished the motives for arranging some instruments,

already existing at Kew in the form represented by fig.3, PlateXVIII., which

shows that a Very efficient apparatus may be constructed at small compa-

rative expense, and presenting considerable facility of transport.

server to stand in it, and broad enough to allow him to view the electro-
meters in a stooping attitude. Several parts of the contained apparatus are

similar to the principal corresponding parts in our Dome (vide Report for
1844, p. 120). Some are improved.

    a is a mahogany varnished cylinder fitted into a circular aperture in the
roof, and furnished with a smooth ring or rim projecting outward from the
upper end.

   B, a window (which may serve for photographic purposes, &c.).
   C, my strong hexapod-stand ; but capable of being folded into a very small

compass*.

   c', a safety conductor of thick copper wire, in good conducting commu-

nication, with moist earth or water.
   D, fig. 3% is the upper end of the principal conductor, which is a light

conical tube of copper 12 feet long.
    E, a brass tube whose upper end is 2^ feet above the roof of A, and into

Dwhich the lower end of is firmly screwed, but from which it can be re-

moved at pleasure by a person standing on the roof of A.
   F, the usual stout hollow glass pillar, with its collar of wood, &c. It is

trumpet-shaped below and firmly secured by bolts passing through the collar

and table.

    G, the table, which also carries the other instruments.

   H, the cap with a globular ring fitted on F, and supporting

   KK, the bolts, &c. which contain the screws, plugs, and stoppers for sus-

taining and adjusting the sliding arms, &c.

    k' P, the clamping balls.
    k-, one of the sliding arms passing through K, &c. and adjustable ver-
tically (or to any angle). It can be secured in any required position by

means of A', in the manner formerly described.

   L, the small warming lamp.
    l^, the usual conical chimney of copper, closed above and entering F, to

which it imparts warmth from L.
   M, fig. 3% a small Volta's lantern, fitted by a socket on the top of D. It

contains the collecting lamp, and is provided with a little cowlf in lieu of

the former perforated cap.
    N, a copper cylindrical parapluie, fitted by a collar on E, and having a

smooth ring or rim, projecting nearly as much inward as the rim of a' pro-

jects outward |.
    O, the uninsulated part of Volta's standard or electrometer No. 1.
    P, his second electrometer, both r,s improved and formerly described.

   OQQ, the usual apparatus, of suspending wire, glass tubes, covers (of

depend for insulation on F only.

electrometers are here omitted as not being absolutely necessary for the ob-
jects contemplated ; but they can be, at any time, easily added.

   A Osheet of tin-foil is placed under and P, and in good conducting com-

munication with c'.
    S is the Henley electrometer, as modified by Volta (and formerly de-

 scribed).

    T, the discharger (or spark-measurer), remains as also formerly described.

    V is a rod and balls, adjustable to height, and attached to one of the balls
K, in the manner in which k- is attached to the other ball K.

    The distinguisher, used for ascertaining the kind of charge possessed by
the conductor, may be either the small Leyden-jar, combined with a gold-
leaf electroscope formerly described ; or the electroscope at fig. 2, which
retains its charge very long whilst under the glass bell, and may be used for
the above purpose without being removed from it*.

  --External Apparatus for Insulation, 8^c. The ap]iaratus represented by

 fig. 4, divested of the conductor (D), formed part of an instrument formerly
alluded to (Report for 1 844), and which was called a pluvio-electrometer.
 In lieu of the conductor a large copper dish was fixed upon the glass pillar
(F), mounted on the tripod which was placed on the leads of the Observatory,
and the dish was connected by a wire with a separate insulating apparatus
in the Dome, for the purpose of examining the electricity of rain. Deeming
 the employment of a dish objectionable, however, I made little use of the
 instrument for that purpose ; but it has been found very convenient in the
 form here described as an external and portable apparatus, placed in situations
 where it would have been inconvenient and expensive to have erected a

round-house observatory (as fig. 3). Some electrical observers would pro-

 bably derive advantage from its use, in preference to the rod projecting

from a window, as in Volta's, Cavallo's, my own former, and many other

 experiments ; for it requires a very long rod thus used to get rid of the
 baneful eflfect of the house-top, chimneys, &c., particularly when the wind
 passes over the house from the side opposite to that from which the rod

 projects.

   G (the table) is, in this case, supported by 3 triangular strong boards or

 frames, attached, by strong hinges, to its under side, and provided with edge-
 pieces or " feather-boards," for diminishing vibration, &c. ; they can be
 folded inward, for the sake of portability, &c.

     Д' g' are 2 of 3 pieces of sail-cloth, which, by means of studs (or buttons)
 on the boards or legs, and of corresponding hooks upon g-' g\ can be laced
 (with small cords) upon the legs, so as to fill up any or all the spaces between

     D, the conductor, and
     F, the glass pillar, &c., are nearly similar to those of fig. 3, but stronger.
 The warming lamp is much more powerful than the lamp of fig. 3, in order
 that it may counteract the colder atmosphere to which this apparatus is
 usually exposed.

H, &c. of fig. 3, or it may be placed in any high situation on the earth, at a
distance from buildings, &c., and a long wire may be attached to a stronger
and shorter rod taking the place of D. This wire may communicate with
internal apparatus, and thus Beccaria's principal method of observing the
electricity of serene weather, dew, &c. may be adopted and compared with

others, and with the electricity of higher strata of the atmosphere.

   Or (much better), several such insulators may be distributed over a con-
siderable space and made to support several wires connected with each other

and with the internal apparatus.

  A large network of small wire thus insulated has long been a desideratum

with me. The pillar F, &c. miglit be inclined for tlie sake of acquiring a

better position for resisting the weight of such network.
   For examining the electricity of rain in Cavallo's manner, a hoop of copper

supporting a net work of wire, as shown by the dotted lines, might be ad-
vantageously substituted for the above-mentioned dish or the conductor D,

   Three such insulators might be placed in an equilateral triangle, and 3
light cords, containing very fine wires, might be attached to an electrical
kite, thus maintained at a nearly invariable height, as was done by lines not
wired, in a rough experiment made here in 18'17, with a view to temperature
and hygrometric observations (vide Phil. Mag. for September 1847).

   The Photo-Electrograph remains nearly as described in the Phil. Trans.
Part I. for 1847. It will be improved by the addition of a little apparatus
applicable to the registration of electrical frequency, and removed into the
Dome.

more sensitive will be particularly described when further contemplated
improvements have been effected. It is supported upon either a pillar at-
tached to the northern part of the balustrade of the leads, or upon one at the
southern part, according to the direction of the wind. It turns to the wind
on hard steel centres, and vibrates vertically upon hard knife-edges and
rings, in the manner of a delicate scale-beam.

   The Rain- and Vafour-Gauge is in the state described at p. 129 of the

same Report. Wear does not seem to affect its sensibility. On November

16, 1850, it was removed from the support of the old rain-gauge and placed
upon a strong tripod, very near to its former locality, viz. the southern end
of the leads, and at the same height as before.

The old Rain-Gauge is a relic of His Majesty George the Third's col-

the amounts of rain.

Thermometers, Hygrometers, &c.

  The Thermometer-stand(P]ate XIX.), not before clearly described, and nearly
similar to that of Greenwich, is situated in front of the northern entrance on
the stone platform. The mean distance of its face from the wall (or door)

central part of a^, and allows A, with all its adjuncts, to be revolved on the
axis of B.

   The Dry Standard Thermometer, C, by Newman, has a brass Fahrenheit

scale divided to 0*5 inch. It was found on September 21, 1850, to read
22░ in pounded ice*.

  A Dry Thermometer, D, by Ronchetti, has an ivory Fahrenheit scale di-

vided to 0*2 inch. The tube and scale are enclosed in a hermetically sealed
thin glass tube. The index corrections, when it was compared with C (on

-- +September 21, 1850), were at 32░ 0-1, at 54░-|-0'2, at 73░ 0-5.

  A Wet-bulb Thermometer, E, by Ronchetti, is exactly similar (in form, &c.)

to D. The coating of its bulb is of taffetas, and the conducting threads are
of floss silk. Its index corrections, when it was compared as above, were, at

-- --32░ 0-5, at 54░ 0-2, at 73░ 0-0

was compared with C, as above, were at 32░ 0-0, at 54░-- 0-1, at 73░-- 0-5.

   The Rutherford Maximum and Minimum Thermometers, FF, by Newman,
have boxwood scales, the minimum divided to 0'067, the maximum to 0'047
inch. The index corrections (as above found) for the maximum were, at
32░-- 1░-5, at 54░-- 9░-2, at,73░-- 2░'0, and for the minimum at 32░-- 0-3, at

  A new Daniel Hygrometer, G, by Newman, has been used in various posi-

tions.

   The index correction of its immersed thermometer (found as above) was

-- 0-3.

   The old Daniel Hygrometer,G, by Newman, which gave place to the above
(on February 1, 1851), had a small void in the mercurial column of the

immersed thermometer.

   The index corrections of this instrument, found as above, were at 32░-- 0*5,
at 54░-- O'S.

   The Saussure Hygrometer, H, of eight hours, made by Richer of Paris, in

1815, and described in the Journal de Physique, tom.xxxiv., p. 58, has a scale
of 100 parts. Some experiments made in September 1 850, seem to show that
the range of the index had extended 5 divisions on the side of " humidity,"
and an equal quantity on the side of " dryness."

   An old Standard Thermometer made by Adams, in about 1768 probably,

for His Majesty George the Third's collection, is contained in a thick metallic

case, open in front. It has a brass Fahrenheit scale divided to 0'059 inch.

Its index corrections, when it was compared with C, as above, were at

--32░ 0-5, at 54░-- 0-5.

A Regnault's Hygrometer and its Aspirator in their original forms have

been presented to us by Capt. Ludlow, R.E., together with several spare

glass cisterns whose lower parts are formed of thin black glass, in addition

to other cisterns compounded of silvered and glass tubes united by cement.

These instruments have been described by M. Regnault*.

The comparisons of its two thermometers. No. 151 and No. 152, with

the Newman's standard C, on September 23rd, 1850, gave the following

results:

An improved Regnault's Hygrometer and Aspirator have been made, and

may be thus described :

A (fig. 1, Plate XX.) is the cistern, composed of a light and highly-polished

Asilver tube.  little cylinder, of solid glass, occupies about an inch, mea-

sured from its bottom, and aether the principal part of the space above the

glass.

Aby revolving about B, but the difficult problem of always protecting them from all these

influences simultaneously, of also avoiding the anomalous effects of radiation and humidity
from neighbouring bodies, and of preserving a sufficiently free circulation of air, has, I fear,

still to be solved.
   * The distinguishing feature in the action of M. Regnault's admirable Hygrometer, as

compared with that of the Daniel, is the deportation of setherial vapour from the interior of
a mass of aether (as well as from the surface) contained in a light metallic or glass cistern,
by a current of air (bubbles) passed through the aether, and coohng the cistern down to, or
beyond, the dew-point. The aspirator, a vessel containing water, and whose upper part com-
municates with the cistern of the hygrometer (only) by means of a flexible pipe and stop-
cock, is employed to create (and regulate with great precision) the current of air (and con-
sequently the rate at which the cistern is cooled) by the flow of the water from its lower part.
--344 REPORT 1851.

   a* is a brass cap soldered to A.
   a^ is part of a small vent (or cock) opening into A.

    a^, a tube (of the vent) with a small aperture at the pointed end, which
when turned downward, permits fluid (above the opening of a^ into A) to

pass out, but when turned upwards that opening is entirely closed. By these
means it is easily ascertained when aether enough has been poured into A.

  Aa* is a stop-cock communicating with and D, and serving as a support

for A, &c.

   B is the immersed thermometer, the tube of which passes (with cement)

through a little pipe soldered to a disc (not shown) which rests upon a flange

in a'.

    b', a ring (with milled edge) screwed upon a', and serving (with a leathern
washer) to press the disc (carrying B, &c.) firmly down upon the flange in a'.

  AC is a pipe for admitting air (and also for feeding with aether) on oc-

casion ; it passes through the above-mentioned disc (with cement), and ex-

tends nearly to the solid glass cylinder in the bottom of A. Its upper end is

funnel-shaped. When the instrument is not in use, this end is closed by a

milled-headed stopper and leathern washer (to prevent the escape of aethe-

rial vapour).

  D is a brass column having a cylindrical bore throughout its length, ex-

cepting the upper plane of the cube ; a* is screwed into the cube and com-

municates with the bore.

  A glass shade may be placed over A, D, &c., for protection from rain,

dust, &c. (on occasion).

E, figs. 2 and 3, is the aspirator.

e' is a pipe fitted into the bore of D, and entering

eS which is a square piece perforated horizontally and ground to fit

exactly upon

e', which is a tube, closed by plugs, at its left end and its central part (in

Athe manner shown in fig. 3).  perforation through the (always) upper side

of e^ and through e* admits a free passage of air, setherial vapour, &c. from

e' into e^.

    e* is a squared piece perforated horizontally, and ground to fit exactly
upon e^, but having liberty to revolve upon e^ on occasion.

    e^, a pipe entering e*, and norv ascending from it. Another perforation
through the (always) upper side of e^ admits a free passage of air from e^ to
e' when e* is in the position shown.

    e'^ is a rectangular vessel into which e* opens, very near to its now upper
surface ; and e* is soldered at the place where it passes through the now

lower surface of e^.

   e'^, a pipe opening at a small distance from the now interior bottom of e^,
and from the now interior top of

e^, which is a vessel exactly similar to e^.

e^ is a pipe opening into the now upper part of e^, and entering

e'░, which is a squared piece perforated horizontally to fit upon e^, but

Ahaving liberty to revolve upon e^ when necessary.    third perforation

through e^, at its always lower side, and through e'░, admits a free passage

of air from e^ to e^.
    It is evident that if e^, in its present position, should contain water, and

that if a current of air were permitted to flow through e', through the left-
hand hollow part of e^, and through e\ the water would descend through
e', and air, in e░, would escape through e^, and through the right-hand end
of e^, or (vice versa) that the descent of water from e^ to e^ (through e')
ON THE KEW OBSERVATORY.  345

would create a tendency to a vacuum in e^, which would cause air to flow
through e', &c. into e^ ; and that when all the water had descended into e^,

air would cease to flow into e^
   e" is a pipe entering e*, and opening into the now lower part of e^, but

having at present no communication with e^ (for there is no opening in the

lower side of e^ at this point).

   e^^, a pipe entering e'", and opening into the now lower part of e^ but at
present having no communication with e^ (for there is no upper opening in

e^ at this point).

    It is therefore also evident, that if the vessel e« were made to take the
exact position of e^, by simply reversing the whole aspirator E, i. e. by
turning it on the pieces e* and e'", the pipes e" and e░ (which open into e^)
would occupy the positions now occupied by e* and e'^, and that conse-
quently air would again flow through e', &c.

   AABut e' communicates with D, D, with the cistern (fig. 1), and with

C, therefore air would flow through C, would rise (in bubbles) through the
aether in A, carrying with it a large quantity of aethereal vapour, and would
pass through a*, D, and e', &c. (fig. 3) into e^, and so on.

   F (fig. 2) is a strong table in two perpendicular legs of which notches are

cut for the reception of the ends of e^.

 yy are plates, fitted to squares at their ends and screwed upon those legs,

in order to prevent e^ from rotation when e^ and e^ are made to exchange

positions.

   It is not necessary to enter upon further details here. The construction
presents no difficulties (the kind of work required being principally that
which is commonly executed by makers of stop-cocks, valves, &c); the parts
of e* whereon e* and e'o revolve are slightly conical, and clamping nuts are

employed.

   The apparatus is very effective and convenient. With aether of second-
rate quality the mercury has been made to descend from about 63░ to about
13░. Even pyroligneous tether or good naphtha are efficient, but act in-
juriously upon the metal.

   The lower part of A remains bright wlien the other part begins to be

clouded with dew, thus affording the advantage of contrast in the discovery
of the dew-point, but the line of demarcation is not always perfect at first.

Further improvements relative to this object are contemplated. The freezing-

point of B (as determined on April S, 1851) is at 32░'2.

   /in Hygrometric Sliding Rule, invented by Mr. Welsh (of this Establish-
ment), has been added to our stock of working instruments. The following
is his abstract from his description of this ingenious contrivance.

   " The hygrometrical sliding-rule has been devised for the purpose of facili-

tating the calculation of the results of observations with the moist-bulb hy-

grometer. The instrument is founded on Dr. Apjohn's formula, Dalton's

values of the elasticity of vapour being adopted. It has been so arranged

--as to give by inspection the values of the following expressions : 1st. The

elastic force of the aqueous vapour. 2nd. The temperature of the dew-
point. 3rd. The relative humidity of the air or the ratio to complete satu-
ration ; and 4th. The weight of water contained in a cubic foot of air. The
scales were divided on metal at Kew by the aid of Perreaux's dividing-
engine, and afterwards copied upon wood by the optician."

   A Standard Thermometer by M. Regnault, No. 231, has been received

from Col. Sabine. The length of its arbitrary scale (beautifully etched

--5upon the tube) is 17 inches. The range is from  to +235, and the

number of divisions is 650.

The boiling-point (as determined on April S, 1851) is at the 591st divi-

sion, and the freezing-point at the lOOdth.

  A Standard Thermometer by Ronchetti, has been also received from Col.

Sabine.

   The freezing-point (as determined on April S, 1851) is at the 31░*4

division.

  A Machine for dividing right lines in equal parts, on Ramsden's principle,

but very ingeniously modified by M. Perreaux, with appendages for fixing

calibring and graduating thermometer-tubes, has been, very seasonably,
imported and added to our collection under the auspices of Mr. Gassiot. The

important application of M. Perreaux's machine to the above-mentioned and
other purposes was effected with the aid and advice of M. Regnault ; and
the instrument, together with the modes of using it, have been clearly de-
scribed and illustrated by M. Soulnier in a Report of July 8, 1846, in-

serted in the ' Bulletin des Sciences*.'

   Apparatus for testing the graduation of Thermometers, and some for com-
paring them and for determining the freezing- and boiling-points, formed

other portions of Mr. Gassiot's valuable importation.

scarcely permitted an examination of its qualifications as to self-correction

for temperature, which was always considered a principal desideratum. The

experience obtained this year, of its efficiency to a very great (if not com-

plete) extent in this respect, may perhaps be deemed a sufficient apology

            Magnetographs.

    The Decimation Magnetograph, placed between the piers of the (trans-

ferred) transit instrument, and described in the Phil. Trans., Part I. 1847,
has undergone the following improvements :

    The index (6') which was formerly used in producing the curve on paper,
has given place to a moveable shield, with its slit similar to 6* of fig. 1,

Plate v., Report for 1849.

  A diaphragm plate, similar to O, has been added, with provision for ad-

justing it, on the marble slab, in the direction of the length (of the slab).

   A fixed shield, like o\ has been attached to O, with the intervention of a

pair of sliders, moveable vertically and horizontally, by means of micrometer
screws, which allow it to be returned to its place if derangement in either of

these directions should occur; and the adjustments of O, on the slab, de-
termine its proper horizontal distance from b\

  A socket has been fixed upon the lamp-support, which guides the lamp

into a constant position when exchanged at about sunrise for a plane mirror,

for which a similar kind of guide has been provided.

    This mirror is at present necessary for reflecting daylight into the camera
from a window (the locality not permitting direct daylight to enter it), and

consequently it is also necessary to keep the mouth at E much more opened

than the mouths of the other two magnetographs, in order to compensate the

loss of light by a longer exposure of the photographic surface in the slider
(H) to its influence ; this has (evidently) a bad eflfect upon the magnetic

curve, particularly on occasions of considerable and sudden magnetic dis-

turbances.

The microscope (/Ф) has been made capable of being slid laterally, in

order that the image on the ground-glass (at e') may be viewed more di-

rectly ; for the principal part of what was before mistaken for other kind of

aberration arose in fact from the circumstance of viewing the image obliquely

through the microscope.

  HThe sliding-frame has been provided with a scale, etched upon a piece of

ground-glass, to serve for verifying scale-coefficients, &c. The scale is divided

Tto fiftieths of an inch, corresponding to the divisions of the square used

with the scale-board (fig. 2, Plate IV., Report for 1819). Also an additional

Hpair of rollers like 6^ fig. 2, has been attached to the left side of ; and an

additional ring has been fixed on the bottom, in order that the frame may be

employed in an inverted position in the slide-case (F), and that thus the

trouble of either preparing two plates per diem, or the necessity and risk of

Hwithdrawing from and replacing the one plate in (at 12 p.m.) might be

avoided*.                   .

These and some other little ameliorations in this instrument were made

   * It was not originally intended that the plate should be inverted {vide fig. 2, Plate XXI.)
for the purpose of procuring the two new lines and the two curves on it. The effect of the
new arrangement has been, in a few instances of magnetic disturbance, to contract the field
on the plate for the range of the image of the slit so much as to exclude a part of the curve.
ON THE KEW OBSERVATORY.  351

with a view of adapting it to the course of experimental trials, as well as its
wooden supports and other wooden appliances, and the use of a mirror (as

above) would permit. It was well known to Col. Sabine and to other gen-
tlemen of the Kew Committee, &c., before those trials began, that although
a long series of good curves on paper had been produced in 1 846, and some
exhibited at the Royal Society in 1847, yet no expectation of accuracy ap-
proaching to that obtained by the otlier two magnetographs, as regards di-
stinctness of the curves, &c,, was ever entertained. It may be also remarked
that its locality is a passage room, and is used for several other purposes.

   The arc value of 1 inch or 50 divisions of the ordinate scale for this in-
strument is, when corrected by the torsion coefficient, 28'71 {vide p. 362,

post.').

   The time of transit of a given point of the photographic surface over the
mouth at (c') is about 5\ minutes (as formerly ascertained).

   The Horizontal-Force Magnetograph, placed on the .stone brackets solidly
attached to the great quadrant wall (and descx-ibed in the Report for 1849,

&c.), has undergone the following alterations :

  A damper, 3 inches broad, ^ inch thick, and having its interior horizontal

surfaces about 1 inch apart, has been substituted for the former damper (6''),
about f inch broad, with its interior surfaces about I5 inch apart. This va-
riation was kindly suggested by Dr. Faraday on a visit to Kew, and has
proved (as he anticipated) a very profitable one. The magnet, which always
performed well, has been rendered remarkably steady by this improvement.

   A new thermometer (by Gary), the tube of which passes through a stopper

in the top of the case, has been affixed.
    Screens have been placed between the lamp and the cases for protection

of the magnet against the h<|at of the flame.
    The sliding-frame (H) has been treated in exactly the same manner as

that of the declination magnetograph.

    The arc value of] inch of the ordinate scale is 109*4.
    The diameter of the pulley (at Ф") is 0-464 in.
    The distance of the ends of the wire (at S) is 0*413 in., and the angle of

torsion 64░"45.

  =The temperature corrections on December 14 were, at 55░*3 0'000312,

and at 76░-2=0-000344.
    The time of passage of a point of the photographic surface over the mouth

e^ is about 1^ minute {vide p. 360, post.).

   A new Vertical-force Magnetograph has been constructed and fixed upon

the three corbels (already mentioned) on the quadrant wall. Its magnet is
nearly perpendicular to the plane of the astronomical meridian, the locality
not, at present, permitting a more favourable disposition.

    This instrument is, in most respects, similar to the vertical-force magne-
tograph which was sent to the Toronto Observatory, and described in the
Report for 1850.

    The following little variations and additions have been made :
    The four brass pillars (Q, fig. 1, Plate JI. of that Report) have been tem-

porarily removed, the intermediate corbel sustaining the magnet, &c. con-

Vtained in the case *.

   X* The slab rests upon the two corbels which are used instead of the piers P^ and P",
& &fig. 1, Plates I. IV., Report for 1849 ; and the slab R, fig. 1, Plates I. II., Report for

 1850, was at first supported by the strong bolts, nuts, &c. of the pillars Q, only very near to
352 REPORT-- 1851.

  &An improved mode of attaching the diaphragm plate O, figs. 1 2, to the
Xslab has been adopted, whereby the horizontal distance between the two

shields 6* and o' is now very easily adjusted.

  A screen has been (occasionally) interposed between the lamp and the

camera.

  A new long-tubed thermometer (by Gary) has been affixed to the magnet

case.

  HThe sliding-frame has been treated in the same manner as that of the

declination magnetograph (vide p. 350, ante).

The temperature corrections of this magnet were, on December 14, 1850,

at 50░'4.= 0-000283 and at 7l░-5=0-000319.

   The time of vibration (with its shield arm l^ and all other appendages) in

--a horizontal plane was, March 31, at a temperature of 52░, =17'9 seconds,

=20and in a vertical plane at 53░,  seconds ; but its time of vertical vibration

has been found several times altered since that day.

The arc value of 1 inch or 50 divisions of the ordinate scale is 76'23.

The transit of a given point of the photographic surface over the mouth

(e') is 1^ minute {vide p. 361, post.).

   Apparatus used in ascertaining arc values of the ordinates of the curves
and errors from distortion, &c. has been made. It is of a very simple kind,

but may be said to consist of four parts.
   The first is a plate of transparent glass, about 3| inches long and fths of

an inch broad, supported by a pair of pillars, &c., and having a scale etched
upon it divided to j^V''^ of an inch.

   The second is a plate of glass, ground to semi-transparency of similar
dimensions, fitted into a frame and similarly divided.

    In making use of these two to ascertain the magnifying power of the lenses,
the transparent scale is placed with its undivided face in contact with the
fixed shield (o*) of all the plates of magnetographs, its scale occupying the
locus of the slit itself in the moveable shield (6') (if the magnet, &c. were in
position), and the semi-transparent plate is placed, with its undivided face, in
contact with the mouth-piece (E), its scale occupying the locus of the Image
of the slit in the moveable shield (the thickness of both plates being properly

adapted to the purpose).

   The lenses (of G) are then adjusted to bring the image of the first-men-
tioned scale into focus as nearly as possible upon the second scale, so that
the image of the first scale and the second scale itself can be conjointly and
scrupulously examined by the microscope {/'') and the corresponding read-

ings noted.

   The third part is merely a long scale, &c. which is employed to measure
the exact distance between the common axis of motion (of the magnet, the
shield-arm, Sec.) and the moveable shield.

   The fourth is (applicable to vertical force instruments only) for measu-
ring the radius from the knife-edge (at b^) to that part of the slit in the
moveable shield which produces a corresponding spot of light at the mouth
(e*) upon the second glass plate.

one of the above-mentioned two corbels. The new short corbel is a substitute for the short
pier ?иии, fig. 1, Plate I., Report for 1850, but this substitution has been here found unne-
cessary {vide p. 561, post.). The original plan of supporting this kind of instrument, i. e. the
method described in the Report for 1850, where the short pier and the pillars are used con-
jointly, and where no pier sustains the extremity of the slab X, is, however, far preferable

perhaps.
ON THE KEW OBSERVATORY.                                            353

    It consists of a pair of sliding tubes, the outer fixed, exactly at right-

angles, to a little base of copper, and a shield with a slit, similar to tlie ordi-
nary moveable shield (o\), fitted to the upper end of the inner tube.

   In using this the copper base is made to rest upon the agate planes (at s^)
in lieu of the ordinary knife-edge of the magnet ; the inner sliding tube is then
slid up or down until the slit in the shield comes to about its proper height
in the plane of the ordinary moveable sliield. Its edge is now marked ex-
actly at that point which produces a corresponding point in its image at the
mouth (e'), and the instrument being removed from the agate planes, the
distance from the lower surface of the copper base to the point marked at
the edge of the slit is easily measured, and is evidently the radius required*.

   The apparatus which has now been described affords us a much more con-
venient means of obtaining the required values than a mirror or a collimator

(attached to the stirrup, &c.), since the shield-arm (6^) of the declination and
horizontal-force magnetographs must have the same angular motion as the
magnet, and it can (as formerly shown) be properly adjusted in azimuth

about the common axis of motion : also there is a provision at the base of

the vertical-force magnet-support which permits a proper horizontal adjust-

ment for the position of the moveable shield of that instrument.
   The first parts may be said to be modifications of contrivances which have

been formerly used for purposes of the same kind as those to which they are
applicable. (They are not quite so accurate, but a little more convenient +.)

   The Scale Board, Lens, &c. used in tabulating all the self-registered curves
remain as described at p. 85, Report for 1849.

  A Drawing Board with Clamps is used for securing the gelatine paper and

Daguerreotype plate firmly in their places for the tracing process.

  A Sliding-rule, invented by Mr. Welsh, has been constructed on the same

principles as that described at p. S^o, " for converting the observed changes
of the horizontal and vertical components of magnetic force into variation
of dip and total force."

  A few specimens of the earlier and latter Daguerreotype curves on their

silvered plates have been preserved ; also some gelatine tracings, some im-
pressions printed from the gelatine tracings on bank-note paper, and some

* Great inconvenience and (probably) damage to the knife-edge would ensue from any

attempt to acquire this measurement by means of the shield-arm {b^), itself in position.

   t The magnifying power of the lenses of the Declination Magnetograph was, in 1846,
ascertained by marking with angular notches, a space of about fths of an inch on the edge
of a thin lamina of brass, placed in the plane of the moveable index, and by comparing the

length of the image projected upon ground glass at the place of the mouth (E) of the said

space with the space itself (on the slip of brass).
   The above-mentioned transparent glass scale is a modification of a metallic screen provided

with a series of slits, formerly used (and described at p. 181, Report for 18.50) in adjustments
for focus, and a plate is preserved exhibiting good and equally distinct impressions of the

images of those slits.
   The distortion occasioned by the use of a plane in lieu of a curved surface to receive the

image, was, from the first, a subject of gi-eat solicitude. It was no easy task to obtain a

tolerably " flat field" from so large a lens-aperture as I am obhged to employ upon an object
much removed sometimes from the axis of the lenses and at a short distance from them,

whilst the lenses were required to magnify several times in the conjugate focus.

   In November 1849, Mr. Fred. Ayrton promised to procure for me from Paris some very

finely divided scales, for the mouth-piece, on semitransparent horn, " for reading the arcs of

vibration described by the magnet in its diurnal variations."  2A

lithographic impressions printed, by first procuring in the copper-plate press
an impression from the gelatine tracing itself, on the lithographer's " Transfer
Paper," and by then printing from that impression transferred to the stone
(as usual)*.

    TheApfaratus of Polishing-hoards, Coating and Mercurializing Boxes, &c.,
remains nearly as described at p. 184, Report for 1850.

    Four small poHshing boards of this kind have been made, and seem to be
improvements upon the frames employed by Daguerreotypists usually.

    Mr. Dent's Chronometer, a Sextant, and an Artificial Horizon,
have been used for keeping Greenwich mean time. The two latter instru-
ments were sent by Colonel Sabine from Woolwich.

                    The Apparatus not (or very little) used

in this year, and belonging to the Association, or on loan to it, is enumerated

in our MS. catalogue with all the above.

The observations at Kew in this year have chiefly related to investigations

on the interesting subject of Frequency of atmospheric electricity, and a pro-

minent object of the inquiry has been the attainment of data for the addition

of proper apparatus to a Photo-electrograph of the kind formerly describedf,

whereby the study of this subject may be facilitated by means which appear

to me peculiarly well calculated for the purpose.

   The form of our Electro-meteorological Journal remains as described in
my Report for 1844, with the exceptions observable in the annexed specimen

and the following revised account.

AIn column is stated the time of each observation by the Dent's chrono-

meter, which " was kept always very near to Greenwich mean time by occa-

sional sextant observations of tlie sun and by casual comparisons, by means

--of a pocket watch, with standard clocks in London. The epochs noticed in

this column are, 1st, the time of the barometer observation, which was about

the middle time of the ordinary meteorological observations. The tempera-

ture of the air and the hygrometer were observed before the barometer, and

the wind, weather, &c. immediately thereafter; 2nd. the time of observing

the elec ti ical tension of the air and of the commencement of the frequency

observation                                                    and  .'frd, the  time when the electrometer was considered  to have
                                                            ;

re-acquired its full tension after discharge."

   * The tabulations and gelatine tracings produced during " the course of experimental
trials," will, at its termination, belong, I presume, to the Royal Society (bv agreement),

  NIn column B the Pletter indicates a positive and a negative charge of

the conductor, &c., as ascertained by the use of the Distinguisher.

  DIn C and the electrical observations of tension are noted as observed by

means of the Volta- and Henley-electrometers. The letter V^ refers to Volta's

standard electrometer (whose scale is divided in half-Paris lines as stated),
and V'^ to his second, whose scale divisions are each equal to 5 of the V' (as
also stated). The value of tension, as observed by means of V«, is set down

V Hin terms of ; the letter refers to the Henley, one degree of whose scale,

in the lower readings, is equal to about 100 divisions of Volta. (It has sel-

dom been used for the frequency observations.)

  HThe columns E, F, G, have not been used.

    In I are contained from 3 to 7 daily results, carefully obtained between
September 10, 1850, and iVIarch 29, 1851, by methods somewhat differing

from those which were adopted under instructions to the observer last year.
    " Slips of paper, about 1 8 inches long, were affixed to the observer's clock.

The brass time-scale, which is divided in accordance with the rate at which
the index travels over the paper, was applied to the slips, and spaces corre-
sponding to every 60 seconds marked off on the paper. At commencing a
' Frequency observation,' the tension was noted, the index was set to the

zero division on the paper, and the clock started ; the electrometer being at
the same instant discharged. As the index came successively over each
mark, the tension was observed by the electrometer and the scale reading re-
corded against the mark on the paper. These observations were continued

(for the most part) until, from the progression of the readings, the conductor

seemed to have acquired the full tension corresponding to the electrical state
of the air at the period. The inverse measure of frequency adopted is the
number of minutes between the time when the electrometer is discharged,
and the time when the readings of the electrometer have again attained to
one-half of their full amount. As the observations were in general continued
until the tension shown by the electrometer had reached its full amount, we
have thus a means of approximately allowing for the change in the electrical
tension of the air during the progress of the experiment. The numbers given
in the column ' Frequency,' are therefore, when the change of tension has not
been great, got in this way, viz. half the mean between the tension shown
before discharging the conductor, and that after the scale readings have again
become constant, is taken ; and the interval of time after discharge corre-

sponding to this reading is taken as the ' Frequency.'

  KIn column are contained the original readings of the mountain baro-

meter until January 9, 1851, and of the standard barometer after that time.

   In L the readings are those of the annexed thermometers, whose bulbs are

immersed in the mercury of the cisterns.

  MIn the corrections of the mountain barometer embrace temperature

corrections as applied to glass scales, given in the Report of the Committee

of Physics of the Royal Society, which corrections were necessary, because
the brass scale does not extend to the cistern. " All the observations of this

instrument have been corrected for temperature, capacity and capillarity."
   " The observations" of the standard " are all corrected for temperature by

Schumacher's tables. No corrections have been applied for capillarity."

   It was found by fifty comparisons, made with due precautions, &c., that
" the mountain barometer read 0*02 inch higher than the standard. All the

observations previous to January 9, 1851, will therefore require a correction

--of 0*02 to make them comparable with those after that date."
  In N the readings are those of the Rutherford minimum and maximum

                                                                                                .2 A 2

 applied. The minimum temperature was generally read at 10'' a.m. and the
 maximum at sunset."

   OIn are contained the corrected readings of the dry standard thermome-

 ter by Newman, until September 22 (23''), and of Ronchetti's dry after that

 date ; both affixed to the stand.

    In P are contained the corrected readings of the small wet-bulb thermo-
 meter by Newman, which belonged to the Mason's hygrometer, until Sep-

 tember 22 (23''), and of Ronchetti's wet-bulb after that date.

   QIn the differences between the readings of the dry and wet thermometers

 are stated.

   RIn is contained the observed dew-point by the old Daniel hygrometer

 until February 1, 1851. The little break in the mercurial column of the
 immersed thermometer of this instrument occasioned probably " no appre-

 ciable error in the observations, as a strict watch was kept on the constancy
of the break." After February 1 the dew-point was observed by the new
instrument. " The observations of dew-point, as entered in the Journal,
 have not been corrected for index error."

    S has been scarcely used.

   In T are contained some occasional readings of the Saussure 8-haired

hygrometer, not corrected for the error of its scale.

   U VIn and are contained the resultsof observations of the rain- and vapour-

gauge. The mode of using it was as formerly. " The reading was noted
and the index set to zero at sunset. When the reading showed that the
evaporation had been greater than the precipitation, the result was noted in

Ucolumn ; and when the reverse was the case, the entry was made in co-

lumn V."

  WIn is contained the amount in cubic inch measure of precipitation be-

tween sunset and sunset, as ascertained by means of the old Rain-gauge
and measure.

   XIn the direction of the wind is noted, as shown by the Vane on the

Dome.

   YIn the static pressure of wind is noted from observations of the Balance

(standard) anemometer, used as formerly*.

   In the space (?. e. a page) headed General Remarks, ^c, the figures

adjoining the margin denote the estimated " Extent of cloudy sky, a clear
sky being considered 0, and a complete covering of clouds 10."

    " The general remarks and occasional observations include the kinds of
clouds prevalent, general remarks on the weather and meteorological phae-
nomena, and notes on the electrical observations."

    They comprise, in addition, notices when the Lamp, in the Volta's lantern,
at the head of the conductor was known to be not burning, or burning low.

    Both that lamp and the lamp which warms the glass support of the con-
ductor, &c., were constantly burning, wiih the above-mentioned rare excep-
tions. They were trimmed three or four times per diem.

four. These were generally made at about 9 and 11 a.m., and 1, 3 and 5 p.m.
The daily mean number between October 1 and March 28 is nearly six,
usually made at about 7 and 10 a.m., and 1, 4, 7 and 10 p.m., at about one
hour after sunrise and at about sunset.

    The mean number of daily compound observations recorded is, from Sep-
tember 10 to 30, about three, and from October 1 to March 28 about five;
the highest monthly mean is seven (in October).

    Some of the circumstances which have operated to prevent the chosen
number of eight daily observations having been uniformly completed, were,
absence of flame in the lantern occasioned by high wind, &c. great

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

 and irregular disturbance of the pendulums of the electrometers occasioned

 by dust, &c. injuring the insulation, violent wind suggesting the caution of
securing the conductor from damage by means of stays (of cord) attached
 to it ; violent wind and rain ; the necessary absence of the observer ; and
 the intervention of Sundays (but even on these days three observations have
been almost constantly made at about 7, 9 and 10 a.m.).

     Five instances only are recorded of absence of signs, but the gold-leaf

--electroscope was not used. These were on January 9*^ 20*^ 50', on March

 5^ l^ 0', on March 5"^ 2>'^ 57', on March 10'^ 4'^ 4', and on March 19"* 3^ 57',
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        .

 and were marked cases of disturbance. In two or three of these instance*
 the circumstances of weather were precisely those in which the atmosphere
itself has been commonly believed to be totally uninsulating, viz. those of

great and long-continued humidity. On March 10 the readings were high

 and negative in several observations before that at 4'' 4', and positive in seve-
 ral afterwards ; a state of transition might therefore have existed at the ob-

 servation at 4'' 4' *.

    Some of the above-mentioned circumstances have operated much more
 frequently in unfitting a compound observation for employment in the fre-
 quency deductions (entered in column I.), than in preventing an observation
 entirely ; and some even of those entries were obtained under circumstances
 of weather, conditions of the apparatus, &c., which render them somewhat

 objectionable in discussion.

    This (so-called) Frequency course terminated, necessarily, at the end of
 March (in order that the Magnetic course might commence (on April 1));

but between April 14 and May 14 about forty single electrical observations,

 accompanied by others for pressure, temperature, &c., as above, were re-
 corded at rather irregular intervals ; most frequently at about 10 a.m., 4 p.m.
 and 10 p.m.

III. EXPERIMENTS, &c.

The principal operations, &c., of which 1 set down a brief summary under

Athis head, scarcely commenced before September 1850.  classified state-

ment may perhaps be found more convenient than an enumeration of thera

in the exact order of their dates would have been.

                                   Horizontal-force Magnetograph.

   On August 3 1,1 850, this instrument was rendered more sensitive than it had

the " frequency paper," and employed in deducing the value, in inverse proportion, of fre-
quency set down in column I. {vide p. 354, ante).

   * Rain attended the four last-meutioued observations. It may possibly have fallen from
a neutral part of a cloud or stratum, electrified by induction, and may not have acquired a

sensible charge in its descent.

hitherto been, by substituting one of the smaller pulleys, i. e. No. 9 (s^, Plate

IV., Report for 1849), diameter 0*'t64 inch, for that before used, i. e. No. 12,

diameter 0"614 inch, and by making the interval at the upper ends of the

Awire(s) less than this quantity.  still smaller pulley (i. e. No. 8) had been

tried with parallel wires, and found to be too small (thus used) to allow the

magnet to be placed at right angles to the magnetic meridian. The adjust-

ments were made by ^leans of the torsion apparatus (S), and by using the

image of the slit in the moveable shield (6'), projected upon ground glass at

the mouth-piece (E).

   On September 2, a very unsatisfactory mechanical agitation of the magnet

was evinced by the photographic curve ; and on the 5th some additional

precautions were taken to prevent the interference of air-currents with its

natural motions.

On September 7, the instrument having still exhibited symptoms of dis-

turbance, evidently not magnetic, was rendered less sensitive, by placing the

upper ends of the wire (s^) at an interval of 0*51 inch from each other. The

angle of torsion was thus reduced by 21░, 19░ more than it had been before

August 31.

On September 19 and 20, new adjustments, &c. were made. The angle

of torsion was fixed at 52░ 25', and the arc value of 1 inch, or 50 divisions

of the ordinate scale (fig. 2, Plate XXI.), was found to be 109'*G ; or the arc

 value, in parts of the whole horizontal force of the ordinate for j-Vth of an

^ inch, was =0'00049. On this occasion " a scale was drawn on gelatine paper,

one division being made equal to ^^j''^ ░f ^"^ inch, and placed beside the

ground surface of glass in the camera sliding-frame" (H).

On the 26th, a little adjustment of the shields took place.

In October it was worked with some regularity. [A specimen of October

16 is reserved.]

On the 5th it was found that the time of the passage of a given point on

the Daguerreotype plate over the aperture of the mouth (at E) was about 2

minutes*.

On November 1, it was minutely inspected by Colonel Sabine and some

further adjustments were made.

On the 15th, Dr. Faraday visited the Observatory and recommended the

use of the very broad damper alluded to at p. 351, ante.

   On December 14, experiments were made in Dr. Lloyd's manner for de-

termining its temperature corrections ; when eight observations at the mean
temperature of 55░'3 gave 0*000312, and eight observations at 76░'7 gave

0-000344.

On January 10, 1851, the new broad damper was affixed.

   Between January 20 and March 20 it was worked pretty constantly.

New adjustments and determinations of its coefficients were made on the

latter day, when the magnifying power of the lenses was found to be 3*46

times (by means of the apparatus described at p. 352, ante), and the distance

from the axis of motion of the magnet, &c., to the moveable shield (b^) was

ascertained (by direct measurement) to be 9'08 inches ; consequently the arc

value of 1 inch of the ordinate scale was, as stated, 109'-4 (p. 351, ante).

   At the end of March the screens were attached at the object-end of the

camera, and a tliernioraeter (by Adie) was inserted in the magnet case (V).
The temperature of the air of the magnet case without these screens was

raised about 4░ by the heat of the lamp. It was found that the time of passage
of a given point over the aperture of the mouth was about 1^ minute.

   On April 1 at m. it was put in motion for the due prosecution of the pro-

posed experimental trials.

   About the 2nd of May a cessation of its activity occurred for two days,

spent in minor improvements, as that of substituting the larger thermometer
by Gary, for that previously used, &c.

   From April 1 to this time, i. e. July 1, the thermometer has been read at

intervals of about three liours.

   The Daguerreotype curves, &c. produced daily, with the above-mentioned
exception, from the commencement of the series of trials to the present time
by means of this instrument, have almost constantly afforded means of mea-
suring ordinates (in the manner described at p. 9 of the Report for 1849)
to -^lodth of an inch, and generally of describing ckar gelatine tracings (in
the manner alluded to at p. 185 of the Report for 1850).

                                    Vertical- Foice Magnetograph.

    In September and November 1850, drawings and instructions were given
to Mr. Ross, Mr. Barrow, and others, for constructing principal parts of
this new instrument preparations were made for its reception ; and work on

                                                                                        ;

it proceeded here.

   On December 14, its magnet, &c. having arrived, experiments for deter-
mining its temperature coefficient were made at the same time as, and in

like manner to those on the horizontal-force magnetograph ; when nine ob-
servations, at the mean temperature of 50'**4, gave O''*000283, and II obser-
vations, at 71░-5, gave 0░'000319.

   On the 21st Mr. Ross's part arrived.
   On February 8, the apparatus described at p. 352 having been completed,

observations were made to determine the magnifying power of the lenses, and
to examine the effect of distortion by its means. The results from two series
of observations were, that the magnifying power was 3'81 times, and that " the
aberration was very small, so small indeed as to render it uncertain whether
 the image, in the middle of the field, was greater or less than at the ends;
the whole amount of apparent difference being quite within the probable
error of observation." In this case the ground glass plate, at the mouth (E),
 was divided to ^th of an inch*.

   On February 10, it was ascertained that no sensible difference in the Da-

 guerreotype impression was produced by enlarging the aperture at the object-
 end (C) of the camera.

    On February 24, measurements were made to ascertain the radius,

 viz. 11*9 inch, from the knife-edge to that part of the slit in the moveable
 shield (o') which corresponds with the moveable image in the conjugate
 focus at the mouth-piece (E), by means of the instrument described at p. 352,

 ante.

    On the 25th this magnetograph was mounted upon its corbels (in the qua-

 drant room) and partially adjusted for work.

    On March 3, the transit of a given point of the Daguerreotype plate over

 the mouth (at E) was made to occupy 1^ minute.

    On the 10th it was ready for further trials, and on this day a good curve

 was produced; but soon afterwards (on the 19th) we found that the curves

                        * The spherical aberration of the lenses was not examined.
ON THE KEW OBSERVATORY.  361

were gradually (and bodily) approaching the zero-line. It was therefore
examined by the maker of the magnet himself, who could see nothing in the
disposition of the other parts to prevent the proper action of the magnet.
The screen for preventing the bad effect of heat from the lamp was applied
(as to the other force instrument), and the slit in the moveable shield {Ц),
having been found too narrow, was widened.

   On the 31st it underwent adjustments and examinations which we hoped

would be final. The radius was found to be 11 '93 inches (as on the 24th
inst.). The magnifying power of the lenses was 3-78 times, as ascer-
tained by the method described above. The arc value of 1 inch of the
ordinate scale was consequently 76''23. The time of vibration (viz. 17*9
seconds) in a horizontal plane, at a temperature of 52░, was determined by
suspending it, protected from currents of air, from a solid support by a small
silken thread, and by using a microscope with cross wires, to view a mark
on the shield (6^). Its time of vibration in a vertical plane, viz. 20 seconds,
at a temperature of 53░, was determined, by observing the oscillations of the
I'mag-e of the slit at the mouth-piece (E) and the chronometer. The time of
transit of a point of the plate over the mouth was found to-be about 1^ minute.

   On April 1 at m. it was brought into activity for the " trials ;" but the curve

soon began to exhibit great dislocations, and also the former tendency to ap-

proach the zero line. A condensing lens was afterwards mounted in front of the

camera(A),in order that the lamp might be removed to a greater distance from

it; but dislocations, &c. in the curve gave evidence of mechanical vibration

having occurred at the times of putting the plates into the slider-case (F)

and removing and replacing the lamp, i. e. at sunrise and set, and we
believed it possible that some cause of unsteadiness might still exist in the
mountings, particularly in the brass pillars (Q). These were therefore dis-
carded, ybr the present, and the intermediate corbel was very firmly planted

and cemented upon the plinth of the quadrant-wall to supply their place.
The whole stone and marble-work was rendered as secure against vibra-
tion as an experienced mason could make it. The magnet had altered its
time of vibration in the vertical plane to 1 seconds, and various changes of

this kind have since occurred (as stated).

   On the 9th the time of transit of a point of the plate over the mouth was

I5 minute.

   On May 2, the larger thermometer having been substituted for a smaller,

it was deemed ready to resume its functions ; but, on the next day, disloca-
tions, &c. corresponding with the usual times were shown by the curve

thus rendering it highly improbable that instability of the four very stout pil-
lars (Q) or of any fittings had produced the bad effect.

   On the 5th this conclusion was confirmed by discovering that the disloca-

tions were occasioned, principally, by the removal of the soft iron bars of the

neighbouring window-shutters, from a vertical to a horizontal position, and

vice versa at the above-mentioned periods (a precisely similar case to one which

had long since occurred relatively to the declination instrument, and had been
forgotten). The bars were therefore now (as was one bar formerly) discarded.

After this time the great dislocations ceased ; but a few instances have since
arisen of extremely sudden variations in the curves of all the magnets
simultaneously, which might have been mistaken for mechanical disturbances,
if they had not been simultaneous ; and some other small dislocations of these
vertical. force curves evince unnatural motions of the magnet.

   On June 4 it had altered its time of vertical vibration.
--362 REPORT 1851.

   The daily Daguerreotype impressions have been almost equal in sharpness
to those of the horizontal-force instrument. But there still exists some im-

perfection (probably in the knife-edge) requiring attention.

                                      Declination Magnetograph.

   In March 1851, some of the improvements, described at p. 350, ante, on
this old instrument {vide PI. XI. Phil. Trans. Pt. I. for 1847), were exe-

cuted here.

   On the 26th it was carefully examined. The wedges were tightened and

the camera (A), &c. were adjusted, by turning them through a small arc upon
the axis of the suspending skein, so as to cause the image of the zero slit in
the fixed shield to occupy its proper place at the mouth (E) on the ground
glass scale (or on the silver plate or Talbotype paper)*.

   On the 27th, 29th and 31st, further examinations and adjustments were
made. The suspending skein seemed to have remained nearly unaltered,

since 1846, as to the condition of its fibres : a torsion of 10░ only existed
(which was eliminated in the computations), but the effect of a twist given

to it =90░ of the torsion circle displaced the magnet a quantity =44░. The

distance from the axis of motion to the moveable shield (in the place of b^)

was 18 inches. The magnifying power of the lenses was =6706 times (as

ascertained by the means described at p. 352). The arc value of 1 inch of
the ordinate scale, when corrected by the torsion coefficient, was 28░*71.

   On April 1 at m. it was put into activity for the " trials," and, in the course

of this month, several little improvements (not affecting its indications) were

made.

   On the 29th it was found that, in consequence either of the fixed shield

having descended or of the moveable shield having risen, light had passed
between the edges of them to the photographic plate. The delay of a day
was therefore required, in order to remedy the evil, by lengthening the zero
slit in the mouth-piece, and lowering the moveable shield a very little. These
expedients answered the purpose at that time, but similar faults required se-

veral repetitions of the last-mentioned process afterwards ; therefore,

   On June 14, the wooden bearers (X) were raised, and four perpendicular

supports of straight-grained deal, resting upon the rafters belo'w, were placed
under them. This expedient will not, probably, secure the instrument against
errors arising from the use of wood for hearers, fittings, &c., and perhaps the

expansion and contraction of the skein.
    It has nevertheless generally presented us with curves, measurable to

-i-dth of an inch at least. The exceptions occur in a few instances of
magnetic disturbance. The damper (a narrow one composed of wood with
a coat of copper electrotyped upon it) seems to have little effect.

                        Tabulating and Tracing the Magnetic Curves.                            I

    Colonel Sabine has in his Report {ante) clearly and ably described the
nature and modes of procedure which have been carried out, by Mr. Welsh,
relative to these operations ; and the apparatus employed has been detailed
at p. 84 of the British Association Report for 1849.

   * In 1846 a similar kind of adjustment was made, which suggested the possibility of adapt-
ing apparatus of telescope, &c. to a metallic camera, &c., which might be moved about the
axis of the suspending skein in the manner of Colonel Beaufoy's variation transit-box, and
thus become a means of procuring self-registered curves of absolute determination, if it were

desirable.
ON THE KEW OBSERVATORY.  363

   The number of daily curves tabulated and traced before the experimental
trials commenced on April 1st, is not considerable. The number since then

to the present time is about 200.
    It only remains here to annex lithographed specimens of printed curves

and their abscissae (or zero lines), Plate XXIII., which specimens were printed
in the manner described at p. 353, ante. It is not pretended that the litho-
graph is equal, in sharpness and accuracy, to the original impression from
the gelatine. It is made use of merely because a sufficient numbor of im-
pressions for this Report could not be obtained probably from the gelatine.

   Impressions made in September from the gelatine on India-paper, were
very good ; but the use of bank-note paper was preferred, on account of

its very superior toughness and less liability to adhere to the gelatine under

the press. The impressions on bank-note paper were very nearly equal to
the India-paper impressions. The number which could be "pulled" from
the gelatine itself would be ample for distribution to other observatories, &c.

   On February 18, a specimen of the action, on Talhotype paper, of the

horizontal-force magnetograph sent to the Toronto Observatory, arrived
here. About half of the curve had been produced by day-light and the re-
mainder by lamp-light. The outline, as viewed by the naked eye, seemed
 tolerably well defined (in both cases) ; but when examined under the same
 magnifying power as that used in tabulating the curves received upon silver,
 was found to be much less perfect than in these curves : it exhibited a little
 fringe, evidently due to the spongy texture of the paper, and was quite in-
 adequate to measurements, equally minute, with those of lines received
 upon a silver surface*.

                        The Magnetographs and Magnets in general.

     In September 1850, it was ascertained that the cost of Lucca oil consumed
 in the Rumford polyflame lamps used with these instruments, was about 0*8
 penny per hour for each.

     In December, and at long intervals subsequently, the improvements upon
 the sliding-frames (H), as regards the scales (vide p. 350), were prosecuted.
 The first were engraved by Ross with a diamond point.

     By the end of March it had been found that the etching process, by means
 of hydrofluoric acid, produced scales on the ground glass well-adapted to the
 purposes; and the dividing machine of M. Perreaux was very advantage-
  ously employed in this operation.

    On January 24, Mr. Welsh explained his plan for applying his sliding

  rule system to computations relative to magnetic curves.
     About June 15 a working drawing of the dip and total-force sliding-rule

 was made. It was put into Mr. Adie's hands, who constructed it in box-
  wood ; it has, together with Mr. Welsh's description of it, been exhibited
  and delivered to the Secretary of the Physical Section.

      In March, and subsequently, the Toronto vertical-force magnetograph
  was examined and corrected. [A screw had become loose and the knife-
  edge a little damaged.]

      * I cannot help adverting here to an evident mistake in the Athenaeum of July 12, 1851,

  p. 784, where the Astronomer Royal is made to imply that my method of self-registration

  does not embrace the use of the paper process ; whereas it has been clearly shown that, be-
  tween April 1844 and February 1849, 1 used no other ; that specimens, so procured, have been

  approved by himself, and that the Kew magnetographs were always equally applicable

   to either the Talbotype or the Daguerreotype process at the pleasure of the observer or pho-
  tographist. They can be as easily applied to any new photographic process I believe.
 364 REPORT-- J 851.

     In June a little progress was made in the construction of a new Declination
 magnetograph, or rather in new mechanism, to be substituted for some parts

  of the old declination instrument.

     From April 1 to this time, i. e. during the course of the experimental trials
 of the three magnetographs, the Daguerreotype plates prepared by Mr.

 Nicklin, our photographist, were put into the instruments daily, with the few
  exceptions stated, at meridian as nearly as possible, the exact time (by Dent's
 chronometer, with proper corrections) being known for each. They were
 inverted at 12 p.m. (as nearly as possible).

     The course of experimental trials for six months was undertaken in accord-

 ance with a wifh expressed by the Kew Committee. I should have been

 better pleased if I could have previously substituted a declination magneto-
 graph, similar in general construction to the horizontal-force magnetograph,
 instead of the original instrument set up before many of the improvements since
 adopted had been made, and if I could have attempted other improvements
 on all the magnetographs (as that of substituting pointed for rectangular
 magnets, in order to diminish the time of vibration, &c.). The Royal Society
 granted me, in the kindest manner, a sum not exceeding Б100 to be applied
 to the costs attending the trials, of which sum about one-third has been ex-
 pended (and an exact account with vouchers maintained).

                                                    Thermometers

    On September 21 and 23, comparisons of Newman's standard thermometer

 were made with various thermometers ; their index corrections are recorded
at pp. 342 and 343.

   On February 22, the dividing machine by M. Perreaux, together with
the adaptations and other thermometric apparatus of M. Regnault's (alluded

 to at p. 346, ante), arrived, and soon afterwards Captain Lefroygave some ex-
planations concerning the former, and made satisfactory trials of their appli-
cability to the accurate calibration and division of thermometer tubes. In
these and subsequent trials a diamond point was sometimes used, and when
the etching process, by means of hydrofluoric acid, was preferred, some diffi-
culty occurred as to the choice of a proper "ground." Oil of Spike (lavender)

was found to answer the purpose tolerably well. An incomplete attempt
was made to etch plates of glass by Fluorine gas. Some tubing, entirely of

vulcanized India-rubber, was advantageously substituted for the original
tubing compounded of this material and glass in the operation of moving
the calibring mercury in the thermometer tubes*.

   On February 23, the maximum Rutherford thermometer (F) was found

to have been destroyed.

   On April 3, the Sub-committee of the Kew Observatory, appointed to

direct the construction and verification of standard thermometers, &c.,
made experiments for determining the freezing- and boiling-points of a

standard thermometer of M. Regnault, No. 229, or Woolwich standard,

which Colonel Sabine brought (with another by Ronchetti) ; also of

the standard Regnault, No. 231 (or Kew standard). The freezing-points

of the above Ronclietti, Newman's standard (C), the immersed ther-
mometer in the improved Regnault hygrometer, and the immersed thermo-
meter of the new Daniel hygrometer, were also determined. The apparatus
used was a part of that referred to at p. S46, and the results obtained are
already stated, excepting that the boiling-point of the Regnault No. 229, or

         ^* further improvement for effecting this object is contemplated.

Woolwich standard, was at 578*1 div., and its freezing-point at very nearly
92'1 div., and that the barometer reading, reduced to 32░, was 30*093 inches,
and the temperature of the room about 55░.

   In June considerable progress had been made in calibring, graduating,
&c. thermometers as standards ; some tubes having been selected with great
care for this purpose, and about six complete standard instruments have been
made.

                                                 Hygrometers, ^c.

On September 18, 1850, experiments had been made for testing the

Saussure eight-haired hygrometer*. It had been placed in a receiver, first

with chloride of calcium and then with water. After several trials and ad-

justments of the instrument, the result was that " dryness" corresponded to

-- 5 degrees of the scale, and "humidity" to 105, the temperature during the

experiment being about 62░.

In this month arrangements weje made for some experiments on tension

Aof vapour, according to Mr. Broun's method.  little apparatus was after-

wards constructed and some progress made.

On the 18th, Captain Ludlow presented to us the Hygrometer and aspira-

tor of M. Regnaultf in their original forms, and made some satisfactory com-

parisons with the former and the Daniel; they corresponded to about 0░*2.

On October 11, Colonel Sykes went over a series of observations with

Mr. Welsh of the wet and dry bulbs, and the (above-mentioned) Regnault

hygrometer, and suggested a form of record for the hygrometric observa-

tions, and the use of one standard dry thermometer for those observations.

At about this time, and subsequently in examining and using this Regnault

hygrometer and its aspirator, it was observed that at low temperatures an

obstruction occasioned by the position of the cork would prevent the con-

venient reading of the immersed thermometer ; that the cistern, composed of

glass, united to metal by cement, was very apt to become leaky (in conse-

quence of the great variation of temperature to which they are often sub-

jected) ; that no trifling waste of aether was occasioned by decantinor this

expensive material from one vessel to another at each period of observation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

that no line of demarcation (as in the Daniel) assisted the precise observation

of the dew-point moment ; and that the aspirator required to be refilled with

water, at, sometimes, a very unseasonable moment, and always with waste of

time, &c.

On November 15, drawings illustrating a proposal for methods of ob-

viating these inconveniences, &c. were made and submitted to Colonel Sykes's

consideration, and his approval was the inducement for giving instructions

(on November 2(5) for constructing a new instrument.

It arrived at the end of February, and early in March, having been found

to answer the intended purposes well in most respects, was brought into use.

Subsequently various little ameliorations have taken place which have brought

it to the state already described |.

   On October 25, a drawing of the parapet in front of the door of the North

Hall was made for the guidance of M. Regnault in constructing his dew-point

apparatus for Kew.

On Jan. 14, Mr. Welsh made a full description and diagram of his hy-

grometric sliding rule.

--366 REPORT 1851.

   On the 18th, Colonel Sabine examined and highly approved of the inven-         I
tion: between this time and the end of June the standard scale, of German
silver, used in its graduation, was divided by means of M. Perreaux's engine,

and the rule itself was completed by Mr, Adie in box- wood. The instrument
was in June sent to Ipswich for exhibition to the Physical Section, together
with a description of it, and both have been delivered to the Secretary of the

Section.

   On May ] 6, experiments were made by and in presence of Colonel Sykes

and Captain James, R.E., for testing the action of the improved Regnault
hygrometer, and for other purposes. These experiments formed five series
but there being some reason to suspect an error in the observation of the
Regnault in the first series, it was declared to be not " trustworthy," and the
last having been made by a gentleman visitor, not accustomed to observations
of this kind, should not perhaps be included in the following summary.

   Two series were made in the North Entrance Hall, where the atmospheric

temperature fell, during their continuance, from 62░ to 61░, and the barometer
stood at ;30-018 and 30-14 corrected.

   The general result of these two were, that the observed dew-point of the
Daniel hygrometer was 0░*4 lower than that of the Regnault, and that the
dew-point by the wet-bulb hygrometer, as reduced by Dr. Apjohn's formula,
was 1░"5 higher than that of the Regnault, and as reduced by the use of Mr.

Glashier's factors, ^Z░'b5 higher.

   Two series were made on the platform (in open air) in front of the North

Hall, where the temperature fell from 60░'9 to 59░'6 during their continuance,
and the barometer stood at SO'Ol in.

   The general results of these were, that the observed dew-point, by the
Daniel and the Regnault, exactly coincided, and that the dew-point by the
wet bulb, using Apjohn's formula, was 1░ lower than that of the Regnault,
and using Glashier's factors, 2░'75 higher.

   The dew-point apud Apjohn was computed by means of Colonel Boilieu's

tables.

   The lowest temperature which we could procure by the action of the Reg-
nault was 16░, and by the Daniel 4-1░. The atmospheric temperature was 62░.
(but previous and subsequent trials gave a much greater difference).

   An experiment was made in the North Hall, at the suggestion and by desire

of Colonel Sykes, to ascertain the difference between the indications of the
dry and wet thermometers when at rest, and when put into rapid motion, by
whirling them, attached to a line held in the hand, through the air. The

--motion produced no sensible change on the dry, but a difference of 0░'9 on

the wet. Precautions having been taken to obtain accurate readings, the dry,
hefore the motion, stood at 61░"8, wet 52░'8, dew-point computed 44░-4, ob-
served 42░'4 ; the dry, after the motion, read 61░'8, wet 51░',9, dew-point
computed 42░*2, observed 42░*4.

    Between the end of September 1850 and this time, many comparisons, ob-
servations and remarks have been made relative to the Wet-bulb, the Daniel
and the Regnault hygrometers, " chiefly with the view of ascertaining to what
extent the indications of the Wet-bulb, as commonly observed, are to be de-
pended upon."

    " The number of comparisons with Daniel's hygrometer has been some-
 what above 500, and with Regnault's about 270," in which all the corrections
 for index errors, the computations (by Apjohn's formula, with the use of
 Colonel Boilieu's tables), and the requisite observances for attaining accuracy
were made.
ON THE KEW OBSERVATORY.  367

   The details will be stated wlicn these, together with additional comparisons,
shall have received more complete discussion than they yet have.

   The following experiments and remarks were made in the course of these

inquiries, &c.
    Instead of taking the mean between the reading of the immersed thermo-

meter at the first appearance of dew on the bright bulb of the Daniel, and the
reading at the time of its disappearance for the determined dew-point, in order
to eliminate the error which might arise in the estimation of the dew-point
from the continued fall of the thermometer after the first appearance of dew,
the observer checked the internal evaporation from the aether in the bright
bulb, " whenever the dew has shown itself by touching with the hand the
covered bulb (upon which the aether is poured), and thus preventing an undue
accumulation of water" on the briglit bulb, and giving time for the mass of
aether, the immersed thermometer and the bulb itself to acquire a uniform
temperature at the dew-point moment.

    In the cisterns of the Regnault hygrometers, the continual agitation of the
aether (by the passage of air bubbles through it) served to produce the re-
quisite uniformity of temperature throughout the mass of aether and the bulb
of the immersed thermometer.

    In experimenting with the improved Regnault, the difficulty alluded to at
p. 345, of "catching the exact instant of the formation of dew," was not found
to have been completely obviated by the method there described*. But " the
agreement between the two dew-point instruments is generally good, the
discordance rarely amounting to one degree ; the dew-point by Regnault
being generally somewhat lower than by the Daniel."

   " The expenditure of aether is somewhat greater in the Regnault than in
the Daniel, which however may perhaps be compensated by the inferior qua-

lity consumed."

   Experiments similar to those made on May 16 (vide p. 366, ante), on the

effect of a current of air on the wet bulb, " have been repeated several times
since, and always with a like result. It has also been found that a moderate

agitation of the air produces the maximum amount of depression. Similar

results have been found in the ordinary comparisons in the open air ; the
agreement between the computed and observed dew-points being greater
when a moderate wind was blowing than when the air was still."

                                                       Barometers.

   Between September 23 and November 16, 1850, a series of 167 com-
parisons was made between the mountain barometer and the photo-barome-
trograph ; " but as there can be little doubt that considerable discrepancies
which the comparison showed might be partly owing to the imperfect stand-
ard of comparison employed, no confidence is placed in the results from this

series."

   In October Colonel Sykes recommended the acquisition of a good standard

barometer.

   In January the standard barometer of Newman (vide p. Sie, ante) arrived

from Colonel Sabine, and soon afterwards, by his desire, its new attached
thermometer was added.

   Between January 23 and March 30, about 200 comparisons, &c. were
made between this barometer and the photo-barometrograph ; the principal
results of which were, that the range upon the Daguerreotype plate (at E,

                                    * Further trials on this point are in progress.

fig. 1, Plate XXII.) of the image of the surface of the mercury in the tube

'(at i') is rather more than twice the range of the mercury itself; that the com-

pensation was overdone by about -^gth of the wliole amount ; and that the

mean error of an observation, from a whole series of 181 comparisons, was

0*0028 inch. It was thought " only fair to suppose that a portion of this mean

error is to be ascribed to the standard barometer ;" and I fear a portion may

be attributed to dry rot or other cause of infirmity in the flooring of the

quadrant-room, that end of the frame-work (P) which carries the barometer

being much nearer to tlie wall of the building than the image end. "The

comparisons do in fact exliibit some symptoms of alterations in the floor,"

These comparisons, and the numerous computations, &c. required, were

"Anmade with great care, and yield a very satisfactory general result.  error

of 0*002 inch in an observation would not be greater than might be expected

in a standard barometer*."

                            Anemometer.

   On September 27, Mr.Howlet, of the Ordnance Office, brought an experi-

mental anemometer for comparison with our balance anemometer {vide p. 341,
ante), and for examination.

    It was speedily erected upon the leads at the southern end of the observa-
tory, and the action of both instruments was watched during about half an
hour. The mean result was, that the former gave about one-tenth more for
pressure of wind than the latter.

   At Mr. Howlet's request, a note was addressed to Sir John Burgoyne, in
which I expressed an opinion that an instrument of the kind, exhibited by
Mr. Howlet, might answer the purpose of a portable anemometer, applicable
in the intended manner, if properly constructed.

   Mr. Howlet made a sketch of his model, and left it at the Observatory.

               IV. MISCELLANEOUS MEMORANDA.

   On September 12, 1850, Mr. Jesse (of the Woods and Forests) visited

the building, and promised to represent its state as regards dry rot, &c.

   On October 5, an interesting account of an Aurora Borealis, which oc-

curred on the evening of the 2nd, was received from Mr. Gassiot, who, with
some friends, had carefully observed it at Clapham Common. The direction
in which it appeared was from N. by W. toN.N,W. bycompass, Mr. Gassiot's
letter was copied in our Diary.

   On November 5, Professor Graham came to confer about methods of

transporting air, free from town contamination, for chemical analysis, with
reference to the presence of ammonia, from this locality to the London Uni-
versity. Every means in our power, calculated to facilitate Dr. Graham's
important researches, were (of course) tendered with great alacrity and
pleasure f

   * If the instrument were mounted in as substantial a manner as are the horizontal and
vertical-force magnetographs, and if a compensating apparatus of larger zinc rods and stout
glass tubes were substituted for this of small rods and wood, the error of an observation would
probably be less, and even the remaining error might perhaps be almost got rid of by making
use of the micrometer screw (at b^*), provided expressly for preventing the compensation from

being either " overdone " or underdone. The neglect of doing this is entirely my own.

   Since the above was vn-itten an instrument improved as above has been ordered by
Mr. Johnson for the RadcUfFe Observatory.

   t The aspirator (described at p. 344) would probably be found convenient in cases of

this kind.

   On the same day and subsequently, a few experiments were commenced
on M. Claudet's actinometer.

On January 20, 1851, Mr. Phipps (of the Woods and Forests) examined

the building; when its state, as to dry rot, &c., was represented, and an in-

timation was made that probably Lord Seymour would visit it.

  On the 25th, Professor Potter's "Aerometric Balance for measuring the

density of the air in which it is situated," arrived for examination and expe-

riment, but was required to be returned before any results which could be

confided in were obtained. The difficulties of observing the instrument

under unobjectionable conditions seemed almost insurmountable. It is de-

scribed in the Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxxvii, p. 81.

   On May 8, Lieut. Fergusson, of the Indian Navy, began a little course

of study and manipulation relative to all our methods of procedure in the

self-registering system, and in eye observations of atmospheric electricity, &c.

It was continued daily during about two weeks, at the end of which time he

had become well qualified to prosecute and conduct such operations and ob-

servations.

At the end of May, Mr. A. Broun, late Director of Sir Thomas Brisbane's

magnetic observatory, appointed to the Trevandrum observatory, commenced

a similar course, which lasted (at intervals) about 2 weeks, and terminated

with like success*.

   On June 20, Colonel Sabine and Professor Stokes decided upon using the

South Lower Hall for the prosecution of Professor Stokes's proposed ex-

periments to determine the index of friction in different gases.

   On the 24th, Mr. Weld, Assistant Secretary of the Royal Society, visited
the Observatory, and informed me that he was directed to send a large

quantity of apparatus belonging to the Royal Society to be deposited here.

He examined the localities in which they could be properly lodged, viz.

the glass cases, &c., formerly occupied by His Majesty George the Third's

splendid collection of instruments of a similar kind; and on the 26th, many

cases containing the Royal Society instruments arrived ; but the operation

of unpacking, &c. was deferred to an early day after this meeting of the

British Association.

Some boxes (probably containing papers) locked and without keys, arrived

with the instruments and were not opened.

Between this time and the end of the month all outstanding bills due by the

establishment were paid, excepting three or four very small accounts (which

presented a little difficulty in adjustment, &c.) ; and a tabulated statement

embracing the whole expenditui-e and receipts for the (British Association)

year was delivered to the Kew Committee, by which account it appears that

the total sum expended on the Establishment account has been Б309 2s. 2d.

   In the course of the year numerous meetings of the Kew Committee, and

very many individual attendances of its President, Colonel Sykes, Colonel

Sabine, and Mr. Gassiot, have taken place at the Observatory,

Our visitors have been numerous, and almost exclusively gentlemen of high

scientific reputation.

course of construction for Mr. Broun.

    I have great pleasure in bearing testimony here to the general services of
Mr. Welsh, and particularly in making and recording, in the Diary, &c.,
very numerous comparisons, observations, measurements, adjustments and
computations relative to the thermom.cters, the various hygrometers, the ba-
rometers and barometrograph, and tlie magnetographs*, in the laborious pro-
cesses of tabulating and tracing the magnetic curves, and in making and re-
cording all the observations and remarks entered in the form of the Electro-
meteorological Journal ; in suggesting a few alterations in that form, and in

the mode of deducing the value of electrical frequency (vide p. 355); in point-
ing out the former defective m.ode of suspending the mountain barometer, and
the first-mentioned inconvenience in the use of a Regnault hygrometer (vide
p. 365); in suggesting the use of screens to protect the magnets from the heat
of the lamps, and in assisting me to vary the older methods of ascertaining
the magnifying powers of tlie lenses of tlie magnetographs (vide p. 352).

   The calibrations and graduations of the new Standard Thermometers have
been executed by him.

              Ordnance Survey of Scotland.

The Committee appointed at the Edinburgh Meeting in 1850, "for the
purpose of urging on Her Majesty's Government the completion of the Geo-

graphical Survey of Scotland, as recommended by the present Meeting of
the British Association at Edinburgh in ISS'l-,"' presented the following Me-

morial to the First Lord of the Treasury :--

<( ]y[Y Lord  " London, February I7th, 1851.

" As constituting a committee appointed for that purpose by the British

Association for the Advancement of Science, we beg to call your Lordship's

attention, and that of Her Majesty's Government, to the untoward condition

and slow progress of the Geographical Survey of Scotland.

"In the year 1834, when, for the first time assembled at Edinburgh, the

British Association prayed the Government of that day to accelerate mate-

rially the completion of a work, Avhich, notwithstanding that the primary
triangulation was commenced in 1809, had not produced in the intervening

25 years a single practical result. It was then shown, that the grossest errors
pervaded every known chart and map ; and although, thanks to the zeal of
the Hydrographer of the Navy and his surveyors, many of the chief head-
lands have since been laid down, the mass of the land still remains in the same

unsurveyed condition.
   " In fact, on returning to Edinburgh last summer, after an interval of 16

years, the British Association deeply regretted to learn that, excepting Wig-
tonshire, about a sixtieth part only of Scotland, no portion of the kingdom had

been mapped.
   " Permit us to remind your Lordship that, although in consequence of many

subsequent appeals from other public bodies (including the Royal Society
of Edinburgh and the Highland Society), the Government did at length, in
1840, direct the survey to be laid down on a scale of six inches to a mile, or
similar to that of the Irish survey, so feeble and inadequate has been the

force employed, that in judging from what has transpired since that date,

of this kind.

upwards of 50 years must elapse before the map of Scotland can be com-

pleted.

   " It is to this point that we specially call your Lordship's attention.
   " The people of Scotland naturally feel that they are entitled to equal justice
with the inhabitants of any part of the United Kingdom, in respect to a work

on which, as a basis, all improvements in agricultural, engineering and mi-
ning affairs are so intimately dependent. Under this feeling, and Avith a
strong sense of the value and importance of this work to all interests in their

country, they cannot but observe that whilst the map of Scotland has thus

been almost in abeyance, and that 66,000/. only has been expended on it

during the present century, Ireland actually obtained a complete survey and

map in the space of 20 years, and at an expenditure of 820,000/. sterling.

   " Documents, a table and references to parliamentary data are annexed, to
sustain our statement, and to enable your Lordship to see what amount of
expenditure will suffice to bring Scotland into a position which has been long

ago attained by even small and poor states on the Continent.
   " We, therefore, implore your Lordship, and Her Majesty's Government,

to endeavour to obtain from the Parliament an annual grant, adequate, if

possible, to the completion of this map within the next 10 years, for we are
confident that the appeal v/e have ventured to make is in unison with the

earnest wishes of all classes of the people of Scotland.

       The Parallelogram of 3Iechanical Magnitudes.

                  By HoMERSHAM Cox, B.A.

The following six kinds of magnitude considered in mechanical science,

           Of translation                  Of rotation

       Statical forces.                 Statical couples.
       Linear velocities.               Angular velocities.
       Linear accelerations.            Angular accelerations,

all conform to the remarkable and well-known law, that if two sides of a parallelo-

gram represent the magnitude and direction of two components of either kind, their

resultant is similarly represented by the diagonal.

It is here proposed to show that this law may be proved for the six kinds of mag-

nitude indifferently by a method of demonstration common to them all. It is clear

that such a demonstration can be derived only from fundamental principles common

to them all, and it is verj^ interesting to trace out these axioms, which may be re-

garded as the abstract causes of the coincidence of the laws of the effect of mechani-

cal agents of nature so diverse as those above specified. Extraneous and unneces-

sary considerations, imported into the particular demonstrations, are excluded from

the general demonstration, which involves no empirical axioms, and deduces its re-

sults solely from analytical and geometrical principles, and the definitions of the

measures of the magnitudes considered.

The direction of a couple, angular velocity, or angular acceleration is here defined

to be the direction of the axis about which either respectively tends to turn, or turns

a system of material parts, of which the relative positions do not vary. The mea-

sure of the relative magnitudes of couples is the relative magnitudes of their mo-

ments. The measure of the relative magnitudes of angular velocities is the relative

magnitudes of the angles through which they respectively turn in a given time, a

system of material parts of which the relative positions do not vary. The measure

of the relative magnitudes of angular accelerations is the relative magnitudes of the

angular velocities which they respectively generate in a given time. The other terms

used in this demonstration do not here require definition.

   From the definitions of a Resultant, and of the measures of the six kinds of mag-
nitude above specified, it may be shown that

I. The resultant of components having the same direction is their algebraical sum.

Therefore (II.) two equal and opposite components destroy each other's effect.
   The inclination of the resultant of two components inclined to each other at a

given angle is independent of the unit by which they are measured, and depends

--solely on their relative (not absolute) magnitude conversely.

   (III.) The inclination of the resultant of two components inclined at a given angle
determines their relative magnitude.

   The relative magnitude of the resultant is independent of the unit by which the
components are measured. Consequently,

   (IV.) Of two comnoneuts inclined at a given angle, the relative magnitude deter-
mines the relative magnitude of the resultant.

   Let two perpendicular components, repre-

sented in direction by M, p, be inclined to
their resultant S, at the same angles re-

spectively as two others, q, N, respectively
to their resultant R.

  NLet M, meet, and be equal and oppo-

site. It is clear by the geometry that R, S

is a right angle.

   R, S together are equivalent to M,p, q, N,

Nand therefore to p, q (since M, by (II.)

destroy each other's effect) ; since j? and q are  M               N
in the same direction, p-]rq by (I.) is the
magnitude of the resultant of R, S.

Rp-\-q is inclined to its perpendicular components at the same angles as to its

perpendicular components. Hence (III.), the relative magnitude of the components,

must be the same in both cases. As then these two pairs of perpendicular compo-

nents have the same ratio, the relative magnitude (IV.) of the resultant must be the

same in both cases, or

   By geometry, if the square of one side of a triangle be equal to the sum of the

squares of the other sides, the triangle is right-angled ; therefore if a triangle have
three sides representing the magnitudes of two perpendicular components and their

resultant respectively, it is right-angled.

  Let DOW A 6, B i represent the mag-

nitudes of any two perpendicular com-

ponents. Therefore by the above, the

Ahypotbenuse B of the right-angled
triangle A i B represents the magni-

tude of the resultant.

Aof the right-angled triangle Cc, is the resultant of \ c, C e.

  ALet the directions of components equal to B 6 or C c meet at and be opposite.

angles AB6, cCФ, Ab=c\, Bb--Cc, angle A= angle c. Therefore AB=aC. Simi-

larly, in triangles ACc, Bio, AC=Ba. Therefore ABaC is a parallelogram.

other at any angles whatever. Hence, the above determines generally the maynitude

Summary of the Results of the Hypothesis of Molecular Vortices, as applied

  to the Theory of Elasticity and Heat. By William John Macquorn

   Rankine, C.E., F.R.S.'E.

This paper gives a general view of the results of a peculiar mode of conceiving that

theory which regards the elasticity connected with heat as the effect of the centri-

fugal force of small molecular motions. Each atom of a body is supposed to con-

sist of a nucleus enveloped by an elastic atmosphere. The nuclei of the atoms,

vibrating independently, or almost independently of their atmospheres, constitute the

medium which transmits light and radiant heat. By supposing a small portion of

atmosphere to form a load on each nucleus, varying in amount according to the di-
rection in which the nucleus vibrates, the phaenomena of double refraction may be

explained* (see Philosophical Magazine for June 1851). The total elasticity of a

body consists of two parts, one which may be resolved into forces acting along the

lines joining the atomic nuclei, and which resists change of figure as well as change

of volume ; and another which cannot be so resolved, and which resists change of
volume only (see Cambridge and Dubhn Mathematical Journal for February and

May 1851).

Part of this total elasticity is the pressure of the atomic atmospheres at certain

surfaces which may be described round each atomic nucleus, and at which the re-

sultant of the molecular attractions and repulsions is null. This pressure varies with

heat ; that is to say, it is increased by the centrifugal force of the movement of re-
volution of the particles of the atomic atmospheres. If v represent the mean velo-

Q=--city of that movement, and g the accelerating force of gravity, then                  v"
                                                                                               is the

quantity of heat in unity of weight of the substance.

  Two bodies are said to be at the same temperature when neither tends to commu-

nicate heat to the other ; and degrees of temperature are measured by the pressure
of a perfect gas at constant volume. Let t represent temperature, as measured from

an absolute zero 274░-6 Centigrade, or 494░"28 Fahr. below the temperature of melt-

ing ice ; then                                                                                                           и

proved experimentally by Mr. Joule, of the equivalence of heat and mechanical

power.
   The total heat of evaporation of a liquid increases uniformly with temperature, and

the rate of its increase is equal to the apparent specific heat of the vapour under

constant pressure.

   The apparent specific heat of a vapour at saturation is negative ; that is to say, if
vapour at saturation be allowed to expand, it must receive heat from without, or a
portion will be liquified to supply the heat required to expand the rest. This result
has also been arrived at by Clausius.

   If a body be expanded by heat at a higher temperature r,, and condensed at a
lower Tq, a certain proportion of the heat employed in expanding it will be trans-
formed into expansive power ; and this proportion is a function of those two tem-
peratures alone, being represented by

Carnot's Law ; and its consequences have also been investigated by Clausius and
Professor William Thomson.

been developed in practical formula and tables, and compared with experiment, and
the agreement is in all cases most satisfactory (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin. vol. xx.).

On the Velocity of Soitnd in Liquid and Solid Bodies of Limited Dimen-

Bysions, especialhj along prismatic masses of liquid.          W. J.M. Rankine.

   This paper is a sequel to one read at Edinburgh to the British Association in
August 1850, and published in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal for
February 1851, on the Laws of Elasticitj"-.
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                           5

    Its immediate object is to determine to what extent our present knowledge of the
condition and properties of elastic bodies enables us to use experiments on the velocity
of sound in them as data for calculating the elasticity of the materials. If it were
possible to ascertain the velocity of propagation of vibratory movements along the
axes of elasticity of an indefinitely extended mass of any substance, we could at once
calculate the coefficients of elasticity of the substance ; for in such a mass we can
assign the directions of molecular oscillation corresponding to each direction of propa-
gation, and consequently the nature of the elastic force called into play. Such experi-
ments, however, are possible in air and water only. For other substances, the best
data which it is practicable to obtain are experiments on the velocity of sound along

prismatic or cylindrical masses.

   The author in the first place integrates the equations of small molecular oscilla-
tions in elastic bodies of limited dimensions, and of any structure, and afterwards
investigates the special results to which they lead in the case of uncrystallized media
generally, and of prismatic bodies of liquid in particular. The principal positive con-
clusions arrived at may be summed up as follows :

    I. In liquid and solid bodies of limited dimensions, the freedom of lateral motion
possessed by the particles causes vibrations to be propagated less rapidly than in an

unlimited mass.

   II. The symbolical expressions for vibrations in limited bodies are distinguished
by containing exponential functions of the coordinates as factors ; and the retardation
referred to depends on the coefficients of the coordinates in the exponents of those
functions, which coefficients depend on the molecular condition of the body's surface,
a condition as yet imperfectly understood. [Exponential functions in the equations
of small oscillations have not hitherto been used, except in the theory of waves pro-
pagated by gravitation, by Mr. Green, in that of total reflexion, and by Professor
Stokes, in investigating the possible eflfect of radiation on the velocity of sound.]

  AIn an uncrystallized body in particular, if represent the coefficient of longitu-

dinal elasticity ; that is to say, the quantity by which an elongation or compression,
without lateral yielding, must be multiplied in order to give the pressure per unit of

Darea to which it corresponds*; if denote the weight of unity of bulk of the sub-

\/stance, and g the accelerating force of gravity, then, while  -^ denotes the velo-

city of sound in an unlimited expanse of the substance, that in a body of limited

\/^dimensions is denoted ^Y        . (i--h''), where A is a quantity depending on the

figure and molecular condition of the body's surface, and entering into the exponents
of the exponential factors in the equations of motion. The trajectory or orbit of an
oscillating particle is, generally speaking, a straight line in an unlimited expanse,

and an ellipse in a limited body.

III. If we adopt the hypothetical principle, that at the free surface of a vibrating

mass of liquid the normal pressure depending on the mutual actions of atomic centres
VI --only is always null, then we deduce from theory that the ratio
                                                                     h^ : 1 of the

velocity of sound along a mass of fluid contained in a rectangular trough to that in

an unlimited expanse, is \^2 : \^3, that ratio being independent of the specific

rigidity of the liquid, provided only that it has some amount, however small. This

theoretical conclusion is exactly verified by a comparison of the numerous experiments

of M. Wertheim on the velocity of sound in water at various temperatures, from 15░

to 60░ Centigrade, in solutions of various salts, in alcohol, turpentine and aether (Ann.

de Ch. et de Phys. Ser. III. tom. xxiii.), with those of M. Grassi on the compressi-

bility of the same substances (Comptes Rendus, xix. p. 153), and with the experi-

MM.ments of  Colladen and Sturm on the velocity of sound in an expanse of water.

To these may be added the following negative conclusions :

  WeIV. are not warranted in concluding from M. Wertheim's experiments (as

he is disposed to do) that liquids possess a momentary rigidity as great as that of

  A* The quantity is greater than the modulus of elasticity, because, in computing the

latter quantity, the particles are supposed at hberty to yield laterally.
--6 REPORT 1851.

solids ; seeing that any amount of rigidity, however small, will account for the
phsenomena, if we adopt certain suppositions as to molecular forces.

   V. Our knowledge of molecular forces is not as yet sufficiently advanced to enable
us to use experiments on the velocity of sound as a means of determining accurately

the coefficients of elasticity of solids.

   If we adopt for them the hypothesis already stated with respect to liquids, a theo-
retical investigation given in an Appendix shows that the velocity of sound in a cylin-
drical rod of an uncrystallized substance, whose surface is absolutely free, will be less

than that in an unlimited expanse in a ratio which is sensibly 1 : s/l for a very

slender filament, and approaches \/-2 : -V^S as the diameter of the rod increases ; but
the absolute freedom of the surface cannot be realized in practice ; the means used in
fixing the rod tend to restrain the lateral oscillations and accelerate the velocity of

Vsound. The ratios ascertained by experiment range from V'2 : Z to near equality
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but they are not sufficiently numerous to form data for any definite conclusions.

     On a General Theory of Gases. By J. J. Waterston, Bombay.

   llie author deduces the properties of gases, with respect to heat and elasticity,
from a peculiar form of the theory which regards heat as consisting in small but

rapid motions of the particles of matter. He conceives that the atoms of a gas, being

perfectly elastic, are in continual motion in all directions, being restrained within a
limited space by their collisions with each other, and with the particles of surrounding
bodies. The vis viva of those motions in a given portion of gas constitutes the quan-
tity of heat contained in it.

   He shows that the result of this state of motion must be to give the gas an elasti-
city proportional to the mean square of the velocity of the molecular motions, and to

the total mass of the atoms contained in unity of bulk ; that is to say, to the density
of the medium. This elasticity, in a given gas, is the measure of temperature.
Equilibrium of pressure and heat between two gases takes place when the number of
atoms in unity of volume is equal, and the vis viva of each atom equal. Tempera-
ture, therefore, in all gases, is proportional to the mass of one atom multiplied by the
mean square of the velocity of the molecular motions, being measured from an abso-
 lute zero 491░ below the zero of Fahrenheit's thermometer.

    If a gas be compressed, the mechanical power expended in the compression is
 transferred to the molecules of the gas increasing their vis viva ; and conversely,
when the gas expands, the mechanical power given out during the expansion is ob-
 tained at the expense of the vis-viva of the atoms. This principle explains the varia-

--tions of temperature produced by the expansion and condensation of gases the

 laws of their specific heat under difi'erent circumstances, and of the velocity of sound
 in them. The fall of temperature found on ascending in the atmosphere, if not
disturbed by radiation and other causes, would correspond with the vis viva necessary
 to raise the atoms through the given height.

    The author shows that the velocity with which gases diffuse themselves is propor-
 tional to that possessed by their atoms according to his hypothesis.

                  On the Cotiduction of Electricity through Water.
                                By F. C. Bakewell.

     Mr. Bakewell stated the results of some experiments on the conduction of electri-
 tricity by water, made with a view to prove that an electric current may be trans-
 mitted for a considerable distance through unprotected wires immersed in water.
 The experiments were conducted on Saturday last in one of the Hampstead ponds.

A thin copper wire (No. 20), three hundred and twenty feet long, was stretched across

 the pond, and two copper plates ten inches square, to which wires were soldered.

Awere also immersed to serve as conducting plates for the return current.  Smee's

battery of two pairs of plates was used, and when the connexion was made with a
galvanometer on the opposite bank, a steady deflection of 30░ was maintained, and a

strong blue mark was produced by a steel electrode on paper moistened with a

solution of prussiate of potash in diluted muriatic acid. In this experiment the

conducting plates were placed close to the wire, and on opposite sides of it, so that
the return current passed diagonally across the exposed wire. The water in this
case appeared to act as a conductor and as a non-conductor at the same time, in

proportion to the surfaces exposed to its influence. Tn the next experiment the wire

was doubled, and a current of electricity from the same battery was transmitted

through the wires, both being immersed in the water. In this case the deflection
of the needle was more prompt, and it continued steady at 45"^. From these ex-
periments, which Mr. Bakewell stated were a confirmation of those undertaken by

Mr. Bain and Lieut. Wright with a diflferent object in 1841, he inferred that the ex-

posure of a large surface, as the electric telegraph wires from post to post, presented

greater opportunity for the dispersion of electricity in moist atmospheres, than the

points of connexion with the posts, even supposing the wires to be entirely unin-

sulated and connected by water with the earth.

On a New Mode of Illumiiiating Qpake Objects under the highest jiowers of
           the Miaoscope. By Charles Brooke, M.B., F.R.S.

  A parallel pencil of rays is obtained by placing a camphine-lamp (which of all

kinds of lamps gives the most intense illumination) in the principal focus of a com-
bination of two plano-convex lenses. This pencil is received on the surface of a
small parabolic mirror, the vertex of which is truncated, so that the focus of the

mirror may be about 0-1 inch beyond the truncated edge. Tiie rays which are con-
verging to the focus are received 'on the surface of the small plane mirror, which is
attached to the bottom of the object-glass, so that the surface of the mirror may be
nearly level with the lowest surface of the object-glass. All the rays of light which
eubte'ud any angle from that of the object-glass, up to about 170░, are thus rendered

available for the illumination of the object, which, as it is illuminated by very oblique
rays, must not be placed in a depression or cavity of any kind.

On a NeiK Arrangement for facilitating the Dissection and Drawing of
 Objects placed under the Microscope. By Charles Brooke, M.B., F.R.S.

  Two short pieces of tube, one of them the size of the eye-piece, the other the same

size as the body of the microscope, are attached at an angle of about 4░ to the sides
of a brass box containing a rectangular prism. The smaller tube enters the body of
the microscope, and the larger receives the eye-piece. The image that enters the eye

is now inverted in a plane passing through the axes of the body and of the eye-piece ;
and in order to erect the image, a cap is placed over the eye-piece, to which is

attached a small rectangular prism, having its axis in the plane in which the image
is already inverted. This arrangement provides a very convenient position of the
eye, when the hands are engaged in manipulating an object placed under the

microscope.

  A rectangular prism has already been introduced into the body of the microscope

by Nachez ; but as this was placed near the object-glass, it must to a certain extent
interfere with the definition of the object. For the purpose of drawing, a small piece
of parallel glass is substituted for the rectangular prism placed in front of the eye-
piece, through which the drawing-paper is seen directly through two opposite sur-
faces, and the object is seen by reflexion from an outer surface placed at an angle of
about 45░ with the axis of the" eye-piece. The image inverted by the first reflexion
is again inverted in the same plane by the second, and is therefore correctly repre-

sented in the drawing.

secution of these experiments. I first of all ordered a series of thermometers from

Fastre of Paris. I had next to devise a suitable heating apparatus ; and finally I

had malleable iron bars made, my experiments having as yet been confined to that

metal. The mode of conducting the experiments, and of deducing results from them,

I shall not now enter upon ; because, although the progress of the experiments has

myperhaps been as great as the difficulties of the inquiry and  very limited leisure

entitled me to expect, I think it very desirable to repeat and extend them further
before drawing any positive conclusions. I may state, however, that my method has

been communicated to Mr. Airy, the President elect of the Association, to Professor
Kelland, and to another scientific friend, and I have received every encouragement
from these gentlemen to proceed in the inquiry, which will I hope be considered by
the General Committee as a proof that these experiments have not been lightly un-

dertaken.

   On these grounds I request a renewal of the grant of 50Z. for the ensuing year,

although it is not at all likely that the whole, or even two-thirds of that sum, should
be required. Of the 50l. granted last year, I have spent only 201. Is. Id., of which
a detailed account has been handed to the General Treasurer. Some smaller expenses
are still unpaid. Messrs. Napier, the eminent machine-makers, have generously
supplied two admirably made bars, free of all cost.

that if no heed were taken of the deviation when regulating the ship's course, the
most serious consequences might be apprehended.

   Taking as an example the case of the Ajax, with the funnel JФp, running upon
an easterly course at the rate of 9 knots per hour, a simple diagram will show
that in 24 hours only, if no allowance were made for deviation, the ship would be
50 miles out of the reckoning ; and with the funnel doixn, the error would be increased
to 72 miles in the same space of time, while the case of the Blenheim would not be
very different.

    In the humid and misty atmosphere which so often prevails on the coasts of the
British Isles, the fact that a ship such as the Ajax, if steered a compass course (but
without allowing for deviation) for mid-channel between Ushant and the Lizard,
would instead thereof be running for the dangers about Ushant, with the funnel wp,
and with it down, be so far out of the proper course as to be advancing towards the
rocks south of Douarnenez Bay, is I conceive a proper example to show the import-
ance of attending to the effects produced upon the compass under the two conditions
of the funnels of steam ships.

    But besides the practical question, I wish you to bring under the notice of the
 Section, the following results which I obtained with reference to the effect of hollow
iron cylinders upon the compass, when placed inside of each other; the object being
to ascertain whether the whole difference of deviation, under the two conditions of
 the^e telescopic funnels, was due to the difference of their elevation and depression
 only, or whether a portion of the said differences was attributable to the induced
 magnetism of the separate parts of the funnel, when lowered, acting upon each

 other.

    As it would have required more time than could be afforded to hoist the parts of
 these huge funnels in and out of the ship while the requisite successions of observa-
 tions were made, I procured three hollow iron cylinders, of smaller dimensions, their
 several diameters being such as to admit of one cylinder being placed inside of
 another, and leaving a space of about an eighth of an inch between their surfaces.

     Having placed a standard compass on one of the pedestals in the observatory, and
 ascertained the magnetic meridian for the moment by the collimator, the largest or
 external iron cylinder. No. 1, was brought in, and placed to the eastward of the com-

pass, the principal mass of the cylinder being below the level of the needle and card,
and its upper end being 2| inches above that level.

   By this means a deflection or deviation of 10░ 10' was produced, the north end
of the needle being drawn that amount to the eastward of the correct magnetic

north.

   Cylinder No. 2 was next placed inside of No. 1, when the deviation was increased

to 12░ 15'.

   Cylinder No. 3 was then placed inside of No. 2, and the deviation was again in-
creased to 14░ 15', the north end of the needle being drawn to the eastward in each

case.

   Hansteen's magnetic force instrument was then placed with the centre of its
needle (as nearly as I could adjust it) in a similar position to that which the centre
of the compass had occupied, and the following reuults were obtained :

                                                                                    Time of 100 vibrations, starting

the induced magnetism of the surfaces of each cylinder, acting upon each other, is

   Mr. Bakewell read a paper on the Copying Electric Telegraph, and illustrated its
action by experiments with the instruments. In the method adopted for trans-
mitting copies of writing, the letters to be transmitted are written on tin-foil with
varnish, so as to present a conducting and a non-conducting surface. The foil is
placed on the cylinder of the transmitting instrument, and a metal style in connec-
tion with a voltaic battery presses on the surface of the cylinder as it revolves. By
this means the electric current is continually broken when the style is resting on the
varnish ; and as the style is made to traverse by an endless screw from one end of
the cylinder to the other, it passes necessarily over all the lines of the writing, and
about eight times over eacii line. The receiving instrument is similar to the trans-
mitting one, and on to the cylinder of that instrument paper, moistened with a solu-

tion of prussiate of potass in diluted muriatic acid, is placed, the metal style on that

instrument being a piece of steel wire. When the electric current from the positive

pole of the voltaic battery passes through the steel point to the paper, a blue mark is
made by the production of prussian blue, and when the cylinder is in motion the
effect is to draw a series of spiral lines on the paper ; but as the lines are broken
whenever the varnish writing on the transmitting cylinder interposes, the forms of
the letters are transferred from one instrument to the other; the writing appearing
of a pale colour on a ground of blue lines drawn closely together. To produce this
effect it is requisite that both instruments should rotate exactly together, and this
synchronous movement is attained by means of an electro-magnet ; one instrument
being made to regulate the other by retarding its motion at regular intervals. The
regulation of the instruments is also facilitated by a guide-line, consisting of a strip
of paper placed at right angles to the writing, by which means the person in charge
of the receiving instrument can ascertain exactly hov/ much the speed of the two in-
struments differs, and by the addition or abstraction of weight can bring the gaps,
formed by the strip of paper, to fall exactly under each other, which indicates that
the two cylinders are revolving at the same rate. It was stated in answer to ques-
tions by members present, that two hundred letters per minute might be copied by
the instruments exhibited, and that five hundred a minute are attainable. To illus-
trate the facility which this means of telegraphic communication affords for trans-
mitting secret messages, an apparently blank piece of paper was produced, on which
a message had been impressed invisibly before the meeting of the Section, and by
brushing it over with a solution of prussiate of potass the writing became instantly

legible.

Remarks on Lord 'Qrowghdims Exiienments on Light, ^c. in the Phil. Trans.

By1850. Part I.  the Rev. Professor Powell, F.R.S. &)-c.

The experiments of Lord Brougham " on the properties of light," &c., are re-

garded by their author as offering new facts at variance with the principle of inter-

ference, hitherto so successfully applied to all pheenomena of this class. They seem

therefore to call for some remarks as to their actual bearing on the question. The

experiments all refer to the well-known phaenomena of diffraction-fringes formed by

the edge of an opake screen ; which the author views in connexion with a peculiar

theory odnflecting and deflecting forces ; the nature of the effect being chiefly inves-

tigated by placing a second edge at some distance from the first along the ray, and oc-

casionally a third ; which produces changes in the breadth and position of the fringes.

In the author's attack on the interference theory (especially in prop, xi.), some mis-

conception of that theory appears to be involved. Though the undulatory theory

has been successfully applied to the general subject of these fringes, yet it is well
known that the application of the formulas to any but the simplest cases of edges

and apertures is defective, owing to the great complexity of the resulting expres-

sions, and the impossibility of integrating them except under very restricted condi-

tions. Thus the integration has not been extended to the action of a second or third

edge at different distances; this last case being obviously the same as that of an

aperture or screen whose plane is inclined to the path of the rays. Fresnel, in his

justly celebrated memoir (Sur la Diffraction de la Lumiere, Mem. de I'lnstitut, tome v.

for 1821, published in 1826, note, p. 452), considers Irieflij this very case, and shows

generally that the fringes will not be symmetrical, having a greater extension towards

one side ; but he does not give any analytical investigation, which would manifestly
--12 REPORT 1851.

be one of considerable complexity. In an attempt to deduce these expressions at
length, it has been found that the expressions become extremely complicated, though

it seems difficult to say whether they may not still yield to proper treatment : the
main question is, whether the expenditure of time and trouble would not be greater
than any results likely to be obtained would repay.

The Earl of Rosse said that, having obser\ed in the London Papers that the Pre-

sident of the Association had in his inaugural address conferred upon him the honour

of alluding with approbation to the attempts which he had lately made, and with

considerable success, to procure plain specula of silver for reflecting telescopes, he

thought that perhaps the Section might wish to hear some particulars, and if they

could spare a few minutes he would make a short statement on the subject.

It is well known that about one-third of the light which falls upon the great spe-

culum of the Newtonian telescope is lost in the first reflexion, and that nearly one-

third of the remainder is lost in the second reflexion. Light being of the greatest

importance, especially in the examination of faint objects, in the Herschehan

telescope the second reflexion has been dispensed with altogether ; and in the New-

tonian telescope attempts have been made, by substituting a prism for the flat mirror,

in some degree to reduce the amount lost. In the Herschelian telescope the mirror

is inclined, so that the light proceeding in a direction parallel to the axis of the tube

is reflected to the centre of the eye-glass fixed to the side of the tube ; there is thus

Abut one reflexion.  consequence, however, of placing the great mirror obliquely

is, that though it may be truly parabolic, yet a pencil of light proceeding from a

point in an object will not be reflected to a point as it should be, but will be difi^used

over a certain space. In a telescope of 3-feet aperture and 27-feet focus, the dia-

meter of that space will be more than yi^thof an inch, so that the magnifying power

employed cannot be considerable without producing indistinctness. \Vere it pos-

sible to work the surface assigned by theorv' for oblique reflexion as accurately as

the surface of  the paraboloid,  we  should have the  light  without  the  indistinctness
                                                                                                                                   ;

but that has not yet been accomplished. Where specula are very large, it has been

proposed to place the eye-glass in the axis of the tube, and it has been contended

that the light interrupted by the head and shoulders of the observer would be less

than the light lost by the second reflexion. This is no doubt true, and various ways

have been suggested of placing the observer so that the light interrupted should be

a minimum, the temperature of the air in the tube remaining at the same time un-

disturbed. In such a construction, however, there would be great diflrraction, and

that appears to me to be an insurmountable objection. The rectangular prism wБis

proposed by Newton as a substitute for the plain speculum ; and with a prism of

i>A inches aperture by Mertz, the saving of light is considerable. Mertz informed

me that a somewhat larger prism might be made, but that there would be consider-

able delay : he did not however hold out any hopes of being enabled to make one

large enough for our 3-feet speculum. It is evident that as the size of the prism is

increased, the amount of light lost in passing through the glass will be greater, and

a point will at length be cirrived at, sooner or later, according as the glass is more or
less transparent, when the light lost in prismatic reflexion will be as great as in re-
flexion from a speculum of metal. It occurred to me that a small prism might be

substituted for a large one by placing it near the focus, and that practically the in-

convenience of a small field might be obviated to a certain extent by employing a

plain speculum and eye-piece in the ordinary way for general work, to be turned
aside by a suitable contrivance when the prism was to be made use of. An eye-

piece, of course of an unusual construction, would be required, cuid it does not seem

practicable to make such an eye-piece with two lenses achromatic : the four-glass

eve-piece would be so, but some light would be sacrificed. How far the want of

achromatism would interfere with real work I have not proceeded far enough to be

able to say. Achromatic prismatic refraction has been proposed by Sir David

Brewster as a substitute for the plain speculum. It has not, as far as I am aware

of, been tried, but the great size of the prism which would be required appears to

me to be a serious objection.

Under these circumstances, it is obvious that where there was a reasonable pro-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                              13

spect of obtainiDg a material for the plain speculum more reflective than the alloy

of tin and copper, no time nor labour could be misapplied in endeavouring to effect

so important an object. It was not until Jamia's ' Menioire sur la Couleur des

Metaux' appeared in the ' Annalesde Chimie ' for 1848, that I was aware that silver

reflected so very much more light than speculum metal. Jaaiin states that he has

abundantlvverified Cauchy's formulae for the laws of metallic polarization ; Бmd from

these laws, by the aid of certain constants, he has determined the intensity of light

reflected by some of the metals. From the table he has given, it appears that while

speculum metal reflects about sixty rays out of a hundred, sih^er reflects ninety.

Not from having any doubt of the accuracy of Jamin's deductions, but happening to

have the means at hand, I made a few coarse photometric measurements of the re-

lative reflective powers of silver and speculum metal, and the results appeared to

coincide sufficiently with the more accurate deductions of Jamin. Not feeling very

sanguine as to the practicability of procuring an accurate surface of silver by me-

chanical means, owing to its softness, I tried the electrotype process in the first in-

stance. The silver was thrown down upon a surface of highly polished speculum

metal ; but in every case where the speculum metal was thoroughly clean there was

strong adhesion, so that separation could not be effected without destroying both

surfaces. The means which were employed to guard against adhesion in electro-

typing the engraved copper plates for the Ordnance Map of Ireland, which, in fact,

consisted in applpng an extremely thin film of wax, would obviously be inadmissible

in this case. Several attempts to precipitate silver on a steel speculum failed, as the

silver had not a proper polish. Being however without experience in electrotyping,

I do not consider these failures conclusive. Attempts were made with a steel die

truly polished to procure accurate polish by pressure. This did not succeed : the

surface was not sufficiently true, owing apparently to unequal elasticity in the tex-

ture of the silver. To turn or plane a polished surface was not attempted, as the

idea had suggested itself to the late Mr. Barton, and if it had been practicable in

his hands it would doubtless have succeeded. There remained therefore but to try

Asome modification of the ordinary processes of polishing metals.  difficulty oc-

curred in the beginning, which gave considerable trouble. Owing to the softness of

the silver, the emery employed to grind it flat became imbedded in it, and in that

state to polish it was quite impossible. Without grinding, however, there seemed

to be no means of making the silver sufficiently flat, as Whitworth's scraping process

had been tried, and was not found to be sufficiently delicate. The difficulty was

obviated by employing a bed of German hones, by which the silver is probably

rather filed than ground. The blue hones might perhaps be employed with advan-

tage after the German hones, but I have not tried them. The silver being thus pre-

pared, I tried the ordinary process of polishing on pitch in vain, employing the

pitch of various degrees of hardness : the surface of the silver was irregular and the

polish imperfect. The silversmith makes use of chamois leather and rouge, some-

times finishing with the hand charged with rouge : his polish is very brilliant, but

the surface is, as we should expect, very untrue, as for example, the surface of a

highlv finished plateau. It was rather puzzling to find that while chamois leather

charged with rouge polished silver, pitch, however soft, did not : there was no ap-

parent difference in the two cases, but this ; that the pitch slightly shielded by the

rouge came more or less in contact with the silver, while the chamois leather, hold-

ing fast the stratum of rouge, was scarcely in contact at all with the silver. That

this was the true reason was probable, as in proportion as the chamois leather was

less shielded, the process was imperfect. It is evident that, however fine the polish,

a true surface could not be procured by the action of an elastic material, and there-

fore pitch was taken as a basis ; a substance which is solid, and at the same time

Weadapts itself in the most perfect manner to the surface to be polished.  pro-
--ceeded in this way : Pitch of the proper hardness for polishing speculum metalwas

covered with a mixture of rouge and the combination of ammonia and soap which

we employ in polishing specula. The silver was worked upon this for a short time

to force the rouge into the pitch, after which the rouge mixture was again applied

and suffered to dry. The surface wБi3 then slightly moistened with spirits of tur-

pentine, and more of the rouge mixture applied. The following day, the turpentine

having evaporated, there was a rouge surface, perhaps of xicsth of an inch thickness.
--14 REPORT 1851.

upon which the silver was polished, using fresh rouge and ammonia soap just as if
it was speculum metal. The spirit of turpentine had long been exposed to the light,
and consequently was slightly adhesive. Silver was several times polished on this
surface successfully, and a plain silver speculum so polished performed well, giving
perfectly sharp images. I have been thus minute in explaining what I believe to be

the rationale of the process as a guide to others, because, having as yet practised it

but little, I may perhaps have omitted to notice some things apparently non-essen-
tial, but which are really not so.

On a new Elliptic Analyser. By Prof. G. G. Stokes, M.A.., F.R.S.

invented for the purpose. In its construction he had aimed at being in all import-

and carries on the side turned towards the incident light a plate of selenite, of such

a thickness as to produce a difference of retardation in the oppositely polarized
pencils amounting to about a quarter of an undulation for rays of mean refrangibi-

lity. On the side next the eye the brass circle carries a projecting collar, and round

this collar there turns a moveable collar carrying verniers, and destined to receive a

Nicol's prism.

The observation consists in extinguishing the light by a combination of the two

movements. The retarding plate converts the elliptically-polarized light which has

to be examined into plane-polarized, and this plane-polarized light is extinguished
by the Nicol's prism. There are two distinct positions of the retarding plate and the

Nicol's prism in which this takes place. In each of these principal positions the
retarding plate and the Nicol's prism may be reversed (i. e. turned through 180░),
and the means of the readings in these four subsidiary positions may be taken for

greater accuracy. The readings of the lixed and moveable verniers in each of the

two principal positions are four quantities given by observation, which determine

four unknown quantities, namely, (1) the index error of the fixed verniers, or, which

comes to the same, the azimuth of the major axis of the ellipse described by the

particles  of sether,  measured     from   a plane   fixed  in   the  graduated    circle                       (2) the

   The author stated that he had made a good many observations with this instru-
ment for the sake of testing its performance, and that he had found it very satisfac-
tory. Inasmuch as light is not homogeneous, the illumination never vanishes, but
only passes through a minimum, and in passing through the minimum the tint
changes rapidly. This change of tint is at first somewhat perplexing ; but after a

little practice, the observer is able to point mainly by intensity, taking notice of the
tint as an additional check against errors of observation. The accuracy of the ob-

servations is a little increased by the use of certain rather pale-coloured glasses.

To give an idea of the degree of accuracy of which the instrument is susceptible,

suppose the ratio of the axes of the ellipse described to be about 3 to 1. In this

case the author found that the mean error of single observations amounted to about

a quarter or the fifth part of a degree in the determination of the azimuth, three or

four thousandths in the determination of the ratio of the minor to the major axis,

and about the thousandth part of an undulation in the determination of the re-

tardation.

   On account of the accuracy with which the retardation is determined, and the

largeness of the chromatic variations to which it is subject, the instrument may be

considered as determining, not only the elements of the ellipse described, but also the

refrangibility of the light employed, or its length of wave, which corresponds to the

refrangibility. The author stated that the error of the thousandth part of an undu-

lation, to which the determination of the retardation was subject, corresponded to

an error of only the twentieth or thirtieth part of the interval between the fixed lines

On Diamagnetism and Magnecrystallic Action. By John Tyndall, Ph.D.

One of the most important inquiries which at the present day occupies the atten-

tion of the student of physical science, is the relation which subsists between mag-

netism and diamagnetism. Are the laws which govern both forces identical ? Will

the mathematical expression of the attraction in the one case be converted into that

of the repulsion in the other case by a change of sign from positive to negative ?
   To this question, M. Pliicker replies " No." His experiments have led him to the

conclusion, that where the power of a magnet which operates upon a body com-

posed of magnetic and diamagnetic constituents is increased, the diamagnetism of
the compound mass increases in a much quicker ratio than the magnetism ; that in

consequence of this, an  indifferent  body is  a  physical  impossibility                                                            for a body in
                                                                                                                                  ;

which the respective forces might be exactly equal and opposite, when excited by a

magnet of a certain strength, would, upon lowering the power of the magnet below

this standard, be attracted, and by increasing the power of the magnet beyond this

standard be repelled.

During a previous investigation, the author of the present memoir had repeated

opportunities of observing phaenomena exactly similar to some of those which form

the premises of Pliicker's conclusion, and a close study of the subject convinced him,

that, to account for these phoenomena, the hypothesis of two conflicting forces in the

Bame compound mass, the one or the other of which predominates according as the

power of the magnet is increased or diminished, was by no means necessarjr.
   To fit himself for the investigation of this question, he commenced an inquiry last

November into electro-magnetic attractions ; one cf the results of this inquiry was,
that a sphere of soft iron separated from the end of a straight electro-magnet by a

small fixed distance, was attracted by the latter with a force exactly proportional to

Nowthe square of the exciting current.   this attraction is jn each case the product

of two factors, one of which expresses the magnetism of the magnet, and the other

the magnetism of the ball, and it is easy to see that while the attraction increases as

the square of the current, the magnetism of the ball increases in the simple ratio of

the current itself.

Our way to a comparison of magnetic attraction and diamagnetic repulsion is

Wenow clear.         know the law according to which the magnetism of an iron ball

increases, and we have only to inquire whether the diamagnetism of a bismuth

ball follows the same law. The apparatus used in the former case proved, however,

--to be totally unfit for the measurement of diamagnetic force, the feebleness of the

latter rendered a much more delicate mode of measurement necessary.

  AThe torsion balance was the instrument finally resorted to by the author. loop

of paper was attached to one end of a fine silver wire, and in the loop rested a little

beam of light wood. At the ends of the beam, which was 6 inches long, two spoon-

shaped hollows were worked out, in each of which a ball of the substance to be ex-

perimented with might be placed. Two cores of soft iron, surrounded by helices of

copper wire, were placed at right angles to the beam when horizontally suspended,

the one core facing the ball at one end, and the other core facing the ball at the
--16 REPORT 1851.

other end. The silver wire was carried upward through a tube three feet in length,

and was connected at the top with a torsion head. When the cores were excited,

by sending an electric current through the surrounding helices, the balls were repelled.
The index of the torsion head was then gentlv turned against the repulsion until the
balls were brought within -i^th of an inch of the ends of the respective cores. The

torsion necessary to effect this, is evidently the expression of the repulsive force

exerted at this particular distance.

   The strength of the exciting current was measured by a galvanometer of tangents,
and it was regulated by means of a rheostat. The cores were excited by currents
which varied from 10░ to 57░, and the corresponding repulsions were determined.

--Spheres of the following diaraagnetic substances were used : 1, bismuth of com-

merce ; 2, chemically pure bismuth, obtained by dissolving the material of com-
merce in nitric acid, precipitating it with distilled water, washing the precipitate for
six days successively, and reducing it by means of black flux ; 3, sulphur of com-
merce ; 4, spheres from a crystal of native sulphur obtained in Sicily ; 5, calcareous
spar from Clitheroe ; 6, calcareous spar from Andreasberg in the Harz mountains.
The diamagnetism of all these spheres followed precisely the same law as the mag-
netism of the sphere of soft iron ; it was exactly proportional to the exciting current.

   These results cannot be reconciled with the statement that diamagnetism increases

with the increasing power of the magnet in a much quicker ratio than magnetism.
The experiments of Pliicker might be accounted for in many ways, but such explana-
tions being necessarily conjectural may be omitted here.

   It is known that crystalline bodies, suspended between the poles of a magnet, ex-
hibit phsenomena which are absent in the case of amorphous bodies. A. certain
line through the crystal will take up a determinate position, and if the line be
forcibly moved away from this position, when the force is removed it will return
to it. Thus a crystal of pure carbonate of lime suspended by a silk fibre between

the poles with its optic axis horizontal, will always turn until the optic axis is per-
pendicular to the line joining the poles, in which position it will come to rest. This

fact was discovered by Pliicker, who referred it to the operation of a new force, which
was entirely independent of the magnetism or diamagnetism of the mass of the

crystal.

   In an investigation conducted by the author, in companionship with Prof. Knob-
lauch of Marburg, this hypothesis of a new force is rejected, and it is there shown
that the position of the optic axis, so far from being independent of the magnetism

and diamagnetism of the mass, is entirely changed if a magnetic constituent be sub-

stituted for a diamagnetic. Thus, for instance, carbonate of iron differs from carbo-
nate of lime only in the circumstance, that an atom of iron is substituted for an
atom of calcium. The crystalline form in both cases is identical, the optic axis of
carbonate of iron sets, nevertheless, from pole to pole, with an energy far surpassing

that with which the optic axis of carbonate of lime sets perpendicular to the line

joining the poles.

But why is it that one direction in the crystal takes up a particular position ?

AThe torsion balance gives a prompt answer to this question.  sphere of cal-

careous spar was placed upon each of the spoon-shaped hollows of the beam, the di-

rection of the optic axis through each sphere being carefully marked. The spheres

were first placed so that the optic axes were parallel to the axes of the soft iron cores,
and, secondly, perpendicular to the same ; the repulsion in the former case was to

the repulsion in the latter in the ratio of 53 to 48.
   If a bismuth crystal be suspended between two poles, the plane of most eminent

cleavage will always set perpendicular to the line joining the poles, that is, equa-

Atorial.  cube formed from this crystal was placed on each end of the little beam

first, so that the planes of principal cleavage were parallel to the axes of the cores,

--and secondly, perpendicular to them : the repulsion in the former case was to the

repulsion in the latter in the ratio of 53 to 38.

   The diamagnetic mass in both these cases is repelled with a greater force in one

direction than in any other direction. When the crystal is suspended between two
poles, the line which marks the direction of maximum repulsion recedes as far as

possible from the poles, and hence sets equatorial.

  A result, the exact antithesis of the above, was observed with magnetic crystals.
                 TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                       l7

A cube of sulphate of iron was attracted in one direction by a force of 43, and in

Aanother direction by a force of 36-3.  spheie of carbonate of iron was attracted

in the direction of the optic axis by a force of 43, and in a direction perpendicular

thereto by a force of 30-5. When these crystals are suspended between two poles,

these lines of chief attraction approach the poles, and finally set axial.

Thus we see that the phaenoraena exhibited by crystals in the magnetic field, are

to be referred to a modification of magnetism or diamagnetism depending, no doubt,

upon the peculiar structure of the crystal. Let us endeavour to penetrate this my-

stery of structure. Our next inquiry is. What direction is that which is chosen

by the respective forces for the manifestation of their greatest energ)'? To this

question  the author imagines that the following  reply is  returned  by experiment                                                                                  " If
                                                                                                                                                                  :

the arrangement of the component particles of any body be such as to present differ-
ent degrees of proximity in different directions, then the line of closest proximity,
other circumstances being equal, will be that of strongest attraction in magnetic

bodies, and of strongest repulsion in diamagnetic bodies."

The torsion balance furnishes us with the means of submitting this conclusion to

Aa direct test.  quantity of bismuth was ground to dust in an agate mortar, gum-

water was added, and the mass was kneaded into a stiff paste. This was placed be-

tween two glasses and pressed together. From the mass, when dried, two cubes

were taken, the line of compression being perpendicular to two of the faces of each

cube, and parallel to the other four. Suspended by a silk fibre in the magnetic field,

upon closing the circuit the line of compression turned strongly into the equatorial

position, exactly as the plane of most eminent cleavage in the case of the crystal.
The cubes were placed one upon each end of the torsion balance, first, with the line

of compression parallel to the axis of the cores, and secondly, perpendicular thereto ;

the repulsion in the former case was to the repulsion in the latter in the ratio of

A53 to 30.  greater differential action was thus exhibited in the case of the model

than in the case of the crystal.

  A pair of cubes constructed in the same manner from powdered carbonate of iron

exhibited an analogous predominance of attraction in the line of compression.

   Against this mode of experiment an objection was urged, during the meeting of the
British Association at Edinburgh last year, by Prof. W. Thomson of Glasgow.
" You have," he said, " reduced the mass to pov<rder, but you have not thereby de-
stroj'ed the crystalline form your powder is a collection of smaller crystals, and

                                                                                                                                      ;

the pressing of the mass together gives rise to a predominance of axes in a certain
direction, so that the repulsion and attraction of the line of compression, which you

refer to closeness of aggregation, is after all a product of crystalline action. Besides,

we know that compressed isinglass exhibits the same optical phcenomena as crystals,

and you are unable to prove that the action is not due to a quasi-crystalline struc-

ture induced in the gum by compression."
   The following experiment will set this point at rest. It will not only show the

influence of compression apart from the mere arrangement of the axes or from the

influence of the gum, for none will be used ; but it will also demonstrate the nullity
of this presumed axial force when opposed to the influence of compression. To this

experiment the author was conducted by the following accident.

   The investigation was conducted in Berlin, and the great electro-magnet of the
university was beside him at the time. Some notion of the power of this magnet

may be gathered from the fact, that the copper helices alone surrounding the iron
pillars, which composed the magnet, weighed 243 pounds. On the top of the pillars,
two moveable masses of soft iron were placed, each weighing about 25 pounds, and
between these the substance to be examined was suspended. Afine cube of bismuth
crystal was suspended on one occasion between these moveable poles, and on closing

the circuit the planes of most eminent cleavage receded to the equator. Scarcely,
however, was this attained when the poles were observed moving towards each other,
and, before the circuit could be broken, they had rushed together and clenched their
iron jaws upon the crystal. The latter was reduced by the pressure to about three-
fourths of its primitive thickness, and immediately suggested the thought, that if the
theory of proximity were true it ought to tell here. The pressure brought the par-
ticles' of the crystal in the line of compression more closely together, and hence a

modification, if not an entire reversion, of the former action might be anticipated.

Having liberated the crystal it was boiled in hydrochloric acid, so as to remove any

impurity it might have contracted by contact with the iron. It was again suspended

between the poles and completely verified the foregoing anticipation. The line of

compression, that is, the magnecrystallic axis of the crystal, which formerly set from

pole to pole, set now equatorial. The experiment was then repeated with a common

vice                   various  pieces of bismuth,                            protected  by plates   of copper, were placed within its

suspended from their edges in the magnetic field, exhibited one unvarying result

the line of compression stood always equatorial, and it was a matter of perfect in-

difference whether this line was the magnecrystallic axis or not. In these cases no

gum was used, and not only was a ' predominance ' of axes present, but they all

worked                 together                                   they  were  further  assisted  by  the  great  mechanical  advantage

offered by such plates to diamagnetic repulsion ; the line of compression, neverthe-

less, triumphed over all and determined the position of the crystal.
   The author concludes his paper as follows :

-- How"Whoever denies the influence of proximity will have to answer the following
questions :                                                       is it possible that a greater differential action can be exhibited by

a cube of bismuth dough than by the crystal itself? What is it which causes the

magneciystallic axis to forsake its usual position, and to set equatorial when the

crystal is compressed in the direction of that axis ? He must further assume a cry-

stalline structure on the part of wax, flour, shale, and the pith of fresh rolls ; for in

all these substances the line of compression determines the position of the mass in

the magnetic field."

    Dr. Tyndall introduced an experiment in thermo-electricity with the monothermic
pile recently invented by Prof. Magnus of Berlin. It is well known if two small
bars, one of bismuth and the other of antimony, be united at their ends, the other
ends being connected by a wire, that on heating the place of contact of the bars an

electric current is evoked, which passes from antimony through the connecting wire
to bismuth, and from bismuth across the place of contact to antimony. These two
metals are mentioned because the phsenomenon is exhibited by them with peculiar
energy ; but any two metals will answer the purpose ; and even the same metal,
under certain circumstances. Thus Becquerel found that by knotting a wire, and
heating it in the vicinity of the knot, a current was developed ; it has even been
thought that a difference of diameter was sufficient to produce the effect, while some

have attributed it to a difference in the radiative power of the metals employed. M.
Magnus has been unable to substantiate these views. On taking a wire three lines
thick,and reducing a portion of it to the thickness of half a line, when the point of junc-
tion of thick and thin was heated, no current was produced ; and on taking a length

of polished wire, and roughening one half of it with a file or with coarse sand-paper,
when the point of junction of rough and smooth was heated, there was no current,

althotgh the radiative powers of both portions were very different. With a knot
upon the wire no current was obtained up to a temperature of 212░ Fahrenheit, It
was necessary to heat the wire to redness, and by this means alter its molecular

structure before a current could be obtained. The principle of the monothermic pile

Adepends on this molecular change brought about by heating. length of hard brass

wire was taken and heated to redness in alternate lengths of 6 inches ; these por-
tions became permanently soft, while the intervening portions remained hard. The
wire was coiled round a little wooden frame, and was of the shape of a rectangle. One
of the sides of this rectangle was composed entirely of soft wire, and the side oppo-

site of hard wire, while the centres of the remaining two sides were the junctions of

hard and soft. When the hard side of the wire rectangle was heated there was no
current, and this was also the case when the soft side was heated. But when the

junction of hard and soft was taken between the finger and thumb, the mere heat of
the hand was sufficient to cause a deflection of 50░ by the needle of a galvanometer.
The investigation goes to prove that to the production of a thermo- current the contact

of different metals is virtually necessary, and that if the same metal exliibit the phse-
nomenon it is because its various parts are in different states of molecular aggregation.

we have tried it at Oxford, in the Radcliffe Library, and with most satisfactory re-

Wesults.  have observed one point in the motion which may be worth recording,

and I have not seen this noticed in other experiments ; and it is this, that whenever

the plane of vibration approaches the magnetic meridian, the apparent motion of the

plane is accelerated, while it is proportionally retarded as it approaches the line

Wewhich is at right angles to the magnetic meridian.   have observed these effects

for more than three weeks. The acceleration in approaching the magnetic meridian

is nearly one degree per hour. I had hoped to have been able to present these results

in an accurate form, but I have not had time.

12 pounds, and suspended by a piano wire ; the length from point of suspension to

bottom is as nearly as may be 80 feet 6 inches. The time of one vibration is a little
short of five seconds, more accurately 4 "96 seconds. As some thought the iron ball
more susceptible of magnetic influence, it was about ten days ago replaced by a lead
one of the same weight with a brass pointer. The results, however (as I did not

doubt), are just the same as with the iron one.

Inquiries into some Physical Properties of the Solid and Liquid Constituent

         Parts of Plants. By Professor E. Wartmann of Geneva.

   Plants are furnished with different membranes, many of which can be obtained
separately. Such are the epidermis of leaves, stems, fruits, &c. These membranes
seem to belong to two classes. The first consists of those which are composed of
round cells. The second comprises the cuticles in which the elongated cells prevail.
When viewed in a polarizing apparatus (such as that devised by Prof Norrenberg),
the latter depolarize light. The action is very striking with the epidermis of Eucomis

Apunctata, and a plate of rock crystal with two inverted rotations. similar action is

found when a ray of polarized heat is transmitted through the membrane. If these

organs have been steeped for a considerable time in acids or water, they are not de-

prived of these properties.

   The double-refracting power of those tissues is easily perceived by looking through
them at a distant window. There are two positions at right angles in which one
set only of the cross-bars is seen. The horizontal bars appear when the longer side
of the cells is vertical, and vice versa. In intermediate positions, two faintly-coloured

images of each are sometimes visible.
    If such a thin membrane is interposed between the eye and the flame of a candle,

spectra of interference are produced on both sides of the flame, in a direction parallel
to the greater length of the cells. The appearance is like that which Fraunhofer has

discovered in the network.

   Such a structure in the outer coating of a great many plants may, perhaps, not

be without some connexion with the ever-changing direction of the plane of polariza-

tion of the atmospheric hght and heat derived from the sun.

   The liquid parts of vegetables are in electrical relations to each other, which may

be readily detected by clear platlna wires connected with a very sensible galvano-

meter. Two have been employed, one of 4000 coils, the other of 20,000. The

following results have been arrived at by examination of what happens in different

sections or the same section of the plant. Since my investigations, some of these
results have been confirmed by M. Becquerel in an independent way.

    Electric currents exist in all parts of vegetables, except in those which are furnished
with insulating substances, or which contain scarcely any internal humidity.

    These currents exist night and day, in the sunshine as well as in the shade ; they
are not destroyed by an exposure to the vapours of aether continued for twenty-four
hours, nor by the partial or total separation of the portion examined from the re-
mainder of the plant, so long as that portion is not dry.

    In the roots, the stems, the branches, the petioles and the peduncles, a central

descending current and a peripherical ascending one are to be found, which may be

called axial currents.

   On connecting, by means of the galvanometer, the layers of the stem where the

liber and the alburnum touch (and where several botanists admit a descending flow
of elaborated sap), either with the more central parts, such as pith and perfect wood,
or with the younger bark, a lateral current appears from these layers to the neigh-
bouring organs.

   The strength of these currents, as well as of those which are exhibited in the other
parts of the plant, depends on the energy of vegetation and the abundance of sap
pervading the part under examination.

  A current is also found when any portion of the plant is placed in the circuit of

the galvanometer, the other extremity of the wire being inserted in the soil at a di-

stance which may be very considerable if the tract is wet. The plant is negative in

relation to the soil.

  All these phienomena (the connexion of which with those described by MM. Mat-

teucci and Dubois-Reymond is obvious) may probably be explained by the fact, that
when two portions of a liquid, acid, alkaline or neutral, the concentration of which

is different, are separated by a porous organic membrane, a current of electricity
proceeds from the denser to the rarer.

   The electric state of the soil, and perhaps the exhalation which takes place in the
organs furnished with stomata, have an influence upon the electricit)' of the ambient

atmospheric strata.

Description of an Apparatus for making Astronomical Observations by

  means of Electro-Magnetism. By G. P. and R. F. Bond, of the Cambridge

    United States Observatory.

   The apparatus exhibited to the Section is the same which has been in use at the
Harvard Observatory, Cambridge, U.S., and is the property of the United States Coast
Survey. It consists of an electric break-circuit clock, a galvanic battery of a single
Grove's cup, and the spring governor, by which uniform motion is given to the paper.
Two wires pass from the clock, one direct to the battery, and the other through the
break-circuit key used by the observer, and through the recording magnet back to the

battery. The length of the wire is of course immaterial. When the battery is in

connection, the circuit is broken by the pallet leaving the tooth of the wheel, and is
restored at the instant of the beat of the clock, which is in fact the sound produced
by the completion of the contact restoring the circuit, the passage of the current
being through the pallet and the escapement-wheel alone. With the exception of
the connecting wires, and the insulation of some parts, the clock is like those in

common use for astronomical purposes.
    Several forms have been proposed by different persons for interrupting, mecha-

nically, the galvanic circuit at intervals precisely equal. In the present instance the

clock is of the form proposed by Mr. Bond. Prof. Wheatstone, Prof. Mitchell, Dr.
Locke, Mr. Saxton and others, have contrived different modes of effecting this object
the former several years since, but for a purpose distinct from the present.

   The cylinder makes a single rotation in a minute ; the second marks, and the ob-

servations succeed each other in a continuous spiral. When a sheet is filled, and it

is taken from the cylinder, the second marks, and observations appear in parallel
columns, as in a table of double entry, the minutes and seconds being the two argu-
ments at the head and side of the sheet.

   The observer with the break-circuit key in his hand or at his side, at the instant
of the transit of a star over the wire of a telescope, touches the key with his finger.
The record is made at the same instant on the paper, which may be at any distance,
many hundred miles, if required, from the observer. It is a well-established fact,
that not only may observations be increased in number by this process, but that the
limits of error of each individual result are also narrowed. As far as comparison^

have yet been made, the personal equation between diflferent observers, if not entirely
insensible, is at least confined to a few hundredths of a second.

   It is through the facilities and means furnished by the Coast Survey Department
of the United States, under the superintendence of Dr. A. D. Bache, that individuals
there have been enabled to bring to its present stage the application of electro-mag-
netism to the purposes of geodesy and of astronomy ; it having been at the expense
of that department, and frequently by its officers, that nearly all the experiments
have been conducted.

Messrs. Whipple and Jones of Boston, from the image formed in the focus of the

On a Method of Sounding in Deep Seas. By J. P. Joule, F.R.S.

The impossibilitj' of sounding the depth of the ocean by the ordinary plumb-line

has been remarked for nearly three centuries, and during that time numerous inven-

tions have been made in order to measure great depths at sea. The instrument

which appeared most feasible consisted of two bodies, which in connexion with one

another, sank to the bottom, where, becoming detached, the body of lighter specific

gravity rose to the surface. The time occupied indicated the depth of the water,

which was otherwise ascertained by vanes propelled by the water during the motion

of the sounding apparatus through it.

In these instruments, the body which was intended to float to the surface was

generally of wood. But, beyond a very limited depth, an instrument composed of

such a material would fail to give any result ; for Scoresby has shown that when

wood is sunk in a deep sea, it becomes so saturated with water as to become of

greater specific gravity than that fluid. To overcome this difficulty, the wood has
been covered with pitch, &c.; but it may be doubted whether such a coating would

prevent the penetration of water under great pressure. I find, moreover, that light

wood, cork, &c., when subjected to a pressure of some tons on the square inch, are

crushed so as to become specifically heavier than water ; and that they remain so even

Aafter the pressure has been removed.  wooden float would therefore be crushed,

even if the coating of pitch were sufficient to keep out the water from its pores.

  A method of overcoming this difficulty has been recently devised by M. Faye, in

which he substitutes a vessel of sheet-steel filled with oil, or other light inelastic

fluid, for the wooden float. M. Faye recommends the use of a cylinder of sheet-

steel 1 metre high, and 2 decimetres in diameter, which, filled with potato oil,

would have a specific gravity of 0"88 in comparison with sea- water, and a force of

ascension equal to 15 kilogrammes. For further details of his apparatus, see the

' Comptes Rendus,' January 20.

I believe it to be impossible to improve upon the general principle adopted by M.

Faye, but it has occurred tome that a great improvement in the detail would be effected

by substituting for the metallic vessel in his apparatus, one of gutta percha, which

if filled with alcohol or a light oil, need not exceed the gravity of 0'8, that of sea-

water being called unity. In this case the ascending force would be nearly double

that of M. Faye's instrument. As a further means of increasing the velocity of

ascension, the gutta percha vessel should be constructed on Mr. Russell's wave prin-

ciple. If the float were 10 feet long, and 1 foot in its greatest diameter, and fur-

nished with a proper weight, a depth of 7 miles might be sounded in less than one

hour.

   Dr. Faraday submitted, on the part of Dr. Roxburgh, a specimen of dark glass to

the examination of the Section under the following circumstances :
    It had been employed to darken the image of the sun outside the eye-piece of a

telescope of 3 inches aperture and 47 inches focal length ; the magnifying power of
the eye-piece was 100, and the dark glass was placed at the distance of about one-

eighth of an inch from it. No other eye- piece produced the same effect. In about

two minutes after the telescope had been directed to the sun, and the focus adjusted,
the greater part of the field of view became dim, as if the glass had been breathed

on, and the definition became suddenly destroyed. When the glass was examined

under high magnifying power, a minute portion on the surface next the telescope
was found to have been completely melted, a small pimple surrounded by a hollow

mhaving been formed. Six or seven dark glasses have been destroyed the same

way ; not one has been broken, all having had the small portion of the surface melted.
Latterly this accident has been prevented from recurring by placing the dark glass

closer to the telescope.    ^

On M. Guyot's Experiment. By the Rev. Professor Powell, F.R.S. ^c.

The recent experiment of M. Foucault, giving direct proof of the earth's rotation,

having excited so much attention, it seems remarkable that an equally striking one

devised and tried by M. J. Guyot in 1836, should have been passed over or forgotten.

That gentleman conceived, that as a falling body deviates to the east, a long plumb-
                            This experiment he performed in the dome of the Pan-
line ought to do the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       _

theon at Paris, with a plumb-line about 172 feet long, and determined the deviation

to be 4 J millims. in 57 metres. His mode of experimenting was by small balls, one at
the point of suspension, the other at the weight, whose images, strongly illuminated

and reflected in a basin of mercury placed below, were viewed from above and found

to coincide, when the eve was laterally distant 4i millims. from the upper ball. The

experiment might probably be simplified without the trouble of illumination, by

making the suspension from a pin passed across a small circular aperture in a flat

roof, the light coming through, which would probably give a sufiiciently light image

in the mercury below. The' effect is also stated to be sufficiently perceptible with

much less length. But much doubt has been expressed with respect to i\ie principle.
It seems, therefore, desirable that attention should be drawn to the question.

Communication respecting the Comet of Short Period discovered by Brorsen,

   Of the different heavenly bodies which made their appearance in the year 1846,
the comet discovered by Brorsen, February 26, merits our special attention, on ac-
count of its short period of revolution round the sun.

the two observations made at the Greenwich observatory, I have determined the

following fundamental positions.

of greater or less brilliancy, occurring at stated intervals ; 2nd, an expanding and
contracting of the whole body of light, not only vertically, but also laterally ; and

3rd, a motion amongst the stars.
   1st. Pulsations were noticed 1850, March 6d. 7h. 42m., of greater and less bril-

liancy in periods of 30s.; in these alternations it invariably receded to a certain dimness,
and then brightened again to a fixed extent. The pulsations were again noticed on

March 7th, 9th, 10th, 11th; 1851, January 27th, March 20th (when^'they were very
marked), and 22nd. These pulsations were again 30s., alternating from change to

change, as they were last year.
   2nd. The vertical expansion and contraction of the body of light on 1850, March

6d.at7h.42m., were4░30'. The longitude of apex, when most brilliant, was 8 21░ 30',
receding to longitude of apex e 17░ when least bright. InlSSl, March 20d. 8h., this
expansion and contraction were 3░ ; the max. long, of apex being 51░, min. long, of
apex 48░, the mean long, of apex being 49░ 30'.

   At three different periods the lateral body of light also widened, and this occurred
each time when at its maximum degree of brilliancy. This was first noticed at
7h. 55m., when the north edge extended to (3 Arietis, again at 7h. 59m., when it
extended midway between ^ and a Arietis, and thirdly at 8h. 3m , when it
covered a Arietis. It remained in this widened state from Is. to 3s., returning each
time to its mean place between /3 and y Arietis; once when very dim the north edge
was thought to have receded to y Arietis (viz. at 7h. 50m.). The southern edge un-
fortunately had not such good guide stars for measuring, so that I cannot speak
positively as to whether it receded when the north edge advanced, yet the impression

made at the time was that it did not, and at 7h. 59m. appeared to widen with the

       On Air-bubbles formed in Water, By John Tyndall, PJi.D.

   The object of the paper is to account for the bubbles formed when water is poured
into water. Venturi imagined that they were due to the air which adheres to the
descending fluid. Magnus, on the contrary, conjectured that they were owing to
the formation of a cavity at the point where the descending water meets the fluid
underneath, the cavity being closed up, and the bubble formed when a motion is
imparted to the surface. This latter conjecture the author proves to be correct, and
shows further the relation which subsists between the production of the bubbles and

the structure of the descending mass.

  A vein issuing at a moderate velocity from a circular orifice in the bottom of a tin

vessel possesses two portions strikingly distinct. After the fluid leaves the orifice it
is steady and limpid for some distance, and contracts gradually as it descends. The
contraction depends upon the accelerated motion of the particles, and its amount
depends upon the cohesive power of the fluid experimented with. At a certain point
the steadiness of the vein ceases, and it exhibits a quivering motion like the vibration
of a harp -string. If the surface of the water underneath intersect the vein above
this point no bubbles are produced ; below this point they invariably appear. The
steady portion of the vein exhibits the exact deportment of a solid rod ; there is even
capillar}' attraction at the point where it enters the fluid below ; and if the oblique
light of a candle be suffered to fall upon the eminence here formed, a moth-like
figure with yellow wings is thrown upon the bottom of the vessel which contains
the fluid. Similar figures are caused by the bubbles which float accidentally upon
the surface ; and when the latter is set in motion the figures stir their wings as if
they were alive.

   Although to the naked eye the quivering portion of the vein appears continuous,
it is not so in reality, as Savart has demonstrated. It is resolved into single drops,
and it is the quickness with which they succeed each other which gives the impression
of continuity. Placing a platinum wire heated to whiteness between the poles of a
small galvanic battery behind the vein, and using an opake fluid; the author found
that when the steady portion came between the eye and wire the latter was cut by
a dark stripe ; but when the quivering portion came into this position the wire glowed
uninterruptedly from end to end. It was seen through the intervals between the
drops, and the time of transit of a drop was not sufficient to extinguish the im-

pression.

   The descent of each drop causes the water to recede on all sides, thus forming a
canal into which the air enters, and where it is entrapped by the descent of the suc-
ceeding drop, or b)' the closing up of the mouth of the canal. Exactly the same
takes place when we let grains of shot fall successively into the water, or draw a
string of beads quickly through it. It is the lateral component of the ilrop's force
which originates the bubble, and even when the jet is continuous, if it vibrate, bub-

Ables will be produced.  bow-string will cause the same when immersed in water

and pulled out of its position of equilibrium.

   The sound of agitated water, which, as a phj'sical phsenomenon, appears to have

been overlooked hitherto, is the invariable companion of the bubbles. When the

continuous portion of the vein is cut b)"^ the surface underneath no bubbles are pro-

duced, and no sound is audible ; but the moment the one appears the other is heard.
The sound is in fact almost wholly due to the sudden liberation of the air enclosed

in the water ; the ripple of a brook and the roar of the ocean being alike referable to

this cause.

On our Ignorance of the Tides. By the Rev. W. Whewell, D.D., F.R.S.

   The leading features of the general knowledge of the tides, at which we arrive by
observations, are the succession of times of high water and low water as we proceed

along an extensive coast, or from one part of a large ocean to another ; and the re-
lative amount of solar and lunar tides, as shown both by the relative heights of high
and low water, and by the amount of the semidiurnal inequality of time. To this

may be added the amount of the diurnal inequality, and its incidence ; namely,

whether it falls most on high water or low water, on heights or on times.

Such knowledge we possess with regard to the coasts of Europe, pretty completelj"^,

mainly owing to the very general system of simultaneous observations made at Dr.

Whewell's suggestion in 1826 ; and also with regard to the Atlantic coast of the

United States, our knowledge in that case being entirely supplied by the set of ob-

Weservations made on that coast at the same time.  possess also a tolerably com-

plete knowledge of this kind for the eastern coast of Australia, and for some other

Wepoints of the coast, the diurnal inequality being here peculiar.  know also the

general course of the tides on the shores of New Zealand, which may be expressed

by saying that the tide-wave comes from the east, and strikes the middle of the

eastern shore first.

   And this seems to be the whole amount of the general practical knowledge which

we possess on this subject. There appears to be no other extensive coast on which
we know the succession of times of high water, still less the semidiurnal and diurnal
inequality. On the eastern coast of South America we do not know this with any cer-
tainty, though we know that the tides on that coast have curious features ; as for
instance, that at the mouth of the Plate river the tides are insensible, and a little
further to the south, are some of the greatest in the world. But we do not know

on whaCt part of the coast the tide- wave runs south, and on what part north.

   On the west coast of South America we labour under the like ignorance. It appears

to be made out by the observations of Capt. FitzRoy and others, that on the southerly

part of this coast the tide-wave runs southward, and so round Cape Horn to the

eastward, although it might have been expected that the tide, following the moon,
would travel westward. But as we proceed northwards along the west coast of Ame-

rica, it becomes more difficult to reconcile the separate observations which we have.

I have supposed that fiom the isthmus of Panama, the tide-wave diverges northwards

and southwards ; but in some of its results this supposition is far from satisfactory.
For the northern parts of the N. Pacific, we have Admiral Liitke's observations at

the Aleutian islands, &c. ; but these, though correct aa far as they go, only give a

partial view.

   Returning to the borders of our knowledge, we find that it ends with the shores of
Europe. On the west coast of Africa, we know nothing, so far as I am aware, of

the progress of the tide-wave ; whether it travels from south to north, or from north

to south ; or where these directions diverge or converge. On the eastern coast of
Africa, our ignorance is still more complete ; and though we have some detached ob-
servations on the coast of India, we have nothing which gives us a correct view of
the progress of the tide. Eastward of India we have remarkable cases of the diurnal

inequality (Tonquin, Sincapore), noticed from the earliest to the latest periods of

tidal researches, but no connected knowledge ; and as we go further, the tides of
the Indian Ocean and of the Pacific become so mingled that we cannot expect to dis-
entangle them except by laborious observations.

As we are thus ignorant of the progress of the shore tides (the littoral tides), so
--28 REPORT 1851.

arc we also of the relation of the central oceanic tides to these. The tides of the

Bahamas, the Azores, the Feroe Isles, the Cape Verde Isles, have not been studied,

Anor connected with each other, nor with the littoral tides.  few notices of what is

called "the establishment," tell us little, and it may be, nothing, if we do not know

the manner in which these results have been obtained. The same is true of the

islands in the central regions of other wide oceans.

It may appear at first sight that this representation of our ignorance is inconsistent

with the results formerly furnished as the amount of our knowledge, exhibited in

maps of cotidal lines. But to this, I reply, that the cotidal lines, so far as they are

drawn across wide oceans, are fallacious. It appears to be certain that the relation

of the tidal movements of a large ocean, such as the Atlantic, the Pacific, or the

Indian Ocean, are not justly represented by the notion of waves bounded by such

lines. With regard to the shores, the motion of the tides may be rightly represented

by such lines ; but the lines formerly drawn on the various shores above mentioned,

merely as the best first approximation which could be made, are still liable to great

doubt in almost every place, and therefore they require revision and correction, or

confirmation. And this is especially the case, now that these systems of cotidal

lines are no longer supported by the kind of connection which their continuity through

the oceanic spaces formerly gave them. By means of given connected observations

(the connesioh in the mode of making the observations is the essential condition of

success), the course of the littoral tide-wave on all the extensive shores of the ocean

might be determined, and at the islands ; and these results being obtained, the mo-
tion of the tidal movements of the ocean on the larger scale would probably be

brought into view.

It may be proper to point out a little more in detail the kind of facts which would

have to be noticed. If we suppose a tide-wave, which is nearly straight, moving

transversely, to strike a convex shore, there will be some one point which it will

first touch, and it will proceed from this point along the shore both ways. This point

will be a point of divergence ; the tide will be later and later both ways in proceeding
from this point. Such a point is the S.W. point of Ireland, the Land's End in

England ; a point on the E. coast of Australia, in S. latitude 25░ ; a point on the E.

coast of New Zealand, in latitude 37░. On the other hand, if the tide come from

two different quarters, as for instance if it come round the two ends of an island to

the side furthest from the tide, the two waves will approach and meet at some in-

termediate point of the coast, and there will be & point of convergence; and the tides

will be later and later in proceeding towards this point. Such a point there is on

the coast of England, about the mouth of the Thames, where the tide which comes

round by the North of Scotland and by the straits of Dover meet. Such a point

there is on the west coast of New Zealand. ^
  Now in order to determine the general course of the tides, we ought to determine

these points of divergence and of convergence on every coast, and especially on every

extensive coast. But as yet I am not aware that any others are known besides those

иwhich I have mentioned. On the west coast of America I have placed a point of

divergence near Panama, as best representing the succession of the tides along the

coast ; but the form of the wave is not satisfactory. On the east coast of South Ame-

rica, as I have said, we have very high tides south of the river Plate, which seems as

if there were a point of convergence in that region ; but this requires to be more

fully proved : and the point of divergence seems to be on the coast of Brazil, but the

evidence is very confused and scanty. On the west coast of Africa, I am not able
at all to fix upon points of divergence and convergence ; and, in short, we know little

or nothing of the course of the tides on that coast. Still more is this the case with

regard to the Indian Ocean, although on the shores of the great islands which lie

there, there must be many points of divergence and convergence.

And the connection of the tides of small islands in a larger ocean with those of

the shore is so obscure hitherto, that I do not now venture to express it in any definite
manner till we have a better collection of facts. In my paper on the tides of the

Pacific (Art. 12.), I have suggested a mode in which this connection may perhaps

be expressed.

                                          Meteokology.

Account of an Apparatus for determining tJie Quantity of Hygrometric

                   Moisture in the Air. By Dr. Andrews.

   The object of the author was to contrive an apparatus capable of giving directly
the amount of moisture in the air by the unerring indications of the balance, and
which might, at the same time, be easily employed in the physical cabinet, or other
place devoted to meteorological observations. For this purpose, according to a
method long known to chemists, a given volume of air is drawn through- a weighed
U-tube filled with some substance retentive of moisture ; but the author proposes
certain modifications in the apparatus hitherto emploj'ed which are designed to
render it applicable in the hands of persons not familiar with chemical operations,
or who may not have the convenience of a laboratory vvithin reach. With this ob-
ject in view, he found it necessary to reject both sulphuric acid and chloride of calcium
as desiccating agents, in consequence of their being either too troublesome in the
preparation, or unsafe in the vicinity of valuable instruments ; but an excellent sub-
stitute presented itself in calcined sulphate of lime or gypsum, which he ascertained
by numerous experiments to be capable of removing every trace of moisture from
air passed even in a tolerably rapid current through tubes containing it. The sul-
phate of lime was employed in small fragments prepared by moistening powdered
alabaster, as commonly used by plasterers and moulders, and spreading the moist-
ened mass into the form of thin plates, which were afterwards rendered perfectly
anhydrous by being placed on an iron plate heated nearly to obscure redness.
The aspirator consists of a gasometer whose bell is attached as a counterpoise to the
weight of a Dutch clock, sufficiently heavy to work it, by which simple contrivance
a known volume of air may be drawn at a uniform rate, and in any required time,
through the desiccating tube. The quantity of moisture in the air may, in this way.
be determined to almost any degree of accuracy, either for shq.rt periods, as half an
hour, or for longer periods, as 8, 12 or more hours, in which latter case the appa-
ratus becomes a sort of integrating hygrometer, by which the total amount of

moisture in the air for a given period is indicated.

                              Sketch of the Climate of Western India.

 By Dr. Buist, LL.D,, F.R.S. L. 4' E. (^Communicated by Col. Sykes.)

   The author in this paper abstains from numerical details, and states as his reason
for doing so, that the " profuse employment of instruments occasions to a con-
siderable extent the more striking and obvious manifestations of the atmosphere to
be lost sight of, unless in so far as these are indicated by the barometer or thermo-
meter;" "and that picturesque and descriptive meteorology has almost altogether

been buried under minute instrumental details." He instances Dampier and Mount-

stewart Elphinstone as furnishing information of the kind he commends.

   He first notes that the European division of the year into four seasons, does not
hold good in Western India, where the year may be divided into two seasons only,

the rainy and the fair, the latter being divisible however into the cold and the hot*.
The monsoon sets in at Bombay with tremendous violence from the S.E. in the
beginning of June ; but the rains immediately go round to the S.W. and draw off
early in September. The winds blow throughout the year with the greatest regu-
larity. During the fair season, from October until May, there are alternating diurnal
and nocturnal winds, or land and sea breezes as they are called. The land wind
blows from easterly quarters, setting in after midnight and blowing until three or
four hours after sunrise, when a dead calm ensues. The sea breezes then blow from

westerly quarters. About the beginning of May the air becomes damp and muggy

the land and sea breezes become irregular, and a calm prevails over a great part of
the night, with the thermometer from 80░ to 85░, and the air being surcharged with
moisture, people are debarred from sound sleep. About the middle of the month

--30 REPORT 1851.

long banks of electric clouds make their appearance over the mountains in the East

[the Deccan Ghauts]. Towards the end of the month sheet-lightning appears from

these clouds, then brilliant lightning, and iu time the monsoon opens from them.

These masses are frequently magnificent at sunset, but they seldom appear before

mid-day, and are rarely visible very long after sunset. In February and March the

ground is so parched that the powers of vegetation appear exhausted ; and though a

small portion only of the trees and shrubs are deciduous, they all look so shrivelled,
brown and stumpy, that it is difficult to believe they will vivify again. About the

middle of April, however, there is all at once a magical burst of verdure and vitality
amongst ligneous plants, as if some new stimulant had been suddenly given, and the

forest trees are radiant with flowers, the foot or more long pendent bunches of the

yellow flowers of the Cassia fistula, and the bright red flowers of the Erythrina

fulgens being most conspicuous. The delicious mango ripens towards the end of

the hot weather, and its turpentine is useful in the cutaneous diseases, boils and

entozoa, which then prevail. The author then speaks of the changing seasons upon

--the habits of birds, very graphically describes the storms of thunder and lightning,

precursors to the setting-in of the monsoon, and the setting-in of the monsoon itself;

with its consequences ofdeluges of rain and greensward ; the lightof a cloudy English
day instead of intolerable glare, and a fall of 10░ or 12░ in the temperature ; cloth and

woollens being substituted for cotton and muslin fabrics. He notices the almost mira-

culous appearance of the multitudinous gigantic yellow frogs, before unseen ; notices
that boots, shoes and other articles of leather are covered with mildew in the course

of twenty-four hours in the houses, and that paper and clothes are damp and clammy.

Thousands of small fish, after the first rain-fall, are found in puddles, whether on

the plains or on the hill tops, and they appear and disappear with the rains, never

exceeding the length of the fore-finger. The rank growth and decay of vegetation

evolves immense quantities of carbonaceous gases, which impregnating the water,

dissolve the shells and calcareous matter everywhere about ; and as the rains draw ofi^

and the water evaporates, lime is thrown down, cementing together gravel and

Aother matters into a kind of concrete building-stone.               rain-table for thirty years

is then given, showing that the annual fall has varied from 122 inches to 34 inches,

the annual average being 76 inches ; but this is for the monsoon only, as an account
of the fall of rain between November and June has never been kept. The natives

consider the force of the rains to be over by the first full moon in August, and a

festival is kept in consequence, and half-deck vessels then venture to sea. The

breaking up of the monsoon is in October, when the sun is in the constellation
" Hust," or the Elephant ; but as the terminal storms come to Bombay from over

the Island of Elephanta, Europeans call them the Elephanta. About 3 p.m. vast

masses of clouds appear piled upon each other, vivid lightning follows, then a

deluge of rain, and at last the sky is left destitute of a cloud. This occurs for

three or four times, and then the cold and afterwards the hot seasons set in, and

rain is sometimes not seen for months. During the squalls of March and April

the barometer usually falls or becomes irregular, and during July it sinks very

low; but the bursts in the beginning of June and October which herald iu and close

the monsoon, seem purely electrical, neither the pressure nor the humidity of the

air being materially aftected by them. Dr. Buist then notices the var^ang phases of

the Elephanta in each year, from 1840 to 1850 inclusive. It will suffice to mention

that in 1847 the Elephanta was almost abortive in October, but from the 1st to the

5th of November, there was a fall of 3^ inches of rain, to the great discomfort of

those who had gone upon the assurance of the usual regularity of the seasons, into

their fair-weather abodes. At neither Madras nor Calcutta is the separation be-

twixt  the  rainy  and  fair  seasons,  anything  like  so distinct  as  it  is at  Bombay                                    nor at
                                                                                                                           ;

either place is there anything corresponding in violence or sublimity to the outburst

about the 6th of June, or the magnificent though brief Elephanta. Some November

--dust-storms are then described, of which that of the 1st of November 1850 is a

type : "At 4 o'clock in the afternoon dark lurid clouds began to collect over the

Ghauts and roll oft' toward the zenith, in the teeth of the sea breeze. Heavy rain

began to fall all along the line of the Ghauts, about half-past 4 o'clock. At 5 p.m.

exactly, the storm burst upon the roadstead and fort of Bombay, and then we had

straw and light materials of all descriptions sweeping through the air ! This squall,
which was one of the most violent while it lasted that we remember, went round by

the N.E., and was over in half an hour; a good deal of thunder followed; after
which light rain began to fall which continued for some time. Before 9 p.m. every-
thing was as quiet and peaceful as if there had never been a disturbance amongst

the elements at all. From Mahabuleshwur* the people saw the whole far beneath

them, and the eflfect was very grand. In one place a cloud seemed pouring out its

contents over a space of almost a square mile, while all around was bright sunshine

between the hills and the sea there was a dense cloud, emitting frequent flashes of

lightning, and beyond everything appeared quite clear." Dr. Buist concludes with

some reflections upon the storms of India, which he resolves into three classes :
1st, the whirling storm or Cyclone, which has been so well illustrated by Mr. Pe-
dington ; 2nd, the travelling storm which glides over the country at the rate of 200
to 250 miles a day, pursuing generally a rectilineal path ; and 3rd, the storms of

simultaneous occurrence, appearing at a fixed date and manifesting themselves at

nearly the same point of time over a vast area of surfuce. Instances are then given :

he considers the first week in November, the last week of December, the middle of

January, the first week of February, and the first weeks of April and May, to have

been crisis periods for some years past. With the exception of these periods of

disturbances, the fair weather climate is so uniform as not to need notice ; the cold

seasion beginning in December and lasting until March, and the hot season com-
mencing in April and lasting until the rains set in. The last half of January, how-

ever, and the whole of February, are remarkable for a dry, thin mist during the day,

which obscures the horizon ; and for the brightness of the nights and heavy fall of

dew. In February the sea at night often assumes a magnificent luminous ap-

pearance, the breakers being bright as melted silver. In the day-time it is seen to

be of a brilliant red colour, which is occasioned by the Protococcus nivalis, or, as Dr.

Carter supposes, P. hcematococcus. The animalcules affect strong saline solutions,

and it is supposed the red rock salt owes its colour to them. Of the lightning, Dr.

Buist says it is often of a ruby or of an amethystine purple colour, sometimes

greenish, but most frequently white. Dr. Buist concludes his paper with some in-

teresting notices of the habits of the flying fox, Pteropus Edwardsii, and land crab,

Hailstorms in India, from June 1850 to May 1851. By Dr. Buist.

                              Communicated by Col. Sykes.

The year 1850 seems in India to have been singularly barren in notable atmo-

spheric pheenomena of all descriptions. The monsoon in Western India was remark-

ably scanty; and at Bombay not a drop of rain fell betwixt the 5th of November and

I6th of May, and there seems scarcely to have been a single hail-storm betwixt June

and February worthy of record. On the 7th of February hail fell in considerable

Aquantity of the size of pigeons' eggs, at Comoree near Rawah.  wild hail-storm

visited Meerut on the 28th of March, the haiUstones being about the size of walnuts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

on the 30th hail fell about the size of beans on the Neilgheries 6000 feet above the

level of the sea. Heavy showers began to pour down all over Lower Bengal about

the 23rd, and so continued for a week, the spring sowings having gone on rapidly

and cheeringly. On this occasion a violent hail-storm visited Calcutta ; no great

damage however was occasioned by it. Hail fell at Secunderabad on the 11th of April

and 2nd of May, and on the 22nd of April a hail-storm of terrific violence occurred at

Rungpore, near Calcutta, the hail-stones being as large as ducks' eggs. Nearly all

the fruit in the districts, hundreds of houses, and a great number of trees were de-

--stroyed by it. The three largest masses of ice recorded as having fallen in India

are

1st. That mentioned by Dr. Hyne in his tracts published in 1814 as having fallen

near Scringapatam in the time of Tippoo Sultan ; it was in the size of an elephant, and
took two days to melt.

2nd. In 1826 a mass of ice fell in Candeish, which must nearly have been a cubic

yard in size ; no exact measure was made of it.
   3rd. In April 1838 a mass of hail-stones, cemented into one block, fell at Dharwar.

It was 19 fpet 10 inches in its larger diameter.

These things, on which doubts at one time were cast, no longer seem incredible.

In August 1 S-4 9 a mass of ice fell in Rosshire 20 feet ia circumference ; it is described

A --in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal and the Scotchman newspaper of the time.
      correspondent writes : " Since my list of hail-storms I have only had to record
one under my own observation, and which occurred about three p.m. at a place

called Oomree, seven miles west of Revvah, on the 7th of February last, the hail-

stones fully as big as pigeons' eggs. It did not last long, but was very violent, and

tore my tent sadly. This village Oomree must have been about the centre, as it did
not extend to Rewah east, and only about four miles to the westward, as ray camels

were about that distance, and had only rain."

 --"The subjoined account of a violent hail-storm at Meerut on the 28th of April, is

from the Mofussilite of the 1st instant: 'On Friday last Meerut was visited by a

hail-storm of unusual violence. The hail-stones were considerably larger than pigeons'

Weeggs, the usual standard of measurement on such occasions.  regret to hear that

much damage was done in the gardens and fields of the station and district. The

prospects of the ensuing fruit-season are now reduced to a possibility, and the
splendid crops are said to have suffered very severely.' "

  A" Jessore correspondent gives rather an unfavourable account of the weather

--and crops ; 'We had a very heavy shower of hail on the 2nd instant, with scarcely

any rain ; whatever of the latter fell was all dried up by noon the next day. Since

then we have had strong south-westerly winds, scorching up and killing everything :

the land is like burnt bricks. Young trees and garden-shrubs are dying off in all
directions.' " Morning Chronicle, April 14.

  A" severe hail-storm visited the Delhi district on the l7th of April, too late, for-

tunately, to do any injury to the crops. The hail-stones, which continued to fall for

more than half an hour, were of large size, and must have done extensive damage

had any of the grain been left standing. At present the atmosphere is charged with
electricity, and we may expect a few more thunder-bursts before the weather becomes

settled."--De?/Ф' Gazette, April 19.

  We" hear from Hydrabad that that station was visited with a very heavy shower of

rain, accompanied with hail, on the evening of the l7th of April. The hail-stones,

we are told, were large, so much so as to startle the natives of the place." Kur-

rachee Gazette, April 23rd.

  A" correspondent at Secunderabad writes as follows, under date 5th instant :

' On the 2nd of April we had a slight shower of hail, and on the 1 1th of last month

there was a very severe fall of hail about four miles from this. The sky now looks
very threatening, large masses of dark clouds hanging about.' " Bombay Times,

May 12th.

   "The subjoined account of a terrific hail-storm at Rungpore is taken from the

Enylishman of the 2nd instant : the hail-stones are described as being equal in size
--A --to ducks' eggs !
correspondent at Rungpore says : ' Have you heard of the

dreadful hail-storm we had here on the 22nd of this month (April) ? It was one of
the most terrific ever known in these parts. It destroyed hundreds of houses, and

no small number of trees ; some old ones which had stood the storms of a hundred
years came down. All the fruit in the gardens is destroyed. The hail-stones were

--as large as ducks' eggs, and the whole station looks like a wreck.'"
   Note by Colonel Sykes. The following is an account of hail-stones of great size

which fell at Nottingham :

  --" Violent Storm at Nottingham.' On Friday afternoon, June 20th, 1851, at three

o'clock, a storm of hail and rain, of unusual violence, broke immediately over this

Atown, deluging the streets, and sweeping everything before it.  great mass of

water accumulated in Upper Parliament Street, and swept with overpowering force

down Sheep Lane into the market-place, at a time when there was the greatest throng

of business, pots and pans, fruit, vegetables, and other things being carried away ;

and a large stream flowed out of the market-place down Wheeler-gate, filling the

low kitchens in its course. The lightning was extremely vivid, and one flash struck

a chimney on the south-west corner of Messrs. Hodgson, Gregory and Co.'s lace-

factory, Canal Street, and the electric fluid, passing down the chimney shaft, set fire

to a quantity of cotton fibre. The room was instantly in a blaze, hut it was fortu-

nately discovered by Mr, Hodgson, and put out in a few minutes. Some of the hail-

stones were three or four inches in circumference, and were in shape something like

broad beans. The storm, which was confined almost exclusively to Nottingham,
Alasted but ten minutes, and was followed by a brilliant evening.

panes were broken, and the low kitchens in the streets, where there was the slightest

descent, were filled with water."

On some Unusual Phcenomena. By E. J. Lowe, F.R.A.S.

--1st. An appearance about the sun seen near Highfield House.

1850, May 28th. The day had been fine, with passing showers, the barometer

above 30 inches.
   At &" 48" the phsenomenon was

first noticed.

  A a mock sun, elliptical, exceed-

ingly bright, highly prismatic, the red

Abeing nearest the sun. ray of light

passed through it. The distance from

the true sun was 24░ 30'.

   C another mock sun, similar in all

respects to A, was formed on the hori-

zontal level of the sun on the E. side.

  ABC was a considerable portion

of a circle (a part being hid behind a

cloud), whose horizontal radius was

24░ 30', and whose vertical radius

was 26░.

  ADC was apparently a horizontal circle of larger size ; it was distinct even to the

sun's edge ; it passed through the sun, and also through the mock suns. The di-
stance from C to E was 20░, its extreme length was 80*.

  D AB was apparently a vertical circle, probably of the same diameter as B C ; it

was brightest at &" 53"'.

   At 7^ 12"' the cloud had risen and covered the sun and mock suns. There was a
curious effect from the mock sun C ; a glare of light came from behind the cloud

similar to the effect produced by a fire behind a hill.
   1^ 14"" the pheenomenon disappeared. It had been apparently formed on the blue

sky, as no clouds were visible except those below the sun, and the sky did not even

appear dull or hazy.

   2nd. An appearance presented by cirri in the daytime resembling aurora borealis.
It occurred in 1850, June 4th, at 10 o'clock a.m. An arch of cirrus stretched across

from north to south, from which cirri branched off resembling streamers of aurora
upon them were five small clouds, and above this an arch passed from north to south
through the zenith ; within this arch were wave-like lines, which had pulsations.

The phsenomenon soon became indistinct. Had the appearance occurred at night, it
would undoubtedly have been called colourless aurora borealis.

 --3rd. Curious appearance in the west after sunset.

   1850, July 28th, T"* 10". The sky scattered over with cirrostrati and nimbi, upon
which were six straight and one curved band of orange-scarlet ; the latter was formed

about over the sun, which had set nearly a quarter of an hour before.

1851.                                                                  3

    7^ 12'>> the curved band vanished.
   7"" IS" a blood-coloured mock sun formed 5░ above the horizon, not dazzling, but
of good shape. It seemed to be immediately above the true sun. Lasted 2 min.

  --4 th. Effect in a fog.

    1851, January 6th. Nottingham and neighbourhood was visited by a remarkable
fog. At 4'' P.M. the prospect did not exceed 5 yards. The upper stories of houses
and tops of trees invisible. On going to an open window, a candle being in the room,

my image was very distinct on the fog at a distance of about 3 yards from me.
   ll*" P.M. mist considerably cleared ; the prospect extended to about 60 yards. On

going down a steep hill, a lamp, being situated near a house, at a distance of 50 yards,

appeared elevated in the air to nearly the level of the eye of the observer ; on near-
ingit, it gradually lowered, until, when opposite, it appeared at its proper elevation.

   5th. An appearance of cloud analogous to aurora boreahs.
    1851, March 29ch, Itf" 50TM. Stars bright, nimbi about. Below Cassiopeia was a

dense nimbus of a leaden colour, from which proceeded upwards streams of a leaden
hue, which precisely resembled aurora borealis ; these advanced and receded re-
peatedly, and dimmed the stars very considerably; between the bands the stars
shone brightly. There were no signs of aurora borealis at the time.

       Observations on Storms, By Robert Russell (^Edinburgh).

   In my communication last year on this subject at Edinburgh, I stated that there

appeared to be two distinct classes of storms which occurred in Britain. In both,
there were in general two currents in the atmosphere moving in different directions.
At that time I described the rainy form of storms in which a western current is

--flowing above, while the wind at the surface of the earth is blowing from very dif-

ferent points of the compass over the island often no doubt to a certain extent cor-
responding to the curves which is supposed to indicate a gyration and translation of
the elements of the storms. But I must say that the rotary theor)' of stonns has

never been satisfactory to my mind, and I believe that the phenomena involved

admits of other explanation. I gave an illustration last year of the slow progress
which the rains often make in their northerly course by taking the weather of October

1849 in the north and south parts of the island. While I was actually reading my

communication a similar instance was again in action, and producing fine clear
weather in Scotland during the end of July and 1st of August, when the equatorial
currents were precipitating their moisture over the south of England, and damaging
the crops. But on the 18th and 19th of August a storm of wind swept over Britain,
and was particularly violent in the north of England and over Scotland. The destruc-
tion which occurred to the uncut grain was of a very serious character. It afforded
a good example of the other class of storms which I adverted to ; and in the present
short sketch I only intend to state the more prominent features which distinguish
this form of storms from the other, which was described last year. Theoretical con-
siderations will be avoided, as it may form materials for a future communication. It
is well known that some storms begin to blow from south-west, and veer round to
north-west. It often happens, however, that an upper north-west current has been
steadily flowing all the time. During the present season the weather was very cold
and stormy in the end of May, and almost throughout the month of June. In these
storms the wind began to blow from south-west, and veered round to north-west
but the upper currents kept very regularly in Scotland from the north-west. This
is a very common occurrence over Great Britain in autumn and winter ; when the
wind below veers round to the north-west, it becomes dry and cold, and the clouds
clear off; but again the wind will shift at the surface of the earth to the south-west,
while the current above will still continue from the north-west. Here we perceive
a consistent and regular recurrence of phsenomena. The south-west wind is laden
with moisture, which is condensed into cloud and rain where the two winds meet.
The lower surface of the cold upper current forms cirrostratus, which, when we
observe its motions, is the means which assures us of the existence of two different
currents. The formation of this particular cloud in the west is the first herald of
approaching storm, for the barometer does not give warning here as in the rainy
storms with eastern winds ; this is a very distinct and important feature in the two.
                       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                   35

This Is no ddubt owing to the change taking place in the one class of storms in the

lower strata, while it is taking place in the upper regions in the other. It is also a

characteristic of these westerly gales, that the south-west wind, at the surface of the

earth in its first stages, crosses the whole island in one broad stream, beginning to

blow almost simultaneously in Cornwall and the north of Scotland. The oscillations

of the barometer also often correspond as to time, but vary as to amount. It is

seldom that much rain falls in the eastern counties under these conditions of atmo-

spheric currents ; but it falls copiously in the western, where the lower current is

driven up the high grounds, and probably projected into the colder current above.

There is no doubt that the upper current from the north-west not only produces

cloud, which, so far as our observations extend, is peculiar in shape and form to this

course of winds, but it actually acts in many instances as a condenser in throwing

Adown considerable quantities of rain.  good instance of this occurred on the 27th

of August, 1850 : early on that morning the wind in Fifeshire was north-west and

very cold ; it fell to a calm below, and a warm moist south-west wind sprang up,

and gradually veered rocnd to south-east, east, north-east, and at last to north-wesfr

at night. This is by no means a common occurrence, as it usually goes the other
way: '71 inch of rain fell in Fife, and ri inch at Whitehaven, in Cumberland,
where it also rained the whole day. When the clouds began to clear away towards

night, I observed the cirrostratus lying like vanes pointing north-west to south-east,

which was gradually evaporated by the wind when it got round to the same direction.

In the more violent storms of wind the upper strata appear to be excessively cold,

and the great alterations of temperature which occur are closely connected with this

circumstance. The weather was remarkably fine and warm over Britain about the

15th of August : it was the finest day of summer in Fifeshire ; the maximum shade

temperature rose to 80░. The barometer fell very rapidly on the 18th and IQth at

ADunino, with a very heavy gale of wind.  repetition of the gale and fall of the

barometer took place on the 25th. In both cases the south-west wind was blowing

over the whole island, from Inverness to Cornwall, and when the storm set in an

upper north-west current prevailed. The temperature of the higher strata seems to

have been intensely cold on the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd; hail-showers were more

or less common over the whole island. The cumuli were very low, and the sky of
that deep and transparent azure which only occurs in summer, when the sun heats

the lower strata of the atmosphere. In Forfarshire and Banffshire devastating storms

of thunder, with hail, occurred ; the Grampian Mountains were covered with snow
in many places.

It is worthy of remark, that on the 18th and IQth of August, when the barometrical

pressure was very light in Fifeshire, the north of France and Belgium were visited

Wewith great falls of rain, which flooded all the low countries.  have avoided in this

short sketch all reference to theory, but on another occasion we may enter upon this

ground. In the meantime we close this paper by expressing our opinion that little

progress will be made in developing the law of storms until the directions of the wind

in the higher and lower strata of the atmosphere are more generally observed and

carefully registered.

          On some of the Appearances which are peculiar to Sunbeams.
                               By Henry Twining.

   In this communication, the author noticed the condition of the cloud and the state

of the atmosphere which usually give rise to the appearance of luminous beams. He

observed that the luminous rays are formed chiefly in the lower regions of the atmo-
sphere, but that they are nevertheless seen at times at very great elevations, since
they occur as much as 20 minutes after sunset.

   He called attention to the peculiar perspective eflects which are connected with

the appearance of luminous rays, as they occasionally seem to extend in the most
opposite directions, although their real direction is invariably the same. Referring
to a belt of exceedingly dark shadow which surrounds the luminous margin of clouds.
he stated that it differs essentially from the usual appearance of solar radiation, and
proposed a hypothetical explanation of this peculiar effect.

                                 Law of Storms On Mooring Ships in Revolving Gales.
                                 By Lieut.-Colonel Wm. Reid, Royal Engineers, F.R.S.

   In this paper 1 propose to explain a subject which I had overlooked, until Hiy at-
tention was lately drawn to it by Sir James Dombrain, who commands the Revenue

vessels on the coast of Ireland. He informed me, that after studying the first work

I had published on the Law of Storms, he observed that when he let go his right

hand, or starboard bower anchor, the first, and afterwards the left-hand, or port

bower anchor, in gales on the coast of Ireland, veering from south-east by south to

west, that the cables twisted or fouled as the vessels swung round to the veering

wind                             and that this observation led him to change all his  best bower anchors from
                              ;

the starboard to the port side of his vessels.

This would generally be the rule on the coast of Ireland. But these remarks led

me to consider what the rule should be on either side of the centre of a progressive

revolving gale, and whether it would not be different in the southern hemisphere, in

which gales revolve in the opposite way to what they do in the northern hemisphere.

I may here explain, that when two cables are laid out with anchors from the head

of a ship, it becomes very difficult to weigh anchor with only one crossing in

the cables, and impossible to do so with a double cross, called an elbow ; and hence
the importance of riding at anchor without crossing or fouling the cables when ships

are moored.

wind at south-east, she would at first swing to the north-west, head to wind,

as in the diagram ; and it is necessary to remark, that both the ships and length of

cable, in this and the other diagrams, are unavoidably greatly exaggerated in size, in

proportion to the scale of the gale.

   As the whirlwind gale moves onwards in the direction of Norway, and as the wind

veers towards the south, the ship would swing towards the north, and whilst

swinging, by letting go the anchor No. 2 from the starboard bow, she would be

moored as in the figure. By inspecting the diagram, it will be seen, that had the

starboard anchor been first let go, and afterwards the port anchor, the cables would

cross                       but if the port anchor had been first let go, the ship would ride with what is
                         ;

called open hawse.

The next diagram will show that the rule just mentioned would not hold good in

cases where a ship comes to anchor at the setting in of a whirlwind gale, and happens
to be on the opposite side of the gale's centre to that just described ; as for example in

the north-east storms of the Atlantic coast of North America, in which the wind
veers from north-east to north and north-west. In this case, if the port anchor
were to be the first let go, and afterwards the starboard anchor, the cables would foul

or cross ; and therefore the starboard anchor should in this case be the first let go, to
ride with open hawse, as will be best understood by considering the diagram. If a
whirlwind storm were moving northward, with its centre skirting the coasts of Hol-
land, the British Islands would be in the left-hand side of the storm, when the star-
board anchor should be the first let go.

   I have made two other diagrams to show what the effect of the veering of the wind
would be south of the equator. From these diagrams we see that ships will ride
with open hawse by letting go the port bower anchor first, when in the right-hand
side of a cyclone or whirlwind gale ; and that ihey will ride with open hawse by
letting go the starboard anchor first in the left-hand side of a cyclone,both in the
northern and southern hemispheres, notwithstanding their counter-movement north
and south of the equator.

   I have been here only endeavouring to point out general principles, which would

require to be modified by seamen according to local circumstances.     For example
tides by creating currents sometimes cause ships to swing against the  wind.

                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                      39

In a paper read before this Association thirteen years ago, I ventured to point

out that meteorology had been studied in far too circumscribed a sphere, and that

nations should combine to study the atmospheric laws. Acting on this principle, a
very important step has recently been taken by the American minister, Mr. Abbott

Lawrence, and Viscount Palmerston, towards putting the consuls of the American

and British nations throughout the globe in communication with each other for the

furtherance of meteorological investigations. It is proposed that the consuls shall

aid their respective navies, both public and commercial, in collecting meteorological

facts. Instructions to this eflfect have been sent by Lord Palmerston to about 200

--British consuls ; and in these instructions to the consuls it is stated, " You will

transmit to me half-yearly an abstract of the information you may have obtained,
with such remarks as may suggest themselves to you. If you can add diagrams, to
show the tracts of any remarkable storms, they will greatly add to the value of the

reports ; and as it is of importance to circulate as widely as possible information as

to storm tracks, you should encourage the publication of such information in news-

papers and periodical works."

If these instructions be properly carried out, they will prove of high value to me-

teorological science. The progress hereafter to be made in the study of the atmo-

spheric laws, will in a great degree depend upon periodical publications, widely cir-
culating information from as many points on the surface of the globe as it is possible

to obtain it. It has been mainly through the instrumentality of the Bengal Asiatic

Society's Journal giving wide publicity to Mr. Piddington's labours, that we are in-

debted for our present knowledge of the cyclones of the Indian seas.

   It had been supposed that hurricanes were unknown at the Cape Verde Islands,
yet a very severe one occurred there on the 3rd of last September. By the consular
reports, forwarded to me by Lord Palmerston, together with reports from some ves-

sels which encountered it, I find that the storm alluded to came from the eastward,

and passed over the Cape Verde Islands, on a westerly course, as a whirlwind storm.
The Cape Verde Islands are in lat. about 16░ and 17░ north. It was afterwards en-

countered in lat. 28░, long. 32░, which shows that it took from the Cape Verde a
north-west direction. If it continued its progress it must have passed to the west-
ward of the Azores.

In such an inquiry, negative proof, if I may here apply the term, is of great value

and it has been satisfactorily proved from reports called for by the Foreign Office,

that this storm did not pass between the groups of islands on the eastern side of the
Atlantic. But the reports from Mr. Carew Hunt, consul at the Azores, lead to the

belief that it did pass on the 12th of September to the westward of his position. I
have alluded to this Cape Verde Islands hurricane, in order to show the great im-

portance of having observations over extensive spaces of the globe, in studying the

atmospheric laws.

   It is generally known that for some time back, the direction of the wind has been
reported to the Electric Telegraph Company, from all the points in Great Britain

with which their wires communicate ; but the atmospheric pressure was not given.
Within these few days, however, this very valuable addition has been made by the
Electric Telegraph Company.

   Should the attempt now making to lay down electric telegraph wires across the
Straits of Dover be successful, we shall be able to obtain in this country simulta-

neous reports on the veering of the wind, in combination with the alterations of at-

Wemospheric pressure over all parts of Europe.  should then be able to track the

storms of the Mediterranean Sea, over Europe to the Baltic ; and I have great

pleasure in being able here to state, that there is reason to hope that the French in

Algeria have engaged in this inquiry, with a view of tracing the Mediterranean

storms to their source in Africa.

  --Note by Dr. Biiisf on the Meteorology of Futtegurh. The following tables furnish

an abstract of the meteorological observations taken by Mr. J. C. Pyle at Futtegurh.
Mr. Pyle is an able, an old and experienced meteorologist. His instruments seem

of the best quality and in good order, and the correctness of his observations may

be relied on. For the first half of the year readings were taken at 6 and 10 a.m., at

noon and at 4, 6 and 10 p.m., thus giving three of the turning-points of the baro-
meter, borastices as we call them in India. The 6 o'clock observation gives a close
 approximation of the fourth. It is unfortunate that for the latter part of the year

 Mr. Pyle should have given readings at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. only. Futtegurh, in lat.
 27░ 21' N., long. 79░ 31' E., is the northernmost station in India, so -far as I know,
 from which observations so full as those of Mr. Pyle have been received. The Simlah
 observations have not yet been laid before the world. The following are the means

 of the various months of the year :

Jan. 29-400.   April 29-116.  July 28-389.   Oct. 2░9-250,
Feb. 29-420.                  Aug. 28-448.   Nov. 29-355.
               May 28-916.    Sept. 28-513.  Dec. 29-389.
March 29-270.
               June 28-771.

   It will thus be seen that the barometer obtains its maximum, as in most places of
India, in February, and its minimum in July, the rain during the year being 24*86
inches. The daily range of the various months seems the following :

Jan. -017.     April -131.    July -110.     Oct. -117.
Feb. -116.                    Aug. -097.     Nov. -110.
               May -129.      Sept. -114.    Dec. -118.
March -112.
               June -152.

   These ranges are unusually high for a latitude so far north as Futtegurh, and they
depart considerably from tlie general law by which the daily range diminishes as the
barometer sinks. The June and July ranges, when the mercury was at its lowest,
are higher, or nearly as high, as those of January and February, when the pressure

was greatest. When we find anomalies of this class in the northern hemisphere,

with others still more striking just south of the line, at St. Helena for example, where

the mercury is almost stationary, how earnestly does the meteorologist long for more
observations, or speedy access to those which have already been made ! Simlah,
Sincapoor, Lucknow, Bombay, Trevandrum, have ail treasures in this way requiring

to see the light.

  --Note by Colonel Sykes on the Meteorology of Futtegurh. Mr. Pyle appears to have

had trustworthy instruments, and to have made a careful and laborious use of them.
I presume he has not had any opportunity of comparing them with standards, nor
does he mention the elevation of Futtegurh above the sea ; but it cannot be less than
600 feet, as the maximum mean pressure on the barometer in February was only
29░-420 ; but as Mr. Pyle would seem to have taken a mean of means for his quar-
terly determinations, in case he has followed the same plan in fixing his monthly
means, 29░'420 may not be quite accurate. The annual curve of pressure would
appear to be regulated by the place of the sun in the ecliptic, as I showed was the

case in my paper on the Meteorology of India, in the annual curves of pressure at

Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. The mean depressions of the wet-bulb seem to

have been always greatest at 4 p.m., diminishing with decreasiug temperature, and
increasing with the temperature. The depressions must have been very marked in
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  41

the month of May, since the mean depression for the month at 4 p.m. was 31░"29╗
the mean temperature at tiiat hour being 103░"35, which by Giaisher's factors would
give a dew-point of 56░'4, or nearly 47░ below the temperature of the air. Apjohn's
formula would make the dew-point 53░'4, or 50░ below the temperature of the air.

The mean temperature of 103░-35 at 4 p.m. in May far exceeds anything I ever ex-
perienced in India. The fall of dew was greatest in the first and fourth quarters of
the year, when the mean temperature is lower than during the other two quarters

but the greatest quantity of dew did not fall in the coldest months, with the excep-
tion of January. The evaporation was necessarily greatest in the hot quarter; but
somewhat singularly the next greatest amount was in the Monsoon quarter, when

nearly 20 inches of rain fell.

                   Notice of a Snoiv-Storm. By J. K. Watts.

  A remarkable thunder-storm, accompanied with snow, passed over the town of St.

Ives, Hunts, on Wednesday the 21st of August, 1850. For several previous days
the state of the weather had been unfavourable, with heavy rains and strong winds,
doing considerable damage to the corn crops in the neighbourhood, some of which
were entirely destroyed. On the morning of the storm, however, the sky remained

clear, a cold wind blowing directly from the north, until about 11 o'clock a.m., when
the wind, after shifting to and from all points, suddenly veered round to the south-
east, bringing masses of heavy cloud, apparently highly charged with electric fluid.

This state of the atmosphere continued till 1 o'clock p.m. ; cold rain falling at in-
tervals with three distinct currents of air, the upper and lower of them blowing from
the south-east with a great volume of dense rolling vapour, and the middle one from

the opposite direction, viz. the north-west, driving thin light cirro-cumulus clouds

before it with great rapidity. At about 2 o'clock a large black cloud approached the
town from the south-east, preceded by an extremely cold current of air. The ther-
mometer fell rapidly, and there was every sign of great atmospheric commotion.

When the storm approached the town, a large quantity of snow fell covering the roofs

of the buildings to some depth, and vivid discharges of electric fluid took place, with
deafening reports of thunder. This was followed by a driving shower of hail of large
dimensions, and a most piercing wind, the air being very oppressive as though
charged with sulphureous vapour. The wind then veered to the south, driving the
storm rapidly away towards the villages of Broughton and Ripton-Regis, where
pieces of ice fell of a large size, doing great injury to vegetation.

   When the storm had subsided one current of air only was perceptible, as the whole

body of vapour travelled in one direction towards the north-west. In the evening
the weather cleared up and the atmosphere became warmer.

Account of a Lunar Rainbow, seen Aug. 23, 1850, between Haddenham and
                    Earith, near St. Ives. By J. K. Watts.

   The weather had been somewhat tempestuous for several days previously, with cold

rains and variable winds, and on the preceding night the moon was at the full. On

the night in question, the sky presented a most singular appearance : from the

horizon in the north-east across to the north-west, it was perfectly clear, the moon

and stars shining brilliantly ; while extending from the south-east to the north-west
and down to the horizon was one continuous mass of black cloud, so that one half
of the sky was quite light and cloudless, and the other half intensely dark. At
about 10 o'clock some small rain fell, evidently from the edge of the cloud above me,
and it was clearly perceptible that at a short distance from the spot where I was, it
rained heavily. Presently a broad and silvery-white arch appeared, being completely
semicircular ; and directly after, a second or outer bow, as perfect in every respect as
42 REPORT 1851.

the inner one, was also formed : both were as clearly and perfectly developed as any
solar bow I have ever seen. They were exceedingly brilliant, and by having a dense
sombre back-ground, had a most magnificent appearance : several colours were per-
ceptible upon their outer edges, but only in a faint degree ; tinges of red and blue
were most distinct. The phaenomenon continued in its greatest perfection for a
quarter of an hour, during which time it attracted the notice of other persons,
as I was afterwards informed. It appeared to be but a short distance from me, and
was at least 20 minutes disappearing from the time of its greatest brilliancy, thereby
showing the slow progress made by the shower.

       Description of a Sliding -Rule for Hygrometrical Calculations.

                     By John Welsh, Kew Observatory.

    This instrument has been devised with the view of facilitating the reduction of
observations with the dry and wet bulb hygrometer.

 --The results usually deduced from the observations of the dry and wet thermome-

ters are, 1st. The elasticity of the aqueous vapour present in the air. 2nd. The
temperature of the dew-point. 3rd. The degree of humidit}', or the ratio to com-
plete saturation. 4th. The weight of water contained in a cubic foot of air.

   The first of these results is deduced from the well-known formula of Dr. Apjohn,

/"=/'  --и - , where/" is the elasticity of vapour required to be found, /' the

elasticity corresponding to the temperature of the wet thermometer, d the difference

between the dry and wet thermometers, and h the height of the barometer. The dew-

point is the temperature corresponding to the elasticity/". /beIf the elasticity

where w' is the weight in grains of the water contained in a cubic foot of air at a

Adew-point t ; E( the elasticity of vapour for the same temperature. factor has to be

applied to w' in order to correct for the increased elasticity of the vapour due to the

depression of the dev/-point below the temperature of the air.

The observer, in obtaining these four results, has to make distinct calculations for

each observation, making six references to tables, and performing one subtraction,

one multiplication, and one division. By means of the instrument about to be de-

scribed, it is believed that the four results mentioned above can be obtained with

less trouble, and with as much accuracy as the observations themselves can be taken.

  HThe instrument is a sliding rule, about 15 inches long, and inch broad, having

one sliding-piece on each side. Figure 1 in Plate I., is a plan of a portion of the

instrument drawn to the natural size ; the sliding-pieces being set in accordance

Awith the example given below. On the first side, the scale is one of equal parts,

its argument being the elasticity of vapour in inches of mercury ; one-tenth of an

Dinch of mercury being represented by one inch in the scale. The fixed scale shows

the corresponding temperature according to Dalton's table ; this scale being of course

an unequal one. Scales B and C, similar to D, are divided upon each edge of the

Asliding-piece which works between and D. In the middle of the sliding-piece are

three slits having bevelled edges ; on each side of these slits are divided short scales

-- --a, b, c, d, e, and/, representing the quantity
                                        и , which has to be subtracted

from/', in order to give/". The scales a, b, c, d are adapted for each half-inch of

/the height of the barometer from 29 to 30i ; e and being adapted to the change

which takes place in the coefficient when the temperature of evaporation is below

32'', and for the heights 29 and 30 inches of the barometer. The indices i, i, i, seen

through these sUts and drawn on the fixed portion of the instrument, are so placed

Whenthat when the slide is closed they shall point to zero of all these short scales.
D Athe slide is closed the scales C and should coincide, and the scales and B should

have the correct tabular relation.

  HOn the other side of the instrument there is another sliding-piece. The scale

on one edge of the sliding-piece is a simple logarithmic scale, the argument in this

instance being the degree of humidity, saturation of the air being=l"0. The fixed

scale I opposite to this is also logarithmic, and represents the logarithm of the

elasticity of vapour ; the argument, however, being the temperature corresponding

to the elasticity.

  The scale E on the other edge of this sliding-piece is one of equal parts, and re-

presents the temperature of the dew-point. The fixed scale F is the weight in grains
of the water in a cubic foot of air corresponding to the temperatures in E. On a
line with F is a short scale G, which gives the correction to be applied to the num-

bers in F for the depression of the dew-point below the temperature of the air ; the

argument being the number of degrees of this depression. An index g is placed so,
that when the slide is closed, and the scales E and F are in correct tabular relation,

Git shall point to zero of scale G. The scales E, F, and ought in strict accuracy

to have been in logarithmic relation to each other; but it was found, on trial of ex-

treme cases, that they are already (owing to the laws of change of elasticity) so very

nenrly so, that no appreciable error is introduced by 'the approximate method

adopted.

lie use of the instrument will be best understood from an example. Let the dry

thermometer read 70░, and     the wet 65░, the difference  is  5░              let  also  the  height of
                                                                            ;

the barometer be about 29"5 inches.

   Move the first sliding-piece (B C) until the index i is opposite 5'0 on scale 6 ; look

Afor the division 65░'0 on scale B ; opposite 65 will be found on scale и561 in. as the
Delasticity of vapour ; again look for 65░ on 0, and opposite to it we shall find on

62*1, which is the temperature of the dew-point.

These two numbers having been written down we pass to the second slide. Set

Hthe point I'O on to 70░ (the temperature of the air) on I ; the dew-point we have

Hfound
to        be  62░'         ;  find this on I, and opposite to it we find on         -770 as the degree

                        1

--of humidity.
   Again : ^The depression of the dew-point below the temperature of the air is 8░

set g to 8░ on G, find 62░'l on E, and opposite to it on F we find 6"15 grains as the

weight of water in a cubic foot of air at the time of the observation.

   It should be mentioned that the standard scales furnished to Mr. Adie of London,

the maker of the instrument, were divided at Kew by myself, with the aid of a
dividing engine constructed by M. Perreaux of Paris.

         On the Products of the Action of Heat on Animal Substances.
                              By T. Anderson, M.D.

Dr. Anderson, having discovered picoline in coal-tar, was led to investigate the well-
known and peculiar foetid oil called bone- oil, and, to obtain the best results, operated
in the last experiment upon 250 gallons of the distilled bone-oil, and discovered at
least three different series of bases in the oil. In the first he had established the
existence of the bodies called methylamine, ethylamine, butylamine, petinine, and
probably others ; in the second series, picoline, and other bodies of which it is the
type. The third aeries is veiy remarkable, and all the members of it are characterized
by decomposing by heat and excess of acid into bases of the picoline series, and a
remarkable and peculiar red or orange-coloured resinous substance. This extensive
investigation was not yet concluded ; but the oil, besides these bases, contained ben-
zole and the nitriles of some of the fatty acids.

       On a Diamond Slab supposed to have been cutfrom tJte Koh-i-Noor.

                                    By Dr. Beke.

     In the year 1S32, llie Persian army, under Abbas Meerza, hereditary prince of
  Persia, undertook tlie subjugation of Khovassan, which province, thougli nominally
 forming a portion of the Persian empire, had been virtually independent since the
 death of the great Nadir Shah, in the year 1747. The success of the campaign was
 complete. The important fortresses of Aineerabad and Coochan were besieged and
 taken, and the other strongholds of the Toorkomans destroyed ; and the Persian sway
 was entirely re-establislied.

    At the capture of Coochan, there was found among the jewels of the Harem of
 Reeza Kooli Khan, the chief of that place, a large diamond slab, supposed to have
 been cut from one side of the Koh-i-Noor, the great Indian diamond now in the pos-
 session of Her Majesty. It weighed about 130 carats, showed the marks of cutting

 on the flat and largest side, and appeared to correspond in size with the Koh-i-Noor.
    The only particulars that could be obtained respecting the past history of this stone

 were, that it had been taken from a poor man, a native of Khorassan, in whose family
 it had served for striking light against a steel, in the place of a flint; and one side
 of it was, in fact, a good deal worn by constant use. The diamond was presented by
 Abbas Meerza to his father, Futteh Ali Shah, and is presumed to be now among the
 crown jewels of Persia. The Armenian jewellers of Tehraun asked the sum of 20,000
 tomauns (16,000^. sterling) for cutting it ; but the Shah was not inclined to incur this
 expense.

    The foregoing particulars were furnished to Dr. Beke by his brother Mr. William
 G. Beke, late Colonel of Engineers in the Persian service, who took part in the
 Khorassan campaign.

 On the Cause which maintains Bodies in the spheroidal state beyond the
           sphere of Physico-chemical Activity. By M. Boutigny.

    The author referred to his former and well-known experiments on the peculiar
state induced in liquids when in contact with any hot metals, and regretted he had
not the means for exhibiting the experiments, as they 'required apparatus he had not
at command in the Section, such as for the application of the spheroidal state of

water to the purposes of the steam-engine. He referred to the experiments first

shown at Cambridge, and their extension since, to explain some of the effects of ancient
oracles. Alluding to the disputed points in the explanation of his experiments as to
the repulsion of metals and fluids, and whether the effects were really entirely or not
to be attributed to the properties of the thin stratum of vapoui', Prof. Boutigny pro-
ceeded to show by experiment that when platina wire was coiled up in the form of a
flat spiral and made hot, and aether or alcohol fluid placed on it in the spheroidal state,
the liquid would not pass through between the spaces, while thevapour readily did so*.

On the Dangers of the Mercurial Vapours in the Daguerreotype Process,

            and the means to obviate the same. By A. Claudet.

    In practice it is found that in that process where heat and mercury are required to
bring out the image, so much vapour of mercury was produced as seriously to aflfect

--the health of the operators. M. Claudet described tlie means of protection. The

mercury apparatus is enclosed in a closet of iron placed outside the room through the
wall, and having two sliding glass shutters communicating with the room. These
shutters being constantly kept shut, and the iron closet being supplied with pipes at
the top, and with two large iron shutters placed one on each side, all the vapours of
mercurj' are immediately carried out or condensed. The mercury bo.x is placed on
a water-bath, heated by a gas burner. The supply of water to the boiler and of gas

 * The members of the Chemical Section had the opportunity of seeing M. Boutigny pass his
hand through a stream of liquid red-hot iron as it passed from the furnace at the works of
Messrs. llansome and May, and afterwards scooping out portions of iron from the casting
ladle, until the fluid sunk to the mere red-hot fluid state, when danger might be apprehended
from the falling of the temperature causing the iron to adhere.

from the room as well as the two outside shutters, without opening the sliding win-

dows in front. When the operator has to put the plates in the mercury box or to

take them out, he has only to stop the external light by shutting the two outside
iron shutters and to open the inside glass shutters. The iron closet is then perfectly
free from mercurial vapour, and during the sliort time necessary for placing and re-
moving the plates no vapour can escape in the room.

On Agricultural Chemistry, especially in relation to the Mineral Theory of

         Baron Liebig. By J. B. Lawes and Dr. J. H. Gilbert.

   Mr. Pusey had, in a recent article in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society
of England, on the progress of agriculture during the last eight years, quoted the
experiments of Mr. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert as being conclusive against the " Mineral

Theory" of Baron Liebig, which asserts that the crops on the farm rise and fall accord-
ing to the supply within the soil of the mineral constituents indicated by an analysis
of the ashes of the plant. To these observations of Mr. Pusey, Baron Liebig had re-
plied at some length in the new edition of his ' Letters on Chemistry', just published,
and in doing so, has asserted that the experiments alluded to are entirely devoid of
value, as the foundation for general conclusions, and that the statements of the au-
thors could only be made in ignorance of the rationale of agricultural practices on the

large scale.

The authors have therefore given in the present paper an outline of their investi-

gations in agricultural chemistry, comprising an extensive series of experiments in

the  field on  the  growth of the  principal  crops,  entering  into  a  rotation                                       upon  the
                                                                                                                     ;

chemistry of the feeding of animals ; and upon that of the functional actions of plants

generally, in relation to the soil and atmosphere. And in connexion with all these

branches much laboratory labour has constantly been in progress since the commence-

ment of the experiments themselves in 1843. The results selected by Mr. Lawes

and Dr. Gilbert in justification and illustration of their views, were those of the field

experiments on wheat ; which had been grown continuously on a previously exhausted
soil for the last eight years, and in each season, by means of many chemical manures

by the side always of one or more plots unnianured, and one manured continuously

by farm-yard manure. Some of the results thus obtained were illustrated by a dia-

gram, from which it appeared that mineral manures had scarcely increased the pro-

duce at all when used alone ; whilst the effects of ammoniacal salts were very marked,

even when repeated year after year on the same space of ground from which the en-

tire crop (corn and straw) had been removed. Indeed, in this way a produce had been

obtained even in the sixth and seventh successive j'ears of the experiment, exceeding

by nearly two-thirds that from the unmanured plot. It v/as thus shown, that the

mineral constituents of the soil continued to be in excess, relatively to the nitrogen
available for them from natural sources. The history of several plots was then traced

down to the last harvest (1850), and it was argued that the statement assailed by
Liebig, viz. that ammonia was especially adapted as a manure for wheat, was fully
borne out when speaking of agriculture as generally practised in Great Britain; in

other words, that in practice it was the defect of nitrogen rather than of the mineral

constituents that fixed the limit to our produce of corn.
   The authors next called attention to the fact of the exhalation of nitrogen by growing

plants, as proved by the experiments of De Saussure, Daubeny and Draper, and they
referred to some experiments of their own, with the view of showing the probability
that there is more of the nitrogen derived from manure given off during the growth
of cereal grains, than of leguminous and other crops ; and hence might be explained
the great demand for nitrogenous manures observed in the growth of grain. The

                                                                                     ^

authors suggested that liere was an important field of study, and that we have in the

facts alluded to, much that should lead us to suppose, that the success of a rotation of

crops depends on the degree in which the restoration of the balance of the organic

constituents of crops was attained by its means rather than on that of their mineral
constituents according to the theory of Liebig ; whilst the means adopted to secure

the former were always attended with a sufficient supply of the latter. Again, Pro-
fessor Liebig had quoted the protesses of fallowing and liming, as being in their known

results inconsistent with the views of Mr. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert ; but these gentlemen

considered that the experiments of Mulder, and especially of Mr. Way on the pi-oper-

ties of soils, justified them in supposing that the process of fallowing and even that of
liming also owed its efficacy, more to the accumulation of nitrogen in the soil from

natural sources, than to that of available mineral constituents : the latter did, however,
undoubtedly thus accumulate by these processes, and this fact should give more con-

fidence in views, which on independent evidence supposed, that they were not so easily

liable to be found in defect in relation to other necessary supphes.

It was next shown, by reference to what happens in actual practice, as generally

followed in Great Britain, that where corn and meat constitute almost the exclusive

exports of the farm, the mineral constituents of the crops, taken collectively, that is,

as shown by the analysis of their ashes, could not be considered as exhausted. Indeed

Baron Liebig himself states that farm-yard manure was the universal food of plants.

And the authors would draw attention to the fact, that the practice of agriculture here

supposed necessitated the production of this manure, by means of which it was that so

large a proportion of the mineral elements of the crops raised upon the land were, in due

time, restored to it. All our calculations therefore should be made on a full considera-

tion of what was involved in the use of farm-yard manure. This was however not

generally sufficiently borne in mind by chemists unconnected with practical agricul-

ture                      and to this cause might in great part be attributed the reiterated recommenda-
                       ;

tions to imitate in artificial manures the composition of the ashes of the plants to be

grown. Of the mineral constituents however, phosphoric acid would be lost to the

farm (by the sales of corn and meat) in much larger proportion than the alkalies,

whilst the latter would generally, by the combined agencies of disintegration of the

native soil and import in cattle food, be liable to diminution in but a very insignificant

degree, if not in some cases to accumulation. Practical agriculture had, indeed, de-

cided that phosphoric acid must in most cases be returned to the land from sources

external to the farm itself, viz. by bones, guano or other means ; while, on the other

band, artificial alkaline manures had generally been found to fail in effect.

Indeed, taking into careful consideration the tendency of all experience in practical

agriculture, as well as the collective results of a most laborious experimental investiga-

tion of the subject, both in the field and in the laboratory, it was the deliberate opi-

nion of the authors that the analj'sis of the crop was no direct guide whatever as to the

nature of the manure required to be provided in the ordinary course of agriculture, from

sources extraneous to the home manures of the farm, that is to say, by artificial manures.
   In conclusion, then, if the theory of Baron Liebig simply implied that the growing

plant must have within its reach a sufficiency of the mineral constituents of which

it is to be built up, the authors fully and entirely assented to so evident a truism

but if, on the other hand, he would have it understood, that, in the ordinary course of

agriculture in Great Britain, it is of the mineral constituents as would be collectively

found in the ashes of the exported produce that our soils became deficient, relatively

to other constituents, they did not hesitate to say that every fact with which they were

acquainted in relation to this point was unfavoiU'able to such a view. On the con-

trary, they believed that nitrogen was the constituent most exhausted relatively to

other constituents ; at any rate, it was certain that for wheat, of all our crops, no sup-

ply of minerals, phosphates, &c. to the fields of Great Britain, woidd enable it to

"obtain a sufficient supply of ammonia from the atmosphere;" and indeed, that any

increased produce of it, such as British agriculture (itself so artificial) demands, could

not be obtained indejjendently of an artificial accumulation of mixogenwithin the soil.

If, however, a cheap source of ammonia were at command, the available mineral con-

stituents might in their turn become exhausted by its excessive use. Of those crops

of rotation, on the other hand, where the effect of mineral manures was characteris-

tically to increase the assimilation of nitrogen from atmospheric sources, and by virtue

of which property they indeed become subservient to the increased growth of grain,

the apparent demand for those substances, was not only generally, not such in hind,

as would be indicated by an analysis of their ashes, but it was frequently much greater
as to quantity, than could be accounted for by any idea of merely supplying what was

to become an actual constituent of the crop.
   If then we would attain by the aid of science a rational system of agriculture, the

-- --actual facts of the art itself, the indications of direct experiments in the field, and

the study of the functional actions of plants and animals, must each receive a due share
of our attention. In fact, chemistry alone would do little for practical agriculture.

  On Liquid Diffusion. By Professor Thomas Graham, M.A., F.R.S.,

    Professor Graham gave a view of some of the unpublished results, to ascertain
whether solutions of saline bodies had a power of diffusion among liquids, especially
water. The apparatus may be stated to be a bottle with ground edges, to be filled
with a weak solution of the saline matter (and closed by a plate of glass), and placed

at the bottom of a glass vessel of water, care being taken to keep the temperature

constant. Then, taking a salt of double base, such as the tartrate of potassa and soda,
if it had the power of diffusing itself in the water around, he was enabled, by con-
verting these bases into chlorides, to ascertain if their diffusion was luiequal, or a
decomposition might be effected, as the manner of solution of some substances is known
to caiise this kind of unequal decomposition. Taking common salt as a diffiisate, and
ascertaining the quantity of chlor-silver to be obtained after a given time, he added
one percent, of the acids sulphuric, muriatic, nitric, oxalic, and thus ascertained how
far these facilitated the diffusion of the substance or the decomposition of it ; thus

chloride of sodium alone yielded 7"65 of muriatic acid ; but add one per cent, of nitric
acid, and J 0-99 could be obtained under the same conditions, and proving tlie decom-
position of the salt. To forward the analysis of bodies in complicated mixtures, and
to elucidate physiological views, he had experimented with the weaker acids, tartaric
and oxalic acids, and as muriatic acid was found free in the human stomacli, he had

tried lactic acid; but evaporated by heat lactic acid does not decompose common salt; by
the aid of this new form lactic acid is seen to possess the power in aqueous solutions.

   Prof. Graham states, the obvious objections to the plan of usefully employing the
diffusive power of bodies arose from the time required, and the difficulty in ordinary
methods of avoiding alterations of heat ; as temperature increased, it shortened the
number of hours, and he employed the water-bath at steady temperatures and periods of
seventy-two hours to determine the results. Common salt, having a certain diffusion
at 50░, had this doubled at 110░, increasing equally for each 50░ to 160░ and 240░,
when a quantity of four times the muriatic acid was obtained to that, at the tempera-

ture of 50░.

On some Theoretical and Practical Methods of determining the Calorific Effi-
     ciencies of Coals. By Prof. W. R. Johnson, of Washington, U.S.

Several series of experiments have been made for the purpose of ascertaining the

relative values of coals :

   First, the series performed by the writer of these remarks in the year 1843, and
published in 1844 at Washington ; second, that of Sir H. T. Ue la Beche and Dr. Lyon

Playfair of London, prosecuted in 1845, 1846 and 1847, and published in 1848                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   third,

that of the same experiment published in 1849 ; and fourth, the series detailed in their

final report of the present year. The first of the series embraces direct trials of eva-

porative power of forty varieties of coal, the second of twenty-seven, the third of thirty-

eight, and the fourth of forty-three ; hence we have the means of comparing the prac-

tical evaporative power with the results of analysis in the case of one hundred and

forty-seven different samples of coal, varying in their composition from the hardest

anthracites, through the softer varieties of the same, and through semi-bituminous

Wecoals, to those of the most highly bituminous class.  have also in the series coals

varying much in the amount of their earthy or incombustible ingredients, as well as in

that of their sulphm-, water and ammoniacal compounds.

It may be proper to examine whether we have yet attained to anytlaw of relation

between the actual and the computed heating powers, or whether it be still necessary

to have recovn-se to the steam-boiler itself to determine the efficiency of any new

variety of coals. The Commissioners at London have expressed the opinion that the
element %<?ro(/ew exercises in the case of the Newcastle coals " a very essential imports

ance in tlieir heating powers, and must not be neglected in comparing the analyfical

Howwith the economic vesiilts."  this conclusion is to be justified from the data

afforded, either by the comparison of Newcastle coals among themselves, or by a com-

parison of them with the coals of Wales with which those of Newcastle are supposed

to compare the more favourably, in consideration of their containing a higher per-

centage of hydrogen, it seems not easy to conceive. In fact, whether wc compare the

eighteen Newcastle coals among themselves, or the thirty-six Welsh coals among them-

selves, or whether we compare the whole of the Welsh with the whole of the New-

castle series, we find that the higher evaporative efficiency is in neither case indicated

by a higher per-centage of the hydrogen element.

The first nine of the Newcastle coals (Table 3, p. 5, 3rd Report) have an average

evaporative power of 8-G3 ; the last nine have 7'S8 ; while the average hydrogen of
the two sets of nine is in each case precisely the same, namely, 5'3l percent.

It therefore appears that the hydrogen element could have exercised no influence

on the i-elative heating powers of the two halves of the Newcastle series. But the

carbon element in the first h.alf of the series is greater than in the last half, in the

proportion of S2'69 to 81"o5.

The first eighteen of the Welsh series gave an average evaporative power of 9*74,

and the second eighteen an average of 8"50; the average per-centage of hydrogen in

the first eighteen being 4-64, and in the second eighteen 4-97 ; in other words, the

lower heating power belongs in this case to those coals which have the greater pro-

portion of hydrogen. If " the hydrogen has exercised a very essential importance,"

it has certainlj' done it by diminishing, not by augmenting, the evaporative power.

How stands the case when we compare the carbon element with the evaporative power ?

The first eighteen give carbon 87'14 and the second 80'71 . Arranging the sets in the

order of evaporative powers, we have

On a new Method of contracting the Fibres of Calico, and of obtaining on
  the Calico thus prepared Colours of much brilliancy. By Mr. Mercer.
   (^Communicated by Dr. LyoN Playfair, F.R.S.)

   Dr. Lyon Playfair, who delivered the notice of this subject, said that Mv. Mercer
had his attention drawn to the subject by experiments made as early as 1844. Dr.
Playfair briefly called attention to the states of water, the points of maximum density
so well known, and the experiments of Mr. Mercer, who found that above this point
water flowed more rapidly through a syphon than at the same number of degrees
below this point of maximum density. He then spoke of the theoretical views of
those chemists who look upon the combined water as in the state of ice, or free from

--fluidity. Mr. Mercer's discovery may be stated in few words to be this : a solutiou

of cold but caustic soda acts peculiarly upon cotton-fibre, immediately causing it to
contract ; and although the soda can be readily washed out, yet the fibre has under-
gone a change, and water will take its place and unite with the fibre. In a practical
view Mr. Mercer considered that the fibre might be considered by this action to have
a sort of acid property to unite with soda and then with other bases. The effect of
the condensation was said to be one-fifth to one-third of the total volume of cotton
employed. Dr. Playfair then showed some proofs of the influence of this new process
upon our cotton manufactures ; thus, taking a coarse cotton fabric and acting upon it
by the proper solution of caustic soda, this could be made much finer in appearance
and if the finest calico made in England, known as 180 picks to the web, was thus
acted upon, it immediately appeared as fine as 260 picks. Stockings of open weaving
were shown, and the condensation process made them appear as of much finer texture.
The effect of this alteration of texture was most strikingly shown by colours. The
pink cotton velvet had its tint deepened to an intense degree by the condensation pro-
cess. Printed calico, especially with colours hitherto applied with little satisfaction,
as lilac, had strength and brilliancy, besides thus producing fabrics cheaply finer than
can possibly be woven by hand. The effect was shown of patterns being formed

by portions of a surface being protected by gum from condensation. Thus patterns

of apparently fine work can easily be produced. It was stated that the fabrics by this
process have much strength given them ; for a string of calico one-half condensed by
caustic soda will break by 20 oz., while the unacted upon string of cotton broke with

13 oz.

On Gambogic Acid and the Gambogiates, and their use in Artistic Painting.
                                By Dr. Scoffern.

   The author described gamboge as a gum-resin, and stated that some years since
he had proposed the use of a preparation of it for oil-painting. For this purpose he
had employed methods to get rid of the gum. To obtain the gambogic acid, he re-
commended ether to be employed ; the colouring matter is dissolved, and by

distillation the ether is given off; the last portions, however, are retained with so

much force that a temperature of 230░ or 240░ is obtained, and this would destroy the
colour, unless water was employed with the ether. About one-twentieth of water was
previously added to the etherial solution of the pigment, or gambogic acid. The gam-
bogiates of lime and other bases were under examination ; the gambogiate of iron,

--however, produced a rich brown, like asphaltum, but capable of more richness and

certainty in oil : from the trials made, the yellow and brown seemed to be permanent
colours, having useful properties as oil-colours. Dr. Scoffern also thought they might
be usefully employed in fresco.

               On Sulphuric Acid in the Air and Water of Towns.
                            By Dr. R. Angus Smith.

   The experiments and observations were generally directed to the existence and
quantityof sulphuricacidinthe atmosphere of large towns, and from the examples taken
in and near Manchester. Dr. Smith, admitting that sulphurous acid was first produced
by combustion, considered it was oxidized and carried down by rain as sulphuric acid,
and usually associated with ammonia. Liebig had proved carbonate of ammonia to be
present in the air. Dr. Smith found that rain-water was alkaline until boiling con-
centrated the sulphuric acid. Rain-water collected six miles from Manchester was

--such that it could not be used agreeably for drinking. He considers the soil as a

great disinfectant of the rain-waters, removing the acids, the ammonia, and the oily
and carbonaceous matters that give luipleasant qualit'es to rain-water. Rain collected
even in the fields on concentration had so much oily matter developed by evaporation,
that suspicion of accidental impurity from the vessels employed was only removed by
the employment of platina vessels. Specimens of air taken in the summers of 1850
and 1851 from the densest parts of Manchester were comparedwith air from the coun-
try. The quantity of sulphuric acid, estimated in tabular form, ranged from 0-4 to 1 "06
grains to the gallon ; the chlorine was from 0-39G to 0-530 to the gallon, while the
total quantity of inorganic matter in rain-water was from G'8 to 3 grains to the gallon.
Dr. Smith alluded to the growth of conferva, and the production of some living bodies,
and made observations on the office of rain-water thus clearing the air of matters
affecting the health of man.

      On Solid and Liquid Camphor from the Dryobalanops Caraphora.

   Dr. De Vry gave the history of the rarer species of camphor from Sumatra and

Borneo, the price of which is thirty to forty times greater than that to be met with in

commerce, and after quoting from the work ' De Kamferboom van Sumatra ' of W.
H. de Vriese of Leyden, and the opinions of Berzelius and Pelouze as to the com-

position, gave his experiments, which led to his opinion that the fluid camphor or oil
of camphor was rather to be regarded as a balsam than as an oil, and that the whole

                           By Professor J. E. De Vry.

    This yellow liquid, nitro-glycerine, seems not to be poisonous, but it explodes at a
moderate heat, as was shown by experiment, detonating when the drops of nitro-gly-
cerine on paper were struck a smart blow with a hammer.

On the Construction and Principles of M. Pulvermacher's Patent Portable
   Hydro-Electric Chain Battery and some of its Effects. By W. H.
   Walenn.

    The galvanic battery now presented to the notice of the Section is the invention of
M. Pulvermacher of Vienna, and was originally intended by him to supersede the
electric apparatus sometimes used, and advised by physicians to be worn on the body
for the relief or cure of certain diseases to which the mild but continuous influence

 of galvanism is of service.
    The chief objection to the instruments hitherto employed for these purposes is, that

 consisting only of a single pair excited by the exhalating cuticle, there is a want of
 sufficient intensity, and consequently the amount of electricity brought into action by
means of them is so exceedingly small as not even to come under the denomination
 "mild." This serious objection has been entirely, and, as will be seen, satisfactorily
 obviated by M. Pulvermacher, the chain-batteries being so constructed that each link
 is a single hydro-electric element ; and the links are connected on the principle on
 which galvanic pairs are connected in general for intensity of action, thus giving a
 much more copious and effective galvanic current than that obtainable from the ap-

paratus above alluded to. The details of its construction are as follows :--

    Tn oi'der to produce a large surface within a small space, and with little material,
positive and negative wives are coiled round a small lengthy piece of wood in such a

manner that thej' run parallel to each other at very small distances hut without in-

termediate contact. At each extremity of the wooden core the end of one of the

wires is bent into a gilt eye (the other end being fixed in the wood), so that at one

extremity of the wood, the eye from the positive wire at the other extremity, that

from the negative wire projects beyond the core ; the whole forming the metallic

Apart of a galvanic element, with space between the wires for the fluid.  number of

such elements linked together on the principle of the voltaic pile, therefore, con-

stitutes the metallic part and arrangement of a battery, permanently connected, flexible

in all directions, of considerable surface (quantity), in pi'oportion to its size, and

of an intensity only limited by the mtmber of elements employed.

   When this chain is immersed for a moment into any dilute acid, the capillary

attraction between the parallel wires and the absorption of the wooden core, on the

removal of the chain from the liquid, retains a quantity of fluid sufficient to excite

the battery from one to two hours. To account for the surprising power and con-

stancy of these small batteries, it must be considered

First. That the acting surface is very considerable in proportion to the substance

of the metal, the wires being excited on the whole of their surface.

Secondly. That the resistance of the fluid to conduction of the electric current is

reduced to a minimum, the layer of fluid between all parts of the wires being very thin.

Thirdly. That no adherence of gas to the negative wire takes place, owing to the

facility afibrded for its escape by the thinness of the layer of fluid interposed ; for the

same reason the counter polarization of the negative plate by the deposition of me-

tallic zinc upon it (which is a necessary consequence of the action of any other single

fluid circle) is effectually prevented.

   For experiments in which an intermitting current is required, M. Pulvermacher

has contrived two instruments :

First. The interrupting cylinder, consisting of a spiral spring fixed in a small glass

tube so as to produce by every motion of the instrument an intermittent connexion

between two metallic hooks at the extremities of the tube ; this is principally used

for physiological and medical effects, as the shock given to a person holding the chain

communicates constant and continuous vibration to the instrument sufficient to prO"

duce the requisite intermission in the connexion.

Second. The portable interrupting clock-work (size five cubic inches), by which the

current is made more rapidly and regularly intermittent.

   The following are some of the properties and uses noticeable in this form of battery:--

A galvanic battery of 120 elements, permanently connected and therefore ready for

instantaneous use, only occupies the space of an ordinary pocket-book. In the labo-

ratory it will form, no doubt, a very useful instrument of research, when it is borne

in mind that the read)', and, in some cases, instantaneous application of electricity

(even were it attained onlj- with instruments of small power) is one of the greatest

desiderata of the present day and in the present state of science ; the general useful-
ness of this instrnment will then immediately become apparent.

With the application of it to these ends then only in view, the follovcing points

of interest present themselves, viz. that it is a good and instantaneous means

of testing solutions in which either acids or bases are suspected to exist in small

quantities ; that it affords a ready and almost instantaneous means of coating metallic

and other conducting surfaces with thin films of metals, either in the most minute

state of division, in a crystalline manner, or in a reguline form ; that as the intensity

of this arrangement may be said to be unlimited, it decomposes the oils and hydro-

carbons with facility, thus opening a wide field of research.

Eight elements charged with distilled water decompose distilled water, and other

most unequivocal proofs of enormous power in this respect are given : it is also capable
of giving all the results of common statical electricity, still combining the admirable

continuity of action of an hydro-electric arrangement, with the sharp effects of that

derived from the frictional machine.

The heating effects of this arrangement will not be without their uses, both in

exploding gases and other materials. It has also been suggested, that for the easy

communication, by electricity, from a train on the line to any station, or at by-stations

where expensive batteries have to be constantly kept charged, although but seldom
used, these batteries would be found to possess great advantages, as they would be in
action, only when required, by a momentary immersion into dilute acid.

    This battery likewise possesses surprising magnetic and odylic power, for its size
but these applications of it still afford ample scope for further investigation and

research.

       On the Constitution of Salts. By Professor A. W. Williamson.

    Chemists have of late years considerably extended the meaning of the term salt
 acids and bases are now rather viewed as acid salts and basic salts respectively, than as
 compounds of fundamentally different arrangement, and there seems reason to believe
 that the molecular structure of the so-called simple bodies is analogous to that of salts.
 Thus any view which best explains the properties of salts may be expected to apply
 ultimately to the molecular structure of matter in general.

     It was remarked that a serious error had crept into chemical science by the intro-
 duction of a different unit of comparison in organic chemistry to that which is em-
 ployed in the inorganic department of the science. The removal of this error and
 ?,doption of an uniform standard of comparison, naturally leads to viewing chemical
 action as consisting in substitutions rather than in direct combinations. The best
 studied processes of organic chemistry have been found to consist of double decompo-
 sitions. Numerous other instances were mentioned, in which the result may be far
 more simply explained by a process of double decomposition than by the supposition
 of unknown predisposing affinities invented for each ; and various arguments were
 adduced why the same mode of reasoning ought to be extended even to the simplest
 phcenomena of inorganic action generally considered as mere combinations or sepa-
 rations. It was shown that water may be assumed as a very general if not universal
 type and standard of comparison, by viewing other bodies as formed from it by the
 replacement of one or more atoms of hydrogen in water by their equivalent of various
 simple or compound radicals. The atom of radical thus replacing hydrogen is some-
 times equivalent to one atom of that element ; in other cases it is equivalent to two.
 The difference between monobasic acids, such as nitric and bibasic acids as sulphuric,
 were shown to follow as a necessary consequence of such a difference of the respective

 radicals NOo and SO,.

On the probable Dimensions of the great Shark (Carcharias megalodon) of the                  1
                  Bed Crag. By J. S. Bowerbank. F.B.S.

The teeth of this fish are common in the coprolite beds of Suffolk ; but although
exceedingly hard, they are usually much water- worn, and have nearly always lost the
serrated edges which are so well preserved in specimens of the same species from
Malta. The teeth of the upper jaw may be known from the lower teeth by their

comparative narrowness and thickness ; those from the sides of the jaws are progress-
ively smaller and shorter. The largest specimens measure from 'i\ to 5 inches in
length. In order to give some idea of the magnitude of the creature to which they
belonged, Mr. Bowerbank exhibited the jaws of the largest known specimen of the
Carcharias glaucus of Australia; it was killed by a whaling crew, at Port Fairy, Au-
stralia. It measured 37 feet in length ; its vertical gape is 25^ inches, its horizontal
20-3- inches ; the length of its largest teeth 2f inches. From the measurements it is
inferred that the fossil shark must have had a gape of at least 3 feet by 4, and an entire

length of not less than 65 feet. This estimate is not at all improbable, as there exists

-- --a (comparatively harmless) species the Basking Shark in the British seas, of which

one individual, killed off Brighton, measured 36 feet, and one which was stranded in
the Orkneys, and described as a " sea-serpent," exceeded 50 feet in length. Looking
at the mineral character of these fossils, and their association with the teeth of a second
Maltese shark {Oxyrrhina hastalis), not found either in the London clay or coralline

crag, Mr. Bowerbank was inclined to regard them as having been derived from the

The specimen indicates the bird to have been at least the size of a full-grown Albatros.

   The author exhibited drawings and restorations of remains of these winged reptiles,
showing that the great species of the chalk {P. Cuvieri) must have had a spread of
wing equal to 1.6 feet 6 inches ; whilst a second large species {P. compressirostris) was
estimated at 15 feet. The largest species from the lias previously well known, the
P. macronyx of Buckland, was only computed at 4 feet 7 inches from tip to tip of its

expanded wings.

      Indications of Upheavals and Depressions of the Land in India.

          By Dr. Buist, LL.D. {Communicated by Col. Sykes.)

    Referring to the well-known cases below the sea-level in Europe, Dr. Buist states
that all around the shores of India, from Calcutta to Bombay, appearances exactly similar
to these present themselves. In 1815, in the clearing out of the Dhurrumtollah Tank
in Calcutta, the workmen at the depth of about 24 feet from the surface passed through a
bedof sand and came tea group of full-grown trees ; these were standing perpendicularly
at short distances from each other, and had the appearance of trunks lopped off within
three or four feet from the roots*. In general they were about a foot and a half in dia-
meter ; they were firmly fixed in a dark loamy soil, into which their fangs spread in
every direction ; their elbows, where the trunk separated into the roots, were pecu-
liarly distinct ; they were of a reddish colour, the fibre soft and moist, but still preser-
ving unaltered the grain of the wood. The recent operations of Mr. Simms have given
an exactitude to these observations they did not at the time possess. The bottom of
the tank, where the roots were found, is, according to him, about 24 feetf below
 the surface of the ground, which, again, is about a similar distance above the lowest
low-water mark at Kyd's Dock, this last being about the same level with the bottom
 of the tank ; so that with a tide range of 16 feet the tree-roots arc 8i feet beneath the

mean level of the sea and 16 below high-water mark. In the bottom of a tank
 three miles distant from this exactly the same appearances were discovered, as they
 were in the excavation of the docks by Mr. Jones, and in the clearing out of various
 tanks on the other side of the river. About the year 1810, the same appearance pre-

sented itself in deepening the Laldiggee in Tank Square. At Dum Dum, eight miles

 further up J, not only trunks of trees but bones and deer's horns were found at a great
 depth from the surface. At Bombay, again, during a violent fall of rain in 1849, a
 torrent near Sewree cut through a bank of shells and gravel cemented together into a
 kind of stone which prevails all up and down over the coast, and to which, from its
 appearance and position, I have given the flame of Littoral Concrete. At the parti-
 cular spot referred to the mass was found to be about 6 feet thick"; underneath this,
 and about 4 feet below high-water mark, was a mass of blue clay, the same in ap-
 pearance as the sludge now depositing on our shores; this varied from 1 to 3 feet

 in thickness, and was everywhere full of tree-roots obviously in situ, apparently
 the mangrove, which always grows betwixt high and low-water mark. The fibres

  were traceable everywhere through the clay, and where, by reason of their fineness
 they had become obliterated, casts of them still remained, "in many cases the woody

fibre was fresh and tough, and could be cut v.ith an axe or saw, to which it yielded with
considerable difficulty. It was of a reddish colour, like that which mahogany assumes
when steeped in water ; in the great majority of cases it was reduced to a black, pulpy
state, like charcoal or the decayed timber found on our sea shores at home. This,
when exposed for a few weeks to the aii-, became hard and brittle, and broke with a

bright resinous fracture and lustre, something like that betwixt lignite and jet. When
exposed to damp, it in many cases became covered with a greenish-white efflorescence

of sulphate of iron, a substance produced in such abundance in the lignite formation
near Quilon that it is collected and sold as a mordant to the dyers. The tree-roots
referred to were everywhere perforated with holes, the work of worms or some other
borer; these varied from a quarter of an inch to an inch in diameter; they are almost
invariably lined with beautiful incrustations of carbonate of lime, from the thickness
of an egg-shell to that of a crown-piece ; these incrustations are composed of a mul-
titude of distinct layers, and form tubes of the most fantastic appearance, varying
from a few inches to some feet in length, but so brittle that it is seldom that more
than half a foot can be taken out entire. Until the present year the arrangement here
described was only observable in two or three localities. In consequence of the cut-
tings of the railway and town drain, together with the deepening of nearly all our old
wells and the excavation of numberless new ones, during the present season excellent
opportunities have presented themselves of inquiring further into the matter, and the
result has been that over nearly a third of the island of Bombay, or with a few excep-
tions, wherever the shell, gravel and concrete fyrm the material at the surface, blue
clay with mangrove roots, in all respects similar to those described, are found beneath.
Captain Fulljames appears to have found nearly the same arrangement at Gogo in
the Gulf of Cambay, and the same thing, so far as I can judge, is described by Capt.

Vicary* as visible at Kurrachee. I have in my possession the grinders and jaw-bone

of an elephant dug out of a well a little way above Kurrachee, from about 20 feet
under the surface of the ground, probably from the same formation. There are in all
likelihood numberless examples of the same appearances all along our coast if they
were inquired after. At present we only find the mangrove growing in shallow and
sheltered spots where mud is freely^ deposited, and we cannot expect its remains to
prevail over a larger area than that at present occupied by the living plant. There
seems to me no means whatever of explaining the appearance of the deposit of shells
and gravel, which from their appearance are manifestly the result of quiet aqueous
deposition and not of wind-drift, above tree-roots obviously iti sihi, except b}' the hy-
pothesis that these latter, after having obtained their present size, sunk with the soil
on which they grew beneath the level of the sea to such a depth as to permit the mass
which now covers them to accumulate. From the excavations lately made on the
Esplanade, Bombay, it would appear probable that the descent which gave rise to
this was a sudden one. In the bottom of a well 12 feet deep, just as the rock was
reached, coral such as that now prevailing on our shores was found in abundance; it
was perfectly iminjured, every pore and fibre remaining as entire as when the zoo-
phyte lived in it. The same species of coral now found on our .^^hores never forms a
rock; when it attains the size of a cubic foot or so the zoophyte dies; the coral is im-
mediately thereafter detached from the rock, and in a short time rounded or ground
to powder by the surge ; the least exposure to abrasion or impact from any hard sub-
stance proves fatal to the texture of a substance so delicate. The proofs of an up-

heaval subsequent to the subsidence are plentiful.

   It seems to me impossible to explain the production of river deltas on the usual
hypothesis of a deposit of silt from running water, and that mud such as that which
constitutes them is never thrown down except when the water which suspends it has
been permitted to remain for a considerable period in a state of repose. By what
means can it be imagined that the Deltas of the Ganges, Indus or Nile, should ever

be enabled to attain a level high above the reach of the highest inundations, if
the relative levels of land and water had at the time of their formation been as at
present? Assume that these rivers discharged their waters into a long shallow estuary
of tlie sea, the bottom of which afterwards became elevated by upheaval, and the
whole matter is simple. At Madras, from the powder-mills to Enmore, and so for

many miles up and down the coast, fragments of bone, oyster-shells, land and sea-

shells and cuttle-fish bones occuv along a level tract which varies from a hundred
yards to twenty miles in breadth. The shells have in most cases retained their form
and appearance, but in black clay soils they are changed into a clear selenitc or dirty
fibrous gypsum, showing crystallization of the latter substance, but retaining enough
of their original form and shape to identify their origin. The greater part of the cha-
racter of the Coroniandel coast is similar to this. After penetrating through the sand
mixed with shells, a deep bed of soft blackish clay is generally found, containing so
much water that the foundations of the buildings constructed where it occurs can only
be laid on the walls* used for foundations and peculiar to Madras. At Adgar, the
small weir, about eight miles from Fort St. George, which forms the limit of the Su-
preme Court jurisdiction in that direction, large quantities of recent sea-shells are
constantly being dug up for the use of the lime-burners three miles from the shore.
These occurred at a depth of from 8 to 12 and 20 feet, under a stratum of red gra-
velly soil, the pebbles in which are mostly quartz and angular in form. The whole
plain in this direction is considerably raised above the level of the sea, and presents
the same geological appearances, the plain between the isolated hills of Amravutty
and the sea slopes gradually towards the shore, and has the appearance of an extensive
alluvial deposit, from the surface of which the subordinate hills rise like so many
islands. The upper bed consists oiregur or black cotton soil, varying from 6 inches
to 20 feet in depth, with a subsoil of stiff unctuous clay, a stratum of sand or gravel
occasionally intervening. Between Chandole and Chinna Ganjam, a black soil gives
place to a belt of sand 8 to la miles in breadth, the whole bearing the appearance of
an old sea beach. Along the sea-margin of Western India we find almost everywhere
vast expanses of nearly level ground, from 3 to 10 feet above high-water mark, con-

sisting exclusively of the shells and gravel such as I have already described, in a loose

or cemented state, according to circumstances. When cemented, the material is used

extensively as a building-stone, and the greater part of the less substantial houses in

Bombay have been constructed from it. It in general abounds in fine fresh water,
and forms the ground on which those magnificent cocoa-nut groves which skirt our

shores prevail; they extend around the whole of the shores of the Arabian Sea as far

as Soonmeani, beyond which my information is imperfect, with the exception always

of the vicinage of the debouchures of our great rivers, where the Delta abuts directly
on the sea. Around the peninsula of Aden, and along the shoi-es of the Red Sea on

both sides, they are peculiarly conspicuous, stretching on the African coast many
miles inland. Around Suez there is a vast expanse consisting of shells and gravel,

in appearance so fresh and recent, that one might imagine it to have formed the
channel of the sea a few months before. Capt. Newbold describes a similar beach as

prevalent along many of the shores of the Mediterranean. Returning to the East, the
island of Mauritius is belted by an enormous coral reef throughout the whole shore,
excepting about 10 miles; this rises from 5 to 15 feet above high-water mark, and is
worn in some places into the most fantastic shapes by the surge. The Observatory
of Port Louis is built upon a bed of coral 10 feet above high-water mark. Blocks of
coral, too vast to be transported b}' any existing agency, are found from 600 to 1300
feet inland, cut oflT from the shore by elevated ridges ; and a considerable way in the

interior two remarkable headlands of coral, from 20 to 25 feet above the level of the

sea, are to be met with in the jungle. The great part of the numberless coral islands
which are scattered between the Cape of Good Hope and Ceylon, the Chagos Archi-

pelago, the Seychelles, Laccadives and Maldives, appear to have been elevated to their
present level by the same upheaval by which the terraces now under consideration

have been produced, and I have no doubt abundance of traces of the same thing will be

 found all along the shores of our Eastern seas. I need not enumerate the numberless

 examples of old sea-margins to be found all along the shores of England and Scotland,

infinitely more familiar, as they must be, to resident geologists than to an exile.
   The theory of subsidence and subsequent upheaval which I have just endeavoured

to establish seems alone capable of explaining the production of coral reefs. As the
rock on which they rested descended, the zoophytes would naturally work their way

upwards to the surface of the sea, on the approach of which their operations are inva-

riably discontinued. An upheaval such as I have assumed would bring the surface

of our AttoUs to their present level, which they could by no other process have

attained.  '

--58 REPORT 1851.

In writing on this subject I may refer to another of ahnost equal interest and

novelty, referring to a change in the aspect of the interior of India, not, so far as I

know, liitherto described. Along the line of the Moolla and Motamoola, near

Poona, where the river cuts through deep beds of alluvium, about 15 feet under the

surface, a stratum of freshwater shells' makes its appearance ; they are sometimes

loose in the clay or sand, more frequently they are cemented together by calcareous

matter : they are for the most part perfectly entire and fresh, and seem, so far as I

can judge, identical with those now in existence. These beds are found over a vast

expanse of country, wherever, in fact, alluvium of any considerable thickness prevails.

The alluvium contains hardly any gravel or stones ; it lies in uniform beds, and bears

every appearance of having been a lake-, none of having been a river-deposit. Dr.

Gibson, Inspector of Forests, is convinced that the whole alluvium of the Deccan owes

its origin to a vast series of magnificent lakes of comparatively recent existence, lakes

which must have affected the climate as well as the whole character of the country.

Compared to the swamps referred to by Dr. Malcolmson and Dr. Falconer*, the col-

lections of water under consideration must have existed as of yesterday ; and were the

regions over which they prevail examined with sufficient care, we might be enabled

to map out the area which they occupy, and infer with considerable accuracy the age

to which they belonged.                                                                                        ___^

of Celtic with Indian types, and an absence of characteristic Lusitanian forms ; as if

   This was an announcement of an important discovery made by Dr. Overweg in
Fezzan, whence he has sent specimens of true Devonian rocks with fossils identical
with those of the Devonians of the Sierra Morena in Spain. No palaeozoic rocks have
hitherto been discovered in Africa north of the line ; and this new fact may probably

prove of consequence in explaining the physical and organic peculiarities of Africa,
and taken in connexion with the fact of the existence of Devonian rocks in the Cape

region, may indicate a palaeozoic axis running north and south through that continent.

responding size from the same formation, the complete femur is shown to have
been five feet in length. The head of another femur, from Mr. Gunn's collection,

gigantic species was most probably the Elephas meridionalis of Nesti, whose remains
are found in the pliocene formations of the south of Europe, and whose existence as a
characteristic fossil of the British crag and its equivalent freshwater deposit at Grays,
had been fully determined by Dr. Falconer, and confirmed by the observations of Mr.

           On the Distribution of Granite Rocks from Sen Cruachan.

            By William Hopkins, M.A., F.R.S., Pres. Geol. S.

   Mr. W. Hopkins exhibited a map of the lochs and mountains around Ben Cruachan,

with the distribution of the trains of granite blocks to which he had alluded last year

at the Edinburgh meeting. He had formerly been unable to explain by what means
the granite blocks supposed to have been derived from Ben Cruachan had crossed the
mountain group between Loch Fyne and Loch Lomond, so as to gain access to the

latter, and form a stream extending to the Clyde and Glasgow. Since then, he had
discovered in this very mountain group a granitic tract not marked on the geological
maps, in the immediate vicinity of Loch Sloy, at a height of from 1500 to 2000 feet,
and agreeing in mineral character with these travelled blocks, which may therefore
have descended Loch Long and Loch Lomond with the same facility that the granite
blocks of Ben Cruachan have entered Loch Awe, and those of Loch Etive have reached
Oban and Kerrara. They are dispersed along the sides of the valleys to the height of

--300 or 400 feet. Mr. Hopkins then referred to the possible causes of (he dispersion

of the granite blocks ; if by ocean currents, then the country must have been de-
pressed nearly 2000 feet, as Wales is believed to have been about the same period; if
transported by floating ice, independently of glaciers, then also the country must have

had a lower level ; terrestrial glaciers may also have been agents, if their existence was

--allowed. The character of the blocks being at first large and angular, but becoming
--smaller and more rounded, was opposed to the supposition that floating ice or terres-

trial glaciers were the principal agents in their removal. If floating ice had been the

cause, then the sphere of dispersion would probably, also, have been much greater.
In Glen Wray he had observed indications of what he considered true moraines. He
was inclined to believe that more than one of these causes had been in operation in

the dispersion of these blocks from their respective centres.

On the Age of tJie Copper-bearing Rocks of Lake Superior and Huron, and

  various facts relating to the Physical Structure of Canada. By W. E,
  Logan, F.R.S. ^ G.S., Director of the Geological Survey of Canada.

myIn the present paper it is  purpose to place before the Association, in as con-

densed a form as possible, one or two of the main features of the physical structure

of Canada, ascertained in the progress of the geological survey now carried on in the
country, under my direction, by the authority of the provincial government.

With the exception of the drift, the country is composed of rocks, none of which

are newer than the carboniferous epoch. The general geographical distribution of

these rocks, as far as ascertained and as connected with the physical structure of

the bordering states of the American Union on the one hand, and the sister British

provinces on the other, is represented on the map which is displayed to view.

myOne of the points to which it is  wish to draw attention is the age of the cop.

per-bearing rocks of Lakes Superior and Huron, as determined by the evidences eoU

lected on the Canadian survey; and another, the differences that exist in the structural

condition of the western and eastern parts of the province.

The rocks on the north shore of Lake Superior consist of reddish granite and

syenite, which in ascending order pass into micaceous and hornblendic gneiss and allied
--60 REPORT 1851.

forms. These are succeeded by chloritic and partially talcose slates, which become

interstratified with obscure conglomerates with a slaty base, and upon them rest

unconformably bluish slates, with intermingled bands of chert and limestone towards

the bottom, and a thick and extensive overflow of greenstone trap at the top. Re-

posing on these are white sandstones, which pass by an alternation of colours into

red sandstones and conglomerates, often with jasper pebbles, and these are repeated

after the occurrence of an uncertain amount of reddish limestone of an argillaceous

quality. The sandstones and conglomerates become interstratified with amygda-

loidal trap layers, and an enormous amount of volcanic overflow divided into beds

crowns the summit. The sandstones are often argillaceous, and display ripple-mark

and crack casts on their surfaces, while the concentric curves of flow sometimes

characterize those of the trap. Innumerable dykes cut up the sedimentary and vol-

canic beds, and both the dykes and the overflows are almost universally marked by

a transverse columnar structure. The thickness of the whole from the base of the

blue slates cannot be less than 1 2,000 feet, and the whole formation is intersected by

copper lodes of different characters in different places, which run in directions both

with and transverse to the strike.

   On the north shore of Lake Huron the granite is succeeded by a formation con-

sisting of white, often vitreous sandstone or quartz rock of great thickness, some-

times passing into a beautiful jasper conglomerate, and alternating with great beds

of slate and bands of conglomerate with a slaty base, both being interstratified with

Athick masses of greenstone.  persistent band of limestone of about 150 feet in

thickness and interstratified with thin cherty layers, occupies a place in the series,

probably somewhere about the middle. The surfaces of the sandstone often exhibit
ripple-mark, and the total thickness of all the members of the formation may be about

10,000 feet. Different intrusive rocks intersect those of stratification, and as related

to one another, they display a succession of events in the history of the formation.

-- --There is of course a set of dykes greenstone no doubt cutting the sedimentary rocks

and giving origin to the greenstone overflows. It is difficult however to identify

these ; but another set of greenstone dykes are seen cutting both the sedimentary
and igneous strata ; intrusive granite, sometimes occupying considerable areas, thrusts

these antecedents aside, sending forth dykes of its own order, intersecting all and

reaching to considerable distances from the nuclei ; and then another set of green-

stone dykes cuts through the intrusive granite, its dykes, and all that previous causes

had placed. Evidences of disturbances and dislocations accompany all these suc-

cessive intrusions, those connected with the granite being the most violent. But

there is in addition another set of disturbances of still posterior date, and it is to

these that is due the presence of those metalliferous veins which give the countiy its

value as a mineral region.

   In respect to the age of the Huron cupriferous formation, the evidence afforded by

the facts collected by my friend and associate, Mr. Murray (published in our Report

of Progress for 1847-48), on the Grand Manitoulin, La Cloche, Snake, Thessalon,

Sulphur, and other islands, points ranging along a line of 90 miles out in front of

the coast, is clear, satisfactory and indisputably conclusive. On these islands, the

Potsdam sandstone, the Trenton limestone, the Utica slates, and the Loraine shales,

successive formations in the lowest fossiliferous group of North America, were each,

in one place or another, found in exposures denuded of all vegetation, resting in un-

conformable repose, in a nearly horizontal position, upon the tilted beds and undu-

lating surface of the quartz rock and its accompanying strata, filling up valleys, over-

topping mountains, and concealing every vestige of dykes and copper veins ; and it
would appear that some of these mountains have required the accumulation of the

whole thickness of the lowest three and part of the fourth fossiliferous deposit, equal

to about 700 feet, to bury their summits.
   The chief difference in the copper-bearing rocks of Lakes Huron and Superior

seems to be the great amount of amygdaloidal trap present among the latter, and

of white quartz rock or sandstone among the former. But on the Cauadian side of

Lake Superior there are considerable areas without amygdaloid, while white sand-

stones are present in others, as on the south side of Thunder Bay, though not in the

same vast amount, or the same state of vitrification as those of Huron. But not-

withstanding these differences, there are such strong points of resemblance in the

dips, and on the shores of Bay Chaleur it lies in a quiescent condition on the tilted

edges of the lower formations, sometimes resting on one find sometimes on another.

Its north-western outcrop however, or rather, I should say, the longitudinal axis of

the whole coal-field from New Brunswick to Newfoundland, has a parallelism with

the folds of the inferior rocks, and there are several parallel undulations in nearly the

same direction on the south side of the carboniferous deposit.

The conclusion to be drawn from these facts appears to be, that some cause pro-

ducing folds in the stratification in one general direction has been in operation from

at least the cessation of the Lower Silurian epoch to the termination of the carboni-

ferous                           and it only requires the inspection of  a map of Atlantic America  to  observe
                              ;

how the features of its physical geography, displayed in the configuration of its

coast, in its valleys of undulation and those of transverse fracture, are almost entirely

dependent on the results of this cause.

The fossiliferous rocks of both these divisions, with the exception of that part sup-

ported by the Cambrian formations of Lakes Superior and Huron, rest, along the

valleys of the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa, upon a series consisting of micaceous

and hornblendic gneiss interstratified towards the south with great bands of cry-

stalline limestone, sometimes highly charged with magnesia and associated with

vast masses of magnetic iron ore, but without calcareous beds on the north. These

rocks constitute a part of the low granitic ridge, which to the westward has been traced

by Sir J. Richardson as extending with a north-westerly curve to the Arctic Ocean.

The Canadian rocks on the north side of this granitic ridge, as displayed toward

the head of Lake Temiscamang, consist, in ascending order, of chloritic slates and

conglomerates with a slaty matrix ; the volume of these is probably not less and

may be much more than 1000 feet. On them rests a set of massive pale greenish-

white or sea-green sandstones, the total amount of which, as determined by the

height of hills which they compose in nearly horizontal layers, is between 400 and

500 feet. These are succeeded by about 300 feet of buff and whitish fossiliferous

limestones, the lowest bed of which is composed of a collection of great boulders and

blocks of sandstone, some of them 9 feet in diameter, that were lying immediately

on the strata from which they were derived when they became covered up, and in

which great cracks and worn fissures are filled with the calcareous deposit that en-

velopes the whole. The sandstones being without discovered fossils, it is not easy

to detei-mine their age ; but the limestones by their organic contents are distinctly
shown to belong to the Upper Silurian epoch. The liOwer Silurian deposits,

unless the unfossiliferous sandstones be a member of the group, appear to be wholly

wanting in the locality, and as all the forms brought from other localities on the

north side of the granitic ridge by Bigsby, Richardson rnd others, are, I believe^

referable to Upper Silurian types, it appears not improbable that the absence of the

Lower Silurian rocks may spread over an extensive area, and the south side of the

ridge indicate an ancient limit to a Lower Silurian sea.

The nearest locality of the well-defined forms which inhabited this sea is at the

island of Allumette, about 200 miles southward from the Upper Silurian rocks of

Lake Temiscamang ; there is however a patch of the same lower formation which

is only about 100 miles southward from them, but in it the fossils are obscure.

Instead of giving any remarks of my own on the fossils of the two sides of the granitic
ridge, I shall append to my paper a note which my friend Mr. Salter of the Geolo-

gical Survey of the United Kingdom has been so kind as to make on them after a

careful inspection, only stating that the specimens which have been examined are

but a small part of an important collection, chiefly from the eastern of the two divi-

sions that have been alluded to, brought from Canada for comparison, and that twice

as many specimens as have been brought remain in the province from other parts,

while great additions it is hoped will annually be made to them.

I have only further to add, that I exhibit to the Section as one of the character-

istics of the lowest member of the Lower Silurian rocks of Canada, a small slab of

sandstone and a cast from a larger one, showing what Professor Owen has, in a

communication to the Geological Society, pronounced to be a track and footsteps of

a species of tortoise, thus proving the existence of reptiles at the very earliest period

of known animal life ; a fact, upon the importance of which it is unnecessary to insist

before a geological audience.

Note on the Fossils above mentioned, from the Ottawa River.

By J. W. Salter, F.G.S., A.L.S.

--Lower Silurian. The fossils from the S.E. end of Allumette Island, on the Ottawa

River, are the only Lower Silurian fossils yet examined of Mr. Logan's large collec-
tions, and they bear out well the opinion he has expressed, that in some parts of Ca-

nada but one calcareous group can be distinguished between the Potsdam sandstone
and the Hudson River group, agreeing in the main with the celebrated " Trenton

limestone" of New York, but possessing also many of the fossils characteristic of the

lower limestones which in that country have received separate names.

   For instance, one of the most abundant fossils is a species of Scalites (^EuompJialus
uniangulatus) , described as a fossil of the calciferous sand-rock by Hall. The corals,

again, Stromaiocerium rugosmn, Coltimnaria alveolata, which are very abundant, are

those of the Bird's-eye and Black River limestones. The former of these corals, too,

is usually found investing (after the manner of a sponge) a large and fine species of

Maclurea, a genus of gasteropods which in New York does not mount above the

"Chazy" or lowest limestone, and is there abundant. Hall indeed expressly mentions

that the Stromaiocerium occurs in beds above those which contain the Maclurea. In
this case, however, the parasitic zoophyte has generally selected this fine and new

shell, to which I propose giving the name of its discoverer. It is well distinguished
from M. magna, by the much more rapid increase in diameter of its whorls, and its

minute umbilicus. It is possessed moreover of a most peculiar operculum, which will

at once establish the right of Maclurea to rank as a distinct genus, being furnished

within with a broad and strong bony process for the muscular attachment, and being

itself very strong and massive. Prof. Forbes has undertaken to compare this pecu-

liar operculum with that of some rare living gasteropods of far inferior size, so that

more need not be said of it at present.

   The Stromatocerium affects also a small and new species of Scalites allied to the
one above-mentioned, and frequently covers all but the mouth, so as to mask the

form of the shell completely.

But it is with the Trenton limestone that the greater number of species agrees ; and

while a large portion of them, especially the gasteropods, appear to be undescribed

Ain Hall's work, still the analogies are very evident.  list of ten or more Murchi-

sonice or Pleurotomaria aflfords one, M. ventricosa, characteristic of the Bird's-eye

limestone ; two common in the Trenton limestone, M. bicincia and M. gracilis (very
abundant species), and M. bellicincta, Hall, a large Turritella-V\ke form ; the rest seem
to be new; and some of them are remarkable for the tendency of the whorls to sepa-

rate and become what may be called vagrant, as happens in some accidental varieties

of the common snail. The shells are tolerably thick and strong.

Some smooth shells, exactly like the Euomphali of the carboniferous limestone, and

several roughly sculptured Turbines or shells of apparently allied genera, occur ; and

one exceedingly elegant, with close thread-like lines of growth, is very common. Ho-

lopea of Hall, an ill-defined genus, offers one or two species of the typical form, and

one closely allied to H. bilix of the Western States. There are three species of Scalites,

a genus with the mouth notched like Pleurotomaria, but destitute of a spiral band

one is the small species so commonly encrusted over ; a second, of which we have

but a single specimen, is muricated with spines, like a Delphinula ; the third is the

very common S. {Euomphalus) uniangulatus above mentioned, which also, but rarely,

shows a tendency to become spinose. There are also two or three species of the

Wegenus Raphistoma, which appears to be only a discoid form of Scalites.  have a

Turritella 1 spirally ribbed, and undistinguishable in general form from living species.

But the most abundant and characteristic shell is the Maclurea, fragments of which,

with scattered opercula, occur on almost every surface.

   Among bivalve shells, which chiefly belong to the Arcacidce, a very interesting
new genus has rewarded examination. It was found that two species resembling

Nucula in every general character, differed from it importantly by having no internal

ligament, but a very manifest exterior one*; one of these shells measures three

inches across, and from the general analogy of several accompanying species it is

   * Mr. S. P.Woodward, of the British Museiun, suggests that Solenella may contain these

species.

           believed that the genus will be found common in the Silurian rocks, and will include
\y many species now referred to Nucula. It might be called Ctenodonta. Of the same
"^ family also, a Lyrodesma (a genus with radiating teeth beneath the beak and syn-

            onymous with Actinodonta, Phillips) is closely allied to a Trenton limestone species.
           There is a new genus probably belonging to the family Arcacidse, but possessing
           only two or three anterior teeth ; the collection does not include any Avicxilx. Of

         the few lamellibranchiate shells none appear quite identical with those from New
           York ; but, as might be expected, the common Brachiopoda of this locality are those

            most abundant also in the Trenton limestone. Orthis tricenaria, Conrad, swarms here,
           as does also Lepfcena filitexta. Hall, a shell verj' like the common L. alternata of the
            Trenton limestone, but reversed as to the convexity of the respective valves. But the

         latter shell, so abundant in New York, does not occur here. Airypa hemiplicata. Hall,

           &nAA. increbrescens are tolerably frequent ; and there are two or three species of Or*
            this, and some small Terehratulas, which require further examination.

            The Bellerophons, two of which are probably identical with New York species, are

           those of the lowest or chazy limestone, namely, Б. (Bucania) sulcatina, Emmons, and
            JS. rotundata, Hall. The group to which these two belong is that of which the
             English B. dilatatus is a familiar type, the whorls scarcely enveloping each other,
            and the mouth wide and trumpet-shaped. There is however a true Bellerophon so
            like B. obiectus. PhilL, from the Ludlow rocks of Pembrokeshire, that, but for its
             treble size, it might be taken for it.

              Perhaps one of the most interesting of the mollusks is a large Cleodora, quite new
          to America, and not yet described as such from Britain. On attentively comparing
           the American, Irish and North Welsh specimens of this fine shell, which measures
           two inches across, I can find only trivial variations. It does not require a new spe-
            cific name, having been figured from an imperfect specimen as Atrypa transversa by
            Portlock. It is interesting to find this species (which of course, as a Pteropod, had
            ready means of migration) in the two countries. There are but few other species
            identical with those of Great Britain, but I think I recognise Turbo frochleatus, and
          perhaps T. tritorquatus, M'Coy, as common to the two regions.

               Of the Cephalopoda, the remarkable two-edged Orihoceras, called Gonioceras
           anceps by Hall, is a Black River limestone species. Cyrtoceras is common, both
            smooth and ornamented ; C. aimulatiim and C. lamellosum, the same with those of
            Trenton; Orthoceras arcuo-liraium, bilineatum, and laqueatuni, Hall, are Trenton
            limestone species ; and lastly, there are two species of Ormoceras, Stokes, the larger
            of which is in all probabihty 0. tenuifilum. Hall, a species both of the Black River
            and Trenton beds.

              Schizocrinus nodosus, Hall, of the Trenton limestone, is the common crinoid : its

             stems are very characteristic.

             Among the corals, one or two species of Slreptolasma, apparently the same as
         those of New York, and the branched varieties of Favosites lycoperdon , accompany
          those before mentioned ; and we may here notice the Receptaculites, already de-

            scribed by Hall, but not I think identical with R. Neptuni of Europe. The fine

      --series brought home by Mr. Logan shows all the structural characters ; the circular
      --expanded form and cup-like centre, the surface composed of rhomboidal plates,

            which cohere by lateral processes, and which are the flattened ends of separate and
            equidistant columns. Unfortunately the entire structure is replaced by cycloidal
            silex, but perhaps it will by careful polishing enable us to see if it be really a coral,
           somewhat of the character of the Tuhiporidce.

            teristic trilobite of the Trenton rocks.

            and so crossing the granitic axis of Canada, the first fossiliferous rock that presents

                 This limestone is weathered like the last ; its siliceous fossils also stand out in bold

phyllum, a Heliolites (Porites), with small tubes ; Syrinyopora {Harmodiies) with Ha-
lysites catenulatus {Catenipora escharoides) , and Stromhodes striatiis, Milne Edwards,
fossils characteristic of the Niagara and Onondaga limestones, and in America never

found in the lower rocks ; with these occur Atrypa reticularis in plenty, a Terebra-
tula with three raised plaits, and very rarely a Leptceiia or Strophomena. One or
two spiral shells recall the shapes of some of Hall's species o( Holopea, but are too
imperfect for identification ; and there is a long spiral shell, like Murchisonia gracilis.

Encrinurus punctatus is the only trilobite.
   The most striking shell perhaps is a species of Ormoceras, the short broad siphun-

cles of which are well preserved, while the shell has decayed ; and these so much

resemble those figured by Dr. Bigsby and Mr. Stokes in the Geological Transactions,
2nd series, vol. i. pi. 30, figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, that we think there can be no doubt of their

identitj'. And it is very interesting, as bearing on the question of age, that these
were found at Drummond Island, the only limestones of which are Upper Silurian.

   Indeed the whole aspect of this collection, small as it is, is as strikingly Upper
Silurian as that of the former one was Lower Silurian. The preponderance of the
Catenipora, Favosites and Stromatopora, &c., is characteristic of the higher rocks, and
they are associated with Pentamerus oMongus (the characteristic fossil of the Clinton
group, which may be regarded as the base of the upper division), and this shell in
America is far more limited in its vertical range than it is in Britain.

   Professor E. Forbes exhibited the new species oi Maclurea referred to by Mr. Salter,
and its operculum, and stated that he regarded it as one of the floating forms which
appear to have been common in the Silurian period.

0)1 the Occurrence of a Stratum of Stones covered with Barnacles in the Red
   Crag at Wherstead, near Ipswich. By Sir Charles Lyell, F.R.S.

It has been observed that in the Red Crag of the neighbourhood of Ipswich, and

generally throughout the area occupied by that formation in Norfolk and Suffolk, the

marine organic remains are not now in the places where the animals to which they

belonged lived and died. They are mixed with pebbles, and often, like tliem, bear the

marks of having been rolled. The valves of the bivalve moUusca are found detached

one from the other, and neither they nor the univalve shells are arranged in groups

as they lived at the bottom of the sea. They look as if they had formed portions of

shifting sand-banks, or as if they had been drifted from some other place to that where
they are now met with. Every exception, therefore, to so general a rule deserves no-
tice, and I shall mention one now to be seen in the Crag within a few miles of

Ipswich, about 500 yards south of the vicarage-house of Wherstead, to which attention

was called by the Rev. Barham Zincke of Wherstead. The shelly red crag here laid

open has a vertical thickness of from 10 to 12 feet, and is overlaid by 8 feet of sandy

and gravelly beds without fossils. The shelly mass presents the usual characters of
this formation, and among others, that of having the separate valves of the Pectun-

culus, Mactra, Cardita, Pecten and Terebratula with their concave sides turned down-

wards, almost without one exception. Near the top ef the shelly mass, usually within

18 or sometimes 8 inches of it, a stratum occurs consisting of imi-ounded chalk flints
intermixed with some well-rounded flint pebbles. The upper portions of these stones,

which are of various sizes, are encrusted with barnacles from which their lower sur-
faces are free. The barnacles consist chiefly of a littoral species, Balanus communis,

and another nearly allied to it. The longest of the stones obtained by Mr. Zincke from

this bed, and which he has brought to the meeting, is an unrounded chalk flint, mea-
suring no less than 22 inches in length, by 16 in breadth, and 7 in height. It sup-

ports on its top and sides about ten groups of barnacles, hut none of these are found

on the under side of the stone, where it must have rested on the bottom of the sea.
The same remark holds good in regard to all the other stones and pebbles spread

through the same stratum. Among these Mr. Zincke and I observed a small copro-

lite, or one of the bodies commonly so called, the top of which was covered with bar-

nacles, while all the lower portion was smooth. The pebbly stratum containing these

Balani is overlaid with shelly crag, of somewhat fine materials, and of slight thickness, as

before stated. From the above facts it appears, that the action of those currents which
brought the principal mass of crag to th.is spot, and which had power to convey to it
some stones of no ordinary magnitude, was so completely suspended for a time, that
even the smallest and lightest pebbles were not moved or overturned. Had any of
them been turned over we should have found barnacles on the lower sides of them, or
perhaps on both sides ; nor did any current wash away the loose shelly layer that
afterwards covered the barnacle bed. The Balanus communis is a littoral species, and
Mr. Searles Wood informs me that he has generally met with it in the upper part of
the Red Crag. Professor E. Forbes, to whom I have shown the specimens, says that
the time required for such a growth of barnacles may have been three or four months,
and that they probably lived in very shallow water, if not between high- and low-water

marks.

                 On the Scratched and Polished Rocks of Scotland.
   JBj/Sir Roderick I. Murchison, G.C.St.S., F.R.S., Pres. Geogr. Soc.

    The author first gave a brief sketch of the whole subject of abraded, polished and
striated rocks, to which for many years he had paid attention, by comparing the phae-
nomena in the British Isles with those seen in Scandinavia, Russia, the Alps, and
otiier })arts of the continent. He showed Iiow effects which had been exclusively
referred by Agasslz and others to the action of ice moving on land, or glaciers, could
now, in the vast majority of examples, be better accounted for by the agency of the
melting of snow and ice, the driving forward of ice-floes by powerful currents, and
the accompanying translation of vast quantities of drift composed of gravel, mud,
sand, and erratic blocks.

    Sir Roderick next described certain polished and striated rocks on the north shore
of Loch Fyne, wliich he had examined last summer in company with the Duke of
Argyll, particularly at the promontories of Kenmore and Penimore, where bosses of
tough, crystalline chlorite schist are powerfully abraded and rounded off wherever
they face to the E.N.E. or up the loch, and whose surfaces are rugged and natural
on the AV.S.W. or towards the sea. The portions of these rocks which have been so
mechanically ground down, exhibit also rudely parallel and slightly diverging lines of
striation, showing that they have been scored and fluted as if by the passage over
them of a heavy harrowing mass which had been translated from E.N.E. to W.S.W.,
and the chief force of which had been expended on the faces of the rocks which stood
out as opposed to it. The author then referred to several other examples of
similar appearances in other parts of the seaboard of the West Highlands, particularly
on the sides of the lochs which open out from Ben Cruachan and Loch Etive to
Oban, the rounded and striated surfaces of the promontories and islets being invariably

presented towards the interior, and their jagged and rough faces towards the sea. He

also referred to his writings on the countless examples of precisely similar phseno-

mena in Sweden, in which flat country he had endeavoured to demonstrate, that
they never could have resulted from the action of terrestrial glaciers, and he now
 applied the same reasoning to the lower parts of Scotland.

    Alluding to the lines of striation cited by Mr. Robert Chambers and other authors
 as occiuring in the eastern counties north of Edinburgh, where the direction has been
from west to east, or nearly opposite to that mentioned on the west coast. Sir Roderick
 then called special attention to a fact which in September 18.50 came under the notice
 of Professor Nicol and himself near Glenluce in Galloway. There the sea-shore
 trends from west to east, and the drift-marks are, as in the other cases, more or less
 at right angles to it, being directed from north to south. In all these cases of
 striation, gravel, stones, and shingle had been recently removed from the surface of
 the rocks. From these data, which go to indicate that the drifted materials had in
 all cases been derived from the chief adjacent masses of land, the author exjiressed
 the opinion, that during the ' glacial epoch' Scotland probably consisted of a range of
rocky iiills in an icy sea, whicii by successive movements from different centres had
thrown off dislocated sheets of ice, with much melted snow and ice, forming a detrital
 ' sludge' or drift which had been poured clown all the lateral openings. In Scotland,
therefore, as in Scandinavia, he accounted for the grinding down and striation of the
rocks in the lower gorges and on the lower grounds near the sea, by the passage of
such materials. At the same time he believes in the former existence in Scotland of

short terrestrial glaciers, and he compares the ancient condition of the upper end of
Loch Fyne and other salt-water lakes of the West Highlands to the present fiords of
Norway, where snowy ridges terminate seawards in glaciers which advance to near

Athe water's edge. sudden upheaval of such tracts would, in dislocating the glaciers

and in throwing off a mixed icy drift, he contends, produce appearances like those on

the coasts of Scotland.

On neiu Fossil Mammalia from the Eocene Freshwater Formation at
          Hordwell, Hants. By Professor Owen, F.R.S.

The specimens described were from the collection of the Marchioness of Hastings,

and belonged to the genera Paloplotherium, Xiphodon, Dichodon, and HijcBuodon.

The genus Paloplotherium (Owen) is the link which connects the Tapir, Rhinoceros

and Palaeothere with the Hippothere and Horse. It differs essentially from the Ano-

plotherium in having a long interval between the molar and canine teeth, and in
having the external nostril formed by six bones instead of four. From Palaeotherium
it differs in having only six molars on each side of the upper jaw. The species (P.

annectens) found at Hordwell also occurs in the lignite formation of Gargas, Vaucluse.

The genus Dichodon agrees with Aiioplotherium in having an uninterrupted series of

teeth ; remains of two species (D. cuspidatus and dorcas) have been found at Hordwell.

Of the genus Xiphodon an almost entire lower jaw (distinct from the X. gracilis of
--Cuvier) has
been  obtained                                          also an entire  lower jaw of the Hyanodon,  a genus
                                                     ;

" so remarkable amongst the carnivorous order for retaining the normal formula of

the dentition of monophyodont placentals, and for the truly carnassial form of the
three true molars." The Hordwell specimen agrees with the H. minor of M. Gervais,

from the lacustrine, marls of Alais.

. On the Fossil Mammalia of the Bed Crag. By Professor Owen, F.R.S.

         On the Structure of the Crag. By John Phillips, F.R.S.

   The author presented in the first place a general view of the geological constitution
of the country round Ipswich, illustrating the vertical succession, horizontal area, mi-
neral character and organic contents of the visible strata, the lowest of which is chalk.
Referring then to the admirable labours of Mr. Searles Wood, by whom the numerous
testacea of the Crag had been beautifully described and figured ; to Professor Owen,
to whom the distinction of many unexpected mammalian forms in this deposit was
due ; and to Mr. Colchester, who discovered the oldest of these forms ; to Mr. Charles-
worth, who first classed the Crag into the three departments of Coralline, Red and
Mammahferous Crag ; to Lyell, Forbes and Prestwich, and finally to Henslow, who
called attention to the now very profitable mass of phosphatic nodules ('coprolites'),
the author limited his following remarks to certain facts in the physical structure of
the Red Crag, which appeared to throw a definite light on the condition of the waters
and sea bed, at the epoch when this rich shelly deposit took place.

   First, he showed that the London clay, the general base of the whole deposit of the
red and coralline crags, had been enormously wasted by the sea, and reduced to a thin
portion with a nearly level though uneven top. On this the red crag was deposited,
in laminae very frequently deviating from the horizontal, often inclined in different
directions, more or less filled with a rude mixture of shells, entire or broken or worn,
most frequently with valves separated pebbles of flint and water-worn lumps of bone,

                                                                                                                                                                           ;

phosphatic nodules, sharks' teeth, and a variety of other substances. Towards the base
of the deposit, in many irregular streams or veins, the larger and heavier of these
nodules were often collected together, and sometimes mixed with great lumps of chalk
flint. Above and below these veins of (so-called) coprolite, was usually a series of
nearly horizontal bands of argillaceous marl, throwing out water ; sometimes two of
these layers of nodules occur, the lower being then thickest. In other places, where

coprolites do not occur in abundance, the lower parts of the red crag are formed by
alternating thin clays or loams (probably derived from the London clay beneath), and

thin bands of coarse shelly crag. Thus, intervals of comparative tranquillity are seen
to have intervened between recurring periods of watery agitation. In the highest

parts of the deposit a vast variety of the effects of agitated water occur, and proof at
                                                                                                      5╗

every step of deposition disturbed by drifting. Selecting from a variety of subjects
two cases of interest, tlie author described, above the middle of the red crag, a band
some feet in thickness which was traceable for half a mile on the Felixstow cliff, and
had in all that range apparently one direction of the inclination of its laminse, viz. to
the S.W. or nearly so, and in several parts of this range showed these laminae to be
curved, with the concavity upwards, the inclination of each lamina being greatest near
the surface (30░), and thence declining av.ay, so as, in the space of 30 or 40 yards, to
become horizontal.

   This result the author showed to be analogous to what happens in certain beaches of
modern date, and is in fact exemplified on the very beach which extends below the
crag, and is now spreading out continually further to sea. Another interesting cha-
racter of the mechanical condilions under which red crag was deposited, is found in the
position occupied by the separated pieces of bivalve shells. These (as first pointed out
by Mr. R. Johnson in the Proceedings of the Geological Society) were, when in a state
of tolerable completeness, very commonly found with their concave sides downwards,
a position which the observer alluded to conceived to be inconsistent with this arrange-
ment of water, and ascribed to currenti of wind. Professor Phillips showed, on the
contrary, by mechanical considerations, and by references to actual experiments, that
this was the very position which such shells must and do take up in finally settling to
rest from frequent agitation in water, such as happens on a sea beach ; and that no
other explanations ought to be admitted. Abundant proof of this was afforded by
trials with the crag shells and recent shells on the beach at Felixstow. In some places,

--alternating with these inclined laminse, and defining them, were laminae of loam or

micaceous sands not shelly evidently due to subsidence from muddy waters settling
to comparative quiet. Thus again intervals of agitation and comparative repose were
proved to have alternated, and this in a way to correspond with what is observed on
modern beaches.

    In regard to the conditions of land and sea during the accumidations of red crag,

the author stated in general terms his opinion that those deposits took place in a sort
of shallow bay, receiving matters from wasting cliffs and shifting shelly sands, by a
current varying in intensity, and subject to one or more specially tumultuous epochs.

    Lieut.-Colonel Portlock exhibited Fossils collected by Mr. R. Rubidge at Sunday

River, on the Cape frontier. They consisted of marine shells of the genera Ammo-

nites, Gryphcea, Pholadomya and Trigonia ; and plants of the genera Zamia, Neuro-
pteris, Pecopteris and Sphenopterls. The shells were apparently of Jurassic age ; the
plants had been examined by Dr. Harvey, and the species oi Neuroplerk, Pecopteris
and Sphenopferis, were regarded as chiefly resembling those of the coal of Australia,
whilst the presence of the genus Zamia in abundance impresses an oolitic aspect on

the flora.

Explication cVu7i Tableau de VEtude Methodiqiie de la Terre et du Sol,

                         By M. Constant Prevost.

Mr. Prestwicli, at the request of the President, explained that M. Prevost's object

was to introduce uniformity into geological nomenclature, and also to give a more

distinct meaning to scientific terms. At present each country had its own nomen-

clature, and many of the terms in use were invented at a time when the science was

one of imagination. M. Prevost had always advocated the view that causes now in

action  were  sufficient to account for  all  the phsenomena of the  older  rocks                                 at  the  same
                                                                                                               ;

time he started with the supposition that the earth was originally in an extremely

heated condition. Round this heated globe a thin crust {sol) was formed, and gradu-

ally thickened by sedimentary deposits going on in all times, whilst volcanic outbreaks

were continually occurring from the interior. M. Prevost divided all the strata into

systems or series (terrains), representing periods of time, each necessarily including

marine, fluvio-marine, freshwater, terrestrial and volcanic deposits (formations). But
although the causes of each of these kinds of deposit must have been in operation

-- --during every past epoch, it may be doubted whether we shall ever discover the equi-

valents freshwater, terrestrial, volcanic, &c. of every one of the known marine for-

mations.

   The Rev. T. Rankin stated that the parish church of North Dalton, near Beverley,
stands on a small mound with a pond below. The mound is a mass of chalky gravel,
usually supposed to be artificial, but the writer regards it as a mass of drift left by
currents, and assigned his reasons for the opinion.

    Mr. C. B. Rose exhibited the Antler of a Rein-deer, found by Captain Alexander
below the cliff near Southwold, and probably derived from the glacial deposits of which
the upper part of those cliffs is formed. As it was the first occurrence of the animal

in Suffolk, he presented the specimen to the Ipswich Museum. He also showed a

very small recent-looking antler of a fallow-deer obtained from a fen at Roydon, near

Diss. It was found at the depth of 4 or 5 feet, associated with remains of the
Red-deer, Roebuck and Ox. Mr. Rose quoted the opinion of Dr. Fleming, that the
fallow-deer was a native of Britain*; Dr. F. having refeiTed, among others, to Lesley
(De Or. Scot. p. 5), who mentions, among the objects which the huntsman pursued
with dogs, "Cervum, damam, aut capream;" in which he was supported by Mr.
Strickland, who remarked also, that the Rein- deer had been found with the Irish Elk
in the marl under a peat bog on the coast of Holderness.

                     On Klinology in reference to the Bavarian Alps.
                           By Dr. Schafhaeutl, of Munich.

The Alps surpass all other European mountains both in grandeur and in complexity

of geological structure. Their central ranges consist chiefly of crystalline and meta-

--morphic rocks, their borders of sedimentary strata ; some of the newest of these strata

have the greatest breadth, elevation, and mas^', attaining a height of 10,000 feet above

the sea. Fossils are often very scarce ; and when they do occur, those of several for-
mations have become mixed together, on account of the frequent repetition of the

formations by mechanical displacement. Dr. Schafhaeutl recommends the study of

--the intimate structure of the beds, a mode of investigation which he terms "Klino-

logy." It has long been admitted that the newer rocks have generally a lower specific

gravity, and are less compact or crystalline than the older strata; and the remarks of

Ehrenberg have shown that the microscope may be employed to detect minute struc-

tural as well as organic peculiarities. Even by placing rock specimens in distilled

water, outlines and designs may be brought out which were before invisible; and still

more maybe learned by the application of hydrochloric acid, or by studying weathered

surfaces. As examples of the importance of attending to minute characters, the author

mentioned that the red sandstone of Berchtesgiiden had been considered the equiva-

lent of the old red schists of Salzburg ; but lie had detected the existence of green

particles  in  this  sandstone                                               and  had  traced  them  to  a  distance  increasing  in  numbers
                                                                          ;

until the red sandstone became green, and was clearly recognizable as a lower mem-

ber of the Cretaceous group. In a similar manner he had ascertained that the black

lias-like schist of M. Beseler, in the western Bavarian .A.lps, was also " greensand."

Microscopic fragments of characteristic shells, like the Caprofina, had been found by

him where entire specimens were wanting ; and in some of the lofty Alpine limestones

which are destitute of fossils, he had detected microscopic remains which showed their
origin, like that of the chalk formation, to have been intimately connected with " the

wide-spread and powerful-working spirit of life developing itself in forms invisible to

the unassisted eye."

On the Morphology of the Fruit in the Crucifera, as illustrated by a Monstrosity
       in the Wallflower. By Professor G. J. Allman, M.D., M.R.I.A.

Professor Allman laid before the Section a singular monstrosity which recently oc-

curred to him in a plant of common wallflower growing in the Botanic Gardens of

Trinity College, Dublin, and which appeared to throw considerable light on the mor-

phology of the fruit in the Cruciferae. The monstrosity consisted in the conversion of

the six stamina into carpels, which faced the axis of the flower and carried ovules on

both margins : in the greater number of instances these carpels were imperfectly

closed, and were united by their margins into a tube which formed a complete sheath

surrounding the pistil. In other cases however the adventitious carpels remained

distinct, and each was then seen to be composed of an ovary, style and stigma. It

was also evident that the ovary with the short style resulted from the transformation

of the filament, while the stigma was plainly a transformed anther ; but what was

especially interesting was the distinctly bilobed condition of the stigma in these soli-

tary carpels ; each lobe was evidently derived from a corresponding lobe of the

transformed anther, and was placed opposite to the marginal row of ovules ; the

stigma indeed here closely resembled that of the normal fruit, and offered a very ob-

vious explanation of the anomalous fact, that the stigmata in the latter appear to be

Wesituated opposite to the placenta.  have only to suppose two of these adventitious

and imperfectly-closed carpels to unite face to face, and a stigma with the exact for-

mation which we find in the normal fruit of the Cruciferae will be the result. The

latter therefore is evidently formed of two bilobed stigmata, united so completely as

to obliterate the traces of union, while the bilobed condition of the individual stigmata

is in no I'espect interfered with ; so that what appears as a simple element in the
compound stigma of the cruciferous pistil is really composed of two half-elements,

namely, one lobe of each of the two elementary stigmata. This opinion has already had

its advocates, but it seems to have been hitherto lU'ged on purely theoretical grounds.

From all this it would seem further to follow that the ovary of the cruciferous carpel

corresponds to a petiole or phyllodium, while the bilobed stigma will represent the

lamina of the carpellary leaf.

   In many of the adventitious and imperfectly-closed carpels a membranous ex-

pansion extends inwards from each margin over the concavity of the carpel, but

without imiting with that from the opposite margin. These expansions correspond

to the spurious dissepiment of the normal fruit, and are here plainly seen to be

derived from the placentae.

On some Facts tending to show the probability of the Conversion of Asci into
   Spores in certain Fungi. By the Rev. M. J. Bekkelet and C. E. Broomb.

    After alluding to the observations of other botanists on this subject, the authors
communicated as follows. The species which have afforded the materials for the
following remarks are more especially three, viz. Tympanis saligna, Tode; Sphcsria
inquinans, Tode; and Hendersonia vnitabilis, Berkeley and Broome. Tympanis
saligna scarcely differs from a lichen, except in the total absence of a crust, and
consequently of gonidia. Its apothecia are at first closed, but at a later period of

growth the fructifying disc or hymenium is exposed. On the same twig, in this in-
stance of the common Privet, some specimens exhibited all the characters of Tym'

pants, and others those of Diplodia. As long as the naked spores occurred only in

specimens in which the disc was not expanded, this caused no surprise, as nothing is

more common than to find Sphasrise and Diplodiae on the same matrix, -which cannot

be distinguished externally ; but further examination exhibited the proper fructifi-

cation of Diplodia in specimens with an open disc, a character quite at variance with

that of the genus, and then the same hymenium was detected producing rather large

uniseptate naked spores, and broad elongated asci exceeding them many times in

length, and containing a multitude of minute oblong sporidia. Prof. Fries, in a letter

lately received, informs us that he has observed a similar fact in 'и Hendersonia Sy-

ringes." The circumstance of the constant or occasional occurrence of Uredo and

Puccinia, Uredo and Aregma, Uredo and Xeiiodochus, or two species of tlie same

genus in the same spot, may be adduced as analogous ; but where there is no peri-

thecium, the occurrence of two species on the same spot, of the same matrix, is not

matter of so much surprise, though suggestive of further consideration. The case,

however, of Spheeria inquinans, which we have now to bring forward, is still stronger.

This species and Stilbospora macrosperma were extremely abundant on an old elm at

Batheaston in January last. Not only were they so intermixed as to make it diffi-

--cult from the close resemblance of the fruit, that of the one being merely a little

--more elongated, and in a very slight degi-ee more attenuated at either extremity, with

rather a browner tinge to say at once which was the Sphceria, which the Stilbospora,

but the same orifice in the bark gave egress both to the sporidia of the one and the

spores of the other. At the base of the spores of the Stilbospora, where they are seated

on their sporophores, from one to three short sheaths were observed, as if the spore had

burst through one or more enveloping membranes ; but not only was the Stilbospora

produced in the same portion of the bark as the Sphesria, or, perhaps, to speak more

correctly, in the same stroma, but in one case it was actually developed on the ex-

ternal surface of a perithecium, the inner surface giving rise to perfect asci with their

proper sporidia. In a certain stage of growth the sporidia of the Sphaeria are fur-

nished at either extremity with a cirrhiform appendage, but this is not always visible

in the ejected mass which surrounds the common orifice of the perithecia. Analogous

appendages occur in some other species. The third case to which we invite attention

is Hendersonia mutahilis, a species which occurs on twigs of Plane. The main peri-

thecium contains one or more cavities more or less isolated, which produce far smaller

hyaline bodies, and which do not accord with the genus Hendersonia, but rather with

Phoma. This is not indeed a case bearing upon the conversion of asci into spores,

but is interesting as exhibiting one perithecium within another ; and whether consi-

dered as a new cell developed within the old one, and consequently containyig

younger spores, a view at first adopted, but which, on mature consideration, seems

scarcely tenable, or as two forms of spores both belonging to the same species, but

produced in distinct cavities, or, finally, as two genera united within the same com-

Wemon receptacle, is full of interest.  are not prepared, as in the last case, to say

that the same wall from its two sides produces different forms of fruit, though in some

sections the two fertile surfaces are so confluent above, that it is very probable that

the same fact will be found to obtain here also. These instances certainly seem to

indicate rather a transformation of organs than any totally distinct productions, a

view indeed which is not at variance with the possibility of the transformed organs,

being an indication of sexual functions, if we may be allowed to form any inference
from known analogies in the animal world. Dr. Hooker, when examining the fruit

of Laminariae on his return from the antarctic expedition, felt convinced of the possi-

biUty of the transformation of an ascus into a spore, a view entertained long since by

Fries, and which is supported by those instances in fungi and lichens where a single

spore only is developed in an ascus. The diflTerence in the analysis of the genus

Spharophoron, as given by Dr. Montagne in the ' Annales des Sciences Naturelles,'

and by Dr. Hooker in the ' Antarctic Flora,' is probably due to a similar change; the

former exhibiting true asci containing sporidia, the latter moniliform threads, breaking

up into spores.. In earlier times the analysis of one would have been pronounced

erroneous, but the present age, with deeper knowledge of the apparent anomalies ex-

hibited by Nature, and consequently a greater measure of dittidence, regards such

discrepancies as calls to further investigations, and as the possibly available keys for

the solution of difficulties whieb have been hitherto insurmountable.

                       On a Mo7istrosily of Latliyrus odoratus.

                     By Edwin Lankester, M.D., F.R.S.

   This specimen was presented to the Section by John King, Esq., of Ipswich, in whose
garden it liad grown. Tlie papilionaceous petals were reduced to mere scales, and
the calyx assumed a less developed and perfectly regular form. The stamens were no
longer diadelphous, but regular, 10 in number, and arranged in two rows. The car-
pels were reduced to the condition of a single leaf, on which were seated rudimentary
ovules. The leaves and branches were not so large or expanded as is usual with
healthy specimens of this plant.

On the Theory ofthe Formation of Wood and the Descent of the Sap in Plants.
                   By Edwin Lankester, M.D., F.R.S.

   The author drew attention to tl>e theory of the formation of wood in j)lants, and
objected to the view tliat the leaves foim the wood, on the ground that the ligneons, like
all other tissues, were the result of the growth of cells, which were not formed in the
leaves; but wood was formed in all parts of tb.e plant where elongated cells were ge-

nerated, quite independently of leaves cr the formation of leaves ; as in the lower part
of the cut wounds pf the stems of plants, in the portions of trunks left when trees were
cut down, in the abortive branches formed in the bark of such trees as the elm and the

cedar, and in the other parts of the vegetable structure. He also objected to the theory

of the formation of the ligneous, or any other secretion, which might be subsequently

appropriated by the cells, in the leaves alone. He maintained that all the facts brought

forward to support the theory of the descent of the sap might be explained on the

known fact of the ready permeability of the tissues of the plant. He related the de-

tails of experiments performed on the species of spurge, in which the fluid was found
to exude from the stem and branches in these plants just in proportion to the quantity
of fluid contained in the plants above or below the section made. The cells of plants

--were nourished in two ways: first, by the sap containing carbonic acid, ammonia,

and other substances ; and secondly, by materials, as sugar, gum, &c., formed in the

cells. These latter were not formed solely in the leaves, but in all cells. He regarded
the leaves as organs by which the water of the sap was got rid of, and by this means a

further supply of sap from the earth and atmosphere was ensured. This function was
performed in subservience to changes which were attributed to a specific vitality. It
was unphilosophical to speak of vitality as a force when it could not be demonstrated
to exist, and especially when physical forces were capable of explaining the phee-
notnena.

Notes on the Botanical Geography of part of the Himalaya and Tibet.

   By Major E. Madden and Captain R. Strachey, Bengal Engineers.

   This paper was illustrated by a sectional drawing of the Himalaya mountains, from
the plains of India to Tibet, passing through the British province of Kum^on, on which
the names of the more striking plants were inserted at the elevations where they were
found. The section commencing from the southern face of the mountains first repre-
sented the band of forest that skirts their foot, chiefly composed of the trees of tropical
India. Ascending, we find forms of temperate climates gradually introduced above
3000 feet,-- Pi?╗M, Rosa. Rubtts, Oak, Berberis, Primula, &:c. At 5000 feet the ar-
boreous vegetation of the ])lains is altogether superseded by such trees as Oak, Rho-
dodendron, Andromeda, Cypress and Pine. Tlie first ridge crossed, ascends to a
height of 8700 feet in a distance of not more than 10 or 12 miles from the termination
of the plains. The European character of the vegetation is here thoroughly established,
and although specific identities are comparatively rare, the representative forms are

most abundant. On a part of this ridge is found a Palm, that on some mountains,

not far off, attains a height of 50 feet at an elevation of more than 8000 feet above the
sea, where it is every year covered with snow. Passing onwards we enter a zone of
less elevation which is comparatively devoid of wood, and is chiefly devoted to agri-
culture. The climate is not very dissimilar to that of Northern India, but not nearly
80 hot, and many species of tropical plants occur. Crossing another ridge, similar in
its vegetation to that first mentioned, we descend into the valley of the Sarjie, one of

the rivers that penetrate at a very low level far into the interior, carrying with them

a tropical vegetation into the heart of the mountains. This, hov/ever, is considerably

Wemodified by the height and by the greater humidity.  thus find Pines and Palms,

Oaks and Maples, growing with the ordinary trees of the plahis, and a similar confusion
of the flora of the temperate and torrid zones holds with the shrubs and herbs. From

this valley we pass into that of the Pindar, which we follow up from 7500 feet to its

source in a glacier at 12,000 feet. From 7500 to 11,000 feet, the region of Alpine
forest, the trees most common are Oak, Horse-chestnut, Elm, Maple, Pine, Yew,

Hazel growing to a large tree, and many others. They often grow to a very large

size, and the forest is usually far finer than in the lower mountains. At about 11,500

feet the forest ends ; Picea Webbiana and Belula Bhojpatra being usually the last trees.

Shrubs, however, continue in abundance for about 1000 feet more, at about 12,000

feet the vegetation becoming almost entirely herbaceous. On this southern face of

the mountains the snow line is probably at about an elevation of 15,500 feet. 'J'he

constant condensation of vapour on this face causing a very humid climate, the vege-

tation is very luxuriant, and the great riches of the Himalayan flora are found in this

region. As we pass to the north of the great snowy peaks, we leave behind us this

wet climate and enter a country that very soon becomes equally remarkable for its

extreme aridity, [n the valley of the Gori, into which we next pass at an elevation

of 11,500 feet, we find that several Tibetan plants have appeared, the flora, however,

having become very poor. The gorges that lead to the great passes into Tibet are

almost devoid of vegetation. The highest dicotyledonous plant noticed on this route

was at about 17.500 feet, probably a species of Echinospermum ; an Urtica also is

common at these heights. The snow line here recedes to 18,500 or 19,000. In Tibet

itself, the vegetation is scanty in the extreme, consisting chiefly of Caragana, Artemi-

sia, Astragali, a few Graminecs, Potentillece, &c. The plain to the north of the Hi-

malaya is almost a desert, not more than one-twentieth of the surface being clothed

with vegetation, and that of the most miserable sort, the bushes seldom rising above a

foot in height. The cultivation of barley extends to a height of 14,000 feet. Vege-

tation ends at about 17,500 feet, the highest plants being Corydalis, Crnciferse, Nepeta,

Sedum, and some few others.

                   On the Botanical Geography of Western Tibet.

                    By Thomas Thomson, M.D., E.I.C.S.

  A section of this country, similar to that which accompanied Capt. Strachey's paper,

was also exhibited. It extended on a line nearly north and south from the upper part
of the Chenab river to the Kara Korum pass on the Konelun chain of Humboldt.
The chain to the south of the Chenab, rising to an elevation of 15,000 feet, excludes
a considerable quantity of humidity from the valley of that river, and the vegetation,
though not altogether losing its truly Himalayan character, becomes much modified.
Thus the Oaks, Rhododendrons, and Andromeda, so common on the southern moun-
tains, are not found ; while fruit-trees become more abundant, and the Grape-vine

ripens its fruit admirably. Passing to the north, the next ridge that is crossed reaches
a height of from 20,000 to 22,000 feet, the passes being usually upwards of 18,000

feet in elevation. To the north of this range the climate and vegetation suddenly
change, and the Tibetan types are at once established. The general character of
the Flora is Europeo-Siberian, but much modified by the extreme aridity which
almost excludes trees and shrubs ; it hardly exceeds 500 or 600 species in all. The
chief groups are Boraginese, Chenopodiacese, Cruciferae, Astragaline Leguminosae, and
Artemisoid Compositae. The few trees consist of a Poplar, confined to the more shel-
tered ravines, and an occasional Juniper on the hill sides. The more common shrubs
are Lonicera, Tamarix, Myricaria and Hippopha'e. The high Alpine herbaceous flora

is almost strictly Siberian, and is a little more varied and copious than in other parts

of this region, from the additional moisture derived from the melting of the snow. It

extends sometimes even to a height of 18,500 feet.

Descriptions of two New Species of Nudibranchiate Mollusca, one of them
  forming the type of a New Genus. By Joshua Alder and Albany Han-
   cock. With the Anatomy of the Genus, by Albany Hancock.

   The Mollusks described were found at Falmouth by W. P. Cocks, Esq. The first

species noticed belongs to the rare genus Thecacera, of which only one species has
been before desrribed. The authors have named it Thecacera virescens, and cha-
racterize it as follows :

    T. virescens. Body rather convex, smooth, of a light peach-blossom tint, blotched
with green anteriorly and posteriorly. Head with a plain subvelar margin in front.
Tentacles broadly laminated, retractile within sheaths with plain margins. Branchial

plumes five, green margined with white. A single row of obsolete tubercles encircles

the branchial region. Length i%ths of an inch.
   The next mollusk described belongs to the family Eolldidec, and constitutes a new

genus in that family, differing from EoUs in the position of the tentacles, and in
having a subdorsal anus, and a curious frilled membrane down the side of each bran-

chial papilla. It is thus characterized:

Oilhnna, n.g. Body elongated, limaciform. Head with four linear tentacles consti-

tuting two pairs, both subdorsal. Mouth with corneous jaws. Branchiae papillary,

clothing  irregularly  a  subpallial  expansion  on  the  sides  of the  back                          a  produced
                                                                                                    ;

membranous margin or fringe runs down the inner side of each papilla. Anus latero-

dorsal, situated towards the right side. Orifices of the generative organs separate.

The species is named 0. nobilis. It is of a pale buff colour, with the branchiae of

a rich brown, their apices having a metallic lustre.

The anatomy of the genus is given in detail by Mr. Albany Hancock. It cor-

responds with that of Eolis in its general features, but shows some very curious and

interesting modifications; the most remarkable of which is the great development of

the efferent or bran chio- cardiac vessels of the vascular system. These vessels, which

lie entirely within the skin, are conspicuous from the outside and show many rami-

fications passing into a large vessel which occupies the centre of the back behind the

heart. A small but very distinct vessel, in connexion with them, runs down the

frilled membranes of the papillae, showing the branchial character of these organs.

Another pecidiarity of this animal is found in the hepatic apparatus. The pyloric

extremity of the stomach receives two biliary ducts, one on each side of the intestine.

These, diverging as they leave the stomach, pass into the skin at the sides of the back,

where each opens into a wide hepatic channel that extends nearly the whole length

of the body, receiving branches from the glands of the papillae, &c. The anterior

portion of the great hepatic channels are apparently connected with two folliculated

glandular bodies, much and irregularly sacculated ; and amidst the cellular tissue at

the posterior part of the body there is likewise a glandular substance, folliculated and

apparently branched, in connexion with the hepatic canals within the skin. This

arrangement differs from that which prevails in the Eolididce, in nearly all the genera

of which the principal hepatic canals lie free in the visceral cavity, and there is a

medial posterior trunk. In this genus there is no such trunk, and the canals are

almost entirely within the skin. In this respect Oitho7ia resembles Her tiKsa, hut the

peculiarities of the digestive system alone distinguish it from that genus as well as

from every other member of the family.

                     On the Branchial Currents Е/"Pholas and Mya.
                      By Joshua Alder and Albany Hancock.

   The existence of branchial cuiTents in the Bivalve Mollusca, received anddischarged
by difterent apertures, is now pretty generally admitted ; but exception has been
claimed for some genera and families v;hose anatomical structure is supposed to
present an insuperable obstacle to this arrangement ; their siphons, as it is thought,
having no communication internally. Amongst these are the Myadce and the

PholadidcE.

   Mr. Garner, in his excellent essay on the Anatomy of the Lamellihranchiata, takes
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  75

this view of the case, and Mr. Clark, who has endeavoured to disprove the existence
of separate branchial currents in all the bivalves, has more recently entered into
many details of experiments to show that no internal communication exists between

the two siphons of the genus Pholas.
    That the Pholades and MyadcB, as well as other bivalves, do draw in a current of

water by the branchial siphon, which is expelled by the anal one, the authors of this
paper have long known from actual observation, confirmed by recent investigations ;
but to answer the objections raised on anatomical grounds, they have found it ne-
cessary to examine the internal structure of these animals with greater care than
they had hitherto done. The result has been highly satisfactory, not only proving
the existence of an internal communication between the siphons, but opening out new
views of branchial action and its subserviency to the sustentation of the animal. The
communication is found to take place through minute apertures between the meshes
of the gills themselves. Each of the gill-plates or branchial leaflets consists of two
laminae united at the ventral margin, and likewise attached to each other in trans-
verse lines running across the gills throughout their whole extent, and forming in the
interspaces a series of parallel tubes which open into the anal or dorsal chamber, and
are thus in communication with the excurrent siphon. The minute reticulated blood-
vessels of the branchial laminas, forming the walls of these tubes, are found when ex-
amined by a high power of the microscope to be open between the meshes, which are
minutely ciliated, allowing the passage of the water into the tubes and from thence
into the anal chamber. The gill-laminae thus act like a sieve, not only aerating the
branchial vessels most completely, but also straining the water, by which means the
nutritive particles suspended in it are left on the outer surface of the gill, and by
means of vibratory cilia are conveyed to the ventral margin, and thence along a mar-
ginal groove to the mouth. By laying open a living Pholas and colouring the water
with indigo, the whole of this apparatus may be seen in action, which certainly forms
one of the most beautifully adapted organic mechanisms that can be looked upon. As

a breathing organ it is very complete ; as a prehensile organ for receiving food, it is

unrivalled for the minuteness and beauty of its structure.

    An examination of the branchiae oi Mya, PuUastra, Cardium, Osirea, and Mytilus,
 shows them to be formed after the same plan, and induces the authors to beUeve that
the sieve-like character of the branchice and the mode of action here described pre-

 dominate throughout the whole order of the LameUibranchiata as well as in that of
 Tunicata, whose branchiae are known to have a similar structure.

 On Sea Sickness, and a New Remedy for its Prevention. By J. Atkinson.

   The writer alluded to the method of curing sea-sickness proposed by M. F. Curie
in the ' Comptes Rendus' of the French Academy of Sciences, September 30th, 1850,

--which consists of drawing in the breath as the vessel descends and exhaling as it

ascends on the billows, being based on the supposition that the complaint arises
from the upward and downward movements of the diaphragm acting on the phrenetic
nerves in an unusual manner. After remarking on various motions, as those pro-
duced by swinging and by riding in a carriage, by which nausea is often induced,
and showing that voluntary operations performed by mechanics and labourers in-
volving the same kind of movements of the diaphragm, &c. do not cause similar
unpleasant results, he proceeded to detail the method which he had found successful

in preventing sea-sickness, as follows :

    " Let a person on ship-board, when the vessel is bounding over the waves, seat
himself, and take hold of a tumbler nearly filled with water or other liquid, and at
the same time make an eflPort to prevent the liquid from running over, by keeping
the mouth of the glass horizontal, or nearly so. When doing this, from the motion
of the vessel, his hand and arm will seem to be drawn into different positions, as if
the glass were attracted by a powerful magnet. Continuing his efforts to keep the
mouth of the glass horizontal, let him allow his hand, arm and body to go through

--the various movements, as those observed in sawing, planing, pumping, throwing
--a quoit, &c. which they will be impelled, without fatigue, almost irresistibly to

perform, and he will find that this has the effect of preventing the giddiness and nausea

 that the rolling and tossing of the vessel have a tendency to produce in inexperienced

voyagers." If the person is suffering from sickness at the commencement of his ex-
periment, as soon as he grasps the glass of liquid in his hand and suffers his arm to
take its course, and go through the movements alluded to, he feels as if he were per-
forming them of his own free-will, and the nausea abates immediately, and very
soon ceases entirely, and does not return so long as he suffers his arm and body to
assume the postures into which they see7n to be drawn. Should he however resist
the free course of his hand, he instantlj' feels a thrill of pain of a peculiarly stunning
kind, shoot through his head, and experiences a sense of dizziness and returning
nausea. From this last circumstance, the author of the paper infers it as probable
that the stomach is primarily affected through the cerebral mass, rather than through
a disturbance of the thoracic and abdominal viscera; and he is of opinion that the
method of preventing sea-sickness just described (which he has found by experience
to be effectual), depends on the curious fact that the invoKintary motion communicated
to the body by the rolling and tossing of the vessel is, by the means he adopts, ap-

parently converted into voluntary motion.

On some Indications of the Molluscous Fauna of the Azores and St. Helena.
                            By Professor E. Forbes, F.R.S.

Great interest attaches to the malacology of the islands of the Atlantic, on account

of its bearing on inquiries into the ancient conformation of land in that region, and

Wethe causes of the distribution of organized beings.                                                                                                              have so few data respecting

the Invertebrata of the Azores and St. Helena, that every fragment of fresh information

becomes of consequence. The author has lately had opportunities of examining a

small collection of land shells gathered in the Azores by Mr. Macgillivray, the inde-

fatigable naturalist, who accompanied tlie surveying voyage of H.JVI.S. Rattlesnake,

and also a small parcel of littoral and sublittoral mollusks collected at St. Michael's

and sent to Mr. MacAndrew. From St. Helena he has recently received a quantity

of the shells cast on the shore, and a few recent and subfossil land shells collected by

Mr. Alexander, a student of King's College.

   Out of eight species of land shells from Fayal in the Azores, one is a new form of
Buliimis, allied to a Madeiran species ; two are Helix pauperctda and Pupa anco-

rostoma, botli Madeiran                                                                                                                                       one  is the Helix harbula of Charpentier, an Asturian  and

GaUician species ; two. Helix pisana and BuUmus ventricosus, are widely distributed

Aspecies, ranging also through the Mediterranean.                                                                                                                  Liltorina is not European; it

is the Littorina striata of Capt. King, a species remarkable for being common to the

AAzores, Madeira, the Cape de Verds, and the Guinea coast.                                                                                                         starfish, sent with

the shells, is the common Uraster spinosa of Europe.
   The shells brought by Mr. Alexander from St. Helena are equally interesting. To

the six land shells already known he adds three, a Siiccinea, a Bulivius, and a Helix,

the last repi'esenting, but very distinct from, the Helix guerincaria of Madeira.

Our knowledge of the marine shells of Madeira has hitherto been entirely due to

Mr. Cuming, who during a brief visit to that island, dredged for a day there in 40
fathoms water, on a soft muddy bottom. The shells he obtained (and of which he

has most liberally communicated his lists) belonged to the genera Cardium, Cytherea,

Mitra, Clavatula, Pleurotoma, Nassa, Scalaria, Eiilima, Pyramidella, Trochus, Del-

phinula, Ttirritella, Nalica, Bulla, and Hyalina. The species have proved, so far as

they have been examined, to be, as they seemed to Mr. Cuming at the time he cap-

tured them, all peculiar.

   To these genera Mr. Alexander adds specimens of Lucina, Donaxi, Hipponyxl,

AcmcBa, Siphonaria, Fissurelta, Genu, Marginella, Cyprcea, Conus, Cassio, Colum-

bella, Cerithium, Fossarus and Rissoa. In the British Museum there is an unnamed

Littorina from St, Helena, closely represented but distinct from ih^ Littorina striata

above alluded to.
                                                                      TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                      77

Several of the above-named shells are too young for determination, others are de-

cidedly new. The known species not peculiar are Cassis testiculus, Cyprcea lurida,

spurca and moneta, Conus equinaceus, var. Kroltii, Marginella mUiacea 1 and iVia-

tica canrena. The Fossarus is not the Senegal shell, but the F. Cumingii. Several

of the above are common to the West Indies and Meditenanean.

The author infers from these facts that the coast-line, of the ancient land of which

the Atlantic islands north of the line are fragments, had a ti-end indicated by the

distribution of the Littor'ma striata, and that the ancient connexion of the Azores

with the Lusitanian land on the one hand and Madeira on the other, as previously

maintained by him, is supported strongly by these additional data. On the other

band, the facts concerning St. Helena indicate, as the indigenous vegetation of that

island had previously done, that it had been insulated from a very ancient period, and

had never been connected v,'ith the continent. At the same time the marine mol-

lusks would seem to point to the submergence of a tract of land probably linking

Africa with South America, before the elevation of St. Helena. Along the sea-coast

of such a tract of land, the creatures common to the West Indian and Senegal seas

might have been diffused.                                             _^____

  On a New Testacean discovered during the Voyage of H.M.S. Rattlesnake.
                             By Professor E. Fokbes, F.R.S.

   Among the collections made by Mr. Macgillivray is a new genus of Gasteropodous

Mollusks, floaters in the manner of lanthina, but having close affinities of shell,
animal, and operculum with Jeffreysia. It appears to thi-ow new light on the nature
of Macluria and the so-called Palaeozoic Littorinse. Prof. Forbes proposes to name

this curious shell Macgillivraya.

     On a Sample of Blood containing Fat. By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D.

   The author detailed an examination of a sample of serum, which was quite white
and opake from floating globules of a substance that was found to consist of a cry-
Btalliue matter, apparently cholesterin, mixed with a much larger amount of non-
crystallizable fat, readily saponified when boiled with alkaU. The sample was given
to Mr. Wrench, who exhausted 2 oz. 40 minims of the liquid by means of Eether, and
obtained from it 3*96 grs. of fat. The amount of fatty matter in the blood itself must
of course have been larger, since that portion which had become entangled in the
coagulated clot was not estimated.

  The blood was taken from a patient suffering from symptoms of apoplexy. He

recovered. The author could not find any account of fatty blood having been

observed in this disease.

                   Observations on the Genus Sagitta.

By Thomas H. Huxley, F.R.S., Assistant- Surgeon B.N.

   Mr. Huxley made some observations upon the structure of the anomalous genus
Sagitta, which has already been more than once a subject of discussion at the Meet-
ings of the British Association. Mr. Huxley's statements essentially confirmed those
of M. Krohn ; the existence of a ciliated canal or oviduct in the outer part of the
ovary being the only new fact of any importance brought forward. The very wide
geographical distribution of Sagitta was alluded to, the animal having been found in
all the seas through which H.M.S. Rattlesnake passed in her circumnavigatory

voyage.

In discussing the zoological relations of Sagitta, Mr. Huxley's remarks were to the

following effect: Sagitta has been placed by some naturalists among the Mollusca

a view based upon certain apparent resemblances with the Heteropoda. These how-

ever are superficial ; the buccal armature of Sagitta, for instance, is a widely difl!erent

structure from the tongue of Firola, to which, when exserted, it may have a distant

resemblance                                                           the distinct striation of the muscular fibre, and  the nature of the ner-
                                                                   ;

vous system, equally separate Sagitta from the Mollusca.

   There appears to be much more reason for placing this creature, as Krohn, Grube
and others have already done, upon the annulose side of the animal kingdom, but it

is very difficult to say in what division of that subkingdom it may most naturally be
--78 REPORT 1851.

--arranged. At first siglit it seems to present equally strong affinities with four

principal groups, viz. 1. tlie Nematoid worms; 2. the Annelida; 3. the Lernaean
Crustacea; and 1. the Arachnida.

   1. With the Nematoid worms it is allied hy its general shape and hahit, its want
of distinct annulation, and remotely, by the armature of the mouth. But on the
other hand, it differs widely from them in the nervous system, the sexual system, and
the nature of the muscular tissue.

   2. Sayittci has no small resemblance to certain Naiadae, in which when young the
anterior hook-like feet are directed forwards parallel to the mouth. It differs from
them in the nature of its nervous system, which exhibits a concentration quite foreign
to the annelid type, in the nature of the muscular tissue, and in the total absence of
any water vascular system.

   3. and 4. The real affinities of Sagitla are probably with one or other of these great
divisions. The structure of the nervous and muscular system speaks strongly for
this view, and the nature of the sexual system is not opposed to it, inasmuch as we
have hermaphrodism among both the lowest Crustacea (Cirrhipedia) and the lowest
Arachnida (Tardigrada).

   The study of development can alone decide to which of these divisions Sagitta
belongs; but until such study shall have demonstrated the contrary, Mr. Huxley
stated his belief that Sagitta bears the same relation to the Tardigrada and Acaridae,
that Linguatula (as has been shown by Van Beneden) bears to the gewws Jnchorella,
and that the young Sagitta will therefore very possibly be found to resemble one of
the Tardigrada, the rudimentary feet with their hooks being subsequently thrown up

to the region of the head, as they are in Linguatula.

   An Account of Researches into the Anatomy of the Hydrostatic Acalephee.
            By Thomas H. Huxley, F.R.S., Assistant Surgeon R.N.

   The observations upon which this communication is based were made during the
circumnavigatory voyage of H.M.S. Rattlesnake, but for the most part in the seas
which border the coasts of North-eastern Australia, New Guinea, and the Louisiade

archipelago.

   With the exception of the mere external form, but very little has been known
hitherto with regard to either the Diphydse or the Physophoridae, the two families of
which the ' Hydrostatic Acalephae' of Cuvier consist, altlio\igh they are some of the
most abundant of pelagic creatures. Indeed, hardly any one can have made a voyage
to the East Indies or Australia without being struck with the immense shoals of the
Phgsalia and Velella, through which the ship sometimes s ils for days together.

    The chief mass of one of the Diphydae is formed by two transparent crystalline
pieces, which look, when taken out of the water, like morsels of cut glass. One or
both of these pieces contains a wide cavity, lined by a muscular membrane, by the
contraction of which the animal is propelled through the water. The attachment of
the posterior piece to the anterior is very slight, and when detached it will swim about
independently for hours together. It was this circumstance which led Cuvier to
 consider the two pieces as two distinct animals.

     In the Monogastric Diphydse a single polype is developed in a special cavity of the
 anterior piece. In the Polygastric DiphydiB, a long chain of such polypes, each en-
 veloped in a little transparent " bract," occupies a similar position. These polypes
 have no oral tentacles, but a long thread-like tentacle, bearing lateral branches, which
 are terminated by small sacs, is developed from the base of every polype. . The small
 " prehensile" sac has a vei-y peculiar form, but is, morphologically, only a dilatation

 of its pedicle, one wall of which is much thickened, and contains a great number of
 such urticating organs or "thread-cells" as are found among the Medusae. The re-
 productive organs are medusiform bodies which are developed by gemmation from the

 pedicle of the polype.

    The central sac of the medusiform body, instead of becoming a stomach, developes
 the spermatozoa or ova within its walls. These are generally shed forth while the
 organ is still attached, but in one genus they swim about independently, and might
 readily be mistaken for Medusae.

    In the Polygastric Diphydsae new polypes are continually being produced by gem-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  79

mation at the attached extremity of the polype chain, and in both polygastric and
monogastric fornif!, the same gemmation is continually going on among the prehensile
and reproductive organs. The gemmae, whether they are eventually to become
polypes, prehensile organs, or reproductive organs, are invariably at first simple,
double-walled processes, containing a cavity continuous with that of the common
stem of the animal, which is itself a double-walled tube. The Diphydse, whether

polygastric or monogastric, are invariably dioecious.

   The genus Rosacea, among the Polygastric Diphydae, is remarkable in possessing

-- --only the anterior piece, which is gelatinous and hemispherical, like the umbrel of a

Medusa. If a peculiar dilatation the float were formed at the extremity of the
polype-chain of a Diphyes, we should have one of the Physophoridse.

   The genera. Rhizopkysa, Physalia, Athoryhia, Physophora, Stephanomia, Agalma,
Porpiia, and Velella, were described and their structure illustrated by diagrams,

without which the details would be unintelligible. Suffice it to say, that their forms,

however varied, are shown to be simple modifications of a common type, in the main

identical with that of the Diphydae. Thus, such a polype-chain as that of Rosacea,
if it developed a float, would be a Rhizopkysa. The Physalia is a Rhizopkysa with
its float disproportionately enlarged ; the Physophora, a Rhizopkysa which has de-

veloped lateral natatorial organs like those of a Diphyes. Again, the Velella may

be considered as a Physalia flattened out and having its air-sac divided and subdivided
by partitions, until it becomes a firm, resisting, internal shell.

   The same continual multiplication of parts by gemmation goes on among the Phy-
sophoridae as among the Diphydae ; and the structure and mode of development of
the young organs is essentially the same. Great variety is presented by the repro-
ductive organs, from the form of mere sacs to that of free swimming bodies, precisely
resembling Medusas, and developing the generative elements only subsequently to
their liberation. In Physalia, the female organs are free-swimming medusiform bo-
dies, while the male organs are simple pyriform sacs, which remain attached and

develope their spermatozoa ?"Ф situ. In the language of the " alternation theory," the
Physalia itself and the medusiform body would be two generations, and we should
be presented with the unexampled peculiarity of a male giving birth to a female.

    As a general conclusion, it may be stated that the Diphydae and Physophoridae are
essentially composed of two membranes, an outer and an inner, which the author

calls " foundation-membranes," since every organ is formed by the modelling into
shape of one or other, or both of these, commencing as a simple process or diverti-
culum, and assuming its perfect form by a gradual differentiation. The stomach has
no wails distinct from those of the general parietes. The reproductive organs are

always developed externally, and the thread-cell is found in all in the greatest abun-
dance. The author lays particular stress on the bearing of the latter fact upon clas-
sification, and shows that the same organ is met with in equal abundance only in the
Hydroid and Sertularian Polypes, the Medusids, Beroidee, and .'V.nthozoic Polypes.

A similar organ has indeed been also found in an Echinoderm, in certain Trematoda,

and perhaps, although the author is inclined to think that its presence in this case is

accidental, in Eolis ; but in none does it assume such a prominent place as in the

families mentioned.

    The author endeavours to show that this fact, combined with the radiate polype
form, and the composition of the body of two distinct membranes, forms a very good
positive character for a group embracing the Hydroid and Anthozoic Polypes, and

 the Acalephae ; a group equal in importance to any one of the primary subdivisions of
the animal kingdom. The name of Nematophora, "thread-bearers," is proposed for
 this group, in allusion to the characteristic diffusion of the " thread-c.eW." But this
 group must be subdivided into two equivalent sub-classes. In the Hydroid Polypes,

 the Diphydas, Physophoridae, and Medusidae, the stomach is not distinct from the
 common parietes, and the reproductive organs are external. In the Anthozoic
 Polypes and Beroidae, the stomach is distinct from the common parietes, and the re-
 productive organs are internal. Some years ago Mr. W. S. MacLeay, when consulted
 by the author, suggested the name of CEcioa (those which have their eggs under

 Nowcover, " housed") for the latter division, and that of Anoecioa for the former.

 a mutual representation runs through these two groups. For instance, the Actinidse
 represent the Hydra and its allies ; the Zoanthidae represent the Corynidae ; the Phy-
 sophoridas seem to represent the Pennatulidae ; and the Medusidae, the Beroidae.
80 REPORT 1851.

Fuvtliermore, each group returns into itself; the fi'ee floating Actiniae nearly ap-
proximate Berbe, and Lttccrnaria is but a fixed Medusa.

    Should these considerations eventually prove to be well-founded, the author con-
siders that it will be necessary to break up the class Radiata of Cuvier into four
groups, severally capable of being defined by positive characters. ' Supposing the
Neniatophora to form a sort of central group, we have on the one hand the Ascidians
and the Bryozoa, leading to the Mollusca; on the other the Echiuoderms and Entozoa
(in the widest sense), leading to the Annulosa ; whilst the Polygastria, Sponges, and
Gregarinidte (if indeed they are not rather to be considered only as the lowest forms

of the other three groups) conduct us towards the lowest plants. These relations may

--be thus represented :

Description of a New Form of Sponge-like Animal. By T. H. Huxley, F.R.S.

   The author described a gelatinous substance found in almost all seas, in masses
varying in size from that of a pea to that of a walnut. This mass is an animal of
extreme simplicity, analogous to the Palmellag in the vegetable kingdom, and con*
sisting of a number of simple cells united by a gelatinous connecting matter, con-

taining siliceous spicula.

   The author pointed out the importance of this creature as connecting the Spongice
Gregarinidce and Polythalamata.

Seeing no calcareous zoophytes in the museum at Ipswich, and having found 15

or 16 species at that place, some from the Orwell, others from Harwich, the author

mentioned them to induce some one to collect and supply the defects in the museum.

Some of the specimens found are the most beautiful of the British Lepralias, one new
to the British list, found also by him in Cornwall and Scotland ; he also produced one
new to the Britisli list from Cornwall, identical with a Lepralia on a Pinna from the

Mediterranean.

   He also called attention to the scooping of pits in shells and stones by Lipralia and

other calcareous zoophytes, and exhibited several specimens of shells and a stone which
had been scooped by one of the most delicate of them, Hippothoa divaricata, which it
had equally scooped with those of larger size. Some of the shells had not only the
pits, but the cells of Lepralia as well.

      Observations on the Geographical Distribution of the Land Mollusca.
                                  By LovELL Reeve, F.L.S.

    This paper consisted of a few additional observations on the geographical distri-
bution over the globe of a tribe of snails, recently published by Mr. Reeve in the
'Annals and Magazine of Natural History.' It was doubted at the time whether a
system of typical arrangement could be formed upon the consideration of a single

--genus, whether an examination of all the genera of land mollusca was not essen-

tial. It being a work of considerable labour to collect the data for this inquiry,
the author submitted a preliminary outline of his views from a consideration of 500

Bulimi only. He was now working upon the genus Helix, andfound the results to be
perfectly similar. The inquiry was founded on a considei-ation of the shell, not on ac-

 count of the difficulty of procuring observations on the animal, but because it offered
a readier and more varied set of characters. The animal differs immaterially in form
and generic character from any of the genera of land mollusca, but the shell varies ac-
cording to the physical conditions by which it is surrounded. The groups of forms

appear to be so many expressions of the calcifying organ of one and the same mollusk,
depending on the laws and circumstances of organic distribution. On comparing his
map of the distribution of land mollusca with that of the marine mollusca by Professor
E. Forbes, Mr. Reeve pointed out many points of resemblance where the areas of sea

 distribution of types corresponded with those on the adjacent land.

                      Observations on Pholas. By J. Robertson.

On the Structure of the Branchice and Mechanism of Breathing in the Pholades
     and other LamelUbranchiate Mollusks, By Thomas Williams, M.D.

    The researches of the author, which were illustrated by numerous diagrams, had
led him to the following conclusions :

     1. That the blood in all lamellibranchiate mollusca is richly corpusculated.
    2. That the branchiae in all species are composed of straight parallel vessels
 returning upon themselves.
     3. That the heart is systemic, and not branchial.
     4. That the parallel vessels of the gills are provided with vibratile cilia disposed in
 linear series on either side of the branchial vessel, causing currents, which set in the
 direction of the ciu-rent of the blood in the vessels.
     5. That in Pholas the siphons are richly lined with vibratile cilia as well as the

 branchiae.

     6. That the branchial siphon acts in drawing in water into the chamber of the
 mantle by the diastole of the valves of the shell.

     That a part of the water which is thus drawn into the branchial chamber, is swal-
 lowed and eventually rejected by the faecal orifice, and that the rest is expelled by
 the orifice in the mantle, the foot, and in part by the branchial orifice.

     That this respiratory fluid is surcharged with carbonic acid and fluid secretions
 contained in the mucus furnished by the interior of the mantle.

     That this current, escaping with force against the walls of the cell in which the
 animal lives, acts as a solvent upon the particles disintegrated by the action of the
 valves ; that therefore the boring of the Pholades can only be explained on the prin-
 ciple that a chemical as well as a mechanical agency is at work.

      On the Correlation of Vitality and Mind loith the Physical Forces.
                      By Richard Fowler, M.D., F.R.S.

   The author began his paper with some observations of what constitutes force. Our
notions of it, he thinks, are acquired very early, from feelings of resistance to our
will ; for all forces are measured by the resistance they can overcome, i. e. the force

they can antagonize. When boys of apparently equal strength and equal courage
are seen to wrestle, we are impressed with a belief that he who fairly throws the
other has the most powerful muscular (vital) force ; but when we see that a spirited

boy of comparatively weaker muscular force cows and throws a larger boy of more
muscular strength, we then infer that mind was the force in the boy who more than
antagonized the vital force of the other. " What," asked Suwarrow, " is the strength
of an army ? " " The stomach ! " was the answer of his experience ; and the stomach,
the source of vital strength, is furnished with its materials by the physical forces
of motion, heat, and chemical affinities. Here then we have correlations of mind
with the vitality of its coil, and of vitality with the physical forces. Mind and

--vitality have these analogies with the physical forces: 1st, That all act through the

media of coils ; 2nd, that the manifestation of the force is directly as the fitness of the
coil, and that wherever an appropriate coil is presented, there the force will be ap-
parent to our senses. The chronometer as the measurer of time by space, the voltaic
trough and the coil of GErsted, and the heat and light from the spontaneous union of

hydrogen and oxygen in spongy platina, are satisfactory instances.
   The cretin affords an analogous instance with respect to the vital and mental forces.

Born with a corporeal coil fitted for both, their manifestation gradually becomes
obscure as the body is diseased ; but when again restored by the invigorating air,
exercise, food, and social converse of a mountain home, the forces of mind and vitality
reappear: here, is it not mind which devised the reparation of the mortal coil in the
case of the cretin, and which has devised the coils which vitality has materialized

for all the physical forces? Had then minds of the highest order been with-
held, the physical forces had wanted the coils by which they are now rendered so

effective; and if the physical forces had remained latent, the seed of plants and ova

--of animals could not have become coils fitted for the activity of vitality and mind.
    Correlation of the Organs of Sense. That these might be indifferently the antecedent
or sequent of each other's functions in effecting sensations or conceptions, occurred
to the author while in the year 1792 he was preparing a paper on Belief, which he
read to the Speculative Society of Edinburgh (see the History of the Society lately
published). It is the law of our organs of sense that a sensation or conception in any
one should excite a re-transmission to the adjusting muscles of all the other organs.

The most palpable instance of an analogous re-transmission from one nerve to many

muscles is from the nasal branch of the fifth pair in the act of sneezing.

   Doubts have been expressed whether these forces may not be really distinct and
independent forces, rather than modifications of one force, as conjectured by Mr.
Grove. There are however several analogies in support of Mr. Grove's hypothesis.
By the modification eftected by glands differently constructed, secretion of varied
qualities are produced from the blood ; different fruits from the same sap, modified
by grafts ; one thought may be modified as in words that are synonymous, and both
the thought and instinct of man or the lower animals are modified by their structure,
" Many administrations, but the same spirit." As therefore the force is more or less

 effective in ratio of its coil, and as coils for thinking or acting, in science, in arts,

 and in the ordinary business of life, are formed by the adjusting muscles of the sen-

 tient and voluntary functions of the body, is it not the business of education to

drill the coils, by which alone elevation and efficiency can be given to the force

 of mind ?

A Summary of Recent Nilotic Discovery. By C. T. Beke, Ph.D., F.R. G. S.*

     After briefly recapitulating his views witii regard to the physical character of the
table-land of Eastern Africa, the position of the sources of the Nile in the Mountains
of the Moon, and the course of the direct stream of that river and of its several
tributaries, namely, the Bahr-el-Ghazal or Keilak, the Sobat orGodjeb, the Bahr-el-
Azrek or Astapus, and the Atbara or Astaboras, Dr. Beke adverted to the explorations
of the Rev. Dr. Krapf and Mr. Rebniann in Eastern Africa, to their discovery of the

Snowy Mountains Kilimandjaro and Kenia, and to the information obtained by
them respecting the great lake in the country of Uniamezi, or Mono-Moezi. He

then gave an account of Dr. Knoblecher's recent ascent of the Tubiri, as the direct
stream of the Nile is called, as far as 4░ IJ' N. lat., where he ascertained that that
river comes from a considerable distance further south, and apparently from beyond
the equator.

   The distance from the extreme point reached by Dr. Knoblecher to Mount Kenia
is 370 geographical miles, and to the lake in Uniamezi it is 360 miles ; and the basin

of the Nile is apparently confined within these limits, unless indeed the river should
be found to flow out of the lake itself. Kenia is not improbably the " high mountain,
the top of which is quite white," which was described to Baron von Miiller as con-
taining the source of the Bahr-el-Abyad.

    These results are in general accordance with the statements of Ptolemy respecting
the sources of the Nile in the Mountains of the Moon, as elucidated and explained

--by Dr. Beke on former occasions f.

   Addition by the Author. On a subsequent journey far into the interior. Dr. Krapf

was informed that at the foot of the snowy mountain Ndurkenia, or Kirenia, is a lake,

--from which (or its vicinity) flow three rivers the Dana, the Tumbiri, and the Nsa-

raddi; the first two of which fall into the Indian Ocean, being the upper courses of
the Ozi and the Adi or Sabaki respectively, while the third flows northwards towards
a still larger lake, called Baringo, being in Dr. Krapf s estimation identical with the
Bahr-el-Abyad or White River.

   This information tends yet further to confirm Dr. Beke's conclusions. And if it

be only supposed that Dr. Krapf has inadvertently transposed the two names, Tumbiri
and Nsaraddi, so that it is, in reality, the former which flows northwards and leaves
the Nile, while it is the latter which falls into the Indian Ocean ; then that traveller's
Tumbiri will correspond with the Tubiri of M. Werve and Dr. Knoblecher, and his

--Nsav-a(frfi with the Adi or Sabaki a double coincidence rendering the matter little

less than certain.-- See AthencBum of February 14, 1853, No. 1268, p. 198.

continued. On the morning of the 19th occurred a dreadful shock, of which the

Spanish MS. from which I extract this says, ' the movements were now more rapid,

and in the twenty-four hours there were more than 200 shocks. The heavens were

darkened with clouds of eruptive matter, flashes of lightning were seen, and then

there descended mucii white ashes like a fall of snow, which covered the country

around.' On the 28th of the same month happened the most dreadful shock of

all. The town of Quinistacas, four or five miles distant from the volcano with

100 inhabitants, was buried ; the town of Ornate also perished; also many villages

in the viciuity were ruined j indeed, the whole country was desolated, and ashes

fell more than ninety miles distant from the volcano. The first earthquake I

experienced was in 1825 and at Chile. There was a shaking of the ground,

some houses and walls fell down, and the water in the (arequias or) water-

courses splashed over. I was also in that of 1829, being in Santiago. The com-

motion commenced on Saturday the 26th of September at twenty minutes past

2 P.M. The principal undulations appeared to come from the south-east. The

great shock was 1^ minute duration. Half an hour afterwards there was a shower

of rain, and'ano^er slight shower at half-past 4 p.m. The weather, however,

before the earthquake was rather inclined for rain. During the night of the 26th

there were slight shocks ; also some on the following days, Sunday and Monday.

On Friday the 1st of October, at half-past 12, there was another shock, as well as

at half-past 1. I went out into the street and found the inhabitants looking at two

volcanoes that had broken out, one in the Dehsa, behind the first range of the Cor-

dillera; the other in the mountains of Maipu (which last was observed to be in acti-

vity just after the earthquake of the 26th), the smoke rising majestically. In Peru I
have felt many, but not very heavy ones. In the province of Tarapaca, lat. 20░

south, I have noticed them as occurring two or three times a month, sometimes

accompanied by a slight rumbling noise which appeared to be subterraneous. But

on one occasion, being in the silver mines of Guantajaya, a few miles east of the

port of Iquique in the province of Tarapaca (these mines are from 2000 to 3000 feet

above the sea), at about 100 yards perpendicular depth in the mine a slight rumbling

noise was heard, as if coming from the Andes, which increased and then passed

onwards to the west ; the noise was immediately followed by a horizontal undulatory

movement, then a vertical, then a mixture of these, or a shake, and then all was quiet,

save a commotion occasioned by some of the loose stones of the mine rolling down-

Mywards.  impression then was, and still continues, that earthquakes in the region

under discussion (Peru and Chili) originate from volcanic causes. A great part of the

Andes is volcanic ; Chile abounds in active and quiescent volcanoes ; and in the

--province of Tarapaca there are the volcano of Isluga, with its five craters, the

Volcancitos or water volcanoes of Puchuttisa, doubtless many quiescent ones,-- on

its northern boundary the volcanic group of Gualtieri, and on its southern the vol-

canoes of Laguna, Olea, &c."

      071 the Negro Races of the Indian Archipelago and Pacific Islands.

                       By W. John Crawfurd, F.R.S.

   Oriental negroes are found thinly but widely scattered from the Andaman islands
in about 80░ of E. longitude, to the New Hebrides in the Pacific, in about 175░ E.
longitude; and from the Philippine islands in 18░ N. latitude, to New Caledonia in
about 21░ S. latitude. These eastern negroes are known to Europeans under various
names. The Malays term the inhabitants of New Guinea Papua, or more correctly

Pua-pua. Europeans, taking this as an authority, call New Guinea and its inha-

bitants both Papua.

   The word pua-pun is an adjective and signifies crisp, frizzled, woolly. To com-

plete the sense for the country or people, it is necessary to state the nouns-substan-

=tive, tona/j country, and oz'aw= people. Thus oran pua-pua := a woolly-headed

man ; and tanah oran ])ua-puaz= the land of woolly-headed men.
    European writers have also sometimes termed them Alfores; which word has

been converted by English and French writers into Arafura and Harafura, and
referred to a Malay source. It is not, however, Malay, because the letter F is not

to be found in any written language of the Indian archipelago, and seldom does the
sound occur in any of the unwritten ones. The word is Portuguese, and means
                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                     87

freedman, in which sense it is adopted by the natives of the country. It is nearly

equivalent to the Indios bravos of the Spaniards, as they term the free unsubjugated

Indians of Spanish America.

   Spanish writers term the negroes of the Philippine islands, from their diminutive

size, Negritos, or little negroes. Some English writers have lately termed them

Austral negroes, which is manifestly improper, since they are found equally in the

northern as in the southern hemisphere ; and this even in the islands of the Indian

archipelago.

The oriental negro is ever found in a state of civilization below that of the brown-

complexioned and lank-haired race in their neighbourhood, whether these be Malayan

or Polynesian. There is great diversity in their civilization ; some, with the least
possible knowledge of the commonest arts of life, live precariously on the spon-

taneous produce of their forests and waters, both animal and vegetable; while

others practise a rude husbandry, construct boats, and undertake coasting voyages

for the fishing of the tortoise and tripang or holothurion.

The negro of the Andaman islands is below five feet in stature, and is of the lowest

civilization. The negro of the northern portion of the Malay peninsula is also of

Ashort stature.  full-grown male of average height was found to measure only four

feet nine inches. The negro of the Philippine islands, found chiefly on the large

island of Lucon, is also diminutive. They dwell in the mountains, generally maintain

their independence, and live in constant warfare with the Malays.

   There are no negroes in Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Celebez, nor is there any

record or tradition of any. The great island of New Guinea is almost wholly peopled

by negroes, who differ from each other, and more so from those distinct races
described as existing in the Andaman islands, in the northern parts of the Malay

peninsula and in Lucon.

   M. Modera, an officer of the Dutch navy, has described two negro tribes which

--exist on the west coast of New Guinea. After describing one of these tribes, he

says, " In the afternoon of the same day, at the time of high water, three of the

naturalists went in a boat well-armed to the same spot, where they found the trees
full of natives of both sexes, who sprang from branch to branch with their weapons

on their backs, like monkeys, making similar gestui-es and screaming and laughing

as in the morning. And no offers of presents could induce them to descend from the

ti'ees to renew the intercourse*."

  The most singular physical character of the negro of New Guinea consists in the

texture of the hair of the head. It is neither that of the negro of Africa, nor

seemingly that of the oriental negro north of the equator. Mr. Earl, who has seen

--most of the negro tribes of New Guinea, and who best describes them, gives the

following account of it : " The most striking peculiarity of the oriental negro," says

he, " consists in their frizzled or woolly hair. This, however, does not spread over the

surface of the head, as is usual with the negroes of western Africa, but grows in

small tufts, the hairs which form each tuft keeping separate from the rest, and

twisting round each other, until, if allowed to grow, they form a spiral ringlet.

Many of the tribes, especially those which occupy the interior parts of islands whose
coasts are occupied bymore civilized races, from whom cutting instruments can beob-
tained, keep the hair closely cropped. The tufts then assume the form of little knobs

about the size of a large pea, giving the head a very singular appearance, which has not

inaptly been compared to that of an old worn-out shoe-brush. Others, again, more

especially the natives of the south coast of New Guinea and the islands of Torres

Straits, troubled with such an obstinate description of hair, yet admiring the ringlets
as a head-dress, cut them off, and twist them into matted skull-caps, thus forming

very compact wigs. But it is among the natives of the north coast of New Guinea

and of some of the adjacent islands of the Pacific that the hair receives the greatest

attention. These open out the ringlets by means of a bamboo comb shaped like an

eel-spear, with numerous prongs spreading out laterally, which operation produces

an enormous bushy head of hair, which has procured them the name of mop-headed

Indians."

There are fifteen different varieties of oriental negroes, of eleven of which we have

--88 REPORT 1851.

good descriptions. Some of them are feeble dwarfs under five feet, and others are
powerful men. To include the whole under one category is surely contrary to truth
 and nature.

     As far as language can be considered a test of race, and as the present state of our
 knowledge on the subject will enable us to judge, it goes to prove that all the races
 of whose languages we possess examples, are separate and distinct from each other.
 I have compared the words of nine negro languages. Three of these consist of the

few words of Mallicolo, Tanna and New Caledonia, given by Foster in his Obser-

 vations on Cook's second voyage, and six of 55 words of the Saman of the Malay

peninsula from my own collection, and of those of the Gebe, Waigyu, New Guinea,
New Ireland and Vanikoro, the scene of the wreck of La Perouse, from that of M.

 Gaimard.

    An examination of these comparative vocabularies corrects one error of very

 general acceptance, that the negro languages contain no Malay words, for each of
 the nine contains Malay words. The proportion of Malay words is considerable in
 the languages of those tribes which are nearest to the Malays, and therefore most
 amenable to Malayan influence, and diminishes in proportion to distance or other
 difficulty of communication. Excluding the numerals, which in most cases are
Malayan, the proportion in 100 words of the Saman is 12; in the Gebe about 8; in

the Waigyu above 5; in the Doree Harbour of New Guinea near 4; in the Port
Carteret of New Ireland 6; and in the Vanikoro little more than 3. The greater

number of Malayan words in all these negro languages consist of nouns or names of
physical objects, and none of them can be said to be essential to the grammatical
structure. They are, in fact, substantially extrinsic.

   A comparison of the native words of the negro languages themselves shows that
they agree in a very small number of cases, where the tribes speaking them are in
the vicinity of each other. Thus several words are substantially the same in the
Waigyu and in the New Guinea. This is, however, the exception, and the rule is a
total disagreement. Thus between the language of the negroes of the peninsula of
New Guinea and of New Ireland there is not one word alike. There is no evidence

therefore to justify the conclusion that the oriental negro, wherever found, is of one
and the same race.

On the Ethnological Position of the Brdhui, and on the Languages of the

         Paropamisus. By 'R.G. Latham, M.D., F.R.S.

Both these papers were thrown into one, as the question bore upon the ethnology

of India. The Brahui are a peculiar people, with a peculiar language, in Biiuchistan,
Mekran, and part of Scinde. It had been suggested by Lassen that their tongue
had affinitie? with the southern (Tamulian) tongues of India. This, by new facts, is
placed beyond doubt. If so, the displacement by which they are now isolated is
remarkable. Reasons were given for considering the Brahui as an old and aboriginal

population of the parts they now occupy rather than recent settlers.
   The Paropamisan languages are those of Wokhan and Shagnan, on the head-
                                                                     Indus                   those of the

near the Cabul-river. To these may be added the Baraki, the Dir and the Tirhai,
whose locality was once as f\ir south as the middle of Afghanistan. The great dis-
placements involved in the present confined limits of these populations were enlarged

on. Their language was transitional to the monosyllabic tongues and Persian.

the Rajah of Sarawak, " On the Geography of the Northern Portion of Borneo,"
He pointed out the present state of our acquaintance with the geography of this

great island, as derived from the researches of British travellers and surveyors, and

as published in the recent map compiled by M. Petermann. He described the
communication of the Rajah as important, in making known the ascent, by Mr. Low,

of the lofty mountain of Kira Balav (near 14,000 feet above the sea), situated in
the north-eastern district, and the intention of Mr. St. John to proceed up the
Barram river between Sarawak and Labuan, and to visit the populous country
of the Kayans and perhaps that of the Ruineah-- a people unknown to our geo-
graphy, but numerous and hospitable, and speaking a language distinct from the

Kayans or Dyaks.

Ethnological Researches in Santo Domingo. By Sir R. Schomburgk*.

  --The following are extracts from tlie letter of the 15th of March 1851, addressed

bv Sir R. Schomburgk to Prince Albert. "it is a melancholy fact, that of the millions
of natives who at the discovery peopled the island of Santo Domingo, not a single

pure descendant now exists ; but a careful observer of the mixed races that in a great

measure form the population of the Dominican republic will occasionally trace
among them the characteristic features of the aborigines. Some stocks of the

human race retain their characteristics much more tenaciously than others ; the

peculiarities of one being lost in a few generations, and those of another being

transmitted through several. I have never- seen that tenacity more displayed than

among the mixed race who to this day are called 'Indios' in Santo Domingo, and

in whom the peculiarities of the pure Indian have preserved themselves for more than

two centuries. This observation refers chiefly to the female sex of the so-called

' Indios.' Their symmetrical forms, the piue olive complexion and soft skin, their

large black eyes, and the most luxuriant hair of an ebony colour, attest at once

Wetheir descent from the Indian stock.  are told by the historians that the last

remnant of the Indians, amounting to from three to four hundred, retired under

Enrique, the last of the Caciques of St. Domingo, to Boya, a village about thirty miles

to the N.N.E. of the city. Enrique had been converted to the Christian religion,

and the Emperor Charles the Fifth ensured to this remnant of the aborigines civil

rights and conferred upon him the title of Don. Tliis miserable fragment of a once
powerful nation soon vanished from the earth, borne down by their misfortunes and

the diseases introduced by the Spaniards. The extirpation of the pure Indian race

prevented me from making comparative inquiries between the still existing tribes of
Guiana and those that once inhabited St. Domingo. My researches were therefore

restricted to what history and the few and poor monuments have transmitted to us

of their customs and manners. Their language lives only in the names of places,
rivers, trees, and fruits, but all combine in declaring that the people who bestowed

these names were identical with the Carib and Arawaak tribes of Guiana.

" An excursion to the calcareous caverns of Ponmiier, about ten leagues to the west

of the city of Santo Domingo, afforded me the examination of some picture-writings

executed by the Indians after the arrival of the Spaniards. These remarkable caves,

which are already in themselves of high interest, are situated within the district

over which, at the landing of the Spaniards, the fair Indian Catalina reigned as

Cacique. Oviedo relates that she knew how to captivate the Arragonin, Miguel Diaz.
In consequence of a brawl with one of his companions, whom he supposed ihat he

had mortally wounded, Diaz fled from Isabella and found an asylum at Catalina's

village. Fearful of losing her lover, who after a few months seemed to long to

return to his companions and his accustomed occupations, Catalina employed the

most powerful means she could have resorted to in order to induce the Spaniards to

settle within her own territory, concluding naturally that this would ensure the con-

tinued presence of Diaz, She related, therefore, that the adjacent mountains pos-

sessed rich mines, and drew his attention to the superior fertility of the soil, which

so much surpassed that upon which Columbus had founded Isabella; moreover that

the river Ozama afforded at its entrance a secure and fine harbour. Diaz returned
with this information to Isabella, where he found to his joy the man recovered from

his wounds whom he thought he had killed, and the report of the rich mines produced
him an easy pardon. The Adelantado, Bartholomew, who governed in the absence

of his brother, visited the district himself, and erected, in 1496, a fortified tower in

the neighbourhood of the mines, which he called San Cristobal ; but the workmen
who built it, finding the precious metal even in the stones they used for its con-
struction, named it the ' Golden Tower.' The mines were soon exhausted, and
the country assumed again the aspect of exuberant nature. When, therefore, the

covetousness and cupidity of the Spaniards sacrificed the lives of millions of Indians

to their idol, Gold, the caverns which previously had only been used for their wor-
ship became now a retreat from the Spanish crossbows, and the frightful bloodhound
sent in pursuit of the poor Indian. * * I was greatly interested in a number of sym-
bolic pictures which the Indians had traced with charcoal on the white and smooth
walls of one of the smaller caves, which bears at present the name of the ' Painted
Chamber.' Peter Martyr of Angleria, the contemporary of Columbus, and one of

the earliest historians of his discoveries, relates, in his first decade of the ' Ocean,'

that the aborigines of Santo Domingo held caves in great veneration, for out of them,

--they say, came the sun and moon to give light to the world, and mankind likewise

issued from two caves of unequal height according to the size of their statures. In
the general uncertainty which prevails with regard to these monuments of by-gone

races, it was particularly gratifying to find these sculptures, which aflbrded a clue to
the period when they were executed. * * Near the entrance of a second cave, close
to the former, I observed some carvings in the rock. The character of these figures,
and their being cut in the hard substance of stone, prove an origin of a more
remote date than those in the other cave. * * Baron Humboldt observes, when
alluding to the carvings he met on the banks of the Orinoco, that ' it must not be

forgotten that nations of very different descent' when in a similar uncivilized state,

having the same disposition to simplify and generalize outlines, and being impelled
by inherent mental dispositions to form rhythmical repetitions and series, may be led
to produce similar signs and symbols.' Baron Humboldt had only opportunity to

view the carved figures on the banks of the Orinoco, but the examination of a great

number of these symbols shows to me that there is a great difference in their cha-
racter and execution; nor is it my opinion that the idols worked in stone and the

carvings on the rocks were executed by the races that inhabited South America and
the West Indies at the time of their discovery. They belong to a remoter period,
and prove much more skill and patience than the simple figures painted with char-
coal on the walls of the cave near Pommier. The figures carved of stone and worked
 without iron tools, denote, if not civilization, a quick conception, and an inexhaustible
patience to give to these hard substances the desired forms, * * With respect to the
 age or epoch when the figures sculptured of stone were executed there is no tradition.
 It is remarkable that they are only found where we have sure evidence that the
 Caribs inhabited or visited the place. I have no reason to believe that they were
 made by the Caribs, which opinion I am the more inclined to adopt on comparing
 them with the tools and utensils executed by the still existing tribes I met in Guiana.
 There are, however, various proofs that the Caribs inhabited Santo Domingo ; among
 others, I found at the eastern point of the island, called JuntaEngano, numerous heaps
 of Conch shells (^Strombus gigas). These shells have invariably a hole near the spire,
 which has been made for the purpose of detaching the animal from the shell, and
 to extract it with ease. I met a large number of similar piles at the island of
 Anegada, which the historians of the Antilles ascribe to the Caribs, who, on their
 descent from the Lucuyas to wage war upon the natives of Puerto Rico, touched
 first at Anegada in ordor to provision themselves with conchs for their expedition.

 A far more interesting discovery than these heaps of conch shells, during my travels

 in Santo Domingo, is, however, a granitic ring in the neighbourhood of San Juan de
  Maguana, which seems to have entirely escaped the attention of previous historians
 and travellers. Maguana formed one of the five kingdoms into which Santo Do-
 mingo, on the arrival of the Spaniards, was divided. It was governed by the Carib
 Cacique Caonabo (which name signifies rain), the most fierce and powerful of the
 chieftains, and the irreconcileable enemy of the Europeans. His favourite wife was
 the unfortunate Anacaona, famed in the island for her beauty, her wisdom, and, as
 recorded by all the early historians, for her kindness towards the white men. Never-
 theless, Ovando, when governor of Santo Domingo, accused her of conspiracy, and

 carried her in chains to the city and ignominiously hanged her in the presence of the

 people whom she had so long and so signally befriended. The granitic ring is now
--92 REPORT 1851.

inown in the neighbourhood under the name of ' el Cercado de los Indies,' and lies
on a savannah surrounded with groves of wood, and bounded by the river Maguana.
The circle consists mostly of granitic rocks, which prove by their smoothness that
they have been collected on the banks of a river, probably at the Maguana, although
its distance is considerable. The rocks are mostly each from thirty to fifty pounds
in weight, and have been placed closely together, giving the ring the appearance of
a paved road, 21 feet in breadth, and, as far as the trees and bushes which had grown
up from between the rocks permitted one to ascertain, 2270 feet in circumference.

A large granitic rock, 5 feet 7 inches in length, ending in obtuse points, lies nearly

in the middle of the circle partly imbedded in the ground. I do not think that its
present situation is the one it originally occufjiedj the rock stood probably in the
centre. It has been smoothed anil fashioned by human hands ; and although the
surface has suffered from atmospheric influence, there is evidence that it was to
represent a human figure: the cavities of the eyes and mouth are still visible.
This rock has in every respect the appearance of tlie figure represented by Pere
Charlevoix in his ' llistoire de I'lle Espagnole ou de Saint-Doniingue,' which he de-

signates as a 'Figure trouvee dans une se[)ulture Indienne.' A pathway of the

same breadth as the ring extends from it first due west, and turns afterwards at a
right angle to the north, ending at a small brook. The pathway is almost for its
whole extent overgrown with thick forest; I could not, therefore, ascertain the

exact length. No doubt can exist that this circle surrounded the Indian idol, and

that within it thousands of the natives adored the deity in the unshapen form of the

granite rock. But another question remains to be solved, namely. Were the inha-
bitants whom the Spaniards met in the island the constructors of this ring? Were
they the adorers of this deity? I think not. * * Among the antiquities recently
discovered near San Diego, within a day's march of the Pacific Ocean, at the head

of the Gulf of California, were likewise granitic rings or circular walls round vene-

rable trees, columns, and blocks of hieroglyphics. If my opinion could possess any

value, I should pronounce the granitic ring near San Juan, the figures which 1 have
seen cut into rocks in the interior of Guiana, and the scupltured figures, to belong to
a race far superior in intellect to the one Columbus met in Hispaniola, who came
from the northern parts of Mexico, adjacent to the ancient country or district of
Huastecas, and that this race was conquered and extirpated by the nations that in-
habited the countries when the Europeans landed. * *

   "I venture to hope that the account of my discoveries of a few monuments that have
descended to us of a by-gone race, may not be entirely unacceptable, f intend to
commence my journey to the northern provinces, for the execution of which I have
already received the permission of Lord Palmerston ; in a few days I promise myself
a rich harvest among the ruins of the first settlements and fortifications which the
Europeans erected in the New World."

On the Geography of Kumdon and Garhwdl in the Himalaya Mountains.
                 By Capt. R. Strachey, Bengal Engineers.

    Capt. Strachey began by giving a sketch of the general configuration of the surface
of Central Asia, in which he pointed out that the elevated region known as Tibet,
formed the summit of a great protuberance above the general level of the earth's
surface, of which the two mountain chains, known by the name of the Himalaya and
Kouenhen, were nothing more than the south and north faces, these ranges having

no definite special existence apart from the general mass. He then proceeded to
give a more detailed account of the main physical features of the British provinces

of Kuviaon and Garhwdl in the Himalaya, and of the part of Tibet contiguous to our
frontier, to which his own observations had been restricted. The plains of northern
India extend along the entire southern edge of the Himalaya over about 500,000
square miles, nowhere exceeding in elevation 1200 feet above the sea. Fron) these
rise the mountains suddenly and in a well-defined line. The exterior range, called
the Siwaliks by Dr. Falconer and Col. Cautley, is of no great elevation, hardly ex-
ceeding 3000 feet. The characteristic tracts of swamp and dry forest that occur
along its southern face, known as Tarai and Bhdbar, and the longitudinal valleys
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  Vd

called Dun along its nortliern slope, were described. Immediately above these rise

the first ranges of the great mountain region that extends to the north over a breadth
of upwards of 200 miles. The loftiest peaks, some of which exceed 28,000 feet in
height, are usually found along a line 80 or 90 miles from the southern edge of the

chain, which in Kumaon neither is coincident with the water-shed, nor forms a con-

tinuous ridge, but is broken up into groups separated by deep gorges, and connected
by transverse spurs with the water-shed range that runs 20 or 30 miles further to the

north. On crossing this water-shed, which forms the boundary between Tibet and

our provinces, the traveller finds himself, not without astonishment, on a plane
150 miles in length, and 36 or 40 in breadth, the elevation of which varies from
16,000 feet along its southern edge, to 14,500 feet in its more central parts, where
it is cut througii by the river Sutlej. It is everywhere intersected by stupendous
ravines, that of the Sutlej being nearly 3000 feet deep, which are furrowed out of
the alluvial matter of which the plain is composed. The mountains that bound this
plain to the north hardly enter the region of perpetual snow, the famous peak of

Kailds, which is nearly 22,000 feet in altitude, being the highest point.

    Capt. Strachey then gave a brief account of his first journey into this country, in
which, in company with Mr. J. E. Winterbottom, he reached the lakes of Rakas,
Tal and Mdnasaroiuar, which are found towards the eastern extremity of the plain

at an elevation of 15,200 feet.

  A general view of the geology of these regions followed, from which it appeared

that from the Siwalik range, which was before known to be of tertiary age, the moun-
tains are formed of metamorphic recks, until we pass the line of greatest elevation.

We then again find fossiliferous rocks which form a regular sequence from the lower

Silurian to the tertiary formations. Fossils from all of these beds have been col-
lected and brought to this country by Captain Strachey. It is of the tertiary beds
that is composed the great plain already described, and in them have been found fos-
silized remains of elephants and rhinoceros at an elevation of between 14,000 and

15,000 feet above the sea.

   From a general consideration of these circumstances, it was inferred that the pre-
sent wonderful development of the Himalaya and of the elevated regions of Tibet
dates no further back than the tertiary period, being in fact one of the most recent

changes that the surface of the earth has undergone.
    Proceeding from the solid crust of the earth to its aerial covering, an account was

next given of the chief meteorological phaenomena, among which it will be sufficient
to specify two of the most remarkable, namely, the glaciers and perpetual snow.
Glaciers were shown to abound in all parts of the mountains covered with perpetual
snow, descending as low as 11,500 feet.

   The snow-line, the height of which has given rise to much discussion, was stated
to descend to about 15,50O feet on the southern face of the Himalaya, while it was
pointed out, that as we advance to the north of the great peaks and stand on the

mountains bordering the Tibetan plain, the snow-line has receded to 19,000 or 20,000

feet. This phenomenon was shown to depend chiefly on the fact, that the quantity
of snow that falls to the north of the great Himalayan peaks, is far less than that
which falls on their southern slopes.

    Capt. Strachey then passed to the description of the vegetation of these moun-
tains. Its character was shown to be truly tropical up to elevations of about 4000
feet, though even from 3000 feet some of the forms of temperate climates begin to
appear. The remarkable admixture of these temperate forms with those of the torrid
zone, that is met with in the valleys of the larger rivers that penetrate at a very low
level far into the interior of the mountains, was also noticed. Above 4000 feet, oaks,
rhododendrons and andromeda, form a very great proportion of the forest up to 7000
feet; although in many places the Pinus longifolia clothes the slopes of the hills to
the exclusion of everything else, nearly within the same limits of from 3000 to 6000

 feet.

    As we ascend species of the deciduous trees of colder climates are introduced, and
they, with the addition of other pines, prevail in the upper parts of the forest, from
8000 to 11,500 feet, where arboreous vegetation is usually found to terminate rather
suddenly. Above this a more open tract succeeds in which the vegetation is for the
most part herbaceous, few shrubs ascending so high as 14,000 feet.
94 REPORT 1851.

    As we recede in our progress to the north, behind the higher summits of the range,
the country rapidly becomes more aridj and when we reach the plain of Tibet, we
find it to be almost a desert, on which few plants rise even to the height of a single

foot.

    The vegetation, which, though scanty, is still highly interesting from its similarity
to that of the arctic regions, may be considered finally to cease at about 17,000 or

 18,000 feet.

    After referring to the agriculture of this tract, in vvhich the profitable cultivation
of the cereal grains was shown to be carried up to about 14,000 feet, Capt. Strachey
concluded by an account of some of the zoological characteristics of the Tibetan

plateau. He mentioned more particularly the Kt/ang or Wild Ass, the Yak, the

wild and domestic Sheep and Goat, the Ounce, and other animals, specimens of
which he brought with him from that country, and which have lately been set up in
the East India Company's Museum,

                   On the Inhabitants of Kumdon and Garhwdl.
                    By John Strachet, Bengal Engineers.

    After alluding to the difficulty of arriving at satisfactory conclusions regarding the
ethnological relations of the tribes inhabiting the Himalaya, in consequence of that
range of mountains lying on the boundar3'-line between two or more races, Mr.
Strachey proceeded to give some account of the people called Khasiya, which com-

prises the greaterpart of the inhabitants oF Kumaon and Garhwdl. A tribe of the same
name is spread extensively over the greater part of the Nepalese territories, and it

has been assumed, from this circumstance and other facts observed in the eastern
parts of the Himalaya, that the Khasiyas generally are a people of mixed Tibetan
and Indian race. Although this may perhaps be true of the Khasiyas of Eastern
Nepal, Mr. Strachey considered that it was by no means proved to be the case as to
those of Kumaon, and he doubted whether the signs of any non-Indian stock were

more definite in the people of Kumaon than in those of the plains of Northern Hin-

dustan, In form and feature, in language, religion, and customs, the Khasiyas of

Kumaon appear to be Hindu, and all their sentiments and prejudices are so strongly
imbued with the peculiar spirit of that faith, that although their social habits and
religion are often repugnant to Hindu orthodoxy, it is difficult for one who knows
them to consider them as anything but Hindu. The custom of polyandry does not
prevail in Kumaon and Garhwal, Mr. Strachey pointed out why he considered that

the existence of this custom did not necessarily prove descent from a Tibetan stock,

and how it might grow up in a purely Hindu community, as a consequence of the

general social state. Historical evidence helps to confirm the opinion that the

Khasiyas of Kumaon are of Hindu origin. It is proved by ancient inscriptions found
in Garhwal, that, say fifteen hundred years ago, the Hindu religion was in full force
in these provinces, and that in the country itself the people were then known by the
name Khasa, In Manu, the Mahabharata, and in several of the Puranas, we read of
a race of Kshatriyas called Khasa, dwellers in mountains, who have become degraded
by the neglect of religious rites, and it is curious thac the Khasiyas of Kumaon at

the present day give an almost exactly similar account of themselves. After speaking
of some of the social and economical peculiarities of the Khasiyas, Mr. Strachey pro-
ceeded to give an account of the Bhotiyas, the most important of the tribes of

Tibetan origin found in Kumaon and Garhwdl, inhabiting the country near the
Tibetan frontier, among the highest parts of the Himalayan chain. Their villages
are situated at elevations varying from 7000 to 12,000 feet above the sea ; but the
Bhotiyas derive their chief means of subsistence, not from agriculture, but from the

carrying trade between Tibet and the Cis-Himalayan states, of which they possess a

monopoly. An account was given of this trade, and of their general habits, religion,
languages, &c. Of their Tibetan origin there can be no doubt. The adjoining pro-
vince of Tibet was also referred to. The name of this country is Hundes, the land

of Htins ; not Hiundes, the snow-country, nor Oondes, the wool-country, as it has
been variously termed. Fron ancient inscriptions found in Garhwal, of which Mr.
Strachey intended to give an account hereafter, it is proved that the country in ques-

don was called Huna probably more than 1000 years ago, and there can be no doubt
that the race of Hunas, often mentioned in the Piiranas, must be referred to the
same country. This fact seems to help to corroborate the views ef the Chevalier
BuHsen and of other ethnologists regarding the origin of the Huns in the countries
on the northern borders of the Himalaya.

On the Inhabitants of Lower Bengal. By Robert Young, E.M.R.C.S.,

               Surgeon to his Highness the Newab Nazim of Bengal.

   In this paper Mr. Young gives a few particulars of the inhabitants of Lower
Bengal, from personal observation, but confines himself to replies to the set of eth-
nological queries which were circulated by the British Association.

 --Physical Characters. The general stature of the men is low ; the proportions of

the figure are not good, and the weight is light, being on an average 130 lbs. The
women are larger in porportion and better made ; this may be attributable to the

development of the muscular system, in consequence of hard or household work,

carrying water, &c., while the men are engaged in agricultural pursuits.
   The head is generally large, as is the abdomen; the extremities usually meagre,

and the joints small.
   The complexion is of a colour hardly describable, and varies considerably from

bronze to black, but never assuming the copper hue of the South American Indian.
The hair is never woolly, but is of a good black, and generally curly ; it is sometimes
fine and sometimes coarse and straight, but mostly what we should term " a beautiful
head of hair." The colour of the eyes varies ; but with the description of hair just

given, you generally find eyes black and glossy. When the hair assumes a reddish

brown tint, the eye is often gray or hazel, and in such cases the complexion is always
lighter. These variations I have particularly observed; and among the natives of the
country, these men of lighter complexion are generally considered as of treacherous

character; but this remark I make not from my own observation. The shape of

the eye is always round rather than long, but it varies as in all other nations. I have
never detected any peculiarity of odour whatever, and should decidedly say there
is none.

   The head is, as I have said, large, and elongated from the front to the back ; the
ear is set remarkably far back in the temporal region, and the powers of perception
exceedingly low. I am unable to furnish sketches, as suggested by your Committee,
having quitted India at very short notice, and the men accompanying me not belonging
to the part of the country described as Lower Bengal, to which my observation
has been principally directed. Idiocy is very common among the Hindoos. As a
people they possess a wonderful power of maintaining an imperturbable expression
of countenance under the most adverse circumstances, and of conceaHng their
emotions, whether of pleasure or pain. This arises by no means from apathy, but
from innate deceit in the character, and is often made available for personal

advantage.

   The bones of the skull are thin and light, and the frontal bone is occasionally
found with a suture in the middle : this is not common. But in giving a reply to this
96 REPORT 1851.

question, I must observe that the facilities for the study of anatomy are, out of Cal-
cutta, exceedingly few, from the fact that exhumation is absolutely necessary in the
case of Mussulmen; and the body of a Hindoo is almost unattainable, because that
of the rich man is almost invariably subjected to cremation, while the Ganges is the
final home for the bodies of the poor. They have no practices for modifying their
form or appearance in any way, and never trouble themselves with a superfluity of

clothing.

   The pelvis in the female is largely developed, and hence the facility and com-
parative absence of pain in parturition. The foot, generally speaking, is well-formed;
and in cases where hard labour has not affected the frame, the foot, hand and arm
may be taken as models for the sculptor.

   There is in the district of Lower Bengal only one race of men, no intermixture;
but there is sometimes in the same family a v.'onderAd difference in the complexion.
1 have in my own service two brothers, natives of Orissa, a district south of Calcutta,
one the eldest, the other the youngest of the family. The skin of the first is re-
markably dark, almost black, while that of his younger brother is particularly fair,
and I have remarked this in other instances. Jt is worthy of observation that this
occurs in a family where no polygamy has ever occurred. Among the Hindoos it is
not allowed for separate castes to intermarry, but this law does not extend to the
whole family of the Mahomedans, of whom there are five distinct sects, namely the
Patan, the Mogul, the Syud, the Shaik, and the Sheah, intermarriage being permitted
among some of these, but not all.

   The inhabitants of Lower Bengal are anything but a long-lived people; and I am
inclined to think this is the case throughout Hindostan ; the causes may be more
than I can enumerate, for they are many. Foremost, that of early marriage, much
more physical weakness naturally than the men north of Behar, who are stronger

and more athletic. I mention Behar for two reasons : first, it is the extremity of
the Bengal Presidency ; and secondly, I have myself observed the fact and been
struck by it. Poverty of food probably has some weight, but the consumption of
opium and hemp in various forms doulJtless tends to swell the list of unfavourable

influences.

 --Language. Among the working classes, the common Bengalee language, which

is nearly pure, is spoken; all their accounts are kept in Bengalee; their native
newspapers, of which there are several published in Calcutta, are in the same.

Among the middle classes vve find Hindostanee in use, occasionally interspersed

with words of Bengalee. But at court, and in the highest ranks of the natives,
Hindostanee in its purity, and also Persian, are commonly found. The Bengalee
does not rule anywhere beyond the three districts I have mentioned, Bengal, Behar,
and Orissa. The people of the last-mentioned district, or Ooriahs, have, in addition,
a language of their own; but little Bengalee is spoken in Behar.

   The literary knowledge of the Mussulman is almost confined to his Koran; and,
to his Shastres, that of the Hindoo. They have their native songs, set to very
simple airs, and appointed for different times of the day and night; those for the
morning, the day, and a part of the night being of a varied and cheerful description,
while those after midnight and towards the break of day are extremely plaintive and

--agreeable; the subjects of these latter may be divided into two, the love ditties of

the country, and the morning invocations to the various deities. These latter, to the
ear of a lover of music, are exceedingly pleasing, being sung in a delicate falsetto

voice.

  --Individual and Family Life, There is a general rejoicing at the birth of a son

but from the low esteem in which women are held throughout the whole of India,

the birth of a daughter as a first-born child is considered as an aflliction in the family.
Should however a daughter be the second child, the distress of the event is con-

siderably mollified.

   I have never known infanticide in the case of a son, but the above reasons induce
a degree of want of affection for female children, who, happily however, are not so

extensively destroyed as in times past.
    Less pains in dressing or clothing children cannot be taken than by the Hindoo

there is no artificial plan of modifying the form in any way, either amongst Hindoos
or Mussulmen.

    Education can nowhere be at a lower ebb than it is at present in Bengal. The

 children are absolutely tanght nothing ! Predestinarians in the extreme, they are

exceedingly indifferent to life, and professionally speaking, I may say they are
adverse to anything like a surgical operation, fate being all in all, to them. The
field for discussion on these points is wide, and 1 might be digressing from the
objects of your Committee, were I to expatiate on the present mode of education
pursuetl by philanthropists who have lately taken up the subject in India. To the
education of our own sex there never has been any obstacle, but against that of the
female, have been pitted the custom of the country, the superstition of the parties
themselves, and the extraordinary ascendency maintained by their pundits or priests
over every class of society. I would give the palm to the Mussulmen in point of
thirst for knowledge and freedom from moral tyranny ; they rank far before the
Hindoos; they are freer from superstition and crafty priesthood; ami from being
more of one family among themselves, I believe their creed to be of a better
stamp than that of the Hindoo, whose name is Legion as to variety of caste.

    Puberty takes place at a very early age. I have knotvn a mothei- as young as
eleven ; and I have heard of such even at an earlier age. Families, generally speak-
ing, are not large ; I think three is the outside average : a twin birth is not common.

    Children are taken very little care of; bad nursing, bad nourishment, and hence

their stunted and frequently squalid appearance.
   As to the age to which children are borne, I consider thirty above the mark ; being

given in marriage as early as four or five years of age, and being passed over to the

husband at the first attainment of puberty. I am not aware of any ceremonies being

connected with particular periods of the life of a child, excepting the circumcision of

the Mahoinedan, and the investment of the Brahminical thread of the Hindoo. On

both these occasions there is a religious ceremony, simply invoking blessings on the

respective heads of the parties.

   Chastity is scarcely known ; among the higher classes it is, from their position,
more observed, it being difficult for the women of rank to leave the zenana; but
where the sanctity of the harem is not observed, married life is only a nanie. I am
not aware of any superstitions on this subject ; rejoicing and feasting are the accomФ

paniments of a marriage, a procession always taking place on the occasion ; the
priests being the parties who simply let the parents understand that the marriage has
taken place, and there it ends. Divorce is not known, and for this reason polygamy
is frequent; and although there is one wife whose station is considered superior to
any other, the offspring of others is equally legitimate. Widows, from not being
allowed to marry a second time, whatever age they may be, almost invariably go
astray, and are consequently looked down upon as outcasts.

   The sick are generally treated by their own native medical men, three-fourths of
the treatment consisting of faith, superstition and charms, and the remaining fourth
in the administration of some vegetable medicine adapted to cure the disease.

Survey of the Southern Part of the Middle Island of New Zealand.
                By Capt. J. L. Stokes, R.N., F.R.G.S.

   Having been employed in 1844 by the New Zealand Company to explore the
eastern and southern coasts of the middle island of New Zealand, in order to select
a suitable site for the then projected settlement of New Edinburgh, I had occasion

to examine carefully the district described. I can fully confirm the accuracy of these

observations in respect to the vast extent of available surface which exists south of

Tuturau and the Mataura river to the shore of Leveause Straits, between the Eurete

or New River and the Aparinia westward, as also to the east of the Eurete. I can-

not however concur in recommending it as a district eligible for a settlement; instead

of its affording good pasture for grazing, or fertile soil for husbandry, in my judgement

the surface is rather rude, and the vegetation chiefly large detached bunches of a

very coarse sharp-edged junk. Where the banks of the Aparima and Eurete are
wooded, I found chiefly the Totara and the Manuka growing luxuriantly, but in

deep sand, whilst those portions of the gently undidated uplands, which are wooded,

afford almost exclusively varieties of the birch, which abounds and attains great

dimensions even on the poorest land. The earth presents a surface of a whitish hue
when dry, without mould or humus, being a deep and gritty clay (as I found by fre-

quently digging), which I am convinced would not bear any adequate crop without

being first well manured. Between the east and west branches of the river Eurete

the land is low and sandy. Eastward to the coast is a vast bed of fine quartz gravel

covered with heather and luxuriant mosses ; and in some places occurs peat of pretty
good quality and considerable depth. There is good timber at the western extremity

of the Bluff harbour, and between it and the river Eurete some extent of bush land,

in and around which a herd of cattle find suiEcient pasture, but feeding chiefly on

the milk-thistle, &c. There is a small community of Europeans at the Bluff and at

the Aparima, who have intermarried with the natives, and who, pursuing whaling,

sealing and husbandry, and in a few instances stock-keeping, have attained to very

comfortable circumstances. Some were in the practice of growing wheat, but they

informed me that the climate was unfavourable, rains being frequent and copious,

and the gales of wind boisterous. While my vessel lay at anchor in the Eurete in

the month of May, we had to encounter, in the surveys executed and on our several

exploratory journeys, very inclement weather. Considering, then, the climate, the

soil, and the natural growth, I am convinced that there is no very eligible site for a

future settlement south of the Mataura river and Tu-tu-rau, a favourite residence of

the natives formerly, when they were more numerous, because it afforded shelter

from the southern climate, good fishing and fertile land. From Tu-tu-rau north to

Otokau, there is an unbroken tract of fertile and well-watered land, affording abun-

dant pasture, and much of it of excellent quality for tillage. It abounds with sup-

plies of coal, wood, timber, brick-earth and stone, conveniently dispersed through

the district and very accessible by the facilities of inland navigation, which its rivers

and lakes afford. Again, for fifty miles north of Otokau there is a district presenting

-almost equal capabilities for large productiveness. Further north, along the ninety

miles beach, extending about twenty-eight miles above Banks Peninsula, there is a

vast plain, for the most part either too arid and stony, or too wet and swampy to be

eligible for occupation. There is but a very limited quantity of fertile land good

enough for tillage within a distance of twenty miles of either of the harbours of

Banks Peninsula. The surface of plains in New Zealand usually presents a succes-

sion of terraces in lines parallel with the course of the rivers, rising in steps of from

six to fourteen feet in elevation ; much of the surface is desolated by closely-im-
bedded boulder and shingle, and usually where these occur in the greatest breadth,

and where there is a dead level, the surface is the most stony. On the hill lands of

MyBanks Peninsula there is good pasture, but it is not so on the plain.  reasons

for rejecting it as ineligible for the site of a settlement, as well as my report of the

entire journey of exploration which I made in 1844, are alluded to, but not adduced

in the Seventeenth Report of the Directors of the New Zealand Company, and the

substance of the same will be presented to the public under the head of Topography

of the Middle Islands of New Zealand, in the valuable work on British Colonies,

written by R. M. Martin, Esq., which is how published in monthly parts by Messrs.

   Statistics of the Attendance in Schools for Children of the Poorer Classes.

                              By Joseph Fletcher.

   This was an elaborate abstract of the attendance, ages, and instruction of the
children in about 160 schools, two-thirds British and one-third Wesleyan, inspected

with reference to the apprenticeship of pupil teachers, in the course of the year 1850.
Their experience is that of the best class of town schools for the poorer classes,
those which are merely infant schools being excluded from the abstract, and the at-
tendance in the remainder derived chiefly from the families of skilled artizans and
small shopkeepers. The number entered upon the books within the 12 months pre-
ceding the date of inspection, was, in 139 schools, 13,728, and the number erased from
them 10,989 ; showing a decided tendency to increase, with the increasing power of
instruction supplied by the pupil-teachers, but a lamentable amount of fluctuation

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

   The excessive fluctuation indicated by this table affects chiefly the lower half of
each school, where the poorer quality of the instruction which has heretofore pre-
vailed, the indifference of the parents, and the want of better check on the part of

the teachers, have often perpetuated a very inferior kind of management.

   Thus one-third of the children in the schools which are not reckoned as infant

Bchools, are of the infantile ages not exceeding 7, while only 4"8 per cent, are up-
wards of 13, and only 9'9 per cent., including these, upwards of 12 years of age.
This latter therefore may be considered to be the age at which the children of arti-

zans generally cease to attend any day school, a large proportion of those above

that age being the children of parents of rather superior means. The relative excess
of boys at the younger and girls at the more advanced ages, is referable to the

greater usefulness of the latter at home; and the fact that a larger proportion of a
somewhat higher class are generally to be found protracting their stay in these even
than in the boys' schools. The children of the unskilled labourers being seldom al-
lowed to attend school to ages ranging so late within two years as those returned
in the preceding table, it is obvious that there is no opportunity for the " over-educa-
tion" of the people by the day schools, let them be made ever so vigorous; while
the following table of the school occupations of the 20,399 children under present

Thus in this highest class of schools for the children of the poorer classes, there

is only about 84 per cent, whose occupations in writing abstracts or compositions,

 opinion respecting the intimate connection between mere instruction and the absence
 of crime in particular districts, when compared, was mistaken. The facts on which
 the calculations in the English maps were founded were taken from the tables drawn
 lip by Mr. Redgrave of the Home Office, for all the time that had been collected.
 Each map was constructed to show the prevalence in each county of England of a

 particular crime or class of crime, such as murder, manslaughter, arson, larceny by
 servants, offences against the game laws, bigamy, &c. As to bigamy, there was a most
 remarkable difference between England and France, that crime appearing to be much

more prevalent in England. He accounted for this circumstance by the difference
in the forms of marriage required by law, which afforded much greater facilities for

 tracing personal identity in France than in England.
    The English maps were constructed to the degrees of criminality as measured by

 the average number of the accused for the whole period of sixteen years, as compared
 with the average population, as ascertained by the three censuses of 1821, 1831 and

 1841.
    Besides the maps, he showed a series of tables exhibiting, by curved lines for each

 county, the degrees of positive and negative criminality corresponding with the

 coloured maps.
    As to the French maps, there were one or two points which he was anxious to

notice. The geographical distribution of instruction among all the young men of 20
 years of age in France was easily observed, in consequence of the mode used for
selecting the soldiers for the French armies. He had analysed the returns made of
these young men by the prefects of France to the Minister of War for 22 years
'ending 1849, and the result as to parallelism of distribntion of mere instruction and
 absence of crime which he had stated 17 years ago in his work on the ' Moral Sta-
 tistics of France,' was fully borne out.

    This second analysis had established another interesting result, that the progress
 in the amount of instruction in each department of France, instead of being in the
 districts where most wanted, had on the contrary been, with singular regularity, in
the districts where the greatest instruction had previously prevailed.

 On the Prospects of the Beet- Sugar Manufacture in the United Kingdom,
                 By Professor W. Neilson Hancock, LL.D.

   Public attention had been directed to this manufacture by the efforts to establish
a public company in London for its introduction into Ireland. The Professor had
learned that at Maldon the manufacture had been attempted by a private company,

but this attempt led to failure in a short time. A manufactory had very recently been

established at Chelmsford, and contracts had been entered into with the farmers in
that neighbourhood. The prospects of the manufacture depended on the answers

--to three questions : 1st. What was the price of beet-root likely to be for a series

of years? 2nd. What was the price of refined beet-sugar likely to be after 1854?
and 3rd, Would it be profitable to carry on the manufacture at these probable prices

of the raw produce and manufactured article ?
   As to the price of beet- root, its price varied in France from an average of 13s. \\d.

per ton in the north-east of France, to 18s. 5d. per ton in the north-west of France.

The average for the whole of France was \bs.\\d. per ton. In Ireland the price stated
to be contracted for by the sugar beet company was 15*, Qd. per ton, and the price
at Essex was from 18s. to 20*. per ton. Thus it appeared that the present price in

Ireland was higher than the average of France, and the present price in England

was higher than the average of the highest-priced districts of France. What the

future price in Ireland and England was likely to be, was a difficult question, and
had not been as yet fully investigated.

    As to the second question, the price of refined beet-sugar after 1854, it was
necessary to take the year 1854, because at present there was a differential duty in
favour of home-grown beet-sugar, which would diminish each year, and cease after
July 1854. After that time the short price of refined beet-sugar would most

probably not exceed '27s. to 28s. per cwt., and the long price would most probably

--not exceed 40s. 4rf. to 41s. 4rf. per cwt. Indeed a fall below those prices might be

anticipated from three causes: )st. From the diminished cost of production of

refined cane-su^ar, consequent on the increased consumption produced by the fall

in its market price from 49s. 4d. to 42s. 4rf. per cwt. ori the equalization of the

duties. 2iid. From the removal of the absurd restrictions now imposed on cane-
sugar refiners. And 3rd, from the competition between cane-sugar and beet-sugar,

if the latter were manufactured to any extent.

As to the third question, Would it be profitable to manufacture from beet-root

at the Irish price of I5s. 6d. per ton, or the Essex price of 19s. per ton, refined sugar

?--to sell at 28s. per cwt.  the calculations on this point which had been most relied

on were two in number, that of Mr. William K. Sullivan, Chemist to the Museum

of Irish Industry in Dublin, and that of M. Paul Hamoir, of the firm of Serret,

Hamoir, Duquesne and Co., the largest manufacturers of beet-sugar at Valenciennes,

and dated April 1 8, 1850. These estimates were as follows :

On the Duties of the Public in respect to Charitable Savings-Banks.
            By Professor W. Neilson Hancock, LL.D.

The Professor said there were three kinds of savings-banks--joint stock, govern-
                       savings-banks. The characteristics of  the latter were, that
ment and charitable    management was divided between the
                                                              Government and the
the responsibility of
           and that neither of these parties were necessarily liable for the acts ol their
trustees;  The savings-banks of the United Kingdom were of the third class ; and the
clerks.    which he proposed to discuss was, what was the duty of the pubhc with

Rochdale and Scarborough, it was not extended to England.
   From the objects for which savings-banks were established, it was                                    maniftest.  ,tvh, at,

the whole success of these institutions, as a means of encouraging a habit ot saving,
depended on their affording a perfectly safe place of deposit ; and their success in
making the poor take an interest in the preservation of the public credit, depended

   The Cuffe Street bank was founded in 1818, under influential patronage,
1826 the trustees suspected the honesty of the actuary, and it took them five years
                                               In 1831 they found out                                   his dishonesty

to the National Debt Commissioners on this emergency, and Mr. Tidd Pratt was sent

to Ireland. He awarded Б7000 to be paid by the trustees, and that Б4000, claimed
by the depositors, was not a legal charge. He advised that this latter sum should be

paid out of future profits, and that the trustees sliould carry on the bank, as the

future surplus would realize enough to pay all deficiencies. Mr. Pratt thought that

the defalcations did not exceed Б4000. The trustees, instead of waiting for future

profits, paid the Б4000 at once out of the incoming deposits ; they also omitted to

post the annual account, as required by law, from 1831 to 1848, and during all that
time, their accounts, as furnished to the Commissioners of the National Debt, showed

a deficiency. In 1838 the defalcations of the actuary were ascertained to have been

at least Б25,000. The bank continued, though insolvent during all this time, to

possess public confidence until 1845. The Act of 1844 having relieved the trustees

Afrom liability, one of them disclosed the insolvency of the bank.  run followed, in

which Б200,000 was paid, leaving only Б60,000 in the hands of tlie trustees, and

which would have compelled the bank to stop payment had not the Chancellor of

the Exchequer (Mr. Goulburn) allowed the bank to draw a larger sum than the re-

gulation of the Bank of Ireland then permitted. When the run stopped, the depo-

sitors replaced their money, and the bank continued in operation until 1848, when

another run took place, in which they paid away all but Б90, leaving a loss of

Б60,000 on the depositors.

The trustees were relieved from legal liability by the Act of 1844. They said they

were not morally responsible, in consequence of -Mr. Pratt's advice in 1831, and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer's allowance of the one draft in 1845. The Government

said that ihey were not responsible, as Mr. Pratt was not an executive officer. After

a long parliamentary investigation, by a vote of the House of Commons the depo-

sitors received Б30,000, or 10s. in the pound.

From this case it appeared, first, that the character of the clerk was no security,

as the Cuffe Street clerk had the highest character. It appeared, 2ndly, that the

security given by the clerks was no protection. 3rdly, that the character of the

managers and trustees did not secure the depositors, neither did their limited liability.

The same case showed that no reliance could be placed on the appointment of au-

ditors, or on any system of mere cheques. As it thus appeared that there was no
real security for the depositors in charitable savings-banks as now constituted, the

--duties of the public in respect to these institutions were manifest : 1st. That those

who advised the poor to deposit their savings in these banks should understand what
security they recommended the people to trust to. 2nd. That trustees who were

convinced that there was no real security, should have the banks they were con-

nected with wound up and the depositors paid ofl'. 3rd. That the public as legis-

lators should provide for the removal of all impediments to banks of deposits being

established for the poor by private enterprise, and for the formation either of govern-

ment banks with government security, or of charitable banks with unlimited liability

of the trustees ; and put an immediate stop to the half-charitable, half-government

institutions where there was no real security.

Should Boards of Guardians endeavour to make Pauper Labour self-sup-
Byporting., or should they investigate the Causes of Pauperism ?
                                                                    Pro-

fessor W, Neilson Hancock, LL.D.

   The Professor commenced by showing that the history of the Irish famine had com-
pletely established the necessity of a public and compulsory system of poor laws, both
on moral grounds and as a matter of police. He next pointed out that the controver-
sies respecting |)oor laws had arisen from taking too narrow a view of the subject.

   The subject of public relief of pauperism really gave rise to questions in every

branch of the social sciences, in moral philosophj', the science of government, juris-
prudence, and political economy. As to the particular question proposed to be dis-
cussed in the paper, it had been suggested by the efforts of the Sheffield and Chorl-
ton and other boards in England to make pauper labour self-supporting; by Dr.

Alison's paper ' On the Employment of Paupers on Waste Lands' at the Edinburgh

meeting of the Association, and by similar plans attempted by the Cork,Thurles and

Banbridge Boards of Guardians in Ireland, On investigating this question, it ap-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  105

peared plainly that pauper labour could not be made self-supporting, for four rea-

--sons: 1st. Because pauper labour was necessarily inferior to the labour at the com-

mand of private capitalists. 2nd. Because boards of guardians were entirely un-
suited to act as capitalists. The failure of the culcivation of waste lands at King
William's Town in Ireland by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, and the
failure of the Waste-Land Improvement Company, both showed how unsuited such

an enterprise was to be undertaken by boards of guardians. 3rd. Boards of guar-

dians must either lose all the most skilful paupers, or they would have to relax the
tests of destitution to retain them, and so would lose more by the increase of pau-
perism than they would gain by any profit on pauper labour. 4th and lastly. Be-
cause, if pauper labour could be self-supporting, it would follow that communism
would be more advantageous than competition ; as paupers employed by a board
of guardians were in exactly the position of a community on the system of St. Simon,
and to become paupers they must have failed to support themselves by free com-

petition.

    It followed, therefore, from these considerations, that pauper labour could never
be made self-su[)porting, and that industrial enterprises could never be successfully
carried on by paupers.

   The opinion that pauper labour could be made self-supporting had to some extent
been caused by the common fallacy on the opposite side of supposing that paupers
should be kept in idleness or at unproductive work. This fallacy had arisen from the
mistake of believing that pauperism was caused by over-production, whilst it always

arose from under-production, or production misdirected. But the moial and econo-
mical view of this question coincided. It was the duty of the guardians to keep
those under their care actively employed, since nothing could be more demoralizing
than a life of idleness, and nothing more calculated to weaken the force of the work-
house as a test of destitution, than making it a place for the indulgence of indolence.
In an economic point of view, it appeared extraordinary how any one could believe
that the wealth of a community would be increased by keeping a number of people

in idleness.

   As the task of making pauper labour productive was a hopeless one, it was the
duty of all intelligent members of the community, and especially of guardians of the
poor, to consider the wide field for exertion open to the philanthropist and the
statesman in the discovery and removal of causes of pauperism.

   In a paper ' On the Causes of Distress at Skull and Skibbereen during the Famine

in Ireland,' which he had read at the Edinburgh Meeting of the Association, he had
pointed out some of the causes of pauperism in Ireland. In other publications he had
treated of the same subject ; but beyond the subjects he had already noticed, there
were large fields of investigation connected with sanitary arrangements, with the
savings of the poor, with intemperance and immorality. The great advantage of a
long-lived over a short-lived population in respect to wealth, especially the wealth
consisting of human labour, had not been sufficiently dwelt on. The early mortality
of the Irish labouring population was a great source of pauperism amongst them.
Every improvement in sanitary arrangements would lead in the most certain way to
an increase of wealth and a diminution of pauperism. Tlie want of a perfectly safe

place for the investments of the poor was another prolific source of pauperism. He

had shown in another paper read at this meeting, that the present half.government
and half-charitable savings-banks afforded no adequate security, and although this
subject had been investigated for some time no practical good had been done.

   Again, could nothing be done with those large sources of crime, intemperance and
immorality ? It might be that nothing could be done directly, but could nothing be

done indirectly? Was anyone warranted in saying, without investigation, that nothing
could be done ? Would not the mere inquiry (if conducted in a proper spirit) into

the nature and extent of these evils and into their causes, be attended with beneficial
results ?

    If rightly considered, it would appear that all social evils and all defects in our in-
stitutions were to some extent causes of pauperism. The effects of these evils were
shifted from class to class, until they came upon those in the lowest place; but this

class had to bear them. He then showed that it was the especial duty of boards of

guardians, as a department of government, and as the department most directly con.

nected with pauperism, to institute careful inquiries into the causes of pauperism in
their respective districts. By an enlightened conception of their duty in this respect,
and by a conscientious discharge of it, boards of guardians would do infinitely more
for the diminution of poor-rates, and for the effectual removal of pauperism, than they

would ever effect by the hopeless task of attempting to make pauper labour self-

supporting.

    The careful conducting of such inquiries, if undertaken from a sense of duty, and
 if carried out with the single-minded object of arriving at truth, would have a most
 salutary influence on the entire administration of the poor laws. It would en-
 courage a spirit of enlightened benevolence, and put a check to the heartless selfish-
ness that was too often avowed and even carried out in poor-law administration

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

such selfishness as w.is manifest in the endless disputes about the settlement of pau-
 pers in England ; such selfishness as led to the transmission of paupers from England

and Scotland to Ireland ; such selfishness as led men to advocate any scheme of
emigration, of law of settlement, of arranging electoral divisions, provided it ended
in what was called " getting rid of the paupers," or provided it forced some one else
by an extra stimulus on his self-interest, " to get rid of his paupers." Notliing would
be so well caloulated to check such selfishness and to secure the adoption of sound

arrangements for the future, as for those immediately connected with the adminis-
tration of the poor law to undertake a comprehensive and enlightened investigation
into the causes of pauperism.

An --Investigation into the Question Is there really a want of Capital in

           Ireland? By Professor W. Neilson Hancock, LL.D.

   The Professor commenced by explaining that the phrase " want of capital," as used
by Sir George Nichols, Mr. Campbell Foster, Mr. Montgomery Martin, and other
writers on Ireland, really meant a deficiency in the sujiply of capital in proportion to
the demand for it. He noticed the erroneous opinions that capital is synonymous with
money, that capital is accumulated labour, that labour is capital, and that land is
capital. The errors respecting the consideration of labour and land as capital were
not mere verbal mistakes, but involved scientific, intellectual and moral evils. It
was the duty of scientific writers to adhere to the established nomenclature of any

science, the conclusions of which were used in discussing public questions. In poli-
tical economy, one of the chief results that had been established beyond controversy,
was the analysis of the price of a commodity into wages, profit and rent, founded on

--the distinction of the instruments of production into three labour, the use of capital,

and land ; it was therefore a serious error to confound these, as no one of them could

supply the place of another. A labourer could not use land as a spade or a plough,

or as food; neither could he subsist until harvest on labour, unless some capitalist
had food saved to give in exchange for his labour. Any confusion as to these fun-
damental, intellectual conceptions, placed a writer under serious disadvantages for
understanding or discussing a question. The moral evils of confounding labour and
land with capital were equally great. This error had led to the most unjust attacks
on the character of the poorer classes in Ireland. Thus, when the small holders of
land found it difficult to get employment from the abundance of labour, when the
tenure of their farms was so precarious that these tenants could raise no capital on
the security of their farms, they had been flippantly told that they did not want capi-
tal, since labour was capital and land was capital, and therefore that the bad culti-
vation did not arise from any cause but their own indolence.

   The most conclusive proof that the poorer classes in Ireland would save if their
wages enabled them to do so, was afforded by the large remittances sent by Irish
emigrants in America to their relatives in Ireland. This subject had been first no-
ticed by Mr. Robert Murray, chief Manager of the Provincial Bank in Ireland. In
a letter to Sir Robert Peel in 1847, he showed that these remittances had been in-
creasing for ten years prior to 1847, and in that year amounted to 125,000/., in 24,000

distinct remittances.
   Having thus disposed of ambiguities and erroneous theories, he then proposed to

ascertain whether the supply of capital was deficient in proportion to the demand
for it by the following tests:-- first, by observing the exports and imports of capital;
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                     107

and secondly, by observing the changes in the rate of profits. As to the exports
and imports of capital between Ireland and England, it appeared that the pnblic
funds might be transferred from the Bank of England to tiie Bank of Ireland and
back without expense, and that such transfer? were very frequent. The portion of
the public debt on which interest was paid in the Bank of Ireland might be assumed
to belong to Irishmen. Now, Mr. Stanley, the Secretary to the Irish Poor Law
Commissioners, in his Prize Essays on Ireland, had shown that from 1824 till 1831 tiie
quantity of public funds transferred to Ireland was about 14,000,000/., and the quan-
tity in the same time transferred from Ireland to England was about 6,000,000/. j
leaving 8,000,000/. funds held by Irishmen in 1831 more than in 18.24, and imply-

ing an export of capital of about a million a year for these eight years. Dr. Long-
field, in his address to the Dublin Statistical Society in 1849, had shown that in eight
vears ending in 1848, about 11,000,000/. worth of public funds were transferred from
England to Ireland,and about 4,000,000/. from Ireland to England; leaving 7,000,000/.
more funded property held by Irishmen in 1848 than in 1841, and showing an export
of capital from Ireland to England of 7,000,000/. in those eight years, including three
years of the famine. In 1 849 the transfer of funds from England exceeded that from
Ireland by about 300,000/. In 1850, for the first time for many years, the export of
capital from Ireland was stopped. In that year the funded property transferred to
Ireland was 1,160,000/., and from Ireland to England 1,970,000/.; giving a diminu-
tion in Irish funded property of 810,000/., and showing an importation of capital into
Ireland of that amount. The result of the long-continued export of capital from
Ireland to purchase funded property, was shown by the quantity of that property
held by Irishmen, which was as follows -.

Irish Courts of Equity  Б3,900,000

Irish absentees paying income tax .... 3,100,000

Residents in Ireland    31,000,000

                                                                               Total Б38,000,000

When it thus appeared that Irishmen had 38,000,000/. worth of funded property,

which could any moment be converted into money, it was preposterous to assert that
the supply of capital in Ireland was deficient in proportion to the demand for it. Ac-
cordingly, as soon as the parliamentary title of the Encumbered Estates Commissioners

afforded an opportunity for the safe investment of capital in Ireland, such capital was
invested to the extent of 1,000,000/., up to November 1850, in the purchase of
estates, besides what was invested in improvements. It appeared too that the pur-
chasers were chiefly Irishmen; for out of 587 purchasers, only 30 were from England

or Scotland.

   The second and more complete test of the supply of capital in any country in pro-
portion to the demand for it was, the changes in the rate of profit. It appeared that
the price of the funds had for many years been nearly the same in Ireland as in En-
gland; and consequently that the rate of profit, as distinct from insurance against
risk and wages of superintendence, was practically the same in England as in Ireland.
Hence the supply of capital in proportion to the demand for it was the same in En-
gland as in Ireland ; so that there had not been for many years any want of capital
in Ireland, as it was conceded that there was no such want in England. The con-
clusion thus arrived at wn'i of great importance, and led to results very suggestive of
future thought and investigation :

   1st. It showed the utter futility of all plans like Mr. Montgomery Martin's all-
sufficient circulating medium for improving the condition of Ireland by tampering

with the standard of value.

   2nd. It showed that, however deficient capital might be amongst many of the pau-
per tenantry and encumbered landlords, the scanty application of capital to the cul-
tivation of land in Ireland did not arise from any deficiency of capital amongst

Irishmen.

   3rd. It showed the absurdity of supposing that estates could not be bought, land
cultivated, or good done in Ireland without the introduction of English capital and
English capitalists.

   4th. It showed the necessity of looking beyond the superficial theories of the past
--108 REPORT 1851.

--to account for this remarkable state of Ireland, tliat there were thousands of able-

bodied labourers unable to get employment, thousands more on scanty wages of 6rf.
and 8rf. a day, millions of acres of improveable land lying wholly waste, millions more
badly cultivated, whilst more than 20,000 capitalists, all Irishmen, found it for their
interest to lend 38,000,000/., at about 3^ per cent, to the government of the richest
country in the world.

071 the Injluence of Discoveries in Science and Works of Art in developing
    the Condition of a People, as indicated hy the Census Operations of the

   United States. By J. C. G. Kennedy.

   The author stated that the Government of the United States had adopted the best
system, yet made available by any people, for eliciting those facts necessary for the
understanding of their true condition. The United States were the first to incorporate
the principle with their fundamental law. Other nations had taken censuses pre-
vious to tliem, but the object of such was mainly to learn their own availability in
a military point of view, or to know what amount of imposition might with safety
be placed on estates so as barely to preserve and not entirely destroy them ; but the
Government of the United States was actuated solely by the desire to know the true
condition of the people, in order to legislate with wisdom, and to know in what
things to encourage continuance, what error to abate, what abuse to correct. He
showed, that in 1790 they confined their inquiries to the number of the people of
different colours and condition, as free and slave; twenty years after they included
statistics relative to agriculture, manufactures and commerce ; now at the distance
of sixty years, they include, by a law made permanent, a collection of nearly all those
facts the development of which will illustrate their exact condition, as to numbers,
white, black, and mulatto, male and female, free and slave, at every age. The
present census, when fully com|)iled, will give the number of families, the number of
dwelling-houses, and the occupations, professions and trades of all persons; the
birthplace of each individual, the number married, widowed and single, the number
attending school, the number unable to read and write, the blind, deaf and dumb,
the insane, the idiotic, the paupers and convicts. With reference to the slave po-
pulation, they take the ages, sex, colour, the number voluntarily manumitted, the
number who have manumitted themselve.s, with the deaf and dumb, blind, insane,
and idiotic. They take an enumeration also of those who have died, their age, sex,
colour, condition, birthplace, profession or occupation, disease or cause of death, and
the number of days ill. In connexion with these statistics, they procure an account
from each county in the United States of its geological formation, its soil, rocks,

minerals, mountains, marshes, rivers, timber; its date of settlement, its date of
organization, the place of nativity of its first settlers, its canals, plank turnpikes, and
railroads, telegraph wires, banking institutions, insurance offices, their capital and

dividends.

   They enumerate the acres of improved and unimproved land belonging to each
farmer, its value, the value of his farming implements and machinery, the numbers
of each variety of live stock, its value and the product of his farm, specifying the
quantity of each variety. They enumerate the various manufactures and trades,
with the amount of capital invested in the business, the quantity and kind of raw
material used, the value of each, the kind of power used, the number of male and
female hands employed, the wages paid, and the various productions in quantity,
kind, and value. 'I'hey take the aggregate value of all personal and real estate of
each county, the kind and amount of taxes, the number of colleges, academies and
schools, the teachers and taught, with the revenues. They take an account of the
libraries, newspapers, and churches, with their number, character, circulation, and

value respectively.
   These elementary facets, it was contended, formed the only true basis of knowledge

with respect to a people, and that while they illustrated the exact condition of that
people in wealth, numbers, natural increase, health, longevity, and general comfort
in different locations at the same moment, they were so taken as to admit of com-
binations of interesting tabular arrangements rich and varied, for the use of the mo-

ralist, philosopher and statist of all countries.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  109

   Many of the developments of the census already made known were glanced at.
1st. The influence of the foreign population in their midst, which he contended was
of so pernicious a character, "that common humanity required of foreign nations
more attention to the education of their indigent population, if the subject was
viewed only as affecting the destinies of their people when scattered over the new

world, setting aside entirely its value to the peace, welfare, and happiness of those
at home." Mr. Kennedy affirmed that ignorance multiplied crime, and adduced
facts to prove, that to the ignorance and degradation of the foreign population in
America could they point as productive of the most terrible evils to themselves,
and as the cause of nearly all the pauperism and crime which could be shown to

exist in the northern states.

   He took a view of the proportion between sexes and colours, and the relative

increase of each, showing from the facts developed that the coloured population
would become rapidly extinct if immediate emancipation of slavery was to occur.

   He alluded to the advances made in the seeking out and providing for the deaf

and dumb, blind, insane and idiotic, paupers and criminals, and gave a gratifying
account of their progress. He dwelt at some length on the reciprocal advantages
arising from their protection of their manufactures, to their morals and agriculture,

estimating the capital invested in the former at 400,000,000 dollars, but that their
agricultural resources would justify a double amount of investment in manufactures,
to which they looked as the natural supporter of agriculture in all time to come;
that while England could purchase cheaper from the continent, they need not rely

on her as a great consumer; and that as things now were, tlie gold they dug in Ca╗
lifornia was " silently but surely passing through their own mints into those of
Europe for recoinage, and thence into the coffers of European capitalists."

   He next alluded to their principle of taxation, that on real estate, as the proper

one, and the only rational one, to induce persons to bring into cultivation the
immense bodies of wild land being accumulated by capitalists. In giving an account
of this important branch of their investigations, he dwelt on the extent and character
of education bestowed upon tiie youth of America, and exhibited its influence on
their morals and the good of the state, traced the origin of provision for education
in the several states, and their movements in its behalf up to the present time, when
there were in the schools of America two and a half millions of scholars and a school
fund of 30,000,000 dollars.

On the best Means of ascertaining the Number and Cojidition of the Infantile
          Idiots in the United Kingdom. By Edw. J. Tilt, M.D.

   At the last Meeting of the British Association at Edinburgh, it was suggested in a
paper read by Dr. Coldstream, " that it was advisable to obtain statistical information
as to the number of idiots in Great Britain." The knowledge to be tlius obtained is
still most desirable, and requisite to the due carrying forward of the work of forming
institutions for their relief. Since the last Meeting we have renewed proofs that the
Swiss cretin is in many cases capable, not only of relief, hut of cure. The late visit
of Dr. Guggenhiihl, the founder of the institution on the Ohendberg, has caused fresh
observations made on this subject to be made known and confirmed. He was unable
to remain in England to attend this Meeting, but he is very anxious that all possible
research should be continued concerning the numbers of those afflicted with the

malady in this country, and the degree of idiotcy to which they are reduced. He
made several journeys, through different counties of England, the result of which has

been partly made known in a " Letter addressed to Lord Ashley on some points of
Public Concern and Christian Legislation." Although the disease exists under dif-
ferent forms in different countries, yet in all its states it must always be considered
as the greatest calamity which can afflict a family or an individual ; and each country
is deeply concerned in ascertaining how far it may be relieved or cured, as well as in
what manner it may be averted or prevented by timely care. That it is a question
peculiarly affecting the present attention to sanitary measures both in towns and vil-
lages is undoubtedly evident. It may be denied by some that any true cretins exist
in England, although Dr. Guggenbiihl relates that " of 500 idiots lately discovered

in Lancashire, a considerable number are marked with the character of cretinism ; in
--110 REPORT 1851.

the village of Settle I detected some cases nearly identical with many of the cretins

of the Alps. In the village of Chiselborough in Somersetshire, most of its 350 in-
habitants are afflicted with goitre, are very subject to deafness, imperfect utterance,

and low degree of intelligence, which in as many as 24 individuals descends to

absolute cretinism." Idiotcy is generally allowed to be incurable, whilst cretinism
has been often cured, yet in all cases idiots are capable of some kind of amelioration.

This has been proved by Dr. Howe of Boston, United States, and the three insti-
tutions founded within the last few years in this country. At Park House, Highgate,

and at the branch institution at Essex Hall, Colchester, great relief has been afforded
and beneficial change effected in the state of the poor idiot children in regard to
health, behaviour, happiness, comfort, and even intelligence, for in many cases they
have been enabled to occupy themselves in various useful ways. The work of re-
storing the cretins has been carried on in Switzerland by one devoted individual
during the last ten years. Similar establishments are now rising up in several parts
of the continent. Three houses have been opened in this country for the poor idiot,
but the number of applicants far exceeds the vacancies ; to ascertain the numbers,
and to provide institutions, is now a work to be carried on, every effort hitherto made
having proved successful as far as the nature of the case admitted of relief or cure.

   In the discussion on this paper, Mr. Kennedy (Director of Statistics at Washington)
pointed out that in the last United States Census, the name and residence of every idiot
in the States was recorded, so as not only to show the number of idiots, but also to
give to charitable institutions the means of relieving them. Mr. J. Hancock and
Mr. Gowing also took part in the discussion.

MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

On the Duplex Rudder and Screw Propeller. By Capt. Carpenter.

The models represent views of a screw steamer constructed on what, after much

consideration, I have determined to call the duplex princiijle, namely, with two rud-

ders and two propellers for improved steering and propelling. To construct a vessel

on this plan, the dead wood, stern-post and rudder are removed from their former

position, and the midship keel, which before was placed in a straight and horizontal

line from stem to stern, is now made to rise up on a graduated scale from the mid-

ship section to the water-line of the midship part of the stern, where it terminates.

The additional keels lie in a parallel line with the midship keel, but placed at a di-

stance of two or more feet, according to the size of the vessel, on either side of it,

terminating near to the midship section in the fore-part, and in a line with the former

Astern-post in the after-part.  stern-post is placed at the end of the additional keels,

and upon each of them hangs a rudder. Framework is carried down to these keels

in proper architectural lines for speed, at the same time connecting the frame together,

so that the strength of the vessel is increased in the after section, where it is most

required in a screw steamer. Between this framework, a channel is formed for the

Awater to pass away freely in a direct line with the midship keel.  screw propeller

works in an orifice in each framework on the common arrangement. One of the

propellers is a little more aft than the other to allow fullplay to both, and yet eco-

nomize space in the mid- channel. The propellers turn each of them towards the

Acentre line of the vessel for propelling and the reverse way for backing.  steering-

wheel is placed on the deck in the usual way, and connected with the tillers, which

move the rudders together in parallel planes, or separately, as may be required. The

propellers can be lifted out of the water, for sailing, by means of a simple appara-

tus, which is placed on the deck for that purpose, or they may be feathered if pre-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                      Ill

ferred. This arrangement is found by experiments to have the best effect for steering

and propelling, although this new form of vessel admits of many variations of adapt-

ing the ordinary propeller or other propellers to it ; for example, the common pad-
dle-wheel may be placed on the sides of the vessel in the usual way, or the common

screw propeller may be placed between the framework, or sailing vessels may be

constructed on this principle. The advantages of the duplex rudder and screw pro-
peller may be considered under three heads : first, as regards the two rudders ; se-

cond, the two propellers                                                                                                               and third, the construction of the vessel.  To explain the
                                                                                                                                    ;

advantages fully of having two rudders to a vessel instead of one, it will be necessary

to refer to what has actually taken place practically on a model, as I have not

been able to make any experiments on a larger scale up to this time. The duplex

rudder has the power of turning the vessel about in the extremely short space of less

than once and a half of her own length, with the helm put hard over on starting,

Aand going full speed all the time till the circle has been completed.                                                                                                             single rudder

of the same size placed in a line with the midship keel on the same model, and pro-

pelled in the usual way with a screw propeller in the dead wood, will not turn a

vessel about in less than four and a half times her own length under similar circum-

stances. This fact shows the infinitely superior power and command there is over

a vessel at all times with the duplex rudder in comparison with that in general use,

and consequently that accidents by collision would be in a great measure prevented,

and the general safety of steam-vessels better secured by its adoption. Moreover,

as either of the rudders on the duplex principle can be used to steer with singly, it

is evident that, in the event of damaging either one or the other, the vessel would

be still under command, and therefore safe from immediate danger, when a vessel

fitted with a single rudder would be in a perilous position.

A proposed Railway Communication from the Atlantic to the Pacific in the

   Territories of British North America. By Alexander Doull, CE.

   The author prefaced his notice of the railway by a general view of the great public
questions which its construction involved, and remarked on the nature of Mr. Whit-
ney's project for the construction of a railway from Lake Michigan to the Pacific,
through the territory of the United States, which has deservedly attracted considerable

attention in England.
   The recent introduction of railways, and the application of steam power to navi-

gation, has very much altered, and will no doubt still further alter, the sj^stems of

travelling, and consequently the great leading feature of the day is the perfecting of
expeditious and cheap modes of travelling; and as there ever will exist a physical

impossibility of travelling as expeditiously, as comfortably, and as safely on the waters
of the ocean as on land, every effort will no doubt be made to shorten the distance
by sea, and to accommodate the land communication to the new arrangement.

  Halifax in Nova Scotia will therefore possess considerable advantages over New

York, in the United States, as the Atlantic terminus of a railway communication
across the continent of America, inasmuch as a line drawn from Cape Clear in Ire-

land to New York, would pass very close to Halifax ; and thus the whole of the
coasting distance of the sea passage from Halifax to New York would be saved.

   From Halifax to Quebec the line would follow the course selected by Major Ro-
binson of the Royal Engineers, and from Quebec it would be directed, as nearly as
circumstances would permit, to the northern extremity of Lake Superior, crossing
the Ottawa at the most convenient point below Lake Temiscaming.

   From Lake Superior the line would pass to the north of the Lake of the Woods,
иwhich portion of its route would pass through a rich mineral and agricultural di-
strict. Continuing through a very favourable country to the important Red River
settlement, and along the extended prairies south of the river Assiniboine, which por-
tion of the line for a considerable distance would pass nearly along the water-shed of
the country, there would be no bridges of any importance to construct; continuing
from Brandon House to Red-deer River, still keeping near the water-shed of the
country, and passing through a district where coal is found to crop out in the banks
of the rivers, and consequently easily worked.

   The passage of the Rocky Mountains is doubtless a point of considerable import-
112 REPORT 1851.

 ance, and one upon which it must be admitted there are no data for the formation of
any definite plan. All authorities, however, concur in viewing this barrier as much
 less formidable on the British than on the United States territory.

    Mr. Isbister is said to have found the rivers Athabasca and Saskachawau flowing
through alluvial formation, and that in their vicinity the Rocky Mountain chain had
 lost its identity, and was reduced to inconsiderable elevations of from 600 to 700 feet.

    Having crossed the Rocky Mountains, either by ascending to the summit upon the
 lateral spurs, or passing through by a tunnel, as circumstances might determine, the
 line would take the direction of Frazer's River to the Pacific Ocean.

    The numerous and spacious harbours in the vicinity of Vancouver's Island, together
 with a rare combination of maritime advantages and an abundant supply of coal,
point to this spot as the site of the future capital of the West.

    At first sight the selection of this line may appear a very formidable undertaking,
and doubtless it will require both energy and skill. The operation being rather an
extensive one, the most judicious plan would be to cut up the distance into sections
 by ascertaining and fixing the points at which the principal obstacles, such as rivers
and mountain ranges, would be crossed most easily. These sections would then be
treated as integral lines, although forming portions of the whole, and thus the ope-
ration would become much more manageable.

    Nearly the whole range of country through which the proposed line would pass
is admirably adapted for the purpose of affording numerous points at which to form
small settlements and to commence the work at several places at the same time, in
consequence of the existing facilities for water communication, and the many small

settlements already in existence.

    To construct an extensive railway, beginning at one end and working continuously
to the other, would entail much additional expense and render the progress very slow.

    The abundant supply of building materials which are found along the whole course
of this line, the rich agricultural and mineral districts, affording employment to the
various classes of emigrants, and also being the shortest possible route from Europe
to China across the great American continent, seem to point to this district as the
natural position of a land communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

    In reference to the various and almost boundless resources of the territory under
consideration, better authority cannot be desired than that furnished by the cele-
brated report of the Earl of Durham upon the affairs of British North America.

   But however great the resources of any country may be, without the means of in-
ternal communication these resources must remain undeveloped. So intimately
does the prosperity of any country depend upon the introduction of roads, that this
one class of improvements has always been held as an unerring criterion of the de-
gree of civilization and prosperity to which it has attained.

   With respect to the ways and means by which this gigantic project is to be carried
out, it has been stated that the construction of the first portion, amounting to about
700 miles, has been guaranteed by the Imperial Government ; and in reference to
the remaining portion, the varied circumstances of the territory passed through

dense primseval forests of the best timber, rich mineral districts, already partially

--occupied, and extensive tracts of agricultural and grazing land, alternating along the

proposed route, clearly indicate the varied resources by which the road must be

constructed.
   Those portions passing through the primaeval forests of timber of superior quality,

must be paid for by the timber upon the ground, and also the land when cleared,
and that not by cutting down the timber in the first instance, but by merely cutting
a passage for the railway, and opening out an extensive traffic in timber, superseding
altogether the present laborious, unmechanical, barbarous system of " lumbering,"
which destroys a great proportion of the limber, and damages to a considerable ex-

tent the remaining quantity.

   The mineral and agricultural districts must in the same manner be made to pay
for the construction of the line passing through them.

   The breadth of land necessary for this purpose can only be ascertained by a care-
ful examination of the several localities, comparing the difficulties of construction
with the remunerative character and capabilities of the particular district.

           On the Constmction of Iron Vessels exposed to sei'^ere strain.

                     By William Fairbairn, C.E., F.R.S.

    In the construction of vessels, such as boilers, pipes, &c., exposed to severe inter-
nal pressure, it is desirable to obtain some knowledge of the strength and condition

of the material used, and some fixed rules calculated to enable us to judge vf\t\\ ac-

curacy as to the disposition of the parts in order to apply the greatest strength in the

direction of the greatest strain, and, in fact, so to dispose of the material in order

that every part of the vessel shall balance itself in its power of resistance when sub-

jected to uniform pressure.

   To attain these objects, the author gave the results of his experiments on the re-
sistance of malleable iron plates first announced to the British Association, and sub-
sequently published in the Transactions of the Royal Society. These experiments

were originally undertaken to determine the strength of metal plates, beams, and

angle-iron, as applied to ship-building ; and they have since been continued, from

time to lime, for the equally important purpose of improving the construction of
malleable iron bridges, boilers, and other vessels, such as caissons and sheet-iron

pipes, which are now coming into more general use for pump trees and other arti-

cles connected with mining.

    In order to acquire satisfactory data on the strength of the material employed, a

variety of plateS from Low Moor, Staffordshire, and other parts, were submitted to

direct experiment ; first, by tearing them asunder in the direction of the fibre ; and

secondly, across it. The tensile strength per square inch was ascertained to be as

follows :

                                 In the direction of the fibre.  Across the fibre.

           Yorkshire plates . .         = 2].-68                       18-65
                                                                       20-00
           Derbyshire plates            = 22-82                        21-01

           Shropshire plates
           =Staffordshire plates
                                        19-56

                             Mean in tons 22-16     Tons 22-29

From this it will be observed that there is no difference in the strength of iron

plates, whether torn in the direction of the fibre or against it ; and this uniformity of

strength probably arises from the superior manner in which that article is now

manufactured.

The experiments would however be imperfect as regards construction, if they had

not been extended to the process of riveting; and on this point our information has

been of the most meagre description. Until of late years many of our numerous

constructions have been conducted under the impression that the riveted joint was

not only strong, but absolutely stronger than the plate itself; whereas more than

one-third of the strength is lost by that process.

   To prove the fallacy of these views, it was ascertained by experiment that the
strength of iron plates, as compared with their riveted joints, was not only weak-

ened to the extent of the quantity of metal punched out to receive the rivets, but

that in the following ratios, viz. as 1000 : 700 in the double-riveted joint, and

100 : 560 in the single-riveted joint.

   From the above facts practical formulae have been deduced to show, that the
maximum resistance of single-riveted plates does not exceed 27,000 lbs. to the square

inch ; but taking into account the crossing of the joints and other circumstances

peculiar to sound construction, 34,000 lbs. or 15 tons per square inch has been found

to be the maximum strength of riveted plates, such as those used for boilers and

similar constructions.

   In conclusion, attention was directed to several important improvements in con-
nection with the construction of steam-boilers, by the introduction of gussets, to
strengthen the flat ends and retain them in shape. After noticing that all boilers
should be of the cylindrical form, Mr. Fairbairn observed that when flat ends are
used they should be composed of plates one-half thicker than those which form the
circumference. The flues, if two in number, to be of the same thickness as the ex-
terior shell, and the flat ends to be carefully stayed with gussets of triangular plates
and angle-iron, connecting them with the circumference and the ends.

   T he use of gussets is earnestly recommended as being infinitely superior to and
more certain in their action than stay- rods. They should be placed in lines diver-
ging from the centre of the boiler, and made as long as the position of the flues and
other circumstances in the construction will admit. They are of great value in re-
taining the ends in shape, and may safely be relied on as imparting an equality of

strength to every part of the structure.

            On Railway Chairs and Compressed Wood Fastenings.
                          By Charles May, F.R.A.S.

   The author brought these observations forward with a view to giving information
to such persons as might incline to visit the manufactory of them at the Orwell
Works, which would be open to any visitors to the British Association.

   The chairs were those used upon narrow gauge lines with cross sleepers, and the
mode of casting effected great accuracy, so that each was practically a counterpart
of the rest ; and so extensively had this system been adopted, that more than fifty
railways had been supplied with them.

   The fastenings are those pieces of wood called treenails and wedges ; the former

being used as nails to fasten the chairs to the sleepers, sind the latter to secure the
rails in the chairs.

   Mr. May described the structure of wood as a bundle of tubes of irregular shape,
which, when emptied of the sap by drying, might be squeezed together into a smaller

bulk, just as a bundle of leaden pipe might be compressed ; but in the case of wood,
which is elastic, it is found necessary to keep the compressing power on it for some
time, or it would more or less re-expand ; if, however, during the continuance of the
compressing force, a small degree of heat is applied, the wood takes a " set," which
is permanent as long as the article is kept dry ; but the power of capillar)' attraction
not being destroyed by the process, the fastenings, when used upon the railways,
expanded like a cork driven into a bottle, and this kind of elastic fastening was found
to produce not only increased security as compared with other modes of fastening,
but also a smoother motion in the carriages.

   The same mode of compression is adopted for the treenails of ships, and from a
series of experiments made by a Committee appointed by the Admiralty, it appeared
that these compressed treenails had 29 per cent, more transverse and 60 per cent,
more adhesive strength than those in ordinary use yet even these advantages had

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

On the Application of Chilled Cast Iron to the Pivots of Astronomical In-
                   struments. By Charles May, F.R.A.S.

   In laying before this Section a few observations on this subject, some preliminary
remarks on the process of chill casting and its previous application to other purposes
seem to be requisite.

   " It has long been known that if a mould for casting iron be made of iron, or
partly of iron and partly of sand, that portion of the casting which has run against
the iron becomes what is technically termed ' chilled,' and is indicated by a white
crystalline structure to a depth depending upon various conditions of temperature
of the mould and the metal run into it, as well as of the chemical composition of the
iron. The practical utility of chill casting depends on the fact, that the part thus

rendered crystalline is of extreme hardness, nearly equal to that of hardened steel

whilst the remainder of the casting may be as soft as iron cast in the ordinary sand-

moulds.
    " The rationale of the effect thus produced is not well understood ; cast iron is a

compound of iron with variable proportions of carbon, and these proportions have
not, as I believe, been j'et reduced to anything like atomic order : some statements
give as much as 15 per cent, of carbon in verj' soft pig iron, and such iron exhibits
very little or no tendency to chilling. Practical experience is at present the only
guide to the production of the desired effect ; in some cases a very thin hard stratum
is desired, in others a considerable depth ; and this stratum may be varied from an
almost imperceptible white line to half or three-quarters of an inch in depth, this latter
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                115

being required in the large rolls for making the finest thin sheet iron. Chemically
speaking, cast iron and steel are of the same composition, viz. iron with a propor-
tion of carbon ; the proportion of the latter in cast iron being infinitely greater than
in steel. Here I would point out a remarkable difference between chilled cast iron
and steel. If the latter is heated red-hot and plunged into cold water it becomes
extremely hard ; if in this state it be again heated, it resumes its original softness ;
but if chilled iron be so treated it still retains its hardness. Whether this is caused
by mere mechanical arrangement or by the chemical combination of the atoms,
whether there be a metallic base of carbon in one case and not in the other, or by
whatever these diflferences are caused, is far too little understood ; the whole subject
is one deserving the close attention of those whose pursuits enable them to study
chemical analysis. Indeed, when we reflect on the fact, that without the peculiar
properties of iron and carbon, civilization could not have been carried on, it does
appear strange that the master-minds of the age have not acquired more knowledge
                                              these two substances. It would be  foreign
of  the relative action and  combinations of  mode of manufacturing steel, but
to  our present object to    enter upon the                                      I may

state the fact, that it is extremely difiicult to procure any masses that are of uniform
density, whilst chill cast iron is easily produced with large homogeneous surfaces,
and this brings me to the main subject proposed for your attention, viz. the appli-
cation of it to the pivots of astronomical instruments. About four years since the
Astronomer Royal applied to my partners and self respecting the construction of the
mechanical parts of a new meridional instrument, the size of which so greatly ex-
ceeded anything of the same kind, that it became a serious question of what mate-
rial the pivots should be made : it was requisite that it should be both hard to resist
wear as much as possible, and homogeneous to ensure that whatever wear took place

should be uniform.                                 .
    "The extensive use we make of chill cast iron suggested, that if the pivots were so
cast with the body of the axis in sand mould and all run together, an instrument
might be produced combining all the requisite qualifications. This has been suc-

cessfully accomplished, and the great transit circle or meridian instrument is now at
work in the Royal Observatory to the satisfaction of the Astronomer Royal, on

whose designs the whole has been constructed."
   After a rigid examination of the form of the pivots, the Astronomer Royal has

concluded that no correction for the shape of the pivots is required. Specimens of
trial castings for the pivots were laid before the meeting.

Description of an Improved Safety Valve. By James Nasmyth, F.R.A.S,

   Mr. Nasmyth described his improved safety valve for steam-boilers, in which he
sought to combine simplicity of construction and efficacy of action with the utmost
security which a safety valve can afford against explosion arising from undue pres-
sure. He prefaced his description by alluding to the main source of derangement
and uncertainty in the action of safety valves as hitherto constructed, namely, the
employment of a conical bearing surface in the valve and in its seat, which renders
the use of a spindle and guide-socket requisite so as to constrain the valve to rise
from its seat in a direction absolutely vertical to the seat or bearing. This gФide-
spindle to be of any service has to fit the socket in which it works with considerable
precision, in consequence of which any mud or incrustation which may chance to
get upon the spindle of the valve tends to prevent its rise and so far arrest its action.
In order to remove this serious defect, a spherical bearing has been employed, which,
by permitting the valve to fit its seat in any position, dispenses with the necessity of
any guide or spindle. The grand feature in Mr. Nasmyth's improvement, however,
consists in the peculiar mode by which a constant shght movement is given to the
valve in its seat by employing the motion of the water during ebullition so to act
upon the valve as to furnish the means of preventing its ever becoming set fast in

 its seat.

    This important object is attained in the most simple manner by attaching to the
 bottom of the weight, which hangs down imide the boiler (and which weight is
 attached to the valve by an inflexible rod), a sheet- iron appendage, which dipping a
 few inches into the water, transfers the constant swaying motion of the water to the

                                                                                                         8*

valve in its seat, and so keeps it constantly free and ready to rise whenever the pres-
sure attains the required force.

   Mr. Nasmyth exhibited several diagrams drawn by the valve itself, which gave
the most clear evidence of the existence and nature of the motion which the valve
derives from the action of the water on the sheet-iron appendage before named.
These diagrams were obtained by attaching a pencil to the top of the valve, and per-
mitting it to draw upon a card such figures as resulted from the slight but incessant
motion of the valve. The perfect action of this valve has led to its extensive

adoption.

On a Direct Actio?i Steam-Fan for the more perfect Ventilatio7i of Coal Mines.
                     By James Nasmyth, C.E., F.R.A.S..

    Mr. Nasmyth exhibited drawings and gave a description of his direct action steam-
fan which he' had contrived and arranged for the purpose of improving the ventila-
tion of coal mines. The fan is one of the most efficient and simple agents for moving
great masses of air, and operating through the agency of centrifugal action ; the
quantity of air which it can draw in at its central opening is exactly equal to what
it can blow out or distribute from its circumference ; and although we are most fami-
liar with the action of fans as blowing agents, yet the suction powers of fans are
equally effective, and it is this suction power which Mr. Nasmyth proposes to em-
ploy as the means for the better ventilation of coal mines. In this respect the appli-

 cation of fans for the jiurpose in question is not novel ; but the efficiency of these

powerful and otherwise simple machines has been much impeded by the complex
and troublesome apparatus which has hitherto been employed for transmitting the
 required high rotative velocity to them, such as by the use of straps, belts and
pulleys, and other agents employed in converting the slow motion of a long-stroked
 engine into the high velocity of rotation required by such fans.

    The chief feature of novelty in the fan proposed by Mr. Nasmyth, consists in the
 application of a short-stroke steam-engine working direct on to the spindle or axis
 of the fan, on the end of which the crank of the engine is placed ; by this system of
 arrangement all intermediate gearing and machinery is done away with, and the
 power of the steam made to act in the most direct manner on the fan. The dia-
meter of the fan described by Mr. Nasmyth is 6 feet, the stroke of the engine 4 inches
 the diameter of the cylinder of the engine being 12 inches, this, worked with steam
 of a pressure of 30 lbs. to the square inch, produces a rate of motion on the fan of
 650 revolutions per minute ; and as the fan blades are 2 feet wide, the rate of dis-
 charge in cubic feet per minute is equal to 23,000 ; and as the ingress apertures at
 each side of the fan are in direct communication with the up-cast shaft of the mine,
 a corresponding quantity of air will descend the down-cast shaft and pervade the
 workings. An important advantage of this mode of ventilation will be, that the ven-
 tilating agent, namely, the fan, is at all times visible, open to inspection, being placed
 on the surface of the ground, and in that respect free from danger ; and even in the
 event of any explosion in the pit, the means of reventilating is by its means at hand.

 On a Method of condensing Steam in Marine Engines, at present eftnployed
    in several Steam Vessels in the Bristol Channel. By Joseph T. Price

     of Neath Abbey.

    It is well known that Boulton and Watt, when they took out their patent for
 their steam-engine, tried the effect of surface condensers, and proved the superiority
 of condensing by a jet of water in land engines ; but it is also well known that at
 that period marine engines for giving motion to ships on rivers and the sea had not
 been used. Had marine engines been in use at that time, it may fairly be supposed
 that Boulton and Watt would not have omitted to show the adaptation of the cold
 water through which a vessel passes to the purpose of condensation and feeding the
 boiler with hot water freed from salt, &c.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  ll'J

   The employment of muddy and salt water for condensation of steam and for
maintaining a vacuum in marine engines is well known to be disadvantageous, so
much of the power of the engine being employed in the process of exhaustion by

the air-pump.
   The application of the screw-propeller for a ship at sea has called attention to the

means most simple and effective for obtaining for such propellers a rapid motion,
whereby to ensure high speed for the ship.

   These are among the considerations which have led to the discovery that the steam,
after it has exerted its power on the piston, may be condensed instantly by being
conducted into a receiver or receivers placed longitudinally vj^ithin a vessel, and on
each side, filled after the manner of tubular boilers, with metallic tubes inserted into

metallic plates of ample substance to ensure perfect tightness, and each end of which
is connected with the water of the sea or river by a bent tube and apertures made

in the sides of a ship or vessel.
   This method has been for several years adopted to great advantage.

   " It was mentioned by myself to the Mechanics' Section of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science two years since, when their Annual Meeting was held
at Swansea, but it was named only incidentally in "the course of some discussion on
marine engines, and I am not aware that it has ever claimed the attention which
further experience has shown it merits. I therefore avail myself of the occasion which
is now presented to me to place before the view of the meeting facts fairly proved
by the Neath Abbey Iron Company as makers, and myself as associated with them,
and as an owner of several of these marine engines ; that even high steam may be
safely employed in such vessels in what, for facility of description, I will call loco-
motive boilers ; that such steam gives a rapid motion to the piston, and that this
action may be conveyed direct to the crank, giving motion to a shaft and propeller
without any multiplying wheel ; that the steam so employed may be condensed by
being at once conveyed from the cylinder into the receiver within the vessel, furnished

with metallic tubes, through Xvhicli the water of a river or the sea shall rapidly pass
that such water so passing through the tubes of a receiver maintains coldness to a
great extent in the interior of such receiver ; that the steam passing from the cylinder
into such receiver becomes instantly, condensed, though still retaining heat enough
for advantageously feeding the boiler with fresh water ; that by these means little
or no vacuum can be obtained independently of the power of the engine employed in
other vessels in working the air-pump ; that the water so condensed is again, by
pumping, transferred to the boiler, and that thus the supply of fresh water taken in

at starting serves, as far as I have proved it, for a voyage from port to port for one
day ; that hereby the boiler is kept free from salt or mud, and does not require to
be blown out to clear it from salt, and thus time and power are further oeconomized

and that under all these circumstances a higher speed may be acquired for a vessel
with the same size cylinder and boiler, and an ceconomy of fuel to a considerable

extent is the result.

   " I have a steamer, called the Princess Royal, on this principle in daily use in the
Bristol channel, where the advantages of this method of condensing are obvious.
The fuel consumed is not more than two-thirds of that used in a timber vessel with
engines of equal power on the old plan, running the same distance ; the speed of
this iron vessel is greater by one-third, and its power to carry cargo nearly doubled.

   " I have also two small passenger-boats on the Bristol dock basin, plying from Bris-
tol to the Hot Wells, the Expert and Express, the engines of which are on the same
condensing principle. Large condensers may exert a partial vacuum. The respec-
tive forms of the two vessels proves this result."

              On Mechanism to explain the Pendulum Experiment.
                         By Richard Roberts, C.E.

   The first model, by reference to which Mr. Roberts explained his view of the sub-
ject, consisted of a railway upon a board, mounted on three balls, as feet, and upon
that board a smaller board was mounted on four wheels like a railway waggon ; upon
the waggon a swan-necked piece of iron was secured, the upper end of which was
bored to receive an axle representing a prolongation of the imaginary ajcis of the earth.
118 REPORT 1851.

To the lower end of the iron axle a portion of a brass sphere was attached in such a
manner as would admit of a dial- plate divided into 24 parts, to represent as many
hours, being brought with its centre vertically over the north pole, where it might
be fixed by a thumb-screw within the sphere, or at any latitude down to the equator.
To the upper end of the axle was fixed a pulley, having two grooves, round each of
which, in contrary directions, a small cord was passed, which was then carried
through a small hole into the interior of the pulley, where it was secured. The ends
of the cord were fastened tight to pillars secured one to each end of the bottom board.
By this arrangement the model sphere was made to rotate by moving the waggon
along the railway. Attached to the waggon, and exactly coinciding with the centre
of the sphere, was an universal joint, from which a radial bar of steel extended through
and a little above the dial, where it received a steel cross-bar that might be set in
any direction to represent the plane of the pendulum's oscillations. Mr. Roberts
contended that the phrenomena in nature happened as this model showed, viz. that
the pendulum would perform a revolution in 24 hours in all latitudes above 45░, or
even a little below that latitude, after which it would reciprocate.

   The second model consisted of a quadrant, upon the edge of which was a brass
dial divided into 24 parts to represent hours. Upon a pin or stud, fixed in the centre
of the dial, was a pointer, to one extremity of which a plummet was suspended, the
object of which was to keep the pointer parallel to any plane that the pendulum might
be caused to oscillate in ; whilst the plummet will always be in the direction of the
centre of the earth's gravity. To show the operation of the pendulum in all latitudes,
the quadrant had been mounted upon a stand with pieces of wood jointed in such a
manner that the parallelism of the pendulum to any plane in space might be seen by

inspection of the model.

On an Improved Modification of the Reservoir for Gold Pens.
                   By James Thomson, C^.

A slightly w^orn quill pen is generally esteemed the best instrument for affording

quickness and ease in writing. The leading objection to steel pens is that they

scratch the paper ; if not when new, certainly after they have been exposed for a
short time to the corrosive action of the ink. In gold pens the points may be made

of any foim, either fine or blunt ; but if they be made as blunt as would be desirable
to imitate the slightly worn quill pen, it is found that the ink is discharged in much

too great quantity on the paper, and that thus the writing is blotted, and inconve-

niently frequent dipping of the pen is required. The reason why the capillary at-

traction has so much less power to hold up the ink in the gold pen than in the quill

one, is to be found in the difference of form of the two pens. In the gold pen the

part to which the ink adheres requires to be tapered very much to produce the re-

quisite flexibility in so rigid a material. In the quill pen, on the other hand, the

semicylindrical part extends very nearly to the point, and contains the upper part of

the drop of ink. The hollow form thus given to the surface of the drop of ink in the

quill pen has, according to the laws of capillary attraction, a powerful tendency to

sustain the ink, while the convex form of the drop in the gold pen tends to force the

ink down on the paper.

The objections thus arising to the gold pens may, however, be more than obviated

by the application of a reser\'oir consisting of a plate or tongue of gold placed in the

Nowhollow of the pen so as to cover the part to which the ink adheres.  a reservoir

nearly fulfilling all the conditions that could be desired has been for some time in

use, having been patented by Mr. Riddle and manufactured by Mr. Mordan. There

are however some objections to which that particular form of reservoir is subject.

It does not, for instance, admit of being opened wide enough to be easily cleaned

and from its large size it contains more ink than it can hold up with sufficient force.

The new modification, which is the subject of the present paper, is free from these

objections and appears to be decidedly an improvement. There is a plate or tongue
