Report of the Proceedings of the Council in 18.52-53, a8 presented
  TO the General Committee at Hull, Wednesday, Sept.7th, 1853.

    " 1. With reference to the subjects referred to the Council by the General
Committee at Belfast, the Council have to report as follows :

   " 2. The Committee appointed for the purpose of ' considering a plan by
which the Transactions of different Scientific Societies might become part of
one arranged system, and the records of facts and phaenomena be rendered
more complete, more continuous, and more systematic than at present,' has
obtained from the greater part of its members written communications em-
bodying their respective opinions on the subject in question, and it is pro-
posed that on the return from Italy of Professor Thomson, the originator of
the resolution, these communications shall be discussed and a report pre-

pared.

   "3. On the request of the General Committee being communicated to the

President and Council of the Royal Society, it was ordered by them that the
Huyghenian object-glass of 123 feet focus should be mounted as an aerial
telescope in the same manner as when employed in 1719 by Pound and
Bradley. The superintendence of the mounting has been undertaken by

Mr. De la Ruo.

    " 4. In conspqiience of a communication from the President of the British
Association to the President and Council of the Royal Society, a Committee
was formed for the purpose of taking such steps as they should deem most
desirable to procure the establishment in the Southern Hemisphere of a Te-
lescope of large optical power for the observation of the southern nebulae.

--The Committee consisted of the following persons ; The Earl of Rosse, Pre-
REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                              XXV

sident of the Royal Society, Chairman ; Lord Wrottesley, Sir John Lubbock,
Bart., Sir John Herschel, Bart., the Dean of Ely, J. C. Adams, Esq.,

G. B. Airy, Esq., Sir David Brewster, E. J. Cooper, Esq., W. Lassell, Esq.,

J. Nasmyth, Esq., John Phillips, Esq., Rev. Dr. Robinson, and the Officers and
Council of the Royal Society. The Committee have conducted their pro-

ceedings partly by meetings and partly by printed correspondence; and
having decided on the nature and size of the Telescope and the mode of

mounting which they deemed most advisable, they appointed a deputation to

communicate with the Earl of Aberdeen, with a view to obtaining the sanc-

tion of Her Majesty's Government, and the requisite funds for the construc-

tion of the Telescope ; the Council have learned with satisfaction that the
Deputation was very favourably received by Lord Aberdeen, and they have

reason to entertain the hope that the necessary funds for the construction of

the Telescope will be included in the estimates presented to Parliament in its

next session.

   "5. The resolution of the General Committee recommending that the

publication of the Townland Survey of Ireland, upon the scale of an inch to
a mile, should be accelerated, has been communicated to the Master- General

of the Ordnance, and a favourable reply received.

"6. In compliance with the resolution directing the Council to solicit the

cooperation of the Royal Society in meteorological investigations attainable

by balloon ascents, a communication was addressed to the President and

Council of the Royal Society, which was most cordially received, and four

such ascents have been made under the direction of the Kew Observatory

Committee, by the aid of funds placed at their disposal by the Royal Society.

A highly satisfactory account of these ascents, and of the results obtained, is

given in a communication to the Royal Society, drawn up by Mr. Welsh by

whom the observations were conducted, of which communication 500 copies

have been presented to the British Association.
    " 7. Respecting ' a series of experiments on a large scale on the thermal

effects experienced by air in rushing through small apertures,' a representa-

tion, as recommended, has been made to the Royal Society, and a grant of

Б100 from the Government Fund at the disposal of the Royal Society has

been made to Messrs. Thomson and Joule, for the necessary apparatus.
   " 8. The recommendation of the General Committee, that, in the event of

a survey of the Gulf stream being undertaken, provision should be made for

investigating its zoology and botany, has been communicated to the Hydro-

Agrapher of the Admiralty and favourably received.  proposition from Dr.

Bache, Director of the Coast Survey of the United States, for a joint survey

of the Gulf-stream by the United States and Great Britain, having been

addressed to the President of the British Association since the Belfast meet-

--ing, has been forwarded to the Hydrographer of the Admiralty, and has given

rise to the following correspondence :

the British Association, over which you presided, I observe a recommendation

Awhich refers to a ' Survey of the Gulf-stream.'   systematic survey of the

Gulf-stream at and below the surface, for hydrographic purposes, was com-

menced in connexion with the survey of the coast of the United States, under

my direction, in 184'4, and has been continued, as means served, each season

since, and we have now carried the examination by sections perpendicular to

the stream from off the capes of New York to Cape Hatteras. Might it not

  --Ф < Sir, I beg leave to enclose the copy of a letter which, as President

of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, I have received
from Dr. Bache, Director of the Coast Survey of the United States of North

America.
   " ' The recommendation of a ' Survey of the Gulf-stream,' referred to by

Dr. Bache, is contained in the accompanying address of the President at the
commencement of the Belfast Meeting of the British Association ; the para-
graph (page 19) is marked, and is to be taken in connexion with the pre-
ceding paragraph, referring to the correspondence which has recently taken
place between the British and United States Governments and the British
Government and the Royal Society of London, on the subject of a conjoint
investigation into the currents and temperatures of the ocean by the ships of
both nations under their respective hydrographic offices.

   " ' It is possible that the British Government may have acceded to the pro-
position to this effect made to them by the Government of the United States,
and strongly recommended in the report wliich the Earl of Malmesbury re-
quested from the President and Council of the Royal Society ; and that the
department of the Admiralty over which you preside may have received
directions to communicate accordingly with the Hydrographic Office of the
United States; in this case you may be able to inform me at once to whom
I should recommend Dr. Bache to address himself.

   " ' Should, however, no such directions have yet issued, it appears to me

most desirable that I should place Dr. Bache's letter in your hands, to be
communicated, should you think proper to do so, to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty ; manifesting as it does, the desire which is felt by a gentle-

man in his high official position in the United States, to cooperate with the
British Navy in accomplishing a ' systematic survey of the Gulf-stream for

hydrographic purposes,' in consonance with the general plan proposed by the
Government of the United States to Her Majesty's Government.

                                             " ' 1 have the honour to be. Sir,

                                                               for the Advancement of Science.'

 --" ' Sir, I have to thank you for the Copy of Dr. Bache's letter, which

shows how rapidly every useful jiroject in art or science is taken up in the
United States, and then how energetically it is pushed forward. With
respect to its immediate subject, you have long known that a thorough
examination of the Gulf-stream has been, in my estimation, an object of great
importance to navigation, and you may be therefore sure that whenever, and
                           REPORT OF THE COUNCIIi.                                   XXVll

by whomsoever it may be undertaken, no effort of mine will be wanting to

contribute to its success.

   " и I confess, however, that I do not at once perceive how the two countries

could profitably cooperate in the work ; but there is no use in discussing the

modus operandi till the Admiralty think proper to give me some direct orders

to consider and report upon the subject, which has not yet been done.
                                         " ' I have the honour to be. Sir,
                                                    " ' Your most obedient Servant,

" ' Colonel Sabine, H.A.,  " ' F. Beaufort, Hydrographer^
         Woolwich.'

                                                                                  " ' London, May 6, 1853.

  --" 'My dear Sir, I have this day received, and at once transmit to you

a copy of, the British Hydrographer's reply to my letter of November 10th,

1852, enclosing a copy of your letter to me on the subject of a joint survey
of the Gulf-stream by the United States and this country. You will see by

Sir Francis Beaufort's letter that he fully concurs with you in recognizing

the great importance to navigation of such a survey, and that no effort on his

part is likely to be wanting to contribute to its success, whensoever it shall

be undertaken.

" ' You have probably seen by a discussion which took place in the House

of Lords, on Tuesday the 26th of April, that Lieut. Maury's proposition for

an extensive system of Hydrographical inquiry, to be carried out conjointly

by the ships of the two nations, has been favourably received by Her

Majesty's Government, and the measures required for British cooperation are

now under consideration.

" 'The part which this country might take in a survey of the Gulf-stream

must necessarily be under the direction of the Hydrographer ; and conse-

quent on instructions received by him from the Admiralty. It is to be

inferred from Sir Francis Beaufort's reply that it does not consist with the

practice of his department to communicate to the Admiralty the fact that the

Director of the Coast Survey of the United States has expressed a desire to

undertake the survey of the Gulf-stream conjointly with Great Britain.

Under these circumstances the best suggestion which I am able to make to
you, in reply lo your question to whom your proposition should be made, is,
that you should take the same course which Lieut. Maury has done, viz. that

the proposition should proceed through your own Secretary of State, and the

American Minister in this country, to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, by whom it will be communicated to the proper executive

Department, and an official reply returned.

   " ' I think that I may safely and confidently assure you that any assistance

which the British Association for the Advancement of Science can give in

furtheranceof a proposition of so much scientific as well as maritime import-

ance, will be most readily given.
                                  " ' Believe me, most sincerely yours,

                                                   " ' Edward Sabine,

  " 9. An application, as directed by the General Committee, has been made

to the Master-General and Board of Ordnance to supply instruments for
measuring the direction and amount of earthquake vibrations in the Ionian
Islands, and instructions have in consequence been issued for the construction

of the necessary instruments.

   " 10. With reference to the resolutions regarding the Agricultural Statistics
of Great Britain, the Committee appointed to carry out the wishes of the
xxviii  --REPORT 1853.

General Committee have reported to the Council, that having ascertained
that measures having those objects in view had already been adopted by Her
Majesty's Government, they have confined themselves to an expression of
satisfaction therewith, and of readiness to afford any practicable aid on the

part of the British Association.

   "11. On the subject of a grant in aid of the publication of Mr. Huxley's

zoological and physiological researches in H.M.S. Rattlesnake, the Council
have to report that the application made in the last year by the Presidents
of the Royal Society and of the British Association to the Earl of Derby,
has been renewed in the present year to the Earl of Aberdeen by the Earl of

Rosse, on behalf of both institutions. No reply has yet been received. The

Council desire to take this occasion of calling the attention of the General

Committee to the want which has been felt in this instance, as in many others,
of suitable and systematic arrangements on the part of Government for the
due publication of the results of scientific researches executed at the public
expense by naval officers acting under the instructions of the Admiralty.

    " 12. The Council, having been directed by the General Committee to take
into consideration the expediency of procuring copies of M. Dove's Maps
and Memoir on the Distribution of Heat over the Surface of the Globe, made
arrangements for obtaining from M. Dove 250 copies of the maps from the
original stones, and have directed them to be bound up with a translation of
M. Dove's Memoir, presented by Colonel Sabine, to be disposed of to mem-
bers of the Association at the cost price of the plates, the printing, and the

binding.
    " 13. In reference to the resolutions respecting the proposed cooperation

of the British Association in recommending to Her Majesty's Government,
in conjunction with the Royal Geographical Society, the examination of a
portion of the eastern coast of Africa, the exploration of the countries around
the river Magdalena with a view to their natural products, and the ascent of
the river Niger to its source, much delay was experienced from the circum-
stance that no papers whatsoever relative to those subjects were given at the
close of the Belfast Meeting to the Assistant General Secretary, and that the
Council were unable subsequently to procure such memorials, embodying
such statements of the objects and grounds of the recommendation, as it is

the practice of the British Association to obtain in all cases of application

to Government and to the East India Company. The subjects were thus

necessarily left in the hands of the Royal Geographical Society.
   " 14. The Council have great pleasure in expressing their conviction of

the increased and increasing usefulness of the establishment at Kew, and
subjoin the report which they have received from the superintending Com-
mittee. The Council recommend a continuation of a grant to this establish-
ment to the same amount as in the last year.

   " 15. The Council have been informed that the invitations formerly re-
ceived by the British Association from Liverpool and Glasgow, to hold the
meetings of the next two years at those places, will be renewed by deputa-
tions appointed to attend at Hull for that purpose. They have also been
informed that it is the intention of the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of

Gloucester, to present on the same occasion an invitation to the British

Association to hold an early meeting in that city."

   The Report of the Kew Committee, signed by J. P. Gassiot, Esq., Chair-

man, referred to in the Report of the Council, was read and ordered to be
entered in the Minutes. It is as follows ;
                 REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  XXlX

" Eeport of the Kew Committee of the British Association for 1852-53.

'и Since the last meeting of tiie British Association, the Kew Committee

have completed the series of balloon ascents which they had contemplated

four ascents in all having been made, viz. on Aug. 17, Aug. 26, Oct. 21, and

ANov. 10, 1852.  Report of these ascents was communicated by the Kew

Committee to the Council of the British Association, on the 29th Nov. 1852.

A detailed account of the experiments, with a discussion of the general results,

having been prepared by Mr. Welsh, was communicated in April last, by the

Council of the British Association, to the Royal Society, and has since been

printed in the Philosophical Transactions. At the request of the Council of

the British Association, the Royal Society have granted to them 500 copies

of the paper for distribution among their members ; 50 copies have been

presented to those gentlemen who took a part in the experiments, by making

contemporaneous meteorological observations or otherwise. The remaining

copies will be distributed to the purchasers of Dove's Isothermal Lines.

The sum of 26 U. 2s. 5d. was granted by the Royal Society, from their

Wollaston Fund, to defray the expense of these ascents.

   " Of this sum 243/. 2s. 5d. was expended, leaving a balance of 18/., which

has been repaid to the Treasurer of the Royal Society.
   " The Committee have, up to this time, been enabled to supply seventy

thermometers, graduated under their superintendence by Mr. Welsh.
   " All the applications yet received have now been complied with, except

three or four for instruments of unusual construction or extent of graduation.

   " On the 30th of May, 1853, the Committee passed the following reso-

lutions :

   " ' 1st. That in order to facilitate the comparisons of thermometers with
the standard at Kew, the Committee are prepared to furnish such instrument-
makers as may apply to them with a standard thermometer at the charge

of 1/.

   " ' 2nd. The Committee are prepared to receive thermometers and to

furnish a table of their errors, provided such thermometers are forwarded to

--Kew free of expense. It was subsequently resolved that the charge for the

verification of such thermometers should be 3s. 6d. for each instrument.

   " ' 3rd. That as there are many very carefully recorded series of observa-
tions made with thermometers that have not been previously verified, the
Committee will also be prepared (on receiving applications from the ob-

servers) to furnish the results of a comparison with the Kew standard. Such

instruments to be forwarded to the Observatory free of expense.'
   " The above resolutions having been forwarded to the editors oi i\\eAthe-

nceum and the Literary Gazette, were kindly noticed by them in their re-

spective journals, but with one exception (by an optician for a thermometer)

no further application has been received by the Committee. It is, however,
very probable that when such facilities for the correction of observations
made with imperfect thermometers are more generally known, further appli-
cations will be received. Except to those who have been actually engaged

in reducing such observations, it is almost impossible to conceive the amount
of comparatively useless observations that have been and are now daily

recorded, owing to the imperfect instruments employed.
   " During the past year a very considerable portion of the time of Mr.Welsh

has been occupied in the arrangement for and the discussions of the results
of the balloon experiments, and as he has no one to assist him in the carrying

out of any meteorological observations, the amount of general work in the
Observatory during the past year has necessarily been much less than in
--XXX REPORT 1853.

previous years ; at the same time it will be seen that the expenditure has
been proportionately diminished. The total amount is 159/. lis. Id., ex-
clusive of the sum expended in the ascents, which, as has already been stated,
was wholly defrayed by the Royal Society.

   " The Committee suggest that, with regard to the balance in hand, the
same principle as that hitherto adopted should be continued, viz. that the

balance from former years should be still held at the disposal of the Kew

Committee (in the event of its being re-appointed), in addition to the usual
annual grant of 200/. Tiie strict ceconomy with which the funds have been
hitherto used is a sufficient guarantee that no unnecessary expenditure will
be incurred.

   " The Committee recommend that an application should be made to the
Commissioners of Woods and Forests for the temporary use of a small por-
tion of the ground near the Observatory for the erection of suitable places
for observing ; the expense would be very trifling, while the position of the
Observatory, in the centre of 450 acres of a level field, combined with its
near proximity to the metropolis, renders it in every respect a most suitable
place for the carrying on those scientific researches which are so intimately

connected with the objects of the British Association.
  '" During the past year, an application has been received by the Council

of the Association for a portion of the electrical apparatus belonging to the
Association for the use of the Observatory at Toronto. This application was

--referred by the Council to the Committee. The following is an extract from

their Minutes, ^th August, 1853 : ' Read a letter from Capt. Lefroy to Dr.
Royle, dated Woolwich, 21st July, 1853. Resolved, that as the electrical

apparatus referred to in Capt. Lefroy's letter is a portion of that constructed
by Mr. Ronalds for the carrying out of his original experiments in atmosphe-
rical electricity, and in which the British Association has always taken so

much interest, the Committee cannot recommend that any portion of it should
be withdrawn from the Observatory, more particularly as Mr. Ne^\ynan could
supply a more perfect apparatus under the superintendence of Mr. Ronalds

at a comparatively trifling cost.'
    " Part of the Government Grant placed at the disposal of the Royal Society

having been entrusted to the Meteorological Sub-Committee, they have been
enabled to prosecute their experiments for the improvement of meteorological

instruments, and have, in furtherance of this object, obtained from M. CErt-
ling a set of standard weights, made under the direction of Dr. Miller, with
especial reference to facility of intercomparison. They are now in the hands

 of Prof. Miller, of Cambridge, for verification, and he expects in the course
 of about a montli to have the trials of them complete. These weights con-

--sist of the following a standard pound of gun-metal thickly electro-gilt; a

 set of weights for ordinary use made of the same material, viz.

1 of 7000 grains.          1 of 700 grains.

--and half an inch thick the standard 3'ard is laid down between two gold

pins, inserted for the purpose, and the interval of 36 inches is marked off on
them by two fine lines ; near an edge of the bar, 40 inches subdivided into
tenths, have been marked off, and one-tenth has further been divided into
hundredths of an inch.

   " Application having been made from the Hydrographer to the Admiralty
for advice as to the thermometers to be supplied to Her Majesty's Navy for
meteorological observations to be made at sea, the Committee have under-
taken to recommend and provide a specimen of the form of instrument they
consider best adapted for the purpose, and experiments are now being made
by Mr. Welsh, with this object in view.

   " Lieut. Maury, of the United States Navy, has also requested the opinion
of the Committee upon the best form of a Marine Barometer, and the subject
is now under their consideration.

   " The Standard Barometer is not as yet mounted, but two tubes of an inch
in internal diameter, have been boiled at the Observatory, by Messrs. Negretti
and Zambra, under the inspection of the Committee, and the mounting is

shortly expected to be completed.
   " The Committee cannot close their report without expressing their high

estimation of Mr. Welsh's services. The constant and unremitting attention
to his duties, combined with the ability he has always evinced in their dis-
charge, entitle him to the warmest thanks and individual support of every
member of the British Association.

                                                                     " John P. Gassiot,

Report of the Parliamentary Committee of the British Asso-
      ciation, TO the Meeting held at Hull, in September 1853.

   " The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as follows:
   " The subjects to which the attention of the Committee has been directed,

since the date of their last Report, are

   " 1. The extravagant rates of postage charged on the transmission of pre-
sentation copies of scientific works to correspondents in foreign parts ; and

   " 2. Lieut. Maury's Scheme for the improvement of Navigation.
   '* As to the first, Mr. Heywood moved, in the House of Commons, for a
copy of the return, which has been already printed by order of the House of
Lords, on the motion of Lord Wrottesley, showing the great amount of the
rates now levied on the postage of letters to foreign countries (and such
communications as those above alluded to can only be sent as letters by the
existing regulation), and the same return was produced and printed accord-
ingly. This return is No. 32 of the sessional papers of the House of Lords,
and No. 142 of those of the House of Commons.
   " Your Committee likewise solicited and obtained an interview with the
Postmaster-General, on the 13th of July, and directed his attention to the
statements contained in the letter to Lord Malmesbury, of last year, on this
subject, and to the facts disclosed by the above-mentioned returns ; and a letter
was subsequently written at Lord Canning's request, embodying in writing
the observations which had been already addressed to him orally in this be-
half. Lord Canning seemed to admit the hardship of the case, and the fol-
lowing letter, which was afterwards received from Colonel Maberly, contains
the substance of the answer given by him to the Deputation :
xxxii  --REPORT 1853.

                                                                           " и General Post-Office, August 2nd, 1853.

  My --" ' Lord, The Postmaster-Geoeral has had under consideration your

Lordship's letter of the 22nd ultimo, aud I am directed to inform you that

he considers it would be difficult to establish any special regulation for the
transmission of scientific works only, through the post, to and from foreign
countries at a low rate of postage.

    " ' Lord Canning's attention, however, has been directed for some time to
the importance of entering into arrangements with the several foreign coun-
tries, with which this department is under convention, for the purpose of
extending to these countries, as nearly as circumstances will permit, the pro-
visions under which printed publications generally may be forwarded by
post, at a cheap rate, to a large number of Her Majesty's colonial possessions
abroad ; and I have to state that his Lordship is already in correspondence
on this subject with the Prussian post-office, acting on behalf of the greater
part of Germany ; and that he will take care that this point is borne in mind
in any future negotiation with foreign post-offices.

                                                     " ' I have the honour to be, &c.,

                                                                           " ' W. Maberly.'

   " Secondly. The subject of Lieut. Maury's plan, for making hydrographical
and meteorological observations at sea, by the co-operation of the principal
maritime nations, was referred to your Committee by your Council on the
29th November, and also by Colonel Sabine, your President ; and, at the
meeting of the Committee on the 11th of February, Lord Wrottesley was
requested to call the attention of the House of Lords to this very important
scheme. This was accordingly done on the 26th of April, and Lord Wrot-

tesley thought it right on this, the first occasion of an appeal to Parliament,

to take advantage of the opportunity that afforded to him to make some
remarks on the advantages arising from the cultivation of abstract science,
and on the duty of protecting and fostering a pursuit from which this country
more especially had derived such inestimable benefits. On the 13th of July
Sir Robert Inglis, in the House of Commons, as representing your Commit-
tee, again urged the importance of Lieut. Maury's plan on the attention of
Government, and the reply of Admiral Berkeley not being deemed satisfac-
tory, your Committee solicited and obtained an interview with Sir James
Graham on the 18th of July, on this subject. The Deputation consisted of
the Chairman, the Earl of Harrowby, the Earl of Rosse, the Bishop of Ox-
ford, Sir Robert Inglis, and Mr. Hey wood, assisted by your President, Col.
Sabine, and Sir Roderick Murchison, who were invited to accompany the
Committee. Sir James Graham stated he was prepared to issue instructions
to captains of men-of-war to take the temperature of sea-water, and that he
would send Capt. Beechy to Brussels on the 23rd of August to confer with
Lieut. Maury, who had arranged to meet at that time and place representa-
tives of many of the maritime powers of Europe ; he also stated to Sir
Robert Inglis, on another occasion, that he was willing to cooperate with the
United States Government by sending a vessel to explore the ocean between

the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn. He stated, further, to the Depu-

tation, that he was not yet prepared to recommend to the House of Com-
mons the establishment of a separate department or office, for the purpose of
receiving, reducing, and coordinating the observations made either by ships
of war or the mercantile marine. The Deputation, in reply, expressed their
regret at this determination, and showed that unless an office of this kind
were provided, it was in vain to expect that observations would be made, and
that, if made, they would be productive of little or no benefit to navigation
                       nfiSEAtlCHES IN SCIENCE.                         XXXui

OP science ; and they called attention to the fact that valuable hydrographi-
cal and meteorological observations had already been made by scientific

naval officers, and had produced no fruit, owing to the want of a provision

for their collation and reductioa. Your Committee entertain a confident

hope that when the attention of merchants and shipowners hБis been com-

pletely awakened to the wonderful results which have flowed from the adop-

tion of the system in question in the United States, and when they perceive,

as they cannot fail to do in the course of time, how materially their pecuniary

interests are likely to be advanced by its unreserved adoption, that they will

either attempt to carry it into effect themselves without aid from any other

source, or make such an appeal to the Government as it will be difficult to

resist ; and symptoms of such a movement have already exhibited them-

selves. Your Committee are happy to be able to conclude their report with

an announcement that the Council of the Royal Society have, by a Resolu-

tion dated the 17th of February last, recognized the importance of the step

taken by the British Association, in appointing a Committee of Members of

the Legislature to watch over the interests of science.

                                                         " Wrottesley,

                                                         " Chairman."

science, both in communications to Government, and in proceedings in the

Houses of Parliament.
   The Members of the British Association have learned with satisfaction

that it is the intention of Government to direct, that ia future, daily meteoro
logical observations shall be made at sea, in correspondence with the plan
adopted by the Government of the United States, on the suggestion of Lieut.
Maury, and to take such further steps, in reference to the Mercantile Marine
of Great Britain, as may be best suited to stimulate and encourage the
Masters of British merchant ships to take interest in investigations by which
the times of passage between different ports have already, in many instances,,
been materially shortened, and which may lead to other results of the great

est importance to practical navigation.
RESEARCHES IN SCIENCE.                                                    XXXV

   The British Association entirely concurs in the opinion, that to make the
observations thus contemplated serviceable for the purposes for which they
are designed, it will be necessary to make provision for their co-ordination,
and for deriving from them the instruction which they may be capable of
yielding, primarily for the advantage of navigation, and secondarily for the

benefit of science.

   In this view the General Committee requests that the Council will com-
municate on the subject with the Parliamentary Committee, and will take
such steps, either by deputation to Government or otherwise, as may appear
to them desirable.

   That as very great inconvenience is frequently occasioned by the injury
or destruction of instruments and specimens arriving from Foreign parts,
arising from careless re-packing at the Custom-House, it be referred to the
Council to consider of the best mode of obtaining a remedy for the evil.

                 Extracts from Resolutions of the General Committee.

   Committees and individuals, to whom grants of money for scientific pur-

poses have been entrusted, are required to present to each following meeting
of the Association a Report of the progress which has been made ; with a
statement of the sums which have been expended, and the balance which re-
mains disposable on each grant.

    Grants of pecuniary aid for scientific purposes from the funds of the Asso-
ciation expire at the ensuing meeting, unless it shall appear by a Report that
the Recommendations have been acted on, or a continuation of them be
ordered by the General Committee.

   In each Committee, the Member first named is the person entitled to call
on the Treasurer, John Taylor, Esq., 6 Queen Street Place, Upper Thames
Street, London, for such portion of the sum granted as may from time to

time be required.
   In grants of money to Committees, the Association does not contemplate

the payment of personal expenses to the Members.
   In all cases where additional grants of money are made for the continua-

tion of Researches at the cost of the Association, the sum named shall be
deemed to include, as a part of the amount, the specified balance which may
remain unpaid on the former grant for the same object.

 WILLIAM HOPKINS, Esq., M.A., V.P.R.S., F.G.S.,

                      Pkesioent of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.

      Gentlemen of the British Association,
Before I proceed to those remarks which I may have to address to you on
matters of science, let me avail myself of this opportunity of expressing to
you the sense I entertain of the honour which you have conferred upon me
in electing me to the Presidency of the Association. When this high office

was first proposed to me, I could not but feel the importance of the duties
attached to it. I felt, also, that there must be others who had higher claims
to the honour than myself. But I was aware how frequently difficulties will
occur in the immediate appointment to such offices of the persons most com-
petent to fill them ; and, after having been invited to the office by those best
qualified to decide such points, I conceived it right not to shrink from its
responsibilities, but at once to accept it, with the determination of performing

the duties it might impose upon me to the best of my ability. I have had

the less hesitation in adopting this course from a knowledge of the effective
and ready assistance which I should always receive, not only from our excel-

lent Secretary, Mr. Phillips, but also from my predecessor in this Chair, who

is so intimately acquainted with the whole working of the Association, to
which he has rendered so long and so cheerfully such invaluable services.
After thanking you, Gentlemen, as I do most sincerely, for the high compli-

ment you have paid me, and assuring you of my best efforts in the cause of

the Association, I proceed to lay before you such statements and remarks on

scientific subjects as have presented themselves most prominently to my own
mind for this occasion. In doing this, I cannot but regret my inability to
do justice to many subjects which might be interesting to you ; and, indeed,

 the limited time for which I should be justified in demanding your attention

to an oral communication, will oblige me to omit, this evening, several even

 of those points which I was prepared to bring under your notice.
    Astronomical research still continues to prove to us how much more

 populous is that portion of space occupied by the solar system than was
 suspected only a few years ago. Between the 23rd of June, 1852, and the
6th of May, 1853, nine new planets were discovered, of which seven have been
--xlii REPORT 1853.

found since the last meeting of the Association. Of these nine planets, our
countryman, Mr. Hind, has discovered four. The number now known, ex-

clusive of the large planets, but including the four old asteroids, amounts to
twenty-six, nor have we any reason to suppose that we have yet approximated
to the whole number of these minor planetary bodies. All those which have
been recently recognized appear like stars of magnitudes not lower than the
eighth or ninth, and are consequently invisible to the naked eye. The
search for them has now assumed, to a considerable extent, a more systematic
form, by a previous mapping of the stars up to a certain magnitude, and
contained within a belt of a few degrees in breadth on either side of the

ecliptic. Any small planet will in the first instance be inserted in the map

as a small star, but will on the re-examination of the same area some time
afterwards, be recognized in its true character from the fact of its having
moved from the place in which it was first observed. This mapping of the
ecliptic stars from the eighth to higher magnitudes is still comparatively
limited ; nor has the length of time during which any one portion, perhaps,
of the space been thus mapped, been sufficiently great to ensure the passage
through it, within that time, of any planet whose period is as long as the pos-
sible periods of those which may yet remain unknown to us. Analogy would
therefore lead us to conclude in favour of the probability of their number
being much greater than that at present recognised. All those which are
now known lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but many may exist
more distant and of much smaller apparent magnitudes ; and thus almost
the same careful telescopic research may be necessary to make us acquainted
with some of our planetary neighbours as with the remoter regions of space.
Nor is the telescopic mode the only one by which we may detect the existence
of remoter planets ; for as Uranus betrayed the existence of Neptune, so
may the latter hereafter reveal to us the retreats in which some more distant
member of the system has hitherto hidden himself from the observation of
man.

   There would seem to be a tendency in the human mind to repose on the
contemplation of any great truth after its first establishment. Thus, after
the undisputed reception of the theory of gravitation and the complete ex-
planation which it afforded of the planetary motions, men seemed to think
little of any further revelations which the solar system might still have to
make to us respecting its constitution or the physical causes which it calls
into operation. The recent discovery, however, of so many planets shows
how imperfectly we may yet be acquainted with the planetary part of the
system ; and the continual discovery of new comets seems to indicate that in
this department still more remains to be done. These curious bodies, too,
may possibly have to reveal to us facts more interesting than any which the
planets may still have in reserve for us. The experience of these latter
bodies, if I may so speak, is more limited, and their testimony, consequently,
more restricted. But they have already told us a noble tale. In moving,
as they do, in exact obedience to the law of gravitation, and thus establishing

that law, they have affirmed the highest generalization in physical science

which it has been accorded to the human mind to conceive. At the same time

the approximate circularity of their orbits prevents their passing through those
varied conditions to which comets are subjected. Thus, while the latter

obey, in common with the planets, the laws of gravitation, they frequently

present to us, in their apparent changes of volume, form, and general cha-
racter, phaenomena the explanation of which has hitherto baffled the inge-

nuity of astronomers. One of the most curious of these phaenomena has
                       ADDRESS.                  Xliii

been recently observed in Biela's comet. This comet has a period of about

six years and a half, and has been observed a considerable number of times

on its periodical return to the neighbourhood of the sun. It appeared in

November 1845, and in the following January the phaenomenon alluded to

was observed for the first time. The comet had become divided into two

distinct parts with separate nuclei. Sometimes the one and sometimes the
other appeared the brighter till their final disappearance. The elements

of the orbits of these twin comets were calculated by Professor Plantamour,

from observations made at Geneva in 1845-46, assuming them to be unin-

fluenced by each other's attractions. The correctness of these elements

could only be determined on the next return of the comet, which took place

in the autumn of last year, one of the nuclei having been first seen by Signor

Secchi at Rome, on the 25th of August, and the other on the 15th of Sep-

tember. The subsequent observations made upon them show that the ele-

ments of the orbits, as previously calculated from the Geneva observations,

Awere far from exact.  complete discussion of all the observations which

have been made on these comets during their last and previous appearances,

is now in progress by Professor Hubbard, of the Washington Observatory.

The distance between the two nuclei was much increased on their last ap-

pearance. Judging from the apparent absence of all influence and sympathy

between these bodies, it would seem that their physical divorcement, though

without known precedent, is final and complete.

Stellar astronomy continues to manifest a vigour and activity worthy of

the lofty interest which attaches to it. Bessel had made a survey of all stars
to those of the ninth magnitude inclusive, in a zone lying between 45░ of

north and 15░ of south declination. Argelander has extended this zone from

80░ of north to 31░ of south declination. It comprises more than 100,000

stars. Last year was published also the long-expected work of M. F. G. W.

Struve, containing a catalogue of stars observed by him at Dorpat, in the

years 1822-43. They are principally double and multiple stars, which had

been previously micrometrically observed by the same distinguished astro-

nomer. Their number amounts to 2874; the epoch of reduction is 1830.

The introduction contains the discussion of various important points in

stellar astronomy.

Notices have been brought before us, from time to time, of the nebulae ob-

served through Lord Rosse's telescope. This noble instrument, so unrivalled

for observations of this kind, continues to be applied to the same purpose,

and to add yearly to our knowledge of the remotest regions of space into

which the eye of man has been able to penetrate. Almost every new obser-

vation appears to confirm the fact of that curious tendency to a spiral arrange-

ment in these nebulous masses, of which mention has so frequently been made.

To those persons, however, who have neither seen the objects themselves, nor

careful drawings of t':em, a mere verbal description must convey very indi-

stinct conceptions of the spiral forms which they assume. I have therefore

had the drawings made, which are suspended in the room for your inspection.

They will convey to you at once an idea of the spiral forms alluded to. I am

indebted to the kindness of Lord Rosse for the use of the original drawings,

and for these large and accurate copies of them to our excellent Secretary,

Mr. Phillips, who, with his usual ready activity in the cause of the Associa-

tion, has had them prepared for the purpose of this evening. Most of them

are representations of nebulas which have been very recently observed.

  Two pairs of these are respectively drawings of the same object, the larger

one of each pair representing the nebula as seen through the large telescope,
--xliv REPORT 1853.

the other as seeu through a smaller one of Lord Rosse's of only three feet
aperture. You will observe how little resemblance there is between them,
except in the external boundary, and how entirely the characteristic details of
the larger drawings are lost in the smaller ones ; and if I had exhibited to you
drawings of some others of these nebulae, as seen by previous observers with
inferior telescopic power, it would have been still more obvious to,you how
necessary are telescopes with large and perfectly ground mirrors for the de-
velopment of the real character of these astonishing and enigmatical aggre-

gations of stars.

    It is for this reason that it has been thought desirable to have the nebulae
of the southern hemisphere examined with higher telescopic power than has

hitherto been brought to bear upon them. You are aware with what a noble
devotion to science Sir J. Herschel spent several years at the Cape of Good
Hope in the examination of the southern heavens ; but his telescopic power was
limited to that of a reflector of 18^ inches aperture. It is now proposed to send
out to some convenient station in the southern hemisphere a reflecting tele-
scope, with a mirror of 4- feet aperture. Mr. Grubb, of Dublin, has under-

taken to construct such an instrument (should the plan proposed be adopted)
under the general superintendence of Lord Rosse, Dr. Robinson, Mr. Lassell,

and one or two other gentlemen. The general construction of the instrument,
and the best mode of mounting it, have been decided on with careful delibe-

ration, after consulting all the best authorities on the subject.
    These important preliminaries being agreed upon, and an estimate of the

whole expense of the instrument having been made by Mr. Grubb, the depu-
tation appointed for the purpose proceeded to wait on Lord Aberdeen, to
ascertain whether the Government were willing to bear the expense which
the plan proposed would involve. His Lordship expressed himself, without

hesitation, as favourable to the undertaking; but said that, since it involved
a grant of money, it would be necessary to consult the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, who, supposing him to take a favourable view of the subject,

would probably bring it before the House of Commons among the estimates
of the ensuing year. With this answer the deputation could not be otherwise

than perfectly satisfied, nor could they fail also to be gratified by the perfect
courtesy with which they were received. Judging from ail we know respecting
Mr. Gladstone's enlightened views on subjects of tiiis nature, and the favour-

able manner in which the House of Commons has always received proposi-
tions for the advancement of science, we have, I tiiink, every reason to hope
that my successor in this Chair may have the satisfaction of announcing to
you another instance of the liberality of the Government in their acceptance of

the plan proposed to them. In such case, the result, I doubt not, will afford
another proof that the Association is doing effectively what it professes to do
as an Association for tlie Advancement of Science.

   The refinement of modern methods of astronomical observation has be-
come so great, that astronomers appear very generally to think that a higher

degree of refinement in the calculations of physical astronomy than has yet

been attained is becoming necessary. Mr. Adams has been engaged in some
important researches of tliis kind. He has corrected an error in Burckhardt's

value of the moon's parallax ; and he has also determined to a nearer approxi-
mation than that obtained by Laplace, the secular variation in the moon's
mean motion. The former investigation is published in an Appendix to the
Nautical Almanac for 1856; the latter has been very recently presented to
the Royal Society.

   Before I quit this subject, I may state that an ' American Epbemeris and
ADDRESS.  xlv

Nautical Almaliae fof 1855' has been published this year. It is the first
American Nautical Almanac, and is considered to reflect great credit on the
astronomers of that country. It is under the superintendence of Lieut. C.
H. Davis, assisted in the physical department by Professor Peirce.

   No one has contributed more to the progress of Terrestrial Magnetism
during the last few years than my distinguisiied predecessor in this Chair.
Formerly we owed theories on this subject much more to the boldness of

ignorance than to the just confidence of knowledge ; but from the commence-
meut of the systematic observations which Colonel Sabine has been so active
in promoting, this vague and useless theorising ceased, to be succeeded, pro-
bably ere long, by the sound speculative researches of those who may be
capable of grappling with the real diflSculties of the subject, when the true
laws of the phaenomena shall have been determined. Those laws are coming
forth with beautiful precision from the reductions which Colonel Sabine is
now making of the numerous observations made at the different magnetic
stations. In his Address of last year, he stated to us that the secular change
of the magnetic forces was confirmed by these recent observations, and also
that periodical variations depending on the solar day, and on the time of the
year, had been distinctly made out, indicating the sun as the cause of these
variations. During the present year, the results of the reduction of the ob-
servations made at Toronto have brought out, with equal perspicuity, a va-
riation in the direction of the magnetic needle going through all its changes
exactly in each lunar day. These results with reference to the sun prove, as
Colonel Sabine has remarked, the immediate and direct exercise of a magnetic
influence emanating from that luminary ; and the additional results now

obtained establish the same conclusion with regard to the influence of the
moon. It would seem, therefore, that some of the curious phaenomena of

magnetism which have hitherto been regarded as strictly terrestrial, are really

due to solar and lunar, as much as to terrestrial magnetism. It is beautiful

to trace with such precision these delicate influences of bodies so distant,

producing phaenomena scarcely less striking either to the imagination or to
the philosophic mind, than more obvious phaenomena which originate in the

 great luminary of our system.

   New views which have recently sprung up respecting the nature of heat
have been mentioned, though not in detail, by my two immediate predecessors

in the chair of the Association. They are highly interesting theoretically,
and important in their practical application, inasmuch as they modify in a
 considerable degree the theory of the steam-engine, the air-engine, or any
 other in which the motive power is derived immediately from heat; and it is
 correct theory alone which can point out to the practical engineer the degree
of perfection at which he may aim in the construction of such machines, and
 which can enable him to compare accurately their merits when the best con-

 struction is arrived at.

   A theory which proposes to explain the thermal agency by which motive

 power is produced, and to determine the numerical relations between the quan-
 tity of heat and the quantity of mechanical effect produced by it, may be termed
 & Dynamical theory of heat. Carnot was the first to give to such a theory a
 mathematical form. His theory rested on two propositions which were re-
 garded as axiomatic. The first embodied the abstract conception of a per-
 fect thermo-dynamic engine, and has been equally adopted by the advocates
 of the new theory of heat. Again, suppose a given quantity of heat to enter
 a body by any process, and thereby to change its temperature and general
 physical state ; and then, by a second process, suppose the bodv to be re-
Xlvi REPORT^--1853.

--stored exactly to its primitive temperature and condition, Carnot's second

fundamental proposition asserts that the quantity of heat which passes out of
the body into surrounding space, or into other bodies, in the form of heat,
during the second operation, is precisely the same as that which passed into
the body during the first operation. This view does not recognise the possi-
bility of heat being lost by conversion into something else, and in this parti-

cular is at variance with the new theory, which asserts that heat may be lost
by conversion into mechanical effect. To elucidate this distinction, suppose
 a quantity of water to be poured into an empty vessel. It might then be
asserted, that, in emptying the vessel again, we must pour out just as much
water as we had previously poured in. This would be equivalent to Carnot's
proposition with respect to heat. But suppose a part of the water while in

the vessel to be converted into vapour ; then it would not be true that in
emptying the vessel, the same quantity of water, in the form of water, must
pass out of the vessel as had before passed into it, since a portion would have
passed out in the form of vapour. This is analogous to the assertion of the
new theory with regard to heat, which may be lost, according to that theory,
by conversion into mechanical effect, in a manner analogous to that in which
water may be said to be lost by conversion into vapour. But the new theory
 not only asserts generally the convertibility of heat into mechanical effect,
and the converse, but also more definitely, that, whatever be the mode of

--converting the one into the other and whether heat be employed to pro-

duce mechanical effect, or mechanical force be employed to produce heat--
 the same quantity of the one is always the equivalent of the same quantity
of the other. This proposition can only be established by experiment. Rum-
ford, who was one of the first to adopt the fundamental notion of this theory
as regards the nature of heat, made a rough attempt to determine the rela-
tion between the force producing friction and the heat generated by it ; but
it was reserved for Mr. Joule to lay the true foundation of this theory by a

series of experiments, which, in the philosophical discernment with which they
were conceived, and the ingenuity with which they were executed, have not
often, perhaps, been surpassed. In whatever way he employed mechanical
force to produce heat, he found, approximately, the same quantity of heat
produced by the same amount of force, the force btir.g estimated \n foot-
pounds according to the usual mode in practical mechanics, i. e. by the motive
power employed in raising a weight of 1 lb. through the space of 1 foot.
 The conclusion adopted by Mr. Joule is that 1░ Fahr. is equivalent to 772

foot-pounds.

    These results are unquestionably among the most curious and interesting

of those which experimental research has recently brought before us. When

 first announced some ten or twelve years ago, they did not attract the atten-
 tion which they deserved ; but more recently their importance has been fully
 recognized by all those who cultivate the department of science to which they
 belong. Of this Mr. Joule received last year one of the most gratifying
 proofs, in the award made to him by the Council of the Royal Society, of one
 of the medals placed annually at their disposal. It may not be known to
 many of you that we have in Mr. Joule a pupil, a friend, and fellow-towns-
 man of Dalton.

    This theory is in perfect harmony with the opinions now very generally

 entertained respecting radiant heat. Formerly light and heat were regarded

 as consisting of material particles, continually radiating from luminous and
 heated bodies respectively; but it may now be considered as established

 beyond controversy, that light is piopagated through space by the vibrations
                   ADDRESS.                                   Xlvii

of an exceedingly refined ethereal medium, in a manner exactly analogous

to that in which sound is propagated by the vibration of the air ; and it is

now supposed that radiant heat is propagated in a similar manner. This

theory of radiant heat, in accordance with the dynamical theory, of which I

have been speaking, involves the hypothesis, that the particles of a heated

body, or a particular set of them, are maintained in a state of vibration,

similar to that in which a sonorous body is known to be, and in which a

luminous body is believed to be. At the same time there are remarkable

Wedifferences between light and heat.  know that light is propagated with

enormous velocity, whether in free space or through transparent media;

sound also is propagated with great rapidity, and more rapidly through most

media than through air. Heat, on the contrary, whatever may be the velocity
with which it may radiate through free space, is usually transmitted with

extreme slowness througii terrestrial media. There appears to be nothing in

light analogous to the slow conduction of heat. Again, the vibrations which

render a body sonorous have no tendency to expand its dimensions, nor is

there reason to suppose that luminous vibrations have any such tendency on

luminous bodies; whereas, with the exception of particular cases, heat does

produce expansion. It is principally from this property of heat that it becomes

available for the production of motive power, as, for instance, in the expan-

sion of steam. These phaenomena of the slow conduction of heat, and the

expansion of heated bodies, are proofs of differences between light and heat

not less curious than the analogies above indicated. They must, of course,

be accounted for by any perfect theory of heat. Mr. Rankine has written

an ingenious paper on a molecular theory of heat; but before any such theory

can be pronounced upon, it will be necessary, I conceive, to see its bearing

on other molecular phaenomena, with which those of heat are in all probability

intimately connected. Prof. W. Thomson has also given a clear and com-

pendious mathematical exposition of the new dynamical theory of heat,

founded on Mr. Joule's principle of the exact equivalence of heat and

mechanical effect. This is not, like Mr. Rankine's, a molecular theory, but

one which must henceforth take the place of Carnot's theory.

   Before leaving this subject, I may add that Prof. Thomson and Mr. Joule
are now engaged in further experiments, which will serve to elucidate the
new theory of heat. Some account of the commencement of these experi-

ments has already been brought before the Royal Society.

  Many years ago Gay-Lussac made an ascent in a balloon for the purpose

of making observations on the air in the upper regions of the atmosphere

but it is only very recently that systematic observations of this kind have
been attempted. Last autumn four balloon ascents were made by Mr. Welsh,

under the guidance of the distinguished aeronaut Mr. Green. Attention was

chiefly directed to the determination of the pressure, temperature, and moist-

ure of tlie air at different altitudes. The decrease of temperature in ascend-

ing was very irregular, being changed even, in some cases, to an increase

but the mean result gives a decrease of 1░ Fahr. for every 348 feet of ascent,

agreeing within 5 or 6 feet of the result obtained by Gay-Lussac. The latter

gentleman ascended 23,000 feet ; the greatest height attained by Mr. Welsh

Awas 22,940 feet.  repetition of similar observations in ascents made from

different points of (he earth's surface could scarcely fail to lead to valuable

information for the science of Meteorology,

   An immense contribution, of which brief mention was made by my prede-
cessor, has been made within the last ievr years to this science, by the publi-

cation of Prof. Dove's Isothermal Maps, giving us the temperature of the
xlviil  --REPORT 1853.

lowest portion of the atmosphere (that which determines the cUmdte of every

region) for nearly all accessible points of the earth's surface. An immense
number of thermometric observations had been made at fixed stations, or by

travellers in almost every part of the globe, but were lying comparatively
useless for want of adequate discussion. This task was undertaken some
years ago by M. Dove. It was not merely a task of enormous labour, but
one requiring great critical acuteness and sound philosophical judgement, and

these qualifications M. Dove brought to his work, which has resulted in the
excellent maps alluded to, accompanied by a considerable amount of letter-

press, full of interesting generalizations, and written in the genuine spirit of

inductive philosophy.

    His maps present a great number of isothermal lines, i. e. lines passing
through all those places which, at an assigned period of the year, have the
same temperature, each line indicating a particular temperature differing by
a few degrees from those of the adjoining lines. Besides a large map giving
these lines for January and July, the months of extreme winter and summer

temperature, there are smaller ones giving similar lines for all the different

months. An English edition of these maps has been just published.

  We may easily conceive how a great ocean current of warm water from

the tropics may affect the temperature of the atmosphere in the colder re-
gions into which it may penetrate, but it is only since the publication of
these maps that we have had any adequate idea of the extent of this influ-

ence, or been able to appreciate fully the blessings conferred on the shores of

North-western Europe, and especially on our own Islands, by the Gulf-stream.
This great current, though not always under the same name, appears, as you

are probably aware, to traverse the Atlantic in a north-westerly direction

till it reaches the West India Islands and the Gulf of Mexico. It is then
reflected by the American coast, and takes a north-easterly direction to our
own shores, extending beyond Iceland into the North Sea. It is to the
enormous mass of heated water thus poured into the colder seas of our own
latitudes that we owe the temperate character of our climate ; and not only
do the maps of M. Dove enable us to assert distinctly this general fact, but
also to make an approximate calculation of the amount to which the tem-

stream which preserves us from these evils. Among its effects on our
climate I may mention one which may not be without its local interest along
this coast, especially for those who may wish to visit it during the winter for
health as well as for pleasure. The temperature of the atmosphere to the

north of this island is so ameliorated by the Gulf-stream in the depth of
winter, that the isothermal lines for the month of January along the whole
eastern coast of Great Britain and the opposite western coast of the continent
run north and south instead of following their normal east and west direction,

thus showing that Scarborough, or any watering-place on the same coast much

further to the north, enjoys as temperate a climate in the depth of winter as

colder than on the latter coast.

  My predecessor in his Address informed us of an application made to our

government by that of the United States, to adopt a general and systematic

mode of observing pbijenomena of various kinds at sea, such as winds, tides,

currents, &c., which may not only be of general scientific interest, but may

also have an important bearing on navigation. The plan proposed by Lieut.

Maury, and adopted by the American government, is to Jiave the required

observations regularly made by the commanders of vessels sent out to sea.

I am happy to be able to state to you that our Admiralty have given orders
for similar observations to be made by those who have command of English

vessels; and we trust also that proper persons'wili be appointed withoutdelayfor

the reduction of the mass of observations which will thus soon be accumulated.

   The science of Geology may be regarded as comprising two great divisions

--' the physical and the palaeontological portions. The former may be subdi-

vided into its chemical and dynamical branches. The chemical department

--has never made any great progress, though abounding in problems of first-

rate interest such, for instance, as the formation of coal, the segregation of

mineral matter constituting mineral veins of all descriptions, the processes of

the solidification and crystallization of rocks, of the production of their jointed

and laminated structure, and many others. Interesting experiments are not

altogether wanting on points such as these, but not such as to constitute, as

far as I am aware, a positive foundation and decided progress in this branch

of the science. The problems, doubtless, involve great difficulties, both as

regards the action of the chemical agencies themselves and the varied con-

ditions under which they may have acted. The accomplished chemist alone

can combat the difficulties of the former kind, and the geologist those of the

latter. Both these characters must be united in any one who may hope to

Wearrive at the true solution of these problems.  cannot too earnestly in-

vite attention to this branch of geology on the part of those best qualified to

contend with its difficulties.

The dynamical, or, more strictly, the mechanical department of the science,

has received a much larger share of attention. In fact, almost all theories

and speculations of geologists, independently of organic remains, belong to it,

and a large portion of the work of geologists in the field has been devoted to

--the observation of pliEenomena on which it treats. Phceiiomena of elevation
    those immediately resulting from the action of the subterranean forces

which have so wonderfully scarred and furrowed the face of our globe

have been made the objects of careful research. It is to this probably violent

and desolating action that we owe the accessibility of the mineral sources of

our mining districts, as well as all those exquisite beauties of external nature

which the mountain and the valley present to us. The absence of all order

and arrangement would seem, on a superficial view, to be the especial cha-

racteristic of mountainous districts, and yet the nicer observations of the geo-

logist has detected, in such districts, distinct approximations to general laws

in the great dislocations and upheavals in which the mountains and the valleys

have originated. The more usual law in these phaenomena consists in the ap-

proximate parallelism of all those great lines of dislocation and chains of

mountains, the formation of which can be traced back to the same geological

epoch. That this law is distinctly recognizable throughout districts, some-

times of many hundred miles in extent, is clearly established, but some geo-
logists contend that it may also be recognized as prevailing over much larger

geographical areas than any single geological district presents to us. M. Elie

de Beaumont was the originator, and has been the great advocate of this ex-

tension of the theory of parallelism. He extends it, in fact, to the whole sur-

face of the eai'th, using the term parallelism in a certain modified sense, to

render it applicable to lines drawn on a spherical instead of a plain surface.

Mis theory asserts that all great lines of dislocation, and therefore all moun-
tain chains originating in them, wherever situated, may be grouped into

parallel systems, and that all the lines or mountain chains belonging to any

one system were produced simultaneously by one great convulsion of the

earth's crust. This theory has been advocated by him many years, but he

lias recently published his latest views respecting it, and has made an im-

portant addition, which may, in fact, be regarded as an independent theory.

Each of the parallel systems already mentioned will have its cJiaracteristic

direction, to which all the lines of that system are parallel. This new theory

asserts that these characteristic directions are not determined, as it were, by

accident or chance, but that they have certain relations to each other, so that

the respective systems to which they belong are disposed over the earth's

surface, according to a distinct symmetrical arrangement. For the details of

this curious theory I can only refer to the author's work, or to the analysis

which I gave of it last February, in ray address to the Geological Society. 1

feel it right, however, to add, that after an attentive examination of the sub-

ject, the evidence adduced by M. de Beaumont in support of the last-men-
tioned theory has failed to convey conviction to my own mind. With re-

ference to the parallelism of contemporaneous lines of elevation, no one, I

conceive, will deny the truth of M. de Beaumont's theory in its application

to many geological districts of limited extent ; but it will probably be the

opinion of most English geologists, that, in attempting to extend it to districts

far remote from each other, he has overstepped the bounds of legitimate in-

duction from facts with which we are at present acquainted. Every one,

however, who studies M. de Beaumont's work, in whatever degree he may be

disposed to adopt or reject the theoretical views of that distinguished geolo-

gist, will admit the ability and the knowledge which he has brought to bear

on the subject, and the advantages which must result from the ample discus-

sion which he has given it.

One favourite subject of speculation in the physical branch of geology has

been, at all times since the origin of the science, the state of the interior of

our planet, and the source of the high temperature observed at all consider-

able depths beneath its surface. The terrestrial temperature at a certain

deptii in each locality (about SO feet in our own region) remains constant during

the whole year, being sensibly unaffected by the changing temperature of

the seasons. The same, of course, holds true at greater depths, but the

lower we descend the greater is this invariable temperature, the increase

being proportional to the depth, and at the rate of 1░ Fahr. for about every

60 or 70 feet. Assuming this rate of increase to continue to the depth of

.50 miles, we should arrive at a temperature about twice as great as that

necessary to fuse iron, and sufficient, it is supposed, to reduce nearly the

whole mass of the earth's solid crust to a state of fusion. Hence the opinion

adopted by many geologists is, that our globe does really consist of a solid
Wshell, not exceeding
                       or 50 miles in thickness, and an interior fluid nu-

cleus, maintained in a state of fusion by the existing remains of the heat to

whicli the whole terrestrial mass was originally subjected. It might, at first

sight, appear that this enormous mass of molten matter, enclosed in so thin

a shell, could scarcely be consistent with the general external condition and

temperature of our globe ; but it is quite certain that the real external tem-
                               ADDRESS.                           U

perature and this supposed internal temperature of the earth are not incon-

sistent with each other, and that no valid argument of this kind can be urged

against the above hypothesis.

The above estimate, however, of the thickness of the earth's solid crust

entirely neglects the possible effects of the enormous pressure to which the

Nowterrestrial mass at any considerable depth is subjected.  this pressure

may produce effects of two kinds bearing directly on the question before us.

In the above calculation, terrestrial matter, placed at the depth of 40 or 50

miles, witli a pressure of more than 200,000 pounds on the square inch, is

assumed to be fusible at the same temperature as if it were subjected merely

to the ordinary atmospheric pressure ; Avhereas the temperature of fusion may
possibly be very much increased by such immense pressure as that I have

mentioned. In such case, the terrestrial matter may be retained in a solid

state at much greater depths than it otherwise would be i. e. the solid crust

may be much thicker than the above estimate of 40 or 50 miles. Again, in

this estimate, it is assumed that heat will pass as easily through the most

superficial portion of the earth's mass, as through the compressed portions

at considerable depths. Now, in this assumption there is, I think, a great

a priori improbability, and especially with reference to those superficial rocks

in which observations on the increase of terrestrial temperature in descend-

ing have generally been made ; for these rocks are, for the most part, sedi-

mentary strata, which in general, independently of the effect of pressure, are

doubtless worse conductors than the older, more compact, and more crystal-

line rocks. But if heat passes through the lower portions of this terrestrial

mass with more rapidity than through its uppermost portion i. e. if the cow-

--ductive power be greater at greater depths the temperature at considerable

depths must increase more slowly as we descend, than it is observed to in-

crease at the smaller depths to which we can penetrate, and consequently it

would be necessary, in such case, to descend to a greater depth before we

should reach the temperature necessary to produce fusion. On this account

therefore, as well as from the increased temperature of fusion, the thickness

of the earth's crust may be much greater than the previous estimate would

make it.

It has been for the purpose of ascertaining the effects of great pressure,

that Mr. Fairbairn, Mr. Joule, and myself have undertaken the experiments

in which we have for some time been engaged at Manchester. The first

object in these experiments is the determination of the effect of pressure on

the temperature of fusion of as many substances as we may be enabled to

Weexperiment upon.  expected to meet with many difficulties in the use of

the enormous pressures which we contemplated, and these expectations have

certainly been fully verified ; but we wei-e also satisfied that those diflSculties

might be overcome by perseverance and patience, and in this also we have
not been disappointed ; for I may now venture to assert that our ultimate

success, with respect to a number of substances, is beyond doubt. M^ithout

the engineering resources, however, at Mr. Fairbairn's command, success

would have been hopeless.

At present our experiments have been restricted to a few substances, and

those of easy fusibility ; but I believe our apparatus to be now so complete

for a considerable range of temperature, that we shall have no difficulty in

obtaining further results. Those already obtained indicate an increase in

the temperature offusion proportioiial to the pressure to which the fused tnass

is subjected. In employing a pressure of about 13,000 lbs. to the square

inch on bleached wax, the increase in the temperature of fusion was not less

Weunder the pressure of the atmosphere.  have not yet ascertained the

degree in which the conductive power of any substance may be increased

when solidified under great pressure. This point we hope to investigate with

due care, and also to determine the effects on substances tlius solidified, with

respect to their density, strength, crystalline forms, and general molecular

Westructure.  thus hope to obtain results of general interest and value, as

well as those which may bear more directly on the questions which first sug-

gested the experiments.

Among researches for determining the nature of the earth's crust at depths

greater than those to which we can penetrate, I must not omit mention of

Mr. Mallet's very elaborate Report on Eartiiquakes, contained in the two

last volumes of the Reports of the Association. His Earthquake catalogue

is preceded by an account of some very interesting and carefully conducted

experiments on tiie transmission of vibrations through solid media. These

results will be found of great value whenever the subject of earthquakes

shall receive that careful attention which it so well deserves. Insulated

observations, and those casual notices which are now frequently given of

earthquake plisenomena, are utterly useless for scientific ])urposes. There

are no observations which more require to be regulated by system and com-

bination than those of the phajnomena in question ; and I sliould rejoice to
see the influence of the Association exerted for this purpose, when some

efficient mode of proceeding shall have been devised.

Some of the most interesting of recent discoveries in Organic Remains are

those wliich prove tiie existence of Reptilian life during the deposition of

some of our oldest fossiliferous strata. An almost perfect skeleton of a

reptile belonging to the Batrachians or Lacertians, was lately found in the
old red sandstone of Morayshire. The remains of a reptile were also disco-

vered last year, by Sir Charles Lyell and Mr. Dawson, in tiie coal-measures

of Nova Scotia ; and a Batrachoid fossil has also been recognized in British

coal shale. But the most curious evidence of tlie early existence of animals

above the lower orders of organization on the face of our globe, is that

afforded by the footprints discovered a siiort time ago in Canada, by Mr.

--Logan, on large slabs of some of the oldest fossiliferous rocks those of the

Silurian epoch. It was inferred from the more imperfect specimens first

brought over, that these footmarks were tliose of some reptile, but more per-
fect examples, afterwards supplied by Mr. Logan, satisfied Prof. Owen that

they were the impressions of some animal belonging to the Articulata, pro-

bably a crustacean. Thus the existence of animals of the reptile type of

organization during the Carboniferous and Devonian periods is clearly esta-

blislied, but no evidence has yet been obtained of the existence of those

animals during tiie Silurian period. After the discoveries I have mentioned,
however, few geologists will perhaps be surprised should we hereafter find

that higher forms of animal life were introduced upon the earth during this

early period than have yet been detected in its sedimentary beds.

Many of you will be aware that there are two theories in geology which

may be styled the theories of progression and non-progression respectively.

The former asserts that the matter which constitutes the earth has passed

through continuous and progressive changes from the earliest state in which
it existed to its actual condition at the present time. The earliest state here
contemplated may have been a fluid, or even a gaseous state, due to the

enormous primitive heat of the mass, and it is to the gradual loss of that

iieat that the progressive change recognized by this theory is chiefly attri-

buted. The theory of non-progression, on tlie contrary, recognizes no primi-
tive state oF our planet differing essentially from its existing state ; the
only changes it does recognize being those which are strictly periodical, and
therefore produce no permanent alteration in the state of our globe. With
reference to organic remains, the difference between these theories is exactly
analogous to that now stated with reference to inorganic matter. The theory
of progression asserts that there has been a general advance in the forms of
organic life, from the earliest to the more recent geological periods. This
advance must not be confounded, it should be observed, with that progressive
development, according to which animals of a higher organic structure are
but the improved lineal descendants of those of tiie lowest grade, thus abo-
lishing all distinction of species. It is merely meant to assert that the higher
types of organic being are far more generally diffused at the present time,
and far more numerous and varied, than they were at the earlier geological
periods ; and that, moreover, at the earliest of those periods which the geo-
logist has been able to recognize, some of these higher types had probably
no existence at all. The theory of non-progression does not recognize the
gradual advance here spoken of.

   Each successive discovery, like those I have mentioned, of the remains of
animals of the higher types, in tiie older rocks, is regarded by some geolo-
gists as an addition to the cumulative evidence by which they conceive that
the theory of non-progression will be ultimately established ; while others

consider the deficiency in the evidence required to establish that theory, as
far too great to admit the probability of its being supplied by future disco-

very. Nor can the theory derive present support, it is contended, by an
appeal to any properties of inorganic matter or physical laws, with which we

are acquainted. Professor W. Thomson has recently entered into some very
interesting speculations bearing on this subject, and suggested by the new
theory of heat of which I have spoken. The heat of a heavenly body placed

under the same conditions as the sun, must, it has been said, be ultimately
exhausted by its rapid emission. Tliis assertion assumes tlie matter com-
posing the sun to have certain properties like those of terrestrial matter with
respect to the generation and emission of heat ; but Professor Thomson's
argument places the subject on better grounds, admitting, always, the truth
of the new theory of heat. That theory asserts, in the sense which I have
already stated, the exact equivalence of heat and motive power ; and that a
body, in sending forth heat, must lose a portion of that internal motion of

its constituent particles on which its thermal state depends. Now we know

that no mutual action of these constituent particles can continue to generate
motion which might compensate for the loss of motion thus sustained. This
is a simple deduction from dynamical laws and principles, independent of
any property of terrestrial matter which may possibly distinguish it from that

of the sun. Hence, then, it is on these dynamical principles that we may

rest the assertion that the sun cannot continue for an indefinite time to emit
the same quantity of heat as at present, unless his thermal energy be reno-

vated from some extraneous source. The same conclusion may be applied
to all other bodies in the universe which, like our sun, may be centres of in-

tense heat ; and hence, recognizing no adequate external supplies of heat to
renovate these existing centres of heat. Professor Thomson concludes that
the dispei'sion of heat, and consequently of physical energy, from the sun
and stars into surrounding space without any recognizable means of recon-

 centration, is the existing order of nature. In such case the heat of the sun
must ultimately be diminished, and the physical condition of the earth there-
--liv REPORT 1853.

fore altered, in a degree altogether inconsistent with the theory of non-pro-

gression.

Mr. Rankine, however, has ingeniously suggested* aw hypothesis according

to which the reconceiitration ol' heat is conceivable. Assuming the physical

universe to be of rinite extent and surrounded by an ahsolute vacuum, radiant

heat (supposing it to be propagated in the same way as light) would be in-

capable of passing into the vacuum, and would be reflected back to foci cor-

Aresponding to the points from whicli it emanated.  reconcentration of heat

would thus be effected, and any of tlie heavenly bodies which had previously

lost their heat, might, on passing through these foci, be rekindled into bright

centres of radiant heat. 1 have alluded more particularly to tiiis very inge-

nious, tliougli, perhaps, fanciful hypothesis, because some persons have, I

believe, regarded this view of the subject as affording a sanction to the

theory of non-progression ; but even if we should admit its truth to the

fullest extent, it may be deemed, I think, entirely inconsistent with that uni-

formity and permanence of physical condition in any of the heavenly bodies

which the theory just mentioned requires in our own planet. The author of

this hypothesis did not possibly contemplate any such application of it ; nor

am I aware how far he would advocate it as really applicable to the actual

constitution of the material universe, or would regard it as suggesting a pos-

sible and conceivable, rather than a probable, mode of counteracting the
constant dispersion of heat from its existing centres. He has not, I think,

attempted to work out the consequences of the hypothesis as applied to light,

to which it must, I conceive, be necessarily considered applicable if it be so
to heat. In such case the foci of the reflected heat would be coincident
with those of the reflected light, proceeding originally from the same lu-
minous bodies. These foci would thus become visible as the images of stars ;
so that the apparent number of stars would be constantly increasing with the
increasing number of images of each star produced by successive reflexions.
This will scarcely be considered the actual order of nature. It would be

easy to trace other consequences of the application of this hypothesis to

light ; but I would at present merely state that my own convictions entirely
coincide with those ol' Prof. Thomson. If we are to found our theories

upon our knowledge, and not upon our ignorance of physical causes and

phasnomena, I can only recognise in the existing state of things a })assing

phase of the material universe. It may be calculated in all, and is demon-
strably so in some respects, to endure under the action of known causes, for an

almost inconceivable period of time; but it has not, I think, received the im-

press of eternal duration, in characters which man is able to decipher. The
external temperature and physical conditions of our own globe may not, and
probably cannot have changed in any considerable degree since the first

introduction of organic beings on its surface ; but I can still only recognise

in its physical state, during all geological periods, a state of actual though of
exceedingly slow progression from an antecedent to some ultimate state, on
the nature of which our limited powers will not enable us to offer any con-
jecture founded on physical research. The theories, even, of which I have

been speaking, may probably appear to some persons as not devoid of pre-
sumption; but for many men they will ever be fraught with deep speculative
interest; and, let me add, no charge of presumption can justly lie against
them, if entered upon with that caution and modesty which ought to guide

our inquiries in these remote regions of physical science.

   I feel how imperfect a view I have now submitted to you of recent scien-

tific proceedings. I have given no account of the progress of Chemistry,
               ADDRESS.                                  It

Practical Mechanics, or of the sciences connected with Natural History ; nor

have I spoken of Ethnologj-, a science, which, though of such recent date,

is become of great interest, and one which is gccupying the minds of men of

great learning and profound research. I can only hope that the chair wliich

I have now the honour to occupy, will, from lime to time, be filled by men
qualified to do full justice to these important sciences. What I have now

said, however, may serve to convey to you some idea of the activity which

pervades almost every department of science.

   I must not conclude this address without some mention of what appear

to me to be the legitimate objects of our Association, or without some allu-

sion to circumstances, calculated, I think, to give increased importance to its

general working and influence.

   There are probably few among us of whom the inquiry has not been made

--after any one of our meetings whether any striking discovery had been

brought forward ; and most of us will also probably have remarked that an
answer in the negative has frequently produced something like a feeling of

disappointment in the inquirer. But such a feeling can only arise from a

misapprehension of what I conceive to be the real and legitimate objects of

the British Association. Great discoveries do not require associations to

Weproclaim them to the world. They proclaim themselves.  do not meet

to receive their announcement, or make a display of our scientific labours in

the eyes of the world, or to compliment each other on the success we may

have met with. Outward display belongs not to the proceedings, and the

language of mutual compliment belongs not to the language of earnest-

Weminded men.  meet, Gentlemen, if I comprehend our purpose rightly, to

assist and encourage each other in the performance of the laborious daily

Atasks of detailed scientific investigation.  great thought may possibly arise

almost instantaneously in the mind, and the intuition of genius may almost

as immediately recognise its importance, and partly foresee its consequences.

Individual labour may also do much in establishing the truth of a new prin-

ciple or theory ; but what an amount of labour uiay its multifarious applica-

tions involve I Nearly two centuries have not sufficed to work out all the

consequences of the principle of gravitation. Every theory, as it becomes

more and more perfectly worked out, embraces a greater number of phaeno-

mena, and requires a greater number of labourers for its complete de-

velopment. Thus it is that when science has arrived at a certain stage,

combination and co-operation become so essential for its further progress.

Each scientific society effects this object in a greater or less degree, but

much of its influence may be of a local character, and it is usually restricted

by a limited range of its objects. Up to a certain point no means are pro-

bably so effective for the promotion of science as these particular societies,

which devote themselves to one particular branch of science ; but as each

science expands, it coi os into nearer relations with other sciences, and a

period must arrive in this general and progressive advance, which must

render the co-operation of the cultivators of different branches of science

almost as essential to our general progress, as the combination of those who

cultivate the same branch was essential to the progress of each particular

science in its earlier stages. It is the feeling of the necessity of combination

and facility of intercourse among men of science that has given rise to a

strong wish that the scientific memoirs of different societies should be ren-

--dered, by some general plan, more easily and generally accessible than they

are at present a subject which I would press on your consideration. It is

by promoting this combination that the British Association has been able to
Ivi REPORT-- 1853.

exert so beneficial an influence by bi-inging scientific men togetiier, and thus

placing, as it were, in juxtaposition every society in the country. But how

has this influence been exercised ? Not assuredly in the promotion of vague

theories and speculative novelties, but in the encouragement of the hard daily

toil of scientific research, and by the work which it has caused to be done,

whether by its influence over its individual members., or on the Government

of the country. Regarding our Association, Gentlemen, in this point of view,

I can only see an increased demand for its labours, and not a termination of

them, in the future progress of science. The wider the spread of science,

the wider will be the sphere of its usefulness.

  We should do little justice to the great Industrial Exhibition, which two

years ago may be literally said to have delighted millions of visitors, or to
the views of the illustrious Prince with whom it originated, if we should

merely recollect it as a spectacle of surpassing beauty. It appears destined

to exercise a lasting influence on the mental culture, and therefore, we may

hope, on the moral condition, of the great mass of our population, by the

impulse which it has given to measures for the promotion of general educa-

Wetion.  may hope that those whose duty it will be to give effect to this

impulse, will feel the importance of education in Science as united with

education in Art. An attempt to cultivate the taste alone, independently

of the more general cultivation of the mind, would probably fail, as it w'ould

deserve to do. I trust that the better education which is now so universally

recognized as essential to preserve our future pre-eminence as a manufac-

turing nation, will have its foundations laid, not in the superficial teaching

which only aims at communicating a few curious results, but in the sound

teaching of the fundamental and elementary principles of science. Art

ought assuredly to rest on the foundation of science. Will it, in the pre-

sent day, be contended that the study of science is unfavourable to the culti-

vation of taste ? Such an opinion could only be based on an imperfect con-

ception of the objects of science, and an ignorance of all its rightful in-

fluences. Does the great sculptor or historical painter despise anatomy?

On the contrary, he knows that a knowledge of that science must constitute

one of the most valuable elements of his art, if he would produce the most

vigorous and characteristic expression of the human figure. And so the

artist should understand the structure of the leaf, the tendril, or the flower,

if he would make their delicate and characteristic beauties subservient to

the objects either of decorative art, or to those of the higher branches of

sculpture and painting. Again, will the artist appreciate less the sublimity of

the mountain, or represent its characteristic features witli less truthfulness,

because he is sufficient of a geologist to trace the essential relations between

its external form and internal constitution ? Will the beauty of the lake be
less perfectly imitated by him, if he possess a complete knowledge of the
laws of reflexion of light? Or will he not seize with nicer discrimination all

those varied and delicate beauties which depend on the varying atmosphere

of our own region, if he have some accurate knowledge of tiie theory of

colours, and of the causes which govern the changeful aspect of mist and

cloud? It is true that the genius and acute powers of observation of the
more distinguished artists may compensate, in a great degree, for the want

of scientific knowledge ; but it is certain that a great part of the defects in

the works of artists of every description, may be traced to the defect of
scientific knowledge of the objects represented. And hence it is that I ex-
press the hope that the directors of the important educational movement

which is now commencing with reference to industrial objects, will feel the

necessity of laying a foundation, not in the complicated details of science,

but in the simple and elementary principles which may pla^e the student in
a position to cultivate afterwards, by his own exertions, a more matured
acquaintance with those particular branches of science which may be more

immediately related to his especial avocations. If this be done, abstract
science will become of increased estimation in every rank of society, and its
value, with reference at least to its practical applications, will be far better
understood than it is generally amongst us at the present time.

    Under such circumstances, Gentlemen, the British Association could not
fail to become of increased importance, arid the sphere of its usefulness en-
larged. One great duty we owe to the public is to encourage the applica-

--tion of abstract science to the practical purposes of life to bring, as it were,

the study and the laboratory into juxtaposition with the workshop. And,
doubtless, it is one great object of science to bring more easily within reach
of every part of the community, the rational enjoyments, as well as the ne-
cessaries of life ; and thus not merely to contribute to the luxuries of the
rich, but to minister also to the comforts of the poor, and to promote that
general enlightenment so essential to our moral progress and the real advance
of civilization. But still, Gentlemen, we should not be taking that higher
view of science which I would wish to inculcate, if we merely regarded it as
the means of supplying more adequately the physical wants of man. If we
would view science under its noblest aspects, we must regard it with refer-
ence to man, not merely as a creature of physical wants, but as a being of
intellectual and moral endowments, fitting him to discover and compreltend
some part at least of the laws which govern the material universe, to admire
the harmony which pervades it, and to love and worship its Creator. It is
for science, as it leads to this contemplation of Nature, and a stronger sense
of the beauties which God has spread around us, that I would claim your
deeper reverence. Let us cultivate science, Gentlemen, for its own sake, as
well as for the practical advantages which flow from it. Nor let it be feared
lest this cultivation of what I may term contemplative science, if prosecuted,
in a really philosophic spirit, should inspire us with vain and presumptuous
thoughts, or disqualify us for the due appreciation of moral evidence on the
most sacred and important subjects which can occupy our minds. There is
far more vanity and presumption in ignorance than in sound knowledge
and the spirit of true philosophy, be it ever remembered, Gentlemen, is a
patient, a modest, and a humble spirit.

            THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1852-53. By the
   Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., F.G.S., Savilian

   Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
In submitting to the British Association a Sixth Report on Luminous
Meteors, I have to acknowledge the valuable contributions of the same
scientific friends who have on former occasions so extensively aided the
objects of the Association in keeping up this record ; which, it is to be hoped,
may eventually prove of some service, by the accumulation of facts to illus-
trate the laws, and thence the origin and nature, of these remarkable phse-
nomena.

  I could indeed have wished that it were in my power now to have entered

upon some kind of classification, at least, of these perplexing appearances,
on which to have founded perhaps some conjectural hints towards their
theory ; but the pressure of other avocations has for the present hindered
the prosecution of a design, which I, nevertheless look forward to taking
in hand at no distant period.

Rankine, Esq., enclosing one from Dr. Myrtle.

 --" Sir, Enclosed I beg leave to transmit to you a register of three luminous

meteors observed on the 12th of December 1852 ; and also a register of one
observed in 1839, which I have prepared from some sketches and memo-
randa that had lain forgotten amongst other papers until now. It is evident
that the latter was an object near the surface of the earth, and indeed, less
than a quarter of a mile from the place of observation.

   " The sketch is as nearly as possible a fac-simile of a pen-and-ink sketch
made by one of the observers on the same morning, which I have now in
my possession.

                                                            " I am, &c.,

                                                                " 59 St. Vincent Street, Glasgow, 6th July, 1853.

 --" Dear Sir, Enclosed I beg leave to send you Dr. Myrtle's account of

the luminous object seen near Edinburgh on the 8th November, 1839
.... It is difficult to determine the real path of the object. I formerly came
to the conclusion, that it must have moved nearly in a parabola, situated in

a plane passing through Gibraltar House, and must have gone almost directly

over the house ; but the appearance described by Dr. Myrtle, of an object
moving almost vertically downwards, is inconsistent with this supposition.

   " With respect to the fact of its having seemed to Dr. Myrtle to disappear
behind Salisbury Crags, I may mention, that the ridge on which Gibraltar
House stands, as shown in the enclosed plan, might readily be confounded
with part of Salisbury Crags when seen from the westward during the night.

   " The apparent size of the object, as seen by Dr. Myrtle, viz. somewhat

larger than Venus, compared with its apparent size as seen from Gibraltar
House (nearly twice the diameter of the moon), shows that it must have been

very near the latter point.    " I am, &c.,
" The Rev. Professor Powell."

   "I was returning about one o'clock in the morning from Newington, when
on looking towards Salisbury Crags I observed a bright luminous meteor, to
appearance more than twice the altitude of the Crags, falling in a somewhat

perpendicular direction with considerable velocity towards the Queen's Park
and the valley eastward from the Ci'ags : it had for a short time, though some-

what larger, very much the colour and appearance of the planet Venus, and
I really took it for a planet till I observed its motion : when it had fallen to
about the third part of its course as observed by me, it suddenly began to
emit sparks, which was continued throughout the remainder of its course,
decreased in size, and at last disappeared behind the Crags.

   On inspecting the projections, it will be seen that the line of divergence

extended from the Pole towards the constellation Cassiopea, and between
this constellation and Perseus ; all the paths in the neighbourhood of these
constellations were short. The general sweep from Cassiopea and Perseus
is across the Pole to Ursa Major and Bootes, which agrees with the passage of
the Earth through a group of cosmical bodies, the observer commanding a
view of those on the left of the Earth's path ; those in that part of the heavens

to move in different directions. W. R. Bikt.

". . . . On finding that Venus occupied nearly the position assigned to the

meteor, I at first felt tolerably well satisfied that Venus was the object seen ;

but then there can be little doubt that it must have presented very extraor-

dinary appearances to excite so much notice ; besides, (G. W.'s) account is
inconsistent with an ordinary appearance, however brightly it may have shone.

                   difficulty, and makes me doubt whether it could be

                   Venus at all. It appears by the Nautical Almanac,

                   that the time specified, or 16^^ on the morning of

Assuming these quantities, I find roughly by a celestial globe, that the two

were 10░ apart, or a distance about equal to that between a and o, the two

upper stars of the Great Bear, .... which does not at all accord with the

Hdrawing, or with the description of J. C.    I think there is little

doubt that the time was later than that mentioned, .... for otherwise J he

moon's altitude would have been much less than that mentioned                  At

the time mentioned, the moon had only about 12░ of altitude                    Tiiere

can be little doubt also, that all the observers saw Venus ; and I think the

descriptions may be reconciled with each other, and with the fact that it was

really a meteor, by supposing that when the meteor vanished they saw Venus

and took it for the meteor they had been observing ; of course, however,

there is great doubt about this, and the balance of probability is in favour

perhaps of Venus having been the object seen, with some peculiar halo

surrounding her; but, as I said, the drawing is decidedly opposed to this

                   On the Physical Features of the Humber.
       By James Oldham, Esq., Civil Engineer, Hull, M.I.C.E.

                   [A communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

In consenting to prepare a paper to be read before the British Association,
I have felt some degree of hesitation, believing that there are many gentle-

men who, from their learning, research, and leisure are much better qualified

to do justice to the subject than myself. However, as a paper of this descrip-

tion may be a text or theme on which to ground a discussion, and thereby

call forth the views and opinions of others, I the more willingly venture

to submit my remarks.
   The Humber is properly an estuary or arm of the sea, in which the tide

reciprocates, and forms the mouth of some extensive rivers. Its length is

about 40 miles; 9 miles of which at its entrance from the sea, average

about 6 miles in width, and the remaining 31 miles a little more than 2

miles. It contains a total tidal area of about 80,000 acres.

From Hull to the sea, the direction is about S.E., and from Hull inland

its course is about W.

For the purposes of navigation, the   Humber  possesses  great advantages
                                                                                                                            ;

and notwithstanding the extensive sand-banks and shoals, the main channel

as high as Hull is good and capable of admitting ships of the largest class.

The depth between Hull and the sea at low water, spring-tides, is from 10
to about 4 fathoms. Above Hull, to the confluence of the Trent and Ouse,

the depth varies from 4 to 1 fathom.

   The spring-tidis rise about 22 leet, and neap-tides 15 feet, on an average;
and according to a note on Mr. Halls Chart of the Humber, the former run
at the rate of 4 to 5 knots per hour, and the latter from 2^ to 3 knots per

hour.

   I do not intend to touch upon the chemical properties of the water of the

Humber, as that subject will be treated by a gentleman well qualified to do
it justice; but I may remark, that the water ol the Humber is charged to a
great density with the alluvial mud of its shores, even to saturation. This
brings me to the geological formation of the Vale of the Humber, which
consists of clay, silt, chalk, lias, and gravel. The clay and silt formations

prevail to the greatest extent, being found on the whole of the shores, except
ON THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE HUMBER.  37

at Hessle and Barton, where the chalk appears* ; at Brough and Whittnn,
where we have the lias ; and at Paiill, where a fine bed of gravel exists.
Where the alluvial formation exists on the shores of the Huniber, it also ex-
tends, more or less, for several miles inland; and from observations I have

made, I find that the average level of the surface of the shores of the Hum-

ber is about the average surface rise of all tides, and that the average fall of

tides below the surface of the land is about 17 feet.

   I may remark here, that we find land in the Vale of the Humber much

lower than that immediately adjoining its shores; for instance, the Sutton

and Waghen Carrs, where changes have taken place very different to any
that we find in other low districts. Being engaged in drainage works on
these Carrs, I had an opportunity more particularly of noticing the pecu-
liarities of the district. The upper surface is peat, to the depth of 2 or

3 feet ; and below this, to a considerable depth, occurs a dense mass of
trees of almost every description, but particularly alders, yews, and other
varieties, which it is impossible could have grown and flourished in swamps.

Some were erect as when growing, but the greater portion were lying in
every possible position. Some were in so perfectly sound a condition, as to

be capable of being converted into walking-sticks, while others fell to dust

on being exposed to the air. The only conclusion that I can come to is,
that this district was once high land, but by some great convulsion of nature,
the whole had settled down to its present level, and for a long period of time
formed an extensive lake. These Carrs were not thoroughly drained until
1835. That the tides of the Humber extended over a much greater surface
at one period of time than they do now, there is not a doubt ; for during the
operation of cutting some of our large drains, which discharge into the Hum-
ber, the tidal deposits were very obvious ; and I would particularly allude
to the Holderness drain, some of the works of which I have just referred to,
and which discharges itself into the Humber at Marfleet. The section in
this drain was most remarkable in illustration of the fact.

   The Humber is not only important as a navigation, but it is also the great

outlet or natural drain of a very extensive portion of England, receiving the
waters of the Trent, the Ouse, and other rivers and streams ; and the low
point to which the tide falls, gives facilities for the perfect and natural drain-
age of nearly all the land in its vicinity ; for we have comparatively little
land the surface of which is not above low-water mark ; and I can state with
confidence, that were the drains of sufficient capacity, and their beds and

sluices placed low enough, we have no lands in the neighbourhood of the
Humber, or any part of the East Riding of Yorkshire, that might not be per-
fectly drained. At the present moment there are districts of many thousands

of acres, within a few miles of Hull, utterly disgraceful to the present state of
science and agriculture. I need only name the neighbourhood of the Market
Weighton Canal, and the Vale of the Foulney, which might be perfectly

drained at a comparatively small cost per acre.

   Great changes have taken place, and are now taking place on the shores
of the Humber. In some districts large tracts of land have been encroached
upon by the tide, and have totally disappeared, whi st in other parts con-

siderable accretions are forming.

   и The chalk at Hessle appears above high-water. At the entrance of the Humber Dock at
Hull it is 1 10 feet below the surface. At the " Cato " Mill, a quarter of a mile north of the
entrance of the old dock, it is about 64 feet below the surface. At Mr. Hodge's mill, a mile
north-east from the north bridge on the Holderness road, and three-quarters of a mile from
the bank of the Humber, it is 84 feet below the surface ; and at Sunk Island Church it is 110
feet below the surface. A section of a boring made at this place by Easton and Amos in 184J
is shown in PI. II.
--38 REPORT 1853.

First, as to the waste of land. It is difficult now to form an idea of what

was once the greatest extent of the tidal waters of the Humber ; but no doubt

they flowed over districts at present in fertile cultivation, forming deep bays

only limited by hills and rising ground ; and it is equally difficult to tell what

Wehave been the narrowest limits of its channel.  have living witnesses to

testify of a much more contracted channel than now exists, and tradition, if

not maps, can verify still greater changes.

  ACommencing at on the Lincolnshire side at the confluence of the Trent,

and proceeding to Whitton at B, the land is alluvial, and easily affected by

the action of the water, and therefore subject to continual change ; at one

time accretions of hundreds of acres forming in a few months, and then being

as speedily washed away. Whitton is, for some short distance, protected by

the lias formation, and therefore is not liable to rapid change, except that of

deposits of sand-banks along its frontage, so as occasionally to prevent en-

tirely the approach of vessels to its landing. From a point near to Whitton,

to another a little to the east of Ferriby at C, including a distance of about

six miles of coast, very extensive ravages have taken place ; and in my own

recollection and knowledge of the shore, and from facts I have obtained, not

less than 200 acres have been lost during the last forty or fifty years, so that

the line of coast at this locality forms a considerable bay, but filled in, in
some measure, by an island, to which I shall have again to refer. I met with

one individual at Wintringham, who informed me, that in one field of 14

acres he had constructed, within the space of about twenty years, seven new

banks, and only about S^ acres now remain. Another field, of about 17
acres, is now reduced to about 2 acres. It is a tradition, that about 100

years ago pei-sons could make themselves heard and understood, between the
ancient Roman Ferry at Brough and the Ferry opposite. It is now more

than a mile from Brough to the nearest point on the opposite side. Of

course, water being a better conductor of sound than land, some allowance

should be made on that account. At a little more than a mile east of Fer-

riby Sluice, at D, the chalk of the Lincolnshire Wolds appears, and for a[

short distance protects the foreshore. Here are two very extensive quarries

for procuring chalk, where it is shipped for the purpose of being used for

protecting the banks of the Humber, as well as for forming the foundations

of roads and other works. From the Barton chalk quarry, throughout the

whole of the remaining line of the Lincolnshire coast, it is, with scarcely an

exception, alluvial, and liable to, and undergoing changes, except where pro-

tected by engineering works : and that part of the coast of the Humber is

not without its massive and magnificent works of art ; as at Ferriby Sluice,

New Holland, and Grimsby.

Having thus noticed at something like railway speed the Lincolnshire coast

of the Humber, from the Trent to the sea, we will now go back to the con-

fiuence of the Ouse, and survey in like manner the Yorkshire shore to the

sea at Spurn.

Starting, then, at Faxfleet at E, we pass the entrance to the Market

Weighton Canal, Bromfleet, &c., to Brough at F, a distance of about 5|
miles, the line of coast forming a rather deep bay to the north. The forma-

tion is rich alluvial soil, and is easily washed away by the action of the tide

and the somewhat rough seas of the Humber; and during the last sixty or

seventy years, it is well known that a large area of land has been lost in this

district, and there is now great danger of still more serious destruction, as

the sea-banks are all but undermined. For many years an island existed

along nearly the whole extent of the bay, to which I shall have to refer here-

after. The land for many miles adjacent to the Market Weighton Canal is
          ON THEPHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE HUMBEB.                                   39

remarkable for its fine beds of clay, having a depth of from 30 to 40 feet,

with scarcely a pebble, or other foreign matter of any kind, to be found.

Near the surface is a stratum, varying from 5 to 8 feet in thickness, from

which the beautiful white stock bricks are made, and which are now beco-

ming so celebrated. Clay suitable for white bricks is found in other parts of

England,  but  I  believe  neither  so  extensive  in  quantity  nor so  fine  in  quality
                                                                                                                ;

and shortly the clay of this district will be more fully developed by the intro-

duction, through an enterprising gentleman, of Beart's patent process of brick-

making. At Brough, the old Roman Ferry, we have the oolite and lias,

which for a short distance more efiectually repel the action of the water, and

thereby preserve that part of the Yorkshire coast, and give to it somewhat

of a projecting form ; and for the next 4 miles, although there is the light

alluvial formation, yet generally the coast is of a harder and more gravelly

character, and, owing to a somewhat better natural protection, it suffers less

than almost any other part of the Humber, except where we have rock forma-

tions. At G, at Hessle, we find along a small extent, the white chalk, similar

to that on the opposite coast of Lincolnshire. From the Hessle chalk quarry

Hto at Hull, a distance of about 5 miles, we have the low alluvial coast,

and, like the rest, subject more or less to waste. Along this district, in the

year 1357, an order was made to raise the road from Hull to Anlaby, as a

tide of unusual height had taken place. I quote from Thompson's ' Ocellum

Promontorium ' the following remarks :
   " In the year 1357 (30th Edward III.), the king, being informed that the

tides of the river of Humber and Hull did flow higher by 4 feet than they

had wont to do, by which the road and the lands between Hull and Anlaby

were overflowed and consumed, directed an old ditch to be cleansed and

made wider, and from thence a new ditch to be made of 24 feet in breadth,

to extend through the pasture of Miton unto the town of Hull, by which

ditches the said waters at every tide might pass to and fro ; and he directed

that the said road should be made much higher.. . . . From this statement by

Dugdale, founded on records of undoubted authority, to which he refers, it

appears probable that the waters of the Humber at that time passed to and

fro, over the lowlands, between Hull and Anlaby. It is certain, however,

that the ditches were left open to the Humber, and that the waters at every

tide passed to and fro in them."
   " This aera deserves to be remembered, on account of the extraordinary

rise of 4 feet in the flowing of the tides of the Humber. The destruction of

the banks" (if there were any), "and the consequent overflowing and da-

mage of the lands, for many miles on both sides of the Humber, in Lincoln-

shire and Yorkshire, must have caused great distress in the country. It does

not appear that any special record is left of the sufferings of the inhabitants

of the adjacent districts ; but if the tides in the Humber were to rise at the

present time 4 feet higher than usual, and continue to flow to that height,

such persons as live on the low lands adjoining the Humber may form some

judgment of the difficulties which they might find in saving their lives and

their property." This clearly shows that at that time there were no banks

to this part of the Humber, and that the high or spring-tides flowed freely

over the raar.<!hes.

It is not necessary that I should enter into any statement of the noble

works of the Hull Dock Company, as the members of the Association have

had the opportunity of inspecting them. These act more or less as a defence

against the ravages of the tide, and have also been the means of a very con-

siderable accretion to the frontage of the port.

Proceeding onwards, we have for a distance of about 6 miles low alluvial
--40 REPORT 1853.

land (protected in a very inefficient manner from the violence of the waves,
which along this portion of the coast concentrate in great force), till we
arrive at I, at Paull ; and for a short length of coast, we find the excellent
gravel frontage of High Paull giving again a firmer defence, and producing
a prominence to the line of coast, thus acting very much as a breakwater for
the softer land in its immediate vicinity. From Paull to the south-eastern
extremity of Sunk Island at J, and thence to the north-eastern point of the
island at K, comprising a distance of about 12 miles, the whole is a fine allu-
vial soil, and of comparatively new formation, but still subject to changes
and damage by the tide, and in some places considerable loss has occurred.

   The only remaining part of the coast of the Humber is by Welvvick, Wee-

ton, SkefHing, and Kilnsea, and thence by the long neck or promontory to
the Spurn at L, being about 11 miles. From Welwick to Kilnsea, the coast
under some circumstances of wind and tide is much exposed and damaged,
and the banks are kept in repair at considerable expense. The neck of land
from Kilnsea to the Spurn Head is exposed to the fury of the North Sea on
the one side, and to the action of the Humber on the other side, and between
the two is suffering materially, and will of necessity soon be entirely swept
away, unless works of importance and efficiency are carried out. It would
be out of place in this paper to enter into a description of engineering works
already executed, or which may be required for the maintenance of so im-
portant a barrier ; and instead of grants of tens, hundreds of thousands should
 be made, or to a certainty the whole of the Spurn Head will be swept away,
and that speedily. Should there once be a low-water channel formed through
the neck (which was very nearly the case a short time ago), I will not under-
take to say what evil effect would follow to the navigation of the Humber,
and the valuable tracts of land on its shores; and there is no doubt, that
were an important change of this nature to take place, such as I have de-

scribed, others perhaps equally disastrous would follow.
    I now proceed to remark upon the islands, accretions, and deposits, and

the changes that are continually taking place in the channels of the Humber.
I shall commence at the upper or western extremity, and notice the principal
 accumulations as I pass down towards the sea.

    For many years an island or mud- bank existed in the deep bay between
Brough and the entrance to the Market Weighton Canal, between E and F,
 about 2 miles in length, and of considerable width, having a large portion
 of its surface covered with marine or salt-water grass, and leaving between

 the island and the Yorkshire shore a navigable channel for river craft at
 high water, called the Broomfleet Hope. For some years I had frequently
 noticed this island, and had devised a plan for attaching it to the main land,
 and silting up the channel, and by an embankment to shut out the tide, and
 thereby secure to the Crown a valuable tract of land. I reported the exist-
 ence of this island to the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods, &c., and
 received directions, in conjunction with Mr. Thomas Page, the engineer, to

 examine and report thereon. On the 21st of August 1846 we proceeded to

 inspect the locality ; but on our arrival we found that a great change had
 taken place, and that the island was fast disappearing. Mr. Leaper, a farmer
 living near to the island, informed us that during the last four months (prior

 to that time) 100 acres of the grass, or best part of the island, had disap-

 peared, and that only about 30 acres remained. He also informed us that

 formerly persons were in the habit of driving cattle across the channel at low
 water to graze on the island; but when we visited the place, we found 27
 feet in the channel at low water. In a very short time after this the whole

 of the island had disappeared, and had formed itsolf into two gieat masses in

other parts of the Humber, one a little above Hessle, and the other at or
along the foreshore at Whitton. Since then the whole of the Whitton por-

tion has moved, and is forming on the old site of the island just described.
   The next accumulation I have to name is the island formed on " Ferriby

Sand or Old Warp," on the Lincolnshire side, a little above Ferriby Sluice.
About the year 1820, 1 believe, no part of the island had appeared above
ordinary tides ; but soon after that time the island formed rapidly, and about
thirteen years ago a person of the name of Read, finding it in a fit state to
be embaniied, (that is, the vegetation had so far progressed as to present such
a surface of available land as to make it worth the expense of shutting out
the high tides which then overflowed the surface) applied to the Commis-
sioners of Woods, &c. for a lease to rent and occupy the island, and from
that time to the present it has been under agricultural management. The
surface within the embankment contains about 80 acres, but there is beyond
the banks more than double that quantity, on which cattle can graze at low
water. From the time the island assumed its present state, or rather its
climax of magnitude, a very deep channel existed between it and the Lin-
colnshire coast, which was generally used by river steamers coming down at
low water ; and during all this time the current has impinged with great
severity on nearly the whole of the coast from Wintringham to South Fer-
riby, causing a serious loss to Lord Carrington, Sir John Nelthorpe, and
others. Here, again, changes are going on, and instead of the deep channel

on the south of the island, the current has taken a direction from about

Brough to Ferriby on the north side of the island, leaving the south channel

comparatively shallow ; and I am also sorry to add, considerable loss is taking

place to the east end and north side of the foreshore of the island, and I
shall not be much surprised if, before very long, the whole island should take

its departure.

   The upper part of the Humber is liable to and experiences great changes,
both as regards the sand-banks and the channels ; but as we descend and
approach Hull, and below Hull towards the sea, we find fewer changes, and
less liability to the sand-banks and channels shifting, and we have no accre-
tions of importance on either side until we have passed High Paull ; and the
first I have to notice in order is what was formerly called Cherrycum Sand,
but now Cherry Cobb Sand, about 5^ miles in length, and varying from

about half a mile to three-quarters of a mile in width. This tract of land,

which contains about 1800 acres, was embanked from the Humber about

the year 1770, and is the property of Sir C. A. Constable, Bart., and the

Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy. To the east of this lies the valuable
estate of Sunk Island, the property of the Crown, containing about 7000
acres. It has a line of coast towards the Humber of about 6f miles, ex-
tending from Stone Creek at M, to what is termed the North Channel at
K. The first, or most early account we have of Sunk Island, is, I believe,
at the time of Charles I., when it contained about 7 acres, and was then

a mile and a half from the Yorkshire coast, having a navigable channel
between it and the main land, through which ships of considerable burthen

could pas?. The earliest map showing Sunk Island is the one by Captain
Greenvile Collins, Hydrographer to His Majesty, in his work called ' Great

Britain's Coasting Pilot,' surveyed by order of Charles II.
    Immediately after this period we find the island rapidly to increase, and

I shall here make an extract from a Report made by the Commissioners of

--Woods and Forests a few years ago, which is as follows : " This estate has

been gradually formed by the accretion of the warp or soil deposited by the
River Humber. It was first granted on lease, on the 18th of December, 1668,
--42 REPORT 1853.

to Anthony Gilby, Esq., for a term of thirty-one years, at a rent of Б5 per
annum, when it was described as containing 3500 acres of drowned ground*,"
(that is, land over which the tide generally flowed,) " and a stipulation was
inserted in the lease for the embankment by the lessee of 100 acres or more,

within the first ten years of the term ; but the difficulties attending the under-
taking were so great, and the expense so heavy, that in the year 1675 the
lessee presented a petition to His Majesty, stating his inability to proceed
with the same (having then succeeded in embanking not more than 20 acres),

unless he should have a grant made to him of the Crown's reversionary
interest in the property, which fortunately was not complied with ; but it
was thought reasonable under the circumstances to accept a surrender of the
lease, and to extend by a new grant the terms to ninety-nine years, at the
same rent. Under that lease considerable progress was made in the embank-
ment, particularly by the exertions of Mr. William Gilby, a descendant of
the original lessee ; as it appears by a survey that had been made of the estate
in the year 174'4, that 1500 acres had been embanked, and that the estate
was divided out into farms. In the 5'ear 1755 a third lease of the estate was
granted, on payment of a fine of Б1050, at the old rent of Б5 ; and in 1771
a fourth lease was granted to Mrs. Margaret Gilby, for a term expiring on
the 15th of March, 1802, on payment of a further fine of Б1550, and at a
rent of Б100 per annum. Some time before the expiration of the last-men-
tioned lease, a survey of the estate was made by order of the late Surveyor-
General of Crown Lands, when it appeared that the quantity of land then em-
banked was only 1561 a. r. l-l- p., no addition having been made since the
year 1744 to the quantity brought into cultivation ; but the surveyor reported
that above 2700 acres of new ground were fit for embankment, the expense

of which was estimated to amount to Б8940 18s. He certified at the same

time, that when the work should be completed, the property would be worth
about Б3400 per annum ; and it was finally agreed that the estate should be
granted to the Rev. John Lonsdale and others, in trust for the representatives
of the original lessees, subject to a stipulation on their part for the embank-
ment, at their own expense, of the new ground, containing 2700 acres, above
referred to (which was estimated to cost about Б10,000), for a term of thirty-
one years from the 5th of April, 1802, at a rent of Б704 2s. 6d. for the first
year of the term, which lease expired at Lady-day 18S3. The Commis-
sioners and the old lessees not agreeing on a new lease, an arrangement was
made with the then tenants or under-lessees to become separate lessees under

the Crown." The Report goes on to say, that " On the survey made of the

estate in 1833, it was certified that the land in actual cultivation contained
no less than 5929 a. 1 r. 13 p. of land of excellent quality, then divided into
fifteen farms, beside some small holdings by cottagers and others. It is
believed that further extensive embankments may shortly be undertaken

with success."
    Without quoting further from the Report, I will briefly state that a further

embankment has taken place in 1850, under my direction as engineer to the
Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods and Forests, of nearly 700 acres of
most excellent land ; so that now we have altogether of land within the banks,

secured from the tides, and also available grass beyond the banks, little less
than 7000 acres, and a prospect of still further increase.

   During the last few years great improvements have been made on the
island, in constructing roads, drains, &c. The land is of the most valuable
kind for agricultural purposes, and requires very little manure for many

                                * Seven acres of which only was then embanked.

years after it is embanked. Before dismissing the subject of Sunk Island, I

would make a remark on the new accretions. When the land, or rather

mud-bank, has nearly reached the usual surface elevation, the first vegeta-

ble life it exhibits is that of samphire, then of a very thin wiry grass, and
after this, some other varieties of marine grass ; and when the surface is thus

covered with vegetable life, the land may at once be embanked ; but if it is
enclosed from the tide before it obtains a green carpet, it may be twenty

years before it is of much value for agriculture, for scarcely anything will

grow upon it. There is another feature of interest, particularly to agricul-

--turists, which I will take the liberty of naming, I refer to the productive-

ness of accretions in this locality, viz. that within a very few years after the

land has been embanked, a natural and luxuriant covering of white clover

makes its appearance, giving an undoubted proof of the richness and capa-

bility of the soil.

In addition to Cherry Cobb Sand and Sunk Island, about 400 acres of

new accretions have been added to Patrington, and a considerable portion to

Ottringham, Welwick, and other places in the immediate neighbourhood

and though I have not been able to ascertain the exact quantity added to
those places, I know it to be considerable, so that in round numbers we have
an increase between the year 1668 and 1850, when the last embankment was

made at Sunk Island, of about 10,000 acres, accumulated between Paull and
the Spurn. It is a question. Where does it come from ? Some are of
opinion that it is brought into the Humber by the flood-tide, being the soil

washed down by the sea along the Holderness coast ; while others are equally
confident that the soil from the sea-coast never enters the Humber, but that
it is brought down from the shores of the Humber itself. From the best

observations I have been able to make, I find that the deposit does not take

place either at the flood or at the ebb-tide, or yet at any time when the water

is in motion ; but only at high-water, when it is in a quiescent state, and the
quantity left is just in proportion to the depth of the tide at the time. Now,

if the deposit be brought down the river, the only quiescent state it could

have when so brouglit down, would be at the turn of the tide at low water,

and therefore no accumulation could take place such as we have been de-

scribing, at least from that direction ; for immediately the current begins to
form with the flood, the whole of the loose deposit is again set in motion.

Taking, therefore. Sunk Island as the point for consideration at the time

of high water of spring-tides, where is it likely the mud could come from

Wewhich is found in suspension above the surface of the land ?  have seen

that the ebb could not deposit it, because of the current and the lowness of

the surface of the water ; then finding that the deposit does take place, and

can only take place at high water, if it does not come from the sea, whence

can it come ? Somewhat further to illustrate this theory, I will make one

other observation. I have already shown that the accretions of Sunk Island

and the immediate vicinity amount to about 10,000 acres. Now, according

to the statement made in the valuable publication by Professor Phillips, ' On

the Rivers, Mountains, and Sea Coast of Yorkshire,' 2^ yards on an average
are lost by the incursion of the sea annually, between the Spurn and Brid-

lington ; and this I fully believe. I have during the present year tested the

waste at Hornsea, and found that during the last forty-four years the average

loss was 7 feet 1 inch and three-tenths. Taking the length of coast so acted

upon at 40 miles, we have a loss during the 182 years prior to 1850 of up-

wards of 6000 acres ; and making the allowance due to the difl^erence in
cubic contents, the clifl" along the sea coast being much higher than the

depth of the bed of the Humber, where the Sunk Island accretion has taken
--44 REPORT 1853.

place, the 10,000 acres' gain within the Humber will very fairly account for
the loss of 6000 acres on the sea coast. If, therefore, the great accretions of
Sunk Island and its immediate neighbourhood are not formed by the loss ot
the land on the shores of the Humber, what becomes of the loss from the
Myforeshores of the Humber thus washed away?
                                                         answer is, that a large

amount of it may pass up the rivers Trent, Ouse, Don, &c., and find its way
on to the extensive tracts of land so wonderfully improved of late years by
what is termed " warping," i. c. by the process of admitting the tidal water
by means of sluices on to the surface of the land, carrying with it a heavy
charge of mud, which on the turn of tide is left on tiie land. By this process

the most worthless land has been rendered the most fertile and valuable.
When therefore we take into account that tens of thousands of acres have

been thus improved by an average depth of 2 or 3 feet of this rich

matter, the question of where does the lost land of the Humber go to is in
some measure answered. I may mention that I have known land put under
the process of warping, on which, in about two and a half years, an average
depth of deposit of 3 feet has taken place ; and within a year or two alter
tiie tides have been shut out, the land is brought into tillage, and crops of
corn growing. By this process, thousands of acres of extensive swamps in
the Vale of the Humber might, at a comparatively small cost, become valu-

able and profitable.                                                otr

  uI have only now briefly
                          to  notice  the  currents and  channelis       ^t.hu e  Huin-

mber ; and as I have already stated that the principal changes taking place
the mud and sand-banks are above Hull, so also, and as a matter of course,
                                                                                                               that
is  it with the currents and channels, and so rapid and frequent are they,
it  can scarcely be told twenty-four hours beforehand where the channel                                        may

be. Below Hull the currents and channels are more fixed and steady, and
it is only occasionally that any material change occurs. It may not prove
uninteresting for a moment to trace the direction of the current, as it more

generallv proceeds downward.                                                                                   .

    The streams of the Trent and Ouse unite above Faxfleet Mess, having
come in contact at about right angles with each other, and there being little
difference in the volume and force of each, their united force would naturally
produce an angle of about 45 degrees ; and so we find it to be the case. 1 he
greater bulk of the stream passes along in front of Whitton, and finding a

hard surlace, can make very little impression on the beach,-- continues in
the direction of Brough, and again meeting with the same hard formation
(lias), is pitched ofi" in the direction of Ferriby, and again is repelled by
the chalk of that district in the direction of Hessle, where meeting with
another hard face it is again diverted, and proceeds in the direction of a little
below Barton. Leaving on its north what is termed the Hessle middle, and

passing New Holland, it takes the direction of Hull and the deep bend of

Marfleet and Hedon, until it feels the hard gravel formation of High Faull,
when it is directed again to the Lincolnshire shore close in by Kelhngholme
and Stallingborough, and thence to the north side of the Burcom, south ot
the Middle Sand, and north of the Bull to the sea. This is not an engineer-
                                                               on the improvement

of the navigation of the Humber by                      and

has been said on the question of depositing mud in the Humber, dredged
from the docks. As a general principle, I think it is right that nothing
                                                                    any kind                                   but
should be  deposited  in  navigable  rivers, or indeed  rivers  ol                                          ;

with reference to the mud taken out of our docks, I am of opinion that no
part of it ren.ains in the channel where discharged from the barges, for had
this been the case and the deposit remained, we should have had an island
              ON STEAM NAVIGATION' IN HULL.                                                      45

opposite Hull before now ; and I maititain that no particle of it either does
or can remain in the channels of the Humber. But if, as persons affirm, it
must settle somewhere, and the deposit does take place on tlie foreshores, it
will do good instead of harm, for it would thereby tend to contract the capa-
city of the navigable space, and deepen the channels. The Humber is now
too wide for the volume of water passing down it ; but contract its width,
and just in proportion as that is done, the depth will be increased. Some
time ago I had an opportunity of closely examining the foreshore in front of
the Pottery at Hull, where the Hull Dock Company had been in the habit
for many years of depositing the mud from the docks ; but instead of any
accumulation, I found the hard blue clay, and in some places extensive beds
of peat, but not the least deposit of mud, for at this part of the Humber we
have a strong current which at once sweeps away such light matter.

    This noble arm of the sea is no longer to be left to its own uncontrolled

sway, but is now and will henceforth be under the vigilant eye of a con-
servator, whose chief business will be to see that no damage is done to it.
 It would have been more satisfactory had the powers of Captain Cator (who
 has the honour of being the first conservator) extended over its two great
fingers also, the Trent and the Ouse, and that authority were given to exe-
 cute extensive works for their improvement.

    It is with great pleasure that I would refer to the admirable manner in
 which the beacons and buoys are arranged and managed by the Corporation
 of the Hull Trinity House ; and I have heard it remarked by a Captain in
the Royal Navy, that nothing can be more beautiful than the way in which
 the lights and buoys of the Humber are disposed for its safe navigation, even

by perfect strangers.

Hull, September 7, 1853.

On the Rise, Progress, and present Position of Steam Navigation in
  Hull. By James Oldham, Esq., Civil Engineer, Hull, M.I.C.E.

                    [A communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

In every new discovery, whether of Science or Art, it is seldom that the
thought or idea is confined to one individual and to one place ; but the all-
wise Creator has caused the same thoughts and feelings to be at work, and to
become developed in different minds, and it may be in widely separated places

at the same time, so that it is often difficult to determine by whom and where

the first discovery originated. It would appear as if some of those rich
treasures were too precious to be entrusted to one single individual, a con-
trary arrangement securing to the world the benefits contemplated.
--46 REPORT lfi53.

In the rise or commencement of steam navigation, like all other discoveries

and inventions which have answered and succeeded in the application, many

persons are found to claim the honour of that which may or may not be their

due. Now, in reference to the first discovery of propelling vessels by steam-

power, we have, amongst others, the following countries as claimants, viz.
England, Scotland, America, and Italy. It is not my intention to enter into

any lengthened statement of the claims of different places, but briefly so, in

order to show that Hull was among the first.
   On the 21st of December, 1736, Jonathan Hulls took out a patent for a

steam-boat, which was, without doubt, the very first attempt that was ever

made to apply steam for the purpose of navigation ; at least we have nothing

older on record. Hulls, as is well known, published his letters-patent, and

a description of his invention, illustrated by a drawing, in 1737> which he

entitled a " Description and Draught of a new invented Machine for carry-

ing vessels or ships out of, or into any Harbour, Port, or River, against wind

or tide, or in a calm."

It appears from a paper of Professor Renwick of New York, published in

Weale's edition of " Tredgold on the Steam-Engine," that the first attempt

to propel boats by steam in America was made in the year 1783, by Fitch

and Rumsey ; but it was not until 1807 that it was made to perform with
success by Fulton. In Scotland, about the year 1788, a trial was made at

Dalswinton to propel boats by steam, by Mr. Patrick Miller of that place

and again, an experiment was made on the Forth and Clyde Canal, by the

same person, in 1789, and it is said with good results; but from some cause

or other, Mr. Miller appears to have abandoned the thing altogether. About

this time, a person in Italy, of the name of D. S. Serratti, also proposed the

application of steam to the purposes of navigation.

In 1801 and 1802, Mr. William Symington constructed a steam-boat for

towing vessels on the Forth and Clyde Canal, but nothing of importance re-

sulted from the experiment.

To come a little nearer home, it will be gratifying to many to hear that in

Hull, about the year 1787, experiments were made on the River Hull by

Furnace and Ashton, in the propulsion of vessels by steam-power. Furnace

and Ashton built a boat which plyed on the river between Hull and Beverley

for some time, and answered exceedingly well. In consequence of the good

results of their experiments, they built a much larger vessel and engine, and

sent the whole to London to be put together and finished, after which it was

subjected to the severest tests, and gave the greatest satisfaction. This ves-

sel was bought by the Prince Regent (afterwards George IV.), who had it

fitted and furnished as a pleasure yacht ; but it was soon afterwards burnt,

having, it is supposed, been set on fire by persons who were afraid that such

an invention would be injurious to their calling.

The Prince was so much pleased with the invention and ingenuity of Fur-

nace and Ashton, that he granted them a pension for life of ^70 a year each.

Furnace was a native of Beverley, and Mr. Ashton was a medical gentleman,

having been articled to the father of the late W. and C. Bolton of this place,

but I do not know whence he came.

The steamer was on the paddle principle, propelled by a steam-engine, to

which was attached a copper boiler ; and this, I regret to saj% is all I can

give in detail as to the construction, and I also regret to add, that all from

Mywhom I obtained information are now no more.       father, himself an en-

gineer, who knew the vessel from personal inspection, gave me the best

information. The late Mr. Matthew Collyford Banks (whose father, Roger

Banks, made the principal part of the machinery), although a boy, witnessed
ON STEAM NAVIGATION IN HULL.                                            47

the performance of the vessel, and assisted in the construction of the engine,

&c., and he gave me information on the subject. The late Mr. William
Bolton, to whom allusion has been made, and the late Captain Joyce, who
had the command of the boat, were both well acquainted with the circum-
stances, and communicated to me facts relating to the invention and perform-

ance of the steamer.

    Thus I hope I have, by this brief introduction, established the claim of

Hull to be ranked amongst the first in the introduction of this wonderful in-

vention, which has become so indispensable to the requirements of the world,

and so beneficial to mankind. It was not before the 12th of October in the

year ISl*, that the first steam-boat began to ply on the Humber as a great
palpable fact, when we were all in some degree excited by the novelty of
seeing the "Caledonia" commence running regularly between Hull and

Gainsborough,

    Thus while all Europe was involved in war and confusion, and empires were
rising and falling. Science was quietly at work ; and this, one of the most im-
portant discoveries ever made for the worlds' benefit, was struggling into life

and activity.

   The following is the first notice I can find in the Hull papers on the sub-

--ject of steam-boats, which I copied from the "Rockingham" of the 15th of

October, ISl'i: "The steam-boat Caledonia, lately arrived here, has during
the week been exhibiting her capabilities on the Humber ; and it appears
that, with both wind and tide strong against her, her speed is considerable.
On Wednesday she went off for Gainsborough, and the weather being favour-

able, reached Burton Stather in the space of an hour and a half, travelling at
the rate of 1 4 miles an hour."

--I also copied the following from the same paper of the 13th of May, 1815
   " The ' Caledonia,' a steam-packet, we understand last Saturday went from
hence up the River Ouse to Naburn, about 4 miles from York, with intention

of proceeding to that city, but the lock was not sufficiently wide to admit of
her passing through it. The packet had arrived from Hull on the same day,

making the whole distance in that time, 122 miles." No doubt it is intended
to convey the fact, that the whole distance from Hull to Naburn Lock and
back to Hull, traversed in one day, was 122 miles. The " Caledonia" was

followed by others of a more improved construction ; the " John Bull," the
" Humber," the " British Queen," the " Mercury," " Dart," " Rockingham,"
and others. The " Humber" was advertised in the Hull papers on the 25th
of August, 1815, to run between Hull and Selby in five hours, and to carry
best-cabin passengers at 65., and fore-cabin passengers at 4^. each.

    Having established the safety and utility of steam-boats on rivers, the next
idea was to try them on the sea, but many were the doubts and fears ex-
pressed at so perilous an undertaking. However, notwithstanding the warn-
ings and prejudices of nautical men, in the year 1821 our highly respected
and enterprising townsmen, Messrs. Brownlow and Co., were the first to send
out sea-going steamers from Hull, to run between Hull and London ; and
the first ship they flespatched was the " Kingston," the engine of which was
made by the late Overton and Smith of this place. This is supposed to have
been the first gea-going steamer plying on the east coast of England. The
owners had great anxiety and expense at the commencement, but they per-
severed, and have triumphed in no small degree, for they have now of one
kind or another about fourteen steamers*. The " Kingston" was followed
by the " Yorkshiremau," "Prince Frederick," "London," &c. From that
time to the present the fleet of both river and sea-going steamers has con-

*  Ten  sea-going                                          four river.

tinually increased, and we have now a goodly number plying in almost every
direction ; those within the Humber running to the tollowing places, viz.
Grimsby, New Holland, Barton, Ferriby Sluice, Gainsborough, Goole,
Thome, Selby, and York ; coasters, to London, Yaimouth, Lynn, Wisbeach,
Newcastle, and Leith ; foreign parts, St. Petersburgh, Christiania, Gotten-

   Many of our finest steamers, both of wood and of iron, have been built in
Hull ; and in justice to my scientific fellow-townsmen, I must say that they
have displayed so much talent in the art of steam-ship building, as to secure

for themselves a large amount of respect and commendation. There is, how-
ever, with some exceptions, a great want of public spirit and bold enterprise
in Hull, or I do not fear to say, it might have become one of the first places
in Britain for shipbuilding ; but it is never too late to amend. As a localit}',
there is every facility for Carrying on an extensive business; its position in
reference to the north of Europe cannot be surpassed. The fine level shores
of the Humber give facility for constructing building-yards and patent slips
to any extent, and the ready communication with the iron, timber, and coal
districts all combine to point out the advantages we possess, almost beyond
any other place in the United Kingdom.

   Many important improvements in the form and construction of steamers
in Hull have taken place since the commencement here ; and although we

cannot boast of a John Scott Russell, a Robert Napier, and a John Laird,
yet we have the advantage of their experience and science in many fine
specimens of their build belonging to our port ; and I may assert, that the
lessons of those gentlemen will not be lost upon us.

    Hull, too, has contributed its share in the improvement of the steam-engine,
as applied more particularly to navigation; for it was the late Mr. Witty, of
the firm of Todd and Witty of Hull, who first adapted the oscillating cylinder
to practical uses, which is now so generally applied to steam-boats. I do
not mean to say that Mr. Witty applied his oscillating engine to steam-boats,
but he did upwards of thirty years ago set one to work in a manufactory at
Hull of six or eight horse-power, which continued for several years, fully
answering the purpose. After this it was that the invention was applied to
marine purposes by Penn of Greenwich, and others. Some of Penn's beau-
tiful engines may be seen on board the " Harlequin," " Columbine," and
" Atalanta," running between Hull and Gainsborough ; also, on the same
principle by Robinson and Russell, on board the " Manchester," and by

Messrs. Rennie on board the " Sheffield," Hull and New Holland steamers
and by our own townsmen, Brownlow and Pearson, on board the beautiful

new ship the " Eagle ;" and Messrs. Earle, on board the " Minister Thor-
becke." I have been more particular in giving this detailed statement as a
tribute to the memory of poor Witty, who, like many others, had few to sup-
port and encourage him in his just claims while living.

    I have great pleasure in referring to another highly important invention by
a townsman, which, although not yet applied to marine engines, no doubt
shortly will, and must be, and which bids fair to take an important stride in

--their improvement, I mean Messrs. Locking and Cook's patent rotary-valve,

the invention of William Cook of this place, a working engineer. It is
already fitted to a pair of engines, and fully answers, if it does not exceed, the
most sanguine expectations formed upon its merits. As the principle will be
fully explained by Mr. Locking, I will not at present say more about it, except
that I hope to see it in general use, applied to marine, locomotive, and fixed

engines.

   Looking back at what has been done in steam navigation, and the rapid

strides effected during tlie last forty years, what may we not anticipate a few
years hence ? When the first trials were made ordinary land-engines were
applied ; now we have the most compact engine imaginable : then paddles
were the only system of propulsion ; now the screw in a variety of forms
is rapidly taking the lead : formerly we had only wooden boats, now iron
ones. Thus year after year we are advancing and improving. I think it
probable that the time is not very far distant when steam-boats, of one

descrption or other, will almost if not entirely supersede sailing vessels.

ON THE STRENGTH OF LOCOMOTIVE BOILERS.  53

 Experimental Researches to determine the Strength of Locomotive

    Boilers, and the Causes which lead to Explosion. By William

    Fairbairn, F.R.S.

                      [A communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

 A DIFFERENCE of opinion having arisen between a gentleman high in

 authority and myself concerning the causes of an accident which took place
 through the explosion of a locomotive engine at Manchester, on the Eastern
 Division of the London and North- Western Railway, I deemed it necessary
 to institute a series of experiments, not for the purpose of confuting the ar-

guments of others or confirming my own, but to determine the real causes

 of the explosion, and to register the observed facts for our future guidance
 in guarding against such fearful catastrophes.

     After a careful examination of the boiler a few hours subsequent to the
explosion, I found one side of the fire-box completely severed from the body
of the boiler, the interior copper box forced inwards upon the furnace ; and
 with the exception of the cylindrical shell which covers the tubes, the whole
of the engine was a complete wreck, as exhibited in Plate I. fig. I.

    Mr. Ramsbottom, the Locomotive Superintendent, in his Report to the
Directors, states that " the engine in question was made l)y Messrs. Sharp,
Roberts and Co. in the year 1840, has been worked at a pressure of 60 lbs.
per square inch, and has run in all a distance of 104,723 miles, a great part
of which has been either entirely without load, or nearly so. As the cylin-
ders are only 13 inch diameter, it has been for some time too light to work
any of our trains; and ha^s therefore been chiefly employed since 1849 in
piloting the trains through Standedge tunnel, along with another engine of
the same size, which is now at work.

   " The fire-box was originally ^^ths of an inch thick, and is now a little over
-^ths of an inch ; and from its excellent condition, might well be supposed (as
indeed it was by Mr. Sharp, of the firm of Sharp Brothers and Co., who

inspected it a few days after the accident) to have been recently put in new.
It is perfectly free from flaw or patch, and would certainly have run at least
100,000 miles. The same may also be said with respect to the outer shell,
which is nearly of the original thickness. The engine had been in the
repairing shop the three months previous to the accident; and the iron fire-

box stays, about which so much has been said, were tested by the hammer
in the usual way, and were considered, both by the workmen and the foreman,
Wheatley, to be all sound. When originally made, they were y^ths in
diameter, and were equal to a strain of at least ten times the force they had
to sustain. With the exception of one stay, which was on the top row, the
one most reduced from oxidation was half-inch diameter; and supposing the
hold on the copper box to have been good, it was capable of resisting a strain
of rather more than 6^ times the working pressure, equal, say, to 390 lbs.
per square inch. The only point therefore which could admit of doubt as
to the safety of the boiler, was with respect to the hold which the stays

might have in the copper box ; but it appears, from experiments which I
have since made, and which are about to be repeated by Mr. Fairbairn, that
from the force required to pull some of the old stays out of a copper plate
similar to the fire-box, into which they had been screwed by the old threads
only, and not riveted, the boiler could not have burst under a pressure of

less than 300 lbs. per square inch. One of the old stays, which had had the
thread partially damaged from being ripped out of the copper box by the
explosion, was screwed by hand into a copper plate, by the old thread, to a
--54 REPORT 1853.

depth equal to the thickness of the fire-box plate, but not riveted, and it

required a dead weight of 8204; lbs. to pull it out ; and as each stay has to

support a surface of 5 inches, X 5f inches, say 27 square inches only, it fol-
lows that a pressure of 820i-r-27= 303*85 lbs. per square inch would have

been required to strip it.
   " Another stay, which had not been stripped by the explosion, but M'hich

was screwed out of the old box, was similarly treated, and required a force

of 9'184 lbs. to strip it, equal to 340 lbs. per square inch,"

Since the experiments here referred to were made, 1 have repeated them

with great care ; and taking into account the tensile strength of the stays

--in their corroded state of the side of the fire-box, which to appearance was

the first to give way, I find that a force of 380 lbs. upon the square inch
would be required to eifect rupture; and the results of the experiments on

the resistance of stays screwed into the copper fire-box fully confirm those
already made by Mr. Ramsbottom. Assuming therefore that the ends of the

screws were riveted, and sound in other respects, we may reasonably con-

clude that a strain of not less than 450 to 500 lbs. upon the square inch
would be required to strip the screws, or tear the stays themselves asunder.

I have founded these facts upon the experiment of the resisting powers of

the iron stay screwed into a portion of the copper cut out of the ruptured
fire-box, and another experiment of a similar stay first and then riveted, as
shown in the annexed sketch.

  =The stay marked A, fths of an inch in diameter, in the first experiment

required a force of 18,260 lbs. 8*l tons to

strip the screw, and draw it out of the cop-
per; and the stay B, of exactly the same

dimensions, but riveted over the end, re-

quired a force of 24,140 lbs.= 10'7 tons be-

fore it was dislodged*. Taking therefore
the mean of those experiments, including

those of Mr. Ramsbottom, and we arrive at

the results given above, namely, a resisting
power of 785 lbs. on the square inch, to burst
or produce fracture in the stays and side of

the fire-box.

In locomotive engines of more recent con-

struction, where the stays are thicker and

formed into squares of 4 to 4| inches, the
resisting powers will probably be increased to
850 or 900 lbs. on the square inch, that is,

7 or 8 times the working pressure.

   On a careful examination of the fire-box

and every other part of the boiler, it was

found that the stays and copper were perfect,

and that they were able to sustain a pressure much exceeding 207 lbs. upon

the square inch, as given in the following table.

In these experiments, the top of the fire-box sank a little, owing to the

breakage of a bolt of one of the cross-bars                                                                                                                                                                             but the fire-box stays were quite
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

perfect, and to every appearance would have sustained nearly double that

pressure. If the fipe-box stays had been new and the top well-stayed, it is
more than probable that a force from 800 to 900 lbs. on the square inch
would have been required to cause rupture.

               Vide Experiments in the Appendix.
ON THE STRENGTH OF LOCOMOTIVE BOILERS.  55

    As much stress has been laid upon the weakness of the stays which unites

 the Bat surface of the boiler to the sides of the fire-box, the following ex-
periments clearly indicate that the fire-box stays are not the weakest parts

of a locomotive boiler, and that we have more to fear from the top of the
furnace, which under severe pressure is almost invariably the first to give

way. Great care should therefore be observed in the construction of this
part, as the cross-beams should not only be strong, but the bolts by which
the crown of the fire-box is suspended should also be of equal strength, in
order that no discrepancy should exist, and that all the parts should be pro-
poi'tioned to a resisting force of at least 500 lbs. on the square inch.

    Finding our knowledge with regard to the power of resistance of locomo-
tive boilers to strain exceedingly imperfect, I availed myself of the present
opportunity to determine by actual experiment the laws on which these
powers are founded ; and for this purpose the Directors of the London and

North- Western Railway Company placed in my hands an engine of the

same age, constructed by the same makers, and in every respect a fac-simile
of that which exploded. This engine was subjected to hydraulic pressure

as follows:

Experiment made May i^th, 1853, (o determine the Resisting Powers of the

   Fire-box and Exterior Shell of No. 2 Engine on the Eastern Division of
   the London and North Western Railway.

   In this experimenti the boiler was furnished with a valve, A, of exactly
1 inch area, and a lever of the annexed dimensions, as per sketch, fig. 3. This

lever, 15 : 1, gave as the weight upon the valve 35 lbs., and having suspended
the scale, which indicated with the lever 50 lbs., the following results were
obtained :

--58 REPORT 1853.

Let us now endeavour from this table to discover the law expressing

the relation between the time and pressure, or between the time and tem-

perature *.

The observations being made at intervals of one minute of time, and the

furnace being maintained at the same intensity, it may be presumed that the

quantity of heat communicated to the water was uniform, or that there were

equal quantities of absolute heat communicated to the boiler in equal times.
   The column of pressures gives the successive augmentations of pressure at

equal intervals, and the column of temperatures gives the corresponding

augmentations of heat as indicated by the thermometer.

The column of pressures shows that the increments of pressure, in equal

intervals of time, increase with the temperature ; thus at or near '260░ the

average increment of pressure is at the rate of 3'1 lbs. per minute ; at or

near 282░, it is 5*4 lbs. per minute; and at or near 326░, it is 7"1 lbs. per

minute.

Mr. Ramsbottom's table of experiments indicates a similar result; thus at

or near 268░ the average increment of pressure is at the rate of 4 lbs.,
whereas at or near 304░ it is at the rate of 5 lbs. per minute.

   The law, therefore, expressing the relation of time and pressure does not

appear to admit of assuming a simple form. But the case is different with

respect to the law expressing the relation of time and temperature. Thus if

T=temperature in degrees, and ^=the time in minutes at which this tem-

peratui'e is observed, estimated from the commencement of the experiments,

then                                                                (1)

Twill give the relation between and t with great precision where a and b

are constants, whose values, derived from these experiments, are a=4*44 and

which exactly corresponds with the tabular value.
   Again, let <=180, then

             T=4-44 X 180-486=313-2

in this case the tabular value is 313░.
    Again, let <=18.5, then

             T=4-44 X 185-486=335░-4

in this case the tabular value is 335░*6.                           ^(2)^

which is nearly the time in which the boiler experimented upon would burst.
    These facts appear to be sufficiently conclusive to enable us to judge of

the dangers to which people expose themselves under circumstances where
the necessary precautions are not taken for allowing the steam thus gene-
rated with the fire under the boiler to escape. The great majority of acci-
dents of this kind have arisen during the time the engines are standing, pro-

Howbably with the safety-valve fastened and a brisk fire under the boiler.

very often do we find this to be the case in tracing the causes of these
melancholy and unfortunate occurrences I

   The statements contained in the earlier part of this paper regarding the
strength of the stays of the fire-box would have been incomplete if we had

not put those parts of a locomotive boiler, comprised in the flat surfaces or

sides of a fire-box, to the test of experiment.
    This was done with more than ordinary care ; and in order to attain con-

elusive results, two thin boxes, each 22 inches square and 3 inches deep,

were constructed ; the one corresponding in every respect to the sides of
the fire-box, distance of the stays, &c., the same as those which composed the
exploded boiler ; and the other formed of the same thickness of plates, but

different in the mode of staying, which, in place of being in squares of 5 inches
asunder, as those contained in the boiler which burst, were inserted in
squares of 4 inches asunder. In fact, they were formed as per annexed
sketch (Figs. 4 and 5), the first containing 16 squares of 25 inches area, and
 representing the exploded boiler, or old construction ; and the other, with
 25 squares of 16 inches area, representing the new construction.

   The mathematical theory would lead us to expect that the strength of the
plates would be inversely as the surfaces between the stays ; but a comparison
of the results of these experiments shows that the strength decreases in a
higher ratio than the increase'of space between the stays. Thus, according
to the mathematical theory, we should have

                                                    =815xf|=1273 lbs.

Now this plate sustained 1 625 lbs. per square inch, showing an excess of

about one-fourth above that indicated by the law.

This is in excess of the force required to strip the screw of a stay -j-^ths

of an inch in diameter, such as those which formed the support of the flat sur-

faces in the exploded boiler.
    It will be found that a close analogy exists throughout the whole experi-

ments, as respects the strengths of the stays when screwed into the plates,

whether of copper or iron ; and that the riveting of the ends of the stays

adds to their retaining powers an increased strength of nearly 14 per cent, to

that which the simple screw affords. The difference between a fire-box stay

when simply screwed into the plate and when riveted at the ends is there-

fore in the ratio of 100 : 76, nearly the same as shown by experiment in

the Appendix.

strain upon one square of section would be about 13 tons, which is con-

siderably within the limits of rupture of wrought iron under a tensile force.

   In the experiments here referred to, it must be borne in mind that they
were made on plates and stays at a temperature not exceeding 50░ of Fahr-

enheit ; and the question naturally occurs, as to what would be the differ-

ence of strength under the influence of a greatly increased temperature in

the water surrounding the fire-box, and that of the incandescent fuel acting

upon the opposite surface of the plates.

This is a question not easily answered, as we have no experimental facts

sufficiently accurate to refer to ; and the difference of temperature of the

furnace on one side, as compared with that of the water on the other, in-

creases the difficulty, and renders any investigation exceedingly unsatisfactory.
--64 REPORT 1853.

Judging, however, from practical experience and observation, I am inclined

Myto think that the strengths of the metals are not much deteriorated.  ex-

periments on the effects of temperature on cast iron* do not indicate much

loss of strength up to a temperature of 600░. Assuming therefore that

copper and wrought iron plates follow the same law, and taking into account
the rapid conducting powers of the former, we may reasonably conclude that

the resisting powers of the plates and stays of locomotive boilers are not

seriously affected by the increased temperature to which they are subject in

a regular course of working. This part of the subject is, however, entitled

to future consideration ; and I trust that some of our able and intelligent

superintendents will institute further inquiries into a question which involves

considerations of some importance to the public, as well as to the advancement

of our knowledge in practical science.

                                                  Appendix.

   In order to test with accuracy the tensile power of the different descriptions
of stays used in locomotive boilers, and to effect a comparison between those
screwed into the plates and those both screwed and riveted, it was deemed
expedient to repeat Mr. Ramsbottora's experiments on a larger scale ; and
by extending the tests to copper stays as well as iron ones, it was consi-
dered that no doubt could exist as to the ultimate strength of those simply
screwed, the tensile powers of the stays themselves, and the relative difference
between those and the finished stays when screwed and riveted on both sides
of the fire-box.

   The large lever and requisite apparatus being at hand, the experiments

proceeded as follows :

The investigations directed by the Association at the Belfast Meeting with

respect to the gases evolved in the steeping of flax and the composition of
flax straw are in progress, and will be reported at the next meeting. The
gases of the fermenting vat have been analysed by the methods of Professor
Bunsen, and have been found to consist of carbonic acid, hydrogen, and

nitrogen. No sulphuretted hydrogen has in any case been detected. Several

analyses of the proximate constituents of the dressed fibre and of its inorganic
ingredients have been made, which show that a considerable amount of the
nitrogenized and other constituents of the plant are retained in the fibre, even
after steeping and dressing have been employed to remove the structures

unsuitable for textile purposes.

previously, subjected to experiment, first in 1846, and secondly in 1848.

   The circumsiances under which they were sown were similar to those an-

On the Chemical Action of the Solar Radiations.
                 By Robert Hunt.

                                                           [Second Report.]

--Note. [In the former Report a division was made between the analytical

examination of the solar spectrum by absorbent media, and the chemical
results obtained from the spectra which had been thus subjected to absorp-
tion. It has been found inconvenient, in the examination of the woodcut
illustrations, to have constantly to refer from page to page when comparing
the chromatic with the chemical effects. This arrangement has, therefore,
been altered in the present Report, and the chemical spectrum is given imme-
diately after the description of the luminous spectrum. In all other respects
the same order of arrangement is maintained ; the numbers attached to the
glasses, &c. remain unaltered, and where new specimens have been introduced
they have been numbered in continuation. This remark applies also to the
paragraphs, so that reference from one to the other, when required, will be
made without difficulty. The uncertain state of the present summer, and
the small amount of sunshine with which we have been favoured, has greatly
retarded the progress of this investigation.]

   (70). The Chemical preparation employed in the series of experiments
which I have now to describe, was the iodide of silver as obtained on the

ordinary iodized paper, rendered sensitive by the mixture of gallic acid and
nitrate of silver. As, however, I find that nearly every variety of paper, and

certainly, every different manipulation, gives rise to an alteration in the scale

of sensibility, it becomes important that I should describe exactly the charac-

ter of the paper employed.

  A very hard and uniform paper of Turner's was selected ; its surface

being beautifully pressed, and presenting a fine ivory character. It was first
washed with a solution of sixty grains of nitrate of silver to the fluid ounce
of distilled water, and dried ; then with a solution of thirty grains of the
iodide of potassium to the fluid ounce of water. After standing for a few
minutes, each sheet was placed in a large vessel of water, and allowed to soak
for about half-an-hour. After this, being hung by one corner, it was allowed

to dry in a warm room ; if the atmosphere was moist, at a short distance

from the fire.
    This paper was placed upon the screen on which the spectrum obtained

fell, after it had been submitted to the action of the medium under examina-
tion. Everything being carefully adjusted, the paper was washed rapidly
by a wide flat brush, with the following mixture :

Saturated solution of gallic acid  40 drops.

Nitrate of silver, thirty grains to fluid oz. of water. . 10 drops.

The action was, in most cases, allowed to continue for a few seconds only,
and the image developed itself slowly in the dark, without any subsequent

application of the developing fluid.

from the reduction of the green space) ; the illuminating powers of the out-

standing rays are but very slightly diminished.                                                              Fig- 35.

low ray about '20 above a! ; it extends, in the first instance,

over a space equal to '10, forming a patch of a semi-metal-

~lic lustre with an olive-grey colour ; this action is continued

for another equal space, but the impressed space has more

of a brown hue ; these gradually blend into one nearly cir-                                                  I

cating, as it appears to me, a set of rays of distinct character.
Beyond this, at about '60, another oval forms, which con-
tinues and extends to "15, or sometimes, if the sun is very

bright, to '20 beyond a. This space, equal to -60, is in
every respect very broadly distinguished from that which is produced between

the Clines and F of Fraunhofer. It is characterized by a light, cloudy

brown colour, which deepens a little in colour beyond the luminous Ym. .36.
rays of the ordinary spectrum, when it is somewhat suddenly shaded

off. The action may be well represented by two ovals, one consider-
ably larger and longer than the other, which overlap ; and it would

appear that the change of colour observed in the upper section of the

lower space is due to this involved action of two sets of rays. In the

chemical spectrum described (52), obtained after the absorptive action
of a medium yellow glass (6), No. 18, an indication of precisely similar
peculiarity was obtained on the collodion plate, although at that time

sufficient importance was not attached to the difference.

  --(7S) 74. Yellow, hy Iron. The least refrangible rays are scarcely at all

influenced by this glass ; the orange is slightly extended upon the red ; and
the yellow in a similar manner encroaches on the green rays. The green

rays are, however, very decided, and beyond them there still appears an out-

standing line of blue, or rather dark indigo ; but beyond these no further

rays are visible.

   (74) 74. At the most refrangible edge of the yellow rays the chemical
action begins ; and it may be at once described as extending to the very edge

of the space occupied by the visible rays of the unabsorbed spectrum. In

this, as in the spectrum from the carbon yellow glass (7 1 . 72),                                            S- 37.
a like dissimilarity was observable between the action of the

two ends of the chemically active rays, although not to the

same extent. The lower space, which commences about

и40 above a' and extends to above -60, is a pale gray spot,                                               f
with a well-defined outline. The upper space, commencing

at 'S5 above a' and extending completely up to a, is much

broader than the first, less perfectly defined, and of a brown

colour of the same character as that already described.

are preserved in their purity, with the exception that the orange rays are some-

what reduced, and appear as a well-defined band, of more brilliancy than when

seen without the interposition of this medium ; and much white light is seen

ill the yellow ray. In observing natural colours through this glass, the

absorption of all the blue rays, and those beyond, becomes very sensible.

by the most luminous rays, the orange, yellow, and the least refrangible green.

again, the action of the green is far less intense. Where the

gradations of shade are very slight, it is not easy to speak               ^

decidedly as to their character ; but the least refrangible

space may be described as gray ; the next in order, and by far the most in-

tense, as an iron-gray or brotize; and the next as a pure broivn. There were

sometimes indications obtained of a central line of action, extending from the:

green up into the blue rays ; but this was always exceedingly faint, and only

to be found when the atmosphere was clear and the sun very bright.

considerable portion of the violet rays, leaving the other rays without any

considerable change.

the present one on iodized paper is not comparable with any previous im-

changes are, however, remarkable. In the very centre of

the yellow ray a faint spot is produced ; then all action

as a mere long oval stain, of pretty uniform intensity, to

limited to two well-defined spaces ; one, the most intense, a
dark oval over the point of greatest luminous intensity,

equal to '20, commencing at "15 above a' and terminating

at '35 a'. Between this point and the most refrangible

violet there is no effect, the paper remaining quite un-

changed ; then at the extreme verge of the luminous spec-
trum a weak chemical action commences, which extends to
1*20. This is singularly weak, except in the mean space

about -10 above a, where the influence of the chemical rays

is more decided.

   (87) 6y. Although this chemical spectrum differs in some

respects from others already described, yet it exhibits pecu-

liarities which are, to a certain extent, common to all the

actions which have yet been obtained through yellow me-
dia. The chemical change commences and is most decided

in the yellow ray, where an olive-brown oval is rapidly
formed. At '70 above a' the second chemical change

occurs, forming a brown oval, which extends to 1*30. These
two ovals are connected by a very faint neck, which is only

chemical action makes its appearance. Thus we have in

this example evidence of two sets of chemical rays which

have a very much greater penetrating power, relative at least

to the yellow media we have been examining, than any of

the others situated in those parts of the spectrum which are

usually referred to as possessing the greatest chemical

power. Other examples of a similar description will be

and without much brilliancy, allows the free permeation of all the rays below

H. When the sun has been very brilliant, a slight shade of violet is visible

beyond the line H. The red of the violet is, however, nearly obliterated.

This yellow medium gives a very decided and in-

tense chemical spectrum. The action commences at '25            "S- 46.

above a', and continues of an olive-brown colour to "50,

the oval formed at first gradually passing into a band.

Then a larger oval is formed, which extends to 1"50, and

sometimes still further. The overlapping of these, as pre-

viously noticed, is very apparent in this spectrum, and the

colours of the upper oval and the lower prolonged space

were as different as any which have yet been noticed.

There were also some evidences of those internal actions

which have been previously observed, but there was much

uniformity in the colours and characters of the inner and

outer images.                                                              a^

 --(91) 68. Orange-coloured glass, Silver. Possess-

ing in a remarkable degree the false dispersion observed by

Mr. Stokes. It reflects from one side, when placed on a piece of black

velvet, a peculiar bluish-green light; or when placed on a sheet of white

paper, the scattered light partakes of that mixture of blue and brown which

is ordinarily distinguished as a puce.

   Of this variety of glass, Mr. Stokes makes the following remarks in his

--memoir ' On the Change of Refrangibility of Light': "Orange-coloured

glasses are frequently met with which reflect from one side, or rather scatter
in all directions, a copious light of a bluish-green colour, quite different from
the transmitted tint. In such cases the body of the glass is colourless, and
the colouring matter is contained in a very thin layer on one face of the plate."

    This is not always the case ; in the glass with which the present experi-
ment wa"? made the colouring matter, silver, is diffused throughout the mass.
The peculiarity in question is produced on one surface by exposing it to the

influence of the flame of burning wood.
   Mr. Stokes continues : " As this phenomenon was supposed by Sir John
ON THE CHEMICAL. ACTION OF THE SOLAR RADIATIONS. 73

Herschel to oiFer some analogy with the reflected tints of fluor-spar and a

solution of sulphate of quinine, I was the more desirous of determining the

nature of the dispersion. It proved on examination to be nothing but false

dispersion, so that the appearance might be conceived to be produced by an

excessively fine bluish-green powder contained in a clear orange stratum, or

in the colourless part of the glass immediately contiguous to the coloured

stratum. The phenomenon has therefore no relation to the tints of fluor-

spar or sulphate of quinine. It is true that the very same glass which dis-

played a superficial reflexion of bluish-green, when examined by condensed

sun-light, exhibited also, in its colourless part, a little true dispersion, just as

another colourless glass would do. But this has plainly nothing to do with

the peculiar reflexion which attracts notice in such a glass." The spectrum

transmitted through this glass is shortened by the loss of the violet, indigo,

and nearly all the blue rays ; some rays are, however, still visible beyond
the green, which assume a reddish colour. The orange rays are extended
into the yellow, with which much white light is mixed, and thp least refran-

gible rays lose some of their illuminating power.

another action is established, and a similar well-defined spot

at -50 beyond a. Over the space occupied by the violet
and Sir J. Herschel's lavender rays, there is a space upon _
which no chemical change takes place for a long time ; but

about ''2.0) beyond a a faint spot makes its appearance, which

is followed after a while by another a short distance above

it. This breaking up, as it were, of the spectrum into small

circles of chemical action cannot but be regarded as curious.

At present we are not in a position to offer any explanation

of the phaenomena. At length the three principal spots be-                                             ^,

them of the red of the violet, which are but little altered. The green rays
are still visible, but they lose much intensity by the loss of their blue. The
yellow ray also suffers considerably in its intensity, and indeed the red and

orange are lowered in intensity. So that all the spectrum suffers rather in

its general illuminating power, than in any actual destruction of a particular

ray.

digo falls there is an enlargement in width of the image,

and the colour is a pure brown. The action is continued -

over the violet and lavender spaces as an interior dark oval,

and it extends in diminished intensity to 1*50, when it sud-

denly ceases.

 --(105) 78. Yellow, by Coke. The entire length of the

spectrum is scarcely at all reduced, but the blue and violet

rays blend, forming one band of a faint reddish blue ; the

green rays are somewhat lengthened ; the yellow rays are                                g^
mingled with the orange.

   (106) 78. The difference between this and the former spectrum (104) is
rather in degree. The image is as nearly as possible the same in all its

parts, but that the chemical action extends to the lower point ; it can indeed

be traced down into the orange ray.

 --(107) 79. Uranium glass, Canary-yellow. This is the peculiar yel-

low glass which is employed in the manufacture of toilet bottles and other

ornamental articles, which transmits a pale yellow light, and disperses an

unusual green light. Upon this quality depends its extensive use in orna-

mental glass manufacture. In my experiments I have employed a slab of this

2^glass, the thickness of which is 1 inch, its width  inches, and its length

4^ inches ; and independently of some striae, the glass was of a pretty uni-

form character throughout. This slab enabled me to operate respectively

through the several thicknesses of I, or 2^^ or 4^^ inches, and thus to deter-
mine with very great exactness the thickness of this medium through which

the chemical rays would pass. If a block of this glass, which is a canary-

yellow when we look through it, is placed upon a piece of black velvet, and

we look at it, it appears of a fine yellowish green colour ; this green light

wanting, however, transparency, and exhibiting more the character of a

gleam of monochromatic light piercing through a mist.

If we throw upon the face of this glass a condensed pure spectrum, and

look through the sides of it, so as to observe the passage of the rays, its

powers of internal dispersion become distinctly visible. From the fixed line

b we find this dispersion commences, but few of these rays are enabled to

Apenetrate through the 1-inch thickness of the glass.                         little above F a

minimum point is very observable, and from this point the dispersion of the

rays becomes very decided ; and some of these green rays, when the light is

good, penetrate the glass. This green-dispersed light is visible for a con-

siderable distance beyond the ordinary spectrum ; the entire space which has

usually been designated as the invisible chemical rays, is rendered luminous.

[For a more detailed examination of the optical properties of this glass, I

must refer to Professor Stokes's Memoir ' On the Change of Refrangibility

of Light,' in the Philosophical Transactions for 1852.]

   The ordinary spectrum which permeates this glass is but slightly altered in

--its character, the condition of the rays after having undergone absorption by

this medium being as follows : Beyond the green ray appears a band of a

brownish hue, from the mixture of red with blue ; then the blue appears

again with considerable brightness. On looking at the coloured fringes pro-

duced by the prism, and interposing the uranium glass, it is evident that both

blue and violet rays do permeate.

(108) 79. The chemical effect produced by the solar spectrum after it has

undergone absorption and dispersion by the uranium glass is not a little re-
markable, and requires to be studied with much care. Before each experi-

ment with this glass, it was my practice to obtain an impression from a very

pure concentrated spectrum which had not been subjected to any absorption ;
the object of this being to determine exactly the relation which the chemical
spectrum after absorption and dispersion bore to the unabsorbed image.
This was necessary, as it was found there were many variations, from day to
day, in the chemical powers of the several spaces corresponding with the
coloured rays. Under all circumstances there was the same general character

A space without any chemical change, equal to '45, then occurs. This ap-

pears to agree with the extreme violet ray and the lavender ray of Sir John

Herschel, and the lines of Becquerel and Stokes beyond. Beyond this, that

is, at и45 above a', the most refrangible limits of the known spectrum, a third
oval forms, the entire length of which is -iO ; so that the whole length which

undergoes chemical change is 'US, with the interruption of the action above

                                                     inches, the action

beyond the spectrum is entirely obstructed ; but over the space covered by

the most luminous rays chemical action goes on, with an intensity nearly
equal to that whiclf is produced when the thickness of the slab about 1 inch

only is used for absorption. The third figure in the woodcut represents the

result which is obtained.

where it extends slightly in width. There are in-

permeated 82 were somewhat different, as is shown

in fig. b. The spot corresponds with the yellow ray ; above this, over the
green, there is no action for a space equal to nearly -20, when it again com-
mences, and entirely ceases at the end of the luminous spectrum. In this the

--protecting band is entirely wanting.

excluding all extraneous light from the eye and gazing at the spectrum fixedly
for some time, a trace of the green ray, nearly black, is rendered evident.

    (118) 85. Neither of these three glasses show the slightest transparency
to the chemical rays. Not only is there no effect produced by the action of
the most concentrated spectrum, but the most sensitive calotype paper may
be exposed for many hours to an intense sunshine under them, without show-
ing the least signs of chemical change.

   (119). To the photographic artist this fact is of considerable importance,
since it gives him the means of excluding absolutely all the chemically active
rays, still allowing a sufficient quantity of light to pass to enable him to work

without any inconvenience. Yellow glasses have frequently been employed

--;
    the results shown, however, in this Report prove thenecessity of examining
with great care the yellow glass which is used, as it is not the question of in-
tensity of colour, but of the physical character of the colouring agent, that
regulates the transparency or opacity of the glass to the chemical rays.

         Quinine Solution.

   (120). From the interest attached to the peculiar property of the solution of
sulphate of quinine in water by means of dilute sulphuric acid, to bring into

view a set of rays bej'ond the violet, of a beautiful celestial blue colour, cor-

responding with those produced by the canary-yellow glass, I became anxious

to examine the influence of it on the chemical rays. This became the more

important, since it had been asserted that the ordinarily dark chemical rays

had been rendered visible, and this brought forward as an additional proof

of the identity of the rays producing luminous and chemical phsenomena.
   (121). The solution employed was that recommended by Mr. Stokes, as the

best for observing the peculiar phaenomena o^ fluorescence, as it has been

named, consisting of one part of the sulphate of quinine to 200 parts of water.

For the purpose of ascertaining if any greater degree of absorption was pro-

duced by using a more concentrated solution than this, experiments were
made with such as contained as much as six times this quantity of quinine ;
but unless this is distinctly stated, it will be solutions of the first-named

strength which were employed.

A(122).  plate-glass trough was used, and being first filled with distilled

water, the length and general character of the prismatic spectrum were care-

fully observed and determined. The trough was then filled with the before-
mentioned solution of sulphate of quinine, the result of which was sufficiently

remarkable. The ordinary rays of the Newtonian spectrum passed the solu-

tion freely, and formed a well-defined image upon a screen placed to receive
them. According to the strength of the solution employed, so more or less
of the violet ray was cut off. The absorptive action on the other rays was
quite inappreciable. From the mean violet ray diminishing, however, towards

the end of the ordinary spectrum, the fluorescent rays penetrate the solution

1 inch in thickness, forming a stream of a beautiful celestial blue passing

across the fluid ; beyond this, over a space often nearly equal to the length
of the ordinary spectrum, the new rays continue in view, but in no case
penetrating the fluid. Mr. Stokes's observations may be quoted in confirma-

tion of these conditions :

    " In the case of a solution of sulphate of quinine of the strength of one

part of the disulphate to 200 parts of acidulated water, it has been already

stated that a portion of the rays which are capable of producing dispersed

light passed across a thickness of 3 inches. On forming a pure spectrum,

Hthe fixed line was traced about an inch into the fluid. On passing from
H towards G, the distance that the incident rays penetrated into the fluid

increased with great rapidity, while on passing in the contrary direction it
diminished no less rapidly, so that from a point situated at no great distance
ON THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF THE SOLAR RADIATIONS. 79

Hbeyond to where the light entirely ceased, the dispersion was confined to

the immediate neighbourhood of the surface. When the solution was diluted

so as to be only one-tenth of the former strength, a conspicuous fixed line,

or rather band of sensible breadth, situated in the first group of fixed lines

beyond H, was observed to penetrate about an inch into the fluid. On pass-

ing onwards from the band above-mentioned in the direction of the more

refrangible rays, the distance that the incident rays penetrated into the fluid

rapidly decreased, and thus the rapid increase in the absorbing energy of the

fluid was brought into view in a part of the spectrum in which, with the

stronger solution, it could not be so conveniently made out, inasmuch as the

posterior surface of the space from which the dispersed light came almost

confounded itself with the anterior surface of the fluid."

   (123). The mode of operating was the same as that already described, but
that the experiments were made with very difl'used, and exceedingly concen-

trated spectra. The object of this was to determine if the less powerful rays

were more liable to absorption than those the energy of which had been

exalted by concentration. Hence the various spectra obtained varied in

length from 1 inch to 6 inches.

(124). The annexed woodcut (fig.57) has been copied by the wood engraver

with very great care from the actual spectra obtained. [This indeed has been

done with all the figures of spectra in this, the quinine series.^ The space

from a! to a was the exact length of the visible ordinary spectrum, and under

the conditions of the experiment, i. e. a weak sun and a difl'used image at a

great distance from the slit through which light was admitted, the chemical

impression obtained through the trough filled with distilled water was pre-

cisely that represented. When the quinine solution was substituted, the

second image was the result.

  A(12.5). weaker solution of the sulphate of quinine was employed, and with

                                 a brighter sun than the former, with a

employed in my camera obscura for

the exposure in each case being pre-

cisely one minute. Upwards of
twenty spectra were obtained in the
same morning, and, as a constant re-
sult, the above woodcut maj' be re-
garded as a faithful representation.

    (127). I was anxious to ascertain
the relative differences between the
spectra obtained on the iodide of
silver and those impressed on the
bromide. The paper was first
washed with a solution of bromide of
potassium, 117 grs. to six ounces of
water; then with nitrate of silver,
170*57 grains to three ounces of
water. The spectrum being care-
fully thrown on the paper by nice
adjustment of the prism, &c., it was
washed with weak gallo-nitrate of
silver, the spectrum being shut off
by an opake screen. The screen
being removed, the luminous
image was allowed to act for one
minute, and was then again ob-
structed. Fig. 60 shows the che-
mical image of the spectrum
which had not undergone any
absorption, and the second that
which was obtained when the
quinine trough was interposed.

 --(128). It has been repeatedly ^

stated that the rays at the most
refrangible end of the luminous
spectrum were rendered chemi-
cally inactive by the quinine solu-

tion. When bromide of silver is

employed, this, as is shown in fig.
60, has been a constant result
but in no case where the iodide of
silver has been employed has this
been found to be the case.

by the quinine solution and the uranium glass, the following experiments
were made :

  My photographic camera was carefully adjusted to embrace a somewhat ex-

tensive view, comprehending a granite-wall and trees in the foreground, the sea
in the middle distance, and a town with an extensive range of hills beyond.

   The first view, a very perfect one, was obtained on calotype paper in
fifteen minutes. The glass trough filled with water was then placed in front
of the lens, and the paper exposed for the same time as before. The view
was not so intense, the radiations from the distant objects and the green leaves
of the trees suffering the most by absorption ; a very distinct image never-

theless resulted.

   The glass trough was filled with the quinine solution. There was very
little difference between this and the image obtained when the water was

employed, although it was exposed no longer than the others (fifteen minutes).
The impression was somewhat redder, and the foliage less perfectly made
out : the distant town and land was well made out. The block of uranium
(canary-yellow glass) was now interposed, expecting, since through this
medium the extra spectral rays are very active, that an equally good result
with that obtained through the quinine would have been secured. The
image obtained in fifteen minutes was very imperfect ; it required a consider-
able time for its development, and the picture eventually was little more

than an outline of the objects.

   Some peculiarities, which are not easily explainable, are indicated here
for an examination of which I must, however, wait until sunshine and leisure
enable me to resume my researches.

    (130). M. E, Becquerel has stated, " The most refrangible rays are the
most absorbable," and " that when any part of the luminous spectrum is

absorbed or destroyed by any substance whatever, the part of the chemical
rays of the same refrangibility is equally so " (Comptes Rendus, tom.

xvii. p. 883).

    The results I have recorded show that this is not a constant result. This,
and the peculiarities, now first observed, of the influБnce of absorbent media in
developing a chemical force in the most luminous rays, are left for further

 examination with this passing remark.

Observations on the Character and Measurements of Degradation of

         the Yorkshire Coast. By John P. Bell, M.D., Hull.

       (A Communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.)

In speaking of the degradation of land on the Holderness coast, it is not

my intention to construct a lengthened history of its former condition,

neither shall I enter into a detail of theoretical plans proposed for prevent-

ing its further waste. There cannot be a doubt that the process of waste

and destruction of this remarkably fertile district had been going on long

Weantecedent to any traditional or written history.  find, however, on

record a lamentable catalogue of losses on this coast ; one field after an-

other has been swept away, and one township after another has disappeared.
The village of Auburn has gone, the towns of Hartburn and Hyde, both at

one period flourishing places, exist no longer. Owthorne has lately yielded

to the same fate ; the ancient church of Withernsea has long since disap-

peared, and its successor, built in 14'34, is dilapidated and deserted. Fur-

ther southward, Kilnsea Church exists no longer ; the last portion of the fabric

(heing part of the tower), according to the parish register, " fell down the
cliff into the sea, Februarj^ 1, 1831," and the village itself is rapidly fol-
lowing. Camden mentions Pennismerk and Upsal, townships or hamlets in
Holderness, neither of which remains at the present day. Nor have the en-
croachments of the deep been confined to the sea coast of Holderness, for
within the Humber we find that considerable tracts of land have been swept
away, as for instance, Redmare, Frismerk, Tharlesthorpe, Potterfleet, Raven-
ser, &c. The ivhole of the Yorkshire coast, south of Flamborongh Head,
is being continually wasted by the encroachments of the sea; and it is a
startling consideration, that in the course of a few years, if the same pro-
cess continue, other towns and villages now flourishing and fertile are doomed
to follow. The rate of loss, however, throughout the line is not uniform

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

the piiysical features, and the geological composition of the cliffs, the set of
the tide, and other minor causes influence the degradation to a greater
or less degree.

    Unfortunately there exist but few scanty records of actual measurement
from certain and existing points to the sea.

   In Tuke's Map of Holderness there are however a few such admeasure-

ments taken in the year 1786, and I have been able to collect from authentic

sources others of later date; namely, some made in the year 1836 by my

late lamented friend George Milner, Esq., F.S.A., on whose accuracy I can
most implicitly rely; and I have also been kindly furnished with others made a

few days ago, by my friend John Malam, Esq. of Holmptou Lodge,

Holderness.

    I have endeavoured to obtain measurements in a due easterly direction
from the different fixed objects to the edge of the cliff; in cases where such
measurement is not specified, the line most direct to the sea has been taken.

   From these records it would appear that the cross at Atwick in 1786, was
distant from the edge of the cliff" 946 yards. In December 1836 it was

S14: yards, thus showing a loss of 132 yards in fifty years, or an annual

TMaverage loss of rather more than 2^ yards. At the present time it is but

770 yards distant from the edge of the cliff" ; so that during the last
seventeen years there has been a waste of 44 yards. The annual average loss
therefore has continued at the same rate. The entire loss during the last
sixty-seven years has been 176 yards, giving an average of rather more than
21 yards annually.

   Tuke says the east end of Hornsea Church in 1786 was distant from the
sea 1133 yards. In 1836 it was only 1000 yards distant from high-water
mark, showing a deficiency in fifty years of 133 yards, and making an

average loss in this immediate neigabourhood of 2f yards, or 8 feet annually.
It is now but 942 yards from high-water mark, so that there has been a loss
of 58 yards in seventeen years, being at the rate of about 3^ yards per
annum; or taking the loss of the last sixty-seven years, there will be found
to have been an annual average waste of nearly 3 yards.

   Aldborough Church in 1786 was 2044 yards from the sea; it is now
1910 yards, so that 134 yards have disappeared in sixty-seven years, giving
a loss of exactly 2 yards annually.

    Tunstall Church in 1786 was 924 j'ards distant from the cliff; it is noM^
758 yards. The loss therefore in sixty seven years has been 166 yards,
giving an annual average M'aste of about 2|^ yards.

    Holmpton Church in the year 1786 was distant from the sea 1200 yards ;
it is now 1120, so that in sixty-seven years 80 yards have gone, averaging
about 1^ yard annually.

   The most rapid waste, however, is that going on at Kilnsea. The greater

part of the church fell in the j'ear 1826, and the last fragment totally disap-
peared in 1831. In April last I visited this place, and found the sea then
making great ravages; several houses had gone, others were partly destroyed,

and quite unfit for habitation.
   The Blue Bell Inn in that village, which was built in the year 184<7, was,

according to a stone which I saw, and which had been fixed in the wall of
that building (during the course of its erection), 534 yards from the sea;
but when I visited Kilnsea on the 1.5th April last, it was only 491 yards
from the edge of the cliff'; thus showing that 4 J yards had been swept
away during the last six years, giving a yearly average loss of land of about

7^ yards.
   The other day I received a letter from Mr. Malam, in which he says,

that since I was there the cliff has been carried away considerably ; that he
has remeasured the distance from the inn to the cliff", and finds it now but

488 yards I It would thus appear that a considerable difference exists in
the amount of waste of land along this coast, it being the greatest at Kilnsea

and the least at Holmpton.

The line of coast to which my remarks apply, extends about forty

miles, and is now losing an amount of rich agricultural soil of 2^ yards

annually. If, however, we take the rapid waste of Kilnsea into account, the

Myyearly loss would average 3 yards.  friend, who resides at Holmpton,

attributes the comparatively small amount of loss at that place to the height

of the cliffs north and south of Holmpton, which project and break the

force of the tide ; the beach is also of a concave form.

He says, " the fall nf the clay or earth at the base of the high cliffs is

to the extent of hundreds of thousands of tons more than where the cliffs are

low." The removal of this fallen cliff" must necessarily take a much longer

period (and so protect the coast for a greater length of time) than

where the land is low, and the sea does not meet with such an opposition.

In fact, the falling of the high cliff's acts in the same manner as the in-

tentional deposit of earth would do in preventing the encroachments of

Athe sea.  farmer named Blushill, who has resided at Holmpton

for the last forty years, told me that more land had been washed away in

that locality during the past year (1852) (especially between the months of

October and December), than had ever been the case in so short a time

during his recollection.

   He is the owner of some fields close to the sea, and calculates that

something like 25 yards have been lost from his fields within tiie last two

years, and he believes that equally large quantities have been lost towards

the south of Holmpton.

Whilst speaking of this immense loss, I would incidentally remark, that

such statements as the foregoing should be received with great caution,

and not without thorough investigation. However honest in themselves

such statements may be, they may nevertheless lead to very erroneous

                                                                       g2

--conclusions. The source of fallacy I conceive to be this : the base of the

cliff first yields to the attrition of the gravel and washing of the ocean ; thus

an undermining or'scooping process necessarily takes place, and for many
months or years a very large portion of what may be called table-land, is
held by an exceedingly precarious tenure ; so that it not unfrequently
happens that one or two severe storms take off several yards of surface
from any particular farm or district, and these losses are then recorded
as having occurred within a very limited time ; whereas, in truth and fairness,
they ought to have been spread over a number of years, commencing with
the washing away of the base.

First Report of the Committee, consisting of the Earl of Rosse, the
    Rev. Dr. Robinson, and Professor Phfllips, appointed by the
    General Committee at Belfast, to draw up a Report on the Physical
    Character of the Moon's Surface, as compared with that of the
    Earth.

I. The Committee, having received their instructions in September 1852, lost

no time in assembling, by invitation of the Earl of Rosse, at Parsonstown,
where with the assistance of Colonel Sabine, at that time President of the
Association, they made preliminary examinations of the moon, by the power-
ful telescopes of the Earl of Rosse, and formed plans of further proceeding in
conformity with the results of these examinations, and the individual expe-
rience of the members of the Committee.

    II. Taking as a general basis for the work to be done, the much-valued
maps and treatise of Madler and Beer, it appeared to the Committee desirable
to procure a new set of drawings or surveys of selected parts of the lunar
disc ; to suggest certain conditions of representation, with reference to the
illumination of these parts, and to propose a uniform scale for the drawings.

   The suggestions offered, as some help to observers on this subject, were

the following :
    " 1. For the acquisition of correct Ideas regarding the form of any part

of the lunar disc, an examination of it under at least three aspects appears
indispensable.

   " By this arrangement each part of the surface may be delineated and de-
scribed under three directions of incident sun-light, two of them (a and c)

suited by long shadows to discover the inequalities of level, and the other
(U) aiding by a vertical incidence to make apparent the unequal reflective
powers and different colours which characterize the different lunar regions,

and the systems of brilliant stripes which are connected with certain lunar

forms.

    " 2. The ' age of the moon,' when a drawing is made, should be stated to
the second decimal of the day, because a knowledge of this epoch is essential
to a right estimation of the angle of incident light under which the observa-

tions are made. Probably the observer will find it convenient to prepare
beforehand a table of the moon's age, corresponding to each hour of mean
solar time. The mean solar time of the place at the beginning and end of

each observation should also be stated.

   "3. Among the chief points to be attended to are

          a. The steepness of slopes, which may perhaps be best determined by

        noting the time at which they began or ceased to be illuminated gene-

           rally.

           h. In ring mountains the difference of level between their exterior

        and interior bases.
          c. The curvature of their interior, whether greater or less than that

       of the general surface. Some of them are much raised in the centre, as

        is evident by the shadows which these parts throw.
          d. Whether the brilliant stripes are elevated above the ground where

        they pass, and the angle of illumination at which they disappear.

           e. Slopes, height, and breadth of the soft ridges in the Maria.
          f. External fragments round ring mountains.
           g. Relation between mass of wall and area of depression {i. e. would
       the wall fill up the hollow).

    " 4. In delineating the appearances on the moon's surface, the Committee
think the observer must be encouraged to employ various methods. For a
general view of the proportional areas, more accurate than any sketch. Pho-
tography may be employed. To steady the work, and reduce it to a uniform
scale, rnicrometrical measures will be required. In some cases, where these
cannot be supplied by the observers separately, they may be obtained at one
of the observatories. In drawing by the eye the Camera lucida is available,

--if the telescope has an equatorial movement by clock a condition not only

desirable, but perhaps indispensable for perfect delineation.

   "5. For convenience of comparison, it appears desirable to recommend
that one uniform scale should be employed in the delineations. Though it
may seldom be practicable to employ on the moon a power of 1000, the
Committee recommend that the drawings should in no case be made on a
smaller scale. If the distance of the paper from the eye be assumed at 10
inches, a circular space on the moon's surface one mile across will be repre-
sented with only a diameter of about one-twentieth of an inch. For objects
which require larger representation, the ordinary scale may be doubled or

tripled.

   " 6. Both in drawing and describing it appears desirable to employ the
method of Beer and Madler, who draw the moon as she appears in the in-
verting telescope, but describe the relative situation of her parts by reference
to her poles as northern and southern, and sides as east and west, in corre-
spondence to the nearest cardinal points of the earth.

    " 7. It is found by trial that Sepia drawings are well-suited for representa-
tions of the peculiarities of the moon's surface."

   It is requested that the drawings and descriptions, which may be prepared
in conformity with these suggestions, may be forwarded by post to Professor

Phillips, Assistant-General Secretary of the British Association, St. Mary's
Lodge, York.

    III. The Committee next endeavoured, by circular, to obtain the coopera-
 tion of a limited number of gentlemen, whether in the British Islands or in
 foreign parts, who by their possession of instruments of adequate optical
 power, habits of astronomical observation, and available leisure, might be able
 and willing to undertake definite parts of the great task which they hoped to

 see accomplished.

    IV. To these letters, the replies which have been received offer in general
 very satisfactory assurances of cooperation ; and in some cases useful addi-

 tional suggestions and notices of interesting facts are added. In particular,
 the author of'Der Mond," besides assuring the Committee of a general de-
 sire to cooperate in their labours, states the degree in which, since his appoint-
 ment to the Observatory at Dorpat, he has been able to extend his former
 observations on the " light streaks" of the moon, an object to which the Com-
 mittee had ventured to specially direct his attention, and instances the di-
stinction which he has already made between the " light spots" which vanish
 in lunar eclipses, and those which remain visible and even grow more distinct
 in the shadow, except where it is deepest.

    The Committee do not, however, feel it to be proper now to report the
 special views and limited progress of their members, beyond placing before

--the Association one drawing of the Mountain Gassendi on the scale proposed
--for the whole survey made from a telescope mounted at York by one of

 their members.

Provisional Report on Earthquake Wave-Transits ; and on Seismome-

   trical Instruments. By R. Mallet, C.E.,M.RJ.A. {In a Letter

     to the Assistant-General Secretary.)

The grant of Б50 made in 1850, for measurement of earthquake wave-
transit, has been wholly expended, in addition to a sum a good deal exceeding
its amount, upon the experiments on transit made at Kiiliney Bay and

Daikey, as reported in the last volume but one of our Transactions. Prior
to the conclusion of the above experiments I had made some progress in the
construction of a self-registering seismometer, upon principles already placed

before the Association.

    Within the last year other unavoidable occupations, and the work of
preparing and discussing the large Earthquake Catalogue, have much
interfered with the progress of the seismometer: I expect to be able at
the meeting succeeding the present to exhibit the instrument, or perhaps to
have had it previously set to work for a time.

    Galvano-telegraphic combinations recently brought into use, and especially
the beautiful arrangements for simultaneous astronomical transit observations
adopted by the Astronomer Royal, leave no room to doubt that any dif-

ficulties in applying such methods to seismometry may be fully overcome.
    The great Earthquake Catalogue, due almost wholly to the devotion and

labour of my eldest son, Dr. John William Mallet, has been entirely completed
and discussed, and the results reduced to curves. The first portion of the

catalogue is already printed in the last volume of our Transactions, and ail
the remainder is ready for press, and with the discussional results can
appear in the volume for 1853.

   At the meeting of the Association, September 1852, a grant of Б50 was
made to me for the purpose of extending experiments upon earthquake

wave-transit, availing myself of the mining operation sin progress at the quar-
ries of Holyhead Harbour. With a view to carrying out this design, I have
ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS.  87

been in communication with James M. Rendell, Esq., V.P. Inst. C.E., the
Engineer-in-Chief of the Works, and have derived from him every aid that
could be desired. I have also been in communication with the Astronomer
Royal, with a view to obtaining the use of some time measuring instruments,
and derived some useful suggestions from his experience in arrangements

analogous to those proposed. I expect therefore early next spring to proceed
with these experiments at Holyhead.

    I cannot close this brief report without congratulating our fellow-workers
in Physical Geology upon the increased attention now given toseismological
observation and reseai'ch, to which the several reports published by the
British Association, and by various authors, have no doubt been instrumental

the arrangements, now understood to be in progress under the Board of Ord-
nance for earthquake observations in the Mediterranean, are a welcome sign

of progress.

On the Mechanical Properties of Metals as derived from repeated
   Meltings, exhibiting the maximum point of strength and the causes
   of deterioration. By William Fairbairn, F.R.S. S^c.

This inquiry was undertaken at the request of the British Association, to
determine certain anomalous conditions which present themselves in castings
when produced from the same iron in successive meltings. It is a generally
acknowledged opinion, that iron is improved up to the second, third, and
probably the fourth meltings ; but that opinion, as far as I know, has not
been founded upon any well-grounded fact, but rather deduced from obser-
vation, or from those appearances which indicate greater purity and increased

strength in the metal.
   Those appearances have, in almost every instance, been satisfactory as

regards the strength ; and the questions we have been called upon to solve in
this investigation, are, to what extent can these improvements be carried
without injury to the material ; and \yhat are the conditions which bear more
directly upon the crystalline structure, and the forces of cohesion by which

they are united.
    In the following research I have endeavoured to supply these desiderata

and having in the course of the inquiry made a careful selection of the
material, the subjoined experiments were instituted, and from which some
curious and interesting results were obtained. In preparing the iron, coke,
and flux requisite for ensuring sound castings, it was found necessary, for
the sake of comparison, to have them cast under circumstances precisely the
same ; and in order to ensure, as nearly as possible, perfect uniformity in the
castings, a furnace was prepared for the express purpose, and from 18cwt.
to a ton of No. 3 Eglinton Hot-blast iron was melted and run into bars and
pigs with 388 lbs. of coke, and 224 lbs. of lime as a flux.

   The proportions of coke and flux were carefully observed in the first and
throughout the whole of the subsequent meltings. They were accurately
weighed every time the furnace was charged, and each charge was made
under the same circumstances, and as nearly as possible with the same quantity
of blast. In the first melting, three or four bars, each 5 feet long and 1 inch
square, were cast, and the remainder of the iron fused was run into pigs, and

preserved for re-melting along with the fiactured bars used in the first ex-
periment. In the succeeding experiments, the bars and pigs were prepared

and re-melted in the same way ; and thus, by a continued succession of re-
--88 REPORT 1853.

meltings, ne constant reproduction of tlie same metal was carefully preserved,
and that under the same circumstances of fusion, as respects coke and flux,
as those previously melted, until the whole of the metal was exhausted.

   In these consecutive meltings, it will be observed that the same quantity
of coke and limestone was used, but at each separate process the quantity of
iron was diminished until the waste and the abstraction of a few specimen

-- --bars reserved each time for the succeeding experiments had exhausted

the quantity with which the furnace was originally charged. These pre-
cautions became the more essential, as any admixture, or any change in the
furnace might alter the conditions under which the castings were produced,
and thus render them to some extent abnormal for those researches and
points of comparison which, under all the circumstances, it was necessary to
observe. To avoid these discrepancies, the furnace was retained of uniform
dimensions, of nearly the same temperature, and having the coke and lime-
stone carefully weighed at every charge; the castings were, by these means,
obtained from a uniform system of treatment maintained from the beginning

to the end of the process.

   The bars derived from each successive melting were placed upon two iron

brackets, a, a, exactly 4 feet 6 inches apart, screwed to the sides of a
wooden frame of the form and dimensions shown in the annexed figure.

  AOn the centre of the cross bar the socket b was fixed, and through this

socket the rod c, screwed on the top end, was passed. This rod had a slit at

Dthe bottom to admit the bar ; and the wheel having a nut in its centre and

fitting the screw, the scale with the weights B could be raised or lowered

upon the middle of the bar according as the weights were successively laid
on to measure the deflection, or taken off to ascertain the defects of elasticity
or permanent set.

   The pig iron used in these experiments, and from which the following
results were obtained, was No. 3 Eglinton Hot-blast. From its blue tinge
and large crystalline structure, it had the characteristics of No. 1 more than
No. 3 ; and judging from its appearance, it indicated a ductile and superior
quality of iron probably of more value for its working properties than its

                                                                   ;

powers of resistance to strain. This .property in the metal was not how-
ever objectionable, as it enabled us to continue the experiments through a

longer series of meltings before it arrived at the point of maximum strength,

and those chemical changes which affected the formation of its crystalline
structure. Under the circumstances, and considering the objects to be at-
tained in the research, it was probably as good a selection as could have been
made for such an inquiry.

    For the purpose of ascertaining progressively the effiect of the load upon
the bars, it was considered expedient to lay on weights not exceeding 56 lbs.
at a time, and by careful attention to the gauge and the scale made in the form
of a wedge, and divided into the tenths and hundredth parts of an inch, the
deflection produced upon the bar was ascertained with the utmost accuracy.
Reading off the deflections was accomplished with great care; and in order
to indicate the amount of permanent set produced by the different weights
as they were laid on, the scale was screwed up at every second or third in-
crease of the load, and applying the scale to the gauge, the defects of elasti-
city were easily determined, and recorded in the Tables in the usual way.
Having thus selected the metal and prepared the apparatus, the experiments

were proceeded with as exhibited in the following Tables.

   The slight deteriorations and loss of strength from the first up to the
eighth melting, and the progressive and striking increase which took place
from the eighth up to the maximum* or the twelfth melting, indicate some
curious and interesting pheenomena in the fusion of cast iron. It will be
observed that after the first melting, there is a steady and progressive de-
crease of strength till the fourth melting, when it again begins to rise and
keeps steadily on the ascent till the thirteenth melting, when it again begins
to decrease, at first progressively up to the fifteenth, when it suddenly falls
from 603 to 371, and from this again downwards to the last or eighteenth
melting, when it falls as low as 312; and at which time the iron becomes
perfectly useless, from its flinty hardness and its obdurate nature in resisting

the attacks of the hardest steel.

   The general summary will, however, exhibit the peculiar properties of the
irons produced from each melting. Some of them, but more particularly

those towards the close of the experiments, presented appearances in their
sectional fractures of an extremely curious character. These I have en-

deavoured to describe at the bottom of each table ; and I now refer to the
following summary, where the results of each experiment will be found ta-
bulated in the order in which they were made.

&c. is only arrived at after the metal has undergone twelve successive melt-

ings. It is probable that other metals and their alloys may follow the same

law, but that is a question that has yet to be solved, and that jirobably by a

series of experiments which would require a considerable amount of time and

labour to accomplish.

Having effected the experiments on the resistance of these metals to a

transverse strain, I next availed myself of a large wrought-iron lever and a

strong cast-iron frame, mounted for other researches, to ascertain their relative

powers of resistance to compression. This powerful apparatus had a lever

17 feet long, 12 inches deep, and 2| to nearly 3 inches thick, and tapered to
about 5 inches deep at the extreme end, where the weights were suspended.

This will, however, be better understood by the foregoing figure, which ex-

hibits the iron frame, lever, scale, weights, &c. by which the experiments

Awere effected, and the results in the following Tables obtained.  is the

lever, B the cast-iron frame, and C the shelf with a solid column below,

over which the specimen to be crushed was placed between two perfectly

Dflat steel discs at a. The column was inserted under the shoulder of the

lever resting upon the specimen and upper disc, and retained in its vertical

Eposition by the guide-plate ; the metal cubes were crushed by adding

weights of 56 and 28 lbs. at a time to the scale F.

In this way the whole of the specimens were crushed ; and in order to pre-

vent the weight falling so as to injure the fractured parts, a stop was placed

Gunder the lever at to receive the fall of the lever and scale when fracture

ensued.

On the Resistance of Cast-iron, derivedfrom repeated Meltings, to the Force

                                                of Compression.

   The extraordinary results obtained from the foregoing experiments on a
transverse strain, induced a further extension of them to that of compression,
or the resisting powers of the metals in their different stages of successive
meltings to a force tending to crush them. This was a work of some diffi-
culty, as we found by repeated trials that our apparatus was not sufficient
to crush 1 inch cubes, and particularly those of the higher meltings, which
required a force of upwards of 90 tons to the square inch to produce frac-
ture. Finding the power of the lever inadequate for this purpose, the cubes
were reduced from 1 inch to a base of three-fourths and five-eighths of an
inch; and having fixed the fulcrum of the lever equivalent to a force of
100 tons, the experiments were proceeded with consecutively in the order of

the meltings, as exhibited in the following Tables.

find this iron of a high order as regards strength ; whether viewed in its
power of resistance to compression or a transverse strain, it is alike conclu-
sive in its measure of strength. In both cases it was approaching its

maximum power of resistance, as may be seen on comparing the three last

experiments with those from which the iron was taken in the other.

On a careful examination of the drawings which exhibit the line of frau-

ture of the cubes derived from the different meltings, it will be observed

that up to the tiiirteenth melting the whole of the specimens appear to yield

at one and the same line of fracture, namely, by wedges which are split, or

which slide off diagonally at an angle varying from 52░ to 58░. This appears

to agree with the experiments of Professor Hodgkinson on the mechanical

properties of iron obtained from the hot and cold blast *. In speaking of

Wethe angle of the wedge he states, that "  have seen that when bodies

are subjected to a crushing force, their fracture, if they do not break

by bending, is caused by the operation of a cone or wedge, which seems,

under various circumstances, to slide off at nearly a constant angle. If a

prismatic body, as for instance a short cylinder, be subjected to a crushiug

force, there seems no reason why fractures should take place one way more

than another ; there is usually, too, in soft irons a bulging out in every di-

rection round the cylinder, which shows that it is equally strained all round ;
a matter which is otherwise exemplified in fig. 8. If, then, the cylinder be

longer than the wedge, or than the two cones, which are always in operation

at the ends during crushing, it is evident that the angle of the wedge and

cones, which is the same, will depend upon the nature of tlie material, and

the cones nmst be isosceles. Cylinders longer than the wedge usually slide

off in one direction without showing the cones."

The resisting powers of iron, stone, and other materials to a crushing

force, have been ascertained by various writers; but the most accurate and

-- --extensive excepting only those of recent date are probably those by Mr.

George Rennie. Rondelet made a considerable number of experiments on

stone and wood of various kinds; but those by Mr. Rennie appear to be

the most conclusive, and give evidence of the great accuracy with which

Mr. Rennie's experiments were conducted. Professor Hodgkinson took up

the subject where Mr. Rennie left off; and the experiments recorded in the

preceding Tables are to a great extent analogous with those by Rennie and

Hodgkinson. It may be interesting, for the sake of illustration, to compare

them. Taking the mean of the different meltings as shown in the follow-

ing Table, we have an approximate ratio of the forces required to crush

cast iron under the separate forms which indicated the experiments made

by Mr. Rennie, Mr. Hodgkinson, and myself.
ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS.                                         115

in those by Mr. Reniiie, which were evidently made on small specimens,
which being cast of such limited dimensions invariably produce a hard
casting exceedingly difficult to crush ; and as those of Mr. Hodgkinson
were made, the first from Devon No. 3, an exceedingly hard and rigid iron,
and the others from the Carron No. 3, a comparatively strong iron, and
the Coed-Talon No. 2, hot blast, a soft, fine working iron, the difierences
under these circumstances may be easily accounted for.

   The Eglinton No. 3 iron, from which the results of the different meltings
were obtained, is very similar in character, but rather stronger than the

Coed- Talon No. 2. Up to the eighth melting it will be observed that the

ordinary power of resistance to a crushing force, namely, about 40 tons to

the square inch, is indicated. Afterwards, as the metal increases in strength,
from the eighth to the thirteenth melting, a very considerable change had

taken place, and we there have 60 instead of 40 tons as the crushing force.
Subsequently, as the hardness increases, but not the strength, double the

power is required to produce fracture.
   From these results we arrive, in round numbers, at the following con-

clusions, viz.

                                                        Crushing force in tons

   These facts are the more interesting as they exhibit some curious pbasno-
mena in connection with, not only the mechanical properties of iron, but

their chemical affinities ; and my friend Professor C. Calvert, of the Royal

Institution of this city, having kindly undertaken to analyse a few of the
most remarkable samples of the experiments, I attach the particulars as

follows.

   In ihe analyses of these irons, Mr. Calvert observes that the gradual in-
crease of silica in the irons as they are progressively reunited are well
deserving of attention ; as also, the increased quantity of sulphur and carbon,
of which it will be observed by the following results that the increase in all
the three substances is progressive from the first to the last meltings, as

under.

indicate up to the tenth and twelfth meltings ; but it is probably not more
than what might naturally be expected from the number of meltings and the
quantity of limestone used each time as a flux. This flux, when in contact
with the iron at a high temperature, would part with a portion of its silica,
or, what is equally probable, the iron would take up its equivalent at each
melting, and thus bear out the fact recorded in the table of the increase and
relative importance of this constituent.

   As respects the sulphur, the surprise is that the increase is not greater,
and that more particularly when the quantity contained in the fuel used is
considered. In this constituent we are led to the conclusion that a gradual
absorption from the coke must have taken place from the commencement to
the end of the process, and in this view of the question the quantity taken
up by the iron at the diflPerent meltings should have been nearly the same.
This is, however, not the case, as we find the tenth melting of a purer quality
by '34! than the eighth, and '^Q less than those of the eighteenth melting.

    In the relative increase of the quantity of carbon * there is not that dis-
crepancy, as in the absorption of this constituent there is not a uniform but
a variable increase; and from the first to the last melting there is an increase
from 2*76 to 3'75, or nearly one per cent.

   The cliemical properties of these difl!'erent meltings are somewhat peculiar
in character, and appear to be entitled to further investigation, and that by

abler and more intelligent heads tlian my own. On some future occasion I
hope to induce some of my chemical friends to take up the subject, and
nothing will give me greater pleasure than to furnish the necessary facilities

for such an inquiry.

   * Mr. Calvert states, in his note attached to the analyses, that the quantity of carbon
contained in the specimens was determined in the usual way ; but the process adopted,
although the best in use, was not calculated, in his opinion, to enable him to state the real
amount of carbon in each specimen.

On the Expressions for the Quotients which appear in the application of
  Sturm's Method to the discovert/ of the Meal Roots of an Equation. Ey

   J. J. Sylvestkr, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.

Many years ago I published expressions for the residues which appear in the

application of the process of common measure to fx and f'x, and which constitute

Sturm's auxiliaiy functions. These expressions are complete functions of the factors

of/x and of differences of the roots of /Ф, and are therefore in effect functions of the
factors exclusively, since the difference between any two roots may be expressed as
the difference between two corresponding factors. Having found that in the prac-

tical applications of Sturm's theorem the quotients may be employed with advan-

tage to replace the use of the residues, I have been led to consider their constitution
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and having succeeded in expressing these quotients (which are of course linear func-

tions of x) under a similar form to that of the residues, i. e. as complete functions of

the factors and differences of the roots of/ar, I have pleasure in submitting the result

to the notice of the Mathematical Section of the British Association.

   The numerators and denominators of these convergents will consequently also be
functions of the factors exclusively. They are the quantities the sum of the pro-
ducts of which multiplied respectively by fx and f'x produce (to constant factors
^res) the residues. The denominators are expressible very simply in terms of the fac-
tors and the differences of the roots ; and their values under such forms were pub-
lished by me about the same time as the values of the residues in the Philoso-
phical Magazine ; the expression for the numerators is much more complicated, but

is given in my paper, " The Syzygetic relations," &c., in the Philosophical Trans-

actions.

   By comparing the expression for any quotient with the expressions for the two
residues from which it may be derived, we obtain the following remarkable identity :

       Z._jXZ,., i.e. ^^(hji,....hi_,)x:zi:(h,L....ki)

                 =iP' + iPl + iPl+           +,P,,-

When the roots are all real, we have thus the product of one sum of squares by the
product of another sum of squares (the number in each sum depending upon the
arbitrary quantity t), brought under the form of a sum of a constant number (n) of

squares, which in itself is an interesting theorem.
   The expression above given for Qj leads to a remarkable relation between the

constant factor will undergo a diminution. The essential part of this theorem

admits of being stated in general terms as follov*rs :
    " If the quotient of an algebraical function of x by its first dilFerential coefficient

be expressed under the form of a continued fraction whose successive partial quo-
tients are linear functions of ar, any one of these quotients may be found (to a con-
stant factor pres) by taking the sum of the products formed' by multiplying each
factor (Ф h) of the given function by the square of what the denominator of the
immediately antecedent convergent fraction becomes after substituting in it for x the

root corresponding to such factor."
    P.S. Since the above was read before the British Association, the theory has been

extended by the author to comprise the general case of the expansion of any two
algebraical functions under the form of a continued fraction, and has been incor-

porated into the paper in the Philosophical Transactions above referred to.

On the Production of Crystalline Structure in Crystallized Powders by

   Compression and Traction. By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L.,

   F.R.S., Sf V.P.R.S. Edinb.

   The author had found that by pressing certain crystalline powders against slips of
glass, sometimes smooth, sometimes roughened by grinding, with the clean broad
blade of a knife or spatula, and drawing it along, he could give to the mass of
powder thus treated the same polarizing action on light possessed by large crystals
of the same kind ; and which could be given to annealed glass and other non-
crystalline substances by mechanical compression, but which they lost when
relievid from the compressing force. The author then gave an enumeration of the

--crystalline powders in which he had succeeded by this compression and traction in

producing this polarizing structure, distinguishing those in which the glass over
which they were so distributed required to be rough, from those in which it might

be used smooth. He also enumerated the powders which he had tried, but in which,

he had not succeeded in producing the same effect.

On the Optical Phcenomena and Crystallization of Tourmaline, Titanium,
  and Quartz within Mica, Amethyst, and Topaz. By Sir D. Brewster,
   K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., ^ V.P.R.S. Edinb.

   The author, after stating that crystals of titanium within quartz had been long
known and attended to, drew attention to the fact that regular crystals of tourmaline,
titanium and quartz had been discovered by him within mica, amethyst and topaz
that in some instances these crystals had been found grouped in very regular
figures, and that the groups of crystals were sometimes distributed over what were

                                                                                                        I*

obviously surfaces of inner crystalline forms of exactly the same shape as the entire

crystal, from which the author drew inferences as to the original growing of the

crystal. He also entered into an examination of some of the optical peculiarities of

 these crystals.

 On the Angle to be gwen to Binocular Photographic Pictures for the Stereo-
                        scope. By A. Claudet, F.R.S.

    Mr. Claudet's paper, which was illustrated by several stereoscopic Daguerreotype
pictures, went to establish some rules for the angle at which the photographic pic-
tures must be taken in order to produce, without exaggeration, the best effect of
relief and distance. The angle depended on the size we wished to give to the model
and the distance at which we were looking at it, so that pictures taken at the
same angle might produce different effects of relief and distance if they were exa-
mined more or less amplified, and the converse might produce a contrary effect. To
exemplify the relation between the stereoscopic effect and the dimensions of the
image, Mr. Claudet observed, that when we look at objects with a double opera-glass,
which magnifies say four times, we have four times less relief and less distance than
when we look at them with the naked eye ; and that when we turn the opera-glass,
looking through the larger end, we diminish considerably the dimensions of objects
and increase considerably the relief and distances. Mr. Claudet entered into some
considerations of the principles of binocular vision, in order to explain the causes of
perfect vision, with relief and solidity, which we obtain with two eyes. The photo-
graphic image being the representation of two different perspectives, we must, when
we look at them in the stereoscope as we do in looking at the natural objects them-
selves, converge more or less the axis of the eye according to the plane on which
the objects are represented or really situated. Therefore we make the same effort,
and we have the same sensation, when we look at photographic pictures, as when

we look at the objects represented. When we look at a single picture with two
eyes, we have less relief and less distance than when we look at the same picture
with one eye, because with one eye we have the natural effect we are accustomed to
feel when we look at the natural objects with one eye, while, if we look at the single
picture with two eyes, we have on the two retinae the same image with the same

perspective, which is not natural, and the eyes have not to make the usual
effort for altering their convergence according to the plane on which the object
observed is situated. This inaction in the convergence of the eyes destroys in some
measure the illusion of the picture, because the same convergence for all the objects
represented gives an idea that they are placed on the same plane. The angle of the
two binocular photographic pictures may be larger than the natural angle of vision, if
we suppose that the reduced model is examined at a small distance. If we have
before us, at 2 or 3 feet, a model of our friends of the size they appear to be at 20
or 30 feet, we have a greater effect of relief than if we were looking at them at 20
or 30 feet, and this effect, instead of being a defect, is more artistic and satisfactory.

We may reduce the model as much as we like, and look at it at the smallest distance

possible ; but in order to preserve the proper proportion between the stereouropic
effect of the nearest and furthest planes, we must take the photographic pictures

with object-glasses having the longest focus possible. It is only when we employ,

too, lenses of short focus that the stereoscopic effect is unnatural, being exaggerated
for the more distant planes and reduced for the nearest.

On the Practice of the Daguerreotype. By A. Claudet, F.R.S.

This morning was devoted to Photography ; the Section having requested Prof.

R. Hunt and Mr. Claudet to arrange the means of exemplifying all the processes at

present employed. By the aid of the local photographic artists, this was accomplished

in as satisfactory a manner as the suddenness of the occasion would admit of. Mr. Hunt

explained all the processes on paper and on glass, while Mr. Claudet exhibited the

Amanipulatory details of the Daguerreotype.  great number of very beautiful speci-

mens of the art were exhibited. Two views in particular, executed by Messrs. Ross

and Thomson of Edinburgh, of an unusually large size, were most remarkable for

the perfection of every part. There was not anything new given in the discoveries
or ehcited in the discussion which ensued, but from the crowded state of the Section,
it appeared to excite much interest to the end.

                      On the 3/ixture of Homogetieous Colours.
                    By Professor Helmholtz, Konigsberg.

   The author pubUshed a year ago experiments on the mixture of homogeneous
coloured light, which seemed to prove that there are only two colours in the solar
spectrum capableof being combined into white, namely, yellow and indigo. He has
repeated these experiments, following another method, similar to that lately described
by M. Foucault, for obtaining larger fields equally dyed with the mixture of two
homogeneous colours, and has found that there are more pairs of complementary
colours in the spectrum. These colours are situated at both ends of the spectrum,

~on --one side from red up to a yellow shade, a little greenish, on the other side

from violet up to a blue shade, also a little greenish. The shades, however, in the
middle of the spectrum, in which the green preponderates, cannot give white with
any other homogeneous colour. Their complement is purple, and must be com-

--pounded by violet and red. The complementary colour of red is greenish-blue, of
-- --orange, sky-blue, of yellow, indigo, of greenish-yellow, violet.

   The author found, moreover, that the complementary colours are arranged in the
spectrum in a most irregular manner. As the breadth of the differently-coloured
bands in prismatic spectra depends not only on the wave-length, but on the sub-
stance of the prism, he refers the following results to interferential spectra, where
the distance of two colours is proportional to the difference of their respective
wave-lengths. If you pass with an equal velocity through the different colours of
such a spectrum, the shade is altered very slowly at both its extremities on the red
and violet ; but in those parts where the complements of red and violet are placed
in the greenish -yellow and greenish-blue, the shade alters very rapidly, so that the
distance of extreme red and golden-yellow is about ten times greater than the
distance of their complementary colours, greenish-blue and sky-blue.

   The author observed two circumstances in these experiments which had prevented
him in his former experiments from finding other complementary colours than yellow
and indigo. At first, according to the pecuhar distribution of complementary shades
in the spectrum, the said colours were able to give a larger white spot than the
others. Secondly, it appeared to be very diflicult to the human eye, which is not
quite achromatical, to find and to keep the right focal length for objects illuminated
by two kinds of homogeneous rays of very different refrangibiUty . Indigo and yellow
are of less different refrangibility than any other pair of homogeneous complementary
colours, and are therefore easily combined. Others, as red and greenish-blue, on
the contrary, are united in the same field of the retina with great difficulty.

   Finally, the author gave some remarks on the best method for bringing the whole
variety of colours into a system. He stated that Newton's coloured disc appeared
to be the most simple and complete manner. Some points, however, are to be
changed. First, not only the seven principal colours of Newton must be arranged
on the margin of the disc, but the whole infinite number of them existing in the
spectrum, so that complementary colours are placed on the opposite ends of the same
diameter. Secondly, the two ends of the spectrum cannot meet together, but must
be separated by an interval, where the complementary colour of the green shades,
namely purple, is to be intercalated. The commonly received theory of three prin-
cipal colours includes a restriction of Newton's method, contradictory to the author's
former experiments.

On the Distribution of Electrical Currents in the Rotating Disc ofM. Arago.

                              St/ Professor Matteucci, Pisa.

   After the discovery of the induction between the electro-magnet and the closed
conducting circuit, Faraday conceived the idea of applying the extremities of a
galvanometer upon a disc of copper revolving in the neighbourhood of a magnet. la
this way he found the electric currents, which were developed by the induction
of the magnet, upon the disc, of which the points change successively according to
--6 REPORT 1853.

the distance from the magnet ; and, by having recourse to the law of electro-mag-
netism, he arrived at an explanation of the magnetism of rotation of M. Arago. The
author, after giving some further historical details, proceeded to point out how per-
plexing were the phsenomena arising from the abrupt and numerous changes of

direction. He then proceeds to state his own conception of the subject, and to

detail the experimental researches which he had founded upon them ; draws general
conclusions from the experiments ; and has drawn up a simple and perspicuous
diagram, indicating the poles of the magnet, the revolving disc, and the curves
which show the neutral points upon the disc, and those indicating the directions of
the tangential forces, or those giving to the disc the tendency to revolve, and all of
which he finds to have a fixed relation to the position of the poles of the magnet and
the velocity of the rotation. The memoir is to be published entire.

      On the Magnetism of Rotation in Masses of Crystallized Bismuth.
                         By Professor Matteucci, Pisa.

   The apparatus used by the author consisted of an electro-magnet caused to
revolve by clockwork ; and the body to be submitted to the action of the electro-
magnet was suspended between its poles. Sometimes he suspended it by a fine
silver wire, and determined the force of torsion, when equilibrium took place, the
body being usually suspended in water to check its tendency to vibrate. Sometimes
he used a single thread of cocoon silk, and the forces developed were measured by
counting the number of uniform rotations which took place in a given time. The
author first describes certain preliminary experiments which he made with this
apparatus. He suspended solid spheres of copper, and hollow spheric shells, of
exactly the same diameter, formed by the electro-plate process, between the revolving
poles, and measured the force by torsion. With a full sphere weighing 59'80gr.,
and a hollow one weighing 10'85 gr., he found the torsions in the proportion of
1 :0*71. With spheres of a less size the differences were less than these. The
author concludes from this that the internal shells of metal, on which the induced
forces are less, serve to discharge the currents developed in the exterior shell ; and
that an analogous effect shows itself in many other cases of magnetism of rotation.
The author also submitted to the same apparatus a cube, formed of very thin square
laminae of copper, insulated from each other by layers of varnish ; when this cube
was suspended a few centimetres above the electro-magnet, so as to have its con-
stituent laminae horizontal, it experienced no action from the magnet; but when its
laminae were vertical it received a very rapid motion of rotation ; in this latter case
the currents induced having the power to develope themselves freely, and circulate
on each lamina, which cannot take ))]ace in the former case. In his experiments

--with crystallized bismuth compared with amorphous masses of the same substance,

he found, 1. That the forces developed by the revolving electro-magnet are greater
for the amorphous masses of bismuth than for the crystallized metal ; 2. that the
forces developed in the masses of crystallized bismuth are greater when the cleavages
are disposed vertically and perpendicularly to the planes of the currents of the
electro-magnet, than when these cleavages are placed horizontally.

                       On Magnetic Phcenomena in Yorkshire.
                 By John Phillips, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.

    The author proposed, in this communication, to place on record some measures of
the direction of magnetism in Yorkshire, and some inferences touching the relation
of magnetism to the physical geography of the district. The magnetic declination

from the true meridian is at this time about 24░ to the W. of North at York, and is

slowly diminishing. The magnetic inclination from the vertical, measured in the
plane of the magnetic meridian, is now at York 70░ 10', and is diminishing about
2'*54 in a year. This result is obtained by comparing many careful observations
between 1837 and 1853.
. In tracing the lines of equal dip over the large area of Yorkshire, the author ems

                                         i

ployed the results obtained at forty stations distributed over the whole, and he
arranged these for a final conclusion in groups and lines related to the great natural

features of the county. By the method of least squares it was found that the Isoclinal
lines made with the meridian, on the average of the whole county, angles of 70░ 31'
to the east of north ; that the rate of maximum augmentation of dip was, on a line
at right angles to this, 'SSS parts of a minute of dip for one geographical mile. But
on examining by the same method, or by a simple graphical process, the direction of
these lines in diflferent parts of the county, it was found that they were bent into

large curves, so as to^retire southward across the great vale of York-, and to advance
northward on the hilly regions to the west and east of this vale, but especially turn-
ing up northward in the country between Flamborough Head and the mouth of the

Tees.

   Besides other ways of viewing these phsenomena, the author called attention to
the probable effect of the inclination of the strata, which by varying the direction of
maximum pressure, as in the case of anticlinals and synclinals, would necessarily
affect by a similar variation the direction of the suspended needle ; and he proposed
as a new and curious question, the possibility of seeing, by help of the magnetic

needle, through the parts of the crust of the earth near the surface, so as to trace the

deep-seated axes and centres of movement, which by no other way could be made

sensible to the geologist*.

                On Magnetism. By Professor PliJcker, Bonn.

   By repeating Dr. Faraday's experiments on diamagnetism six years ago, I first
observed that a piece of charcoal suspended between the two poles of a magnet was
either repelled or attracted, according to the distance from the poles. The same day
I observed the same phsenomenon, when I substituted a prism of tourmaline for the
piece of charcoal ; but these phsenomena, similar as they are in appearance, were
produced by quite a different kind of magnetic action. I made a communication to
the British Association, when I attended the Swansea meeting, on the particular
action of a magnet on crystals, but I did not speak then on the other class of

phsenomena, the transition from magnetic attraction into diamagnetic repulsion,
which takes place on mixed bodies when the power of the magnet increases. I had
deduced from a long series of facts, that by increasing this power the action on dia-
magnetic bodies augments more rapidly than the action on magnetic ones. I believe

it is a mathematical law, and being such a one, whatever may be its physical
interpretation, is out of the reach of attack ; but I had not the satisfaction to see it
generally adopted, therefore I undertook last summer a new series of experiments,
which will give, I think, to that law a more universal character and a more distinct

description.

   The experimental results I immediately obtained may be represented best by curves,

giving for the different bodies I examined the law according to which the attraction
produced by the electro-magnet varies with the intensity of the current made use of.
If the induced magnetism were always in the same ratio as the inducing power, if
there were no resistance against further magnetization either in the electro-magnet
or in the body examined, that curve must be a parabola ; on the contrary, if the

body were saturated with magnetism, it would be a straight line. Now by examining

different substances, I got curves passing through all intermediate steps from one
limit to the other one. Nickel is nearly saturated when I make use of one single
element of Grove ; the hydrate of oxide of cobalt presents, under the same condi-
tions, scarcely any resistance against magnetization. The resistance is also very
 small in oxygen ; it is very small too in bismuth and phosphorus, the two diamag-
 netic bodies I examined, wherein the repulsion by the magnet is to be substituted
 for the attraction exerted' on magnetic substances. Then comes oxide of nickel,
 oxide of iron, iron, cobalt, and at last nickel.

    From the curves I have spoken of, we may deduce others giving the intensity

    * In the discussion which followed, Prof. Pliicker confirmed .the truth of the supposition
 of Prof. Philhps, that such magnetic effects would follow from the varying direction of maxi-
 miun pressure, but whether the effects would be sensible must be settled by experiment.

of the induced magnetism in the different substances for any inducing power of the
electro-magnet. All these curves will be very nearly represented by the equation

                                M ^I
                                -- --=: tan

                                 ck

M being the power of the magnet, I the intensity of the induced magnetism, and

Ic and c two constants varying from one substance to another. The curve will be

transformed into a straight line parallel to the axis when t)ie substance is saturated

иwith magnetism ; it will be an inclined straight line when there is no resistance

against magnetization. Between these two straight lines are placed all our new

curves.

The Professor deduced the following conclusions :

1. For every substance, either magnetic or diamagnetic, there is a particular law,

according to which the intensity of induced magnetism is determined by the inducing

power.

   2. There is for every substance a limit of magnetization, to which it approaches
more or less rapidly by increasing the power of the electro-magnet.

3. The curves for diamagnetic bodies ascend very rapidly, much more rapidly

than the curve for iron does. By means of these curves we may find in what pro-

portion bismuth, for instance, is to be mixed with iron, so that the mixture may,

by a given power of the magnet, be neither attracted nor repelled.

   4. An eminent German philosopher explained all diamagnetic phsenomena by ad-

mitting that there is in diamagnetic substances no resistance to magnetization

but his theory cannot hold, the curves for bismuth and phosphorus ascending more

rapidly than the curves for most of the magnetic substances, but not so rapidly as

the curves for oxygen and hydrate of oxide of cobalt. The Professor was much

inclined to believe that all bodies retaining magnetism, as steel does, and, accord-

ing to his experiments, also oxygen, oppose a very small resistance against magnetiza-

tion. So may be explained in a more satisfactory way what has been improperly

called " coercive force."

5. There is, generally speaking, no specific magnetism, as there is a specific

weight, a specific heat. The specific magnetism varies with the power inducing

it. Cobalt is more magnetic than iron when we make use of one of Grove's elements ;
but by giving to the current an intensity four times greater, the magnetism

of cobalt becomes only i^ths of that of iron. Let the magnetism of iron be one

million ; then by employing the stronger current and also the weaker one, the diamag-

netism of the bismuth will be in  the first case 39, in the second  23"6                     while
                                                                                          ;

Professor Weber, making use of a much smaller inducing power, found only 10. So

we may also, partly at least, explain why Edm. Becquerel gives for the magnetism

of oxygen a number ten times less than Prof. Piiicker found, while his number agrees

pretty well with the approximate estimation of Dr. Faraday, who employed nearly the

same inducing power as he did.

6. The Professor does not know what magnetism and diamagnetism are ; but the

curves for diamagnetic bodies being included on both sides by curves for magnetic

substances, he thinks there is no difference at all between the magnetic and diamag-

netic states of bodies, except that the conditions inducing these two states are oppo-

site ones.

7. After having obtained his results, he was highly surprised by learning that a

French philosopher, Lallemand, had deduced from experiment the law according to

which the intensity of an induced current is dependent on the intensity of the in-

ducing one. He found for this case exactly the same law that Prof. Piiicker got for
magnetic induction. Though we do not know what an electric current really is,

by supposing that I.allemand's law and Pliicker's are true laws of nature, not merely

laws of approximation, we may conclude that magnetism and galvanism are one and

the same agency of nature.

   On a New Photometer. By Astley Paston Price, Ph.D., F.C.S.

   The object sought in this modification of the Photometer is the combination of
the two images usually obtained when estimating the difference of intensity' between
two sources of illumination, and by so doing facilitating the valuation of the difference
betweeen the light to be determined and a recognized standard.

   The Photometer is so constructed that the rays of light, after passing through
orifices at either side of the instrument, impinge on two mirrors placed at an angle
of 45░ ; by such an arrangement, when an observation is made the two images are
united, which facilitates the comparison and permits the more easy approximation

to neutrality.

   The orifices may be of any desired form ; those which have been adopted are either

oblong apertures covered with tissue paper, placed, on the one side horizontally, and

on the other perpendicularly, or two semicircular discs may be substituted ; in the

former case the two are united and crossed at right angles, and in the latter a circu-
lar disc is obtained. It is obvious that any design may be adopted, the object being
that the resulting combination shall afford facility of comparison.

                    General View of an Oscillatory Theory of Light.

     By W. J. Macquorn Rankine, C.E., F.R-S.S. Loud, and Edin.

   The author endeavours, while retaining the whole of the mathematical forms of
the undulatory theory of light, to render the physical hypothesis which serves as its
basis more consistent with itself and with the known properties of matter. Light,
according to the undulatory theory in its most general sense, consists in the propa-
gation of some species of motion amongst the particles of the luminiferous medium,
the nature and magnitude of which motion are functions of the direction and length
of certain lines transverse to the direction of propagation. According to the existing
hypothesis of vibrations, this motion is a vibration of the atoms of the luminiferous
medium in a plane transverse to the direction of propagation. In order to transmit
motions of this kind, the parts of the luminiferous medium must resist compression
and distortion, like those of an elastic solid body ; its transverse elasticity being
great enough to transmit one of the most powerful kinds of physical energy with a
speed in comparison with which that of the swiftest planets of our system is appre-
ciable, but no more, and its longitudinal elasticity immensely greater ; both these
elasticities being at the same time so weak as to offer no perceptible resistance to the
motion of the planets and other visible bodies. The author considers that it is
impossible to admit this hypothesis as a physical reality. He also points out the

difficulties arising from certain inconsistencies in the present theory as to the rela-

tion of the direction of vibration in polarized light to the plane of polarization.

   The author then proposes what he calls the hypothesis of oscillations, which con-
sists mainly in conceiving that the luminiferous medium is composed of detached atoms
or nuclei, distributed throughout all space, more or less loaded with atmopheres of
ordinary matter, and endowed with a species of polarity, in virtue of which three
orthogonal axes in each atom tend to place themselves parallel respectively to the
three corresponding axes in every other atom ; and that plane-polarized light con-
sists in a small oscillatory movement of each atom round an axis transverse to the
direction of propagation, and perpendicular to the plane of polarization. The square
--IP REPORT 1853.

of the velocity of propagation of such a movement would be proportional directly to
a coefficient depending on the rotative force, or polarity of the particles in a given
space, and inversely to a coefficient denoting the sum of the moments of inertia of
the luminiferous atoms in a given space, together with their loads of atmosphere,
round the axes of oscillation. The author shows that it is necessary to suppose that
the coefficient of polarity, for transverse axes of oscillation, is the same in all sub-
stances and for all directions ; and that the variations in the velocity of light depend
wholly on the variations of the moments of inertia of the luminiferous atoms, with
their loads, in different substances and round different axes. The coefficient of
polarity for longitudinal axes of oscillation must be supposed to be very great com-

pared with that for transverse axes. How powerful soever the polarity may be which

is here ascribed to the luminiferous atoms, it is a species of force which must neces-
sarily be wholly destitute of effect in producing resistance to compression or distor-
tion ; so that it is no longer necessary to suppose the luminiferous medium to have

the properties of an elastic solid.
   The author deduces from this hypothesis the known mathematical laws of the

wave-surface, of the intensity and phase of reflected and refracted light, and its
plane, circular, and elliptic polarization, and of all other phaenomena to which the

existing theory has been applied, the equations being identical in form.

0?i the Composition and Figuring of the Specula of Reflecting Telescopes.

                           By J. D. SoLLiTT, Hull.

The author of this paper was of opinion that all makers of reflecting telescopes

cast their metals too low in tin. He thinks they ought to be made in proportion to

the true atomic weights of the two metals, which would give 32 parts of copper to

17*4 of tin; and if this composition be found too difficult to work, it is easily

reduced without injuring the colour of the metal by the addition of one or two parts

of nickel. Such a composition he uses, and finds that the light reflected from it is

perfectly white; and when the telescope is made, b. front view one, very nearly equal
in quantity to an achromatic of the same aperture. He further observed that the

pores may be taken out of a composition containing them by the addition of.

metallic arsenic, he also repudiated the practice of fluxing the metal vath the salts of

potash or soda as being highly injurious. In polishing he uses extremely hard

pitch, so hard that no impression can be made upon it with the edge of a knife

and the polishing powder (either putty or colcothar) he grinds very fine on a slab,

and uses only a very small quantity, but works it down on the pitch for a very long

time, and in order to obtain a very fine polish only puts the powder on the tool once.

He prefers dividing the surface of the pitch by ten concentric circles, with six, eight,

or ten radii, the radii being made gradually wider towards the edges of the tool

and for the size of the tool, to produce a true parabolic figure, adopts the fol-
D =lowing formulae : Let
                          the diameter of the metal, d =: the diameter of the tool,
=and F the focal length of the metal ; then, if worked with the metal below,

d=:D--         , or if the metal be above, d=T>-\- r^; in either case the metal will
                          F
        F-l-D

come oflF a true parabola, provided the pitch be of sufficient hardness and the powder
worked down a sufficiently long time to produce a high polish.

       Description of a Graphic Telescope. By Cornelius Varley.

   The author drew attention to the imperfections and difficulties experienced in
using the Camera Lucida, and then exhibited and described his instrument. The
stand of it united great portability with complete steadiness j and the instrument
itself, which had something of the appearance of a telescope, could be adjusted so
as to focus the image exactly at the spot where the pencil was to delineate it, and
the direct view of the point of the pencil easily caused to trace the picture to be
drawn. The object-end also of the instrument could be turned round so as to place
on the paper any portion of the landscape before the artist which he wished to deli-
neate ; or, if his object were to take the inside of a building, he could take the ceiling,
or roof, floor, or any portion of the sides, at pleasure. The Graphic telescope can

give images of every size useful to an artist, up to the largest panoroma ; by this Mr.
Horner traced the great panorama of London from the top of St. Paul's. The exist-
ence of this instrument caused the Colosseum to be built. Through this instrument
original sketches may be printed from. By taking the flat speculum from the ob-
ject-end the images will be given the reverse way, and thus suited to trace direct on

stone.

Observations on the Deiisity of Saturated Vapours and their Liquids at the

                 Point of Transition. By J. J. Waterston.

The chief object of the author in these experimental researches was, to ascertain if

the low density in saturated vapours holds good up to that point when, according to

M. Cagniard de la Tour's interesting researches, the liquid condition seems to

terminate suddenly. The observations were made on the same principle as those

which were the means of detecting the general law of density, the details of

which have been communicated to the Royal Society. The tubes used by the

author were from 2 to 3 inches in length, filled with the same liquid in different pro-

portions and sealed at the blowpipe. The author then described the method used

in graduating them, and the simple graphic principle employed in calculating the

density of the vapour and of the liquid; the same strictness not being required in

these researches as in those detailed in the paper above referred to in which the

strict method of computation is given. The author then described his mode of

heating the tubes, which is by suspending them by a brass wire frame in a glass

funnel about 3 feet long, 1 inch diameter, and y\th of an inch thick, fixed vertically

over anArgand cocoa-nut oil lamp. The brass wire frame being slipped with the

tube into the top of the funnel, kept it in the middle of the current of heated air

about 4 or 5 inches below the top of the funnel. The liquid volume in No. 1 tube

being noted, the tube was taken out and the thermometer put exactly into its place.

The mercury quickly rising, the temperature is noted after it had become steady.

The thermometer being then removed, a second tube. No. 2, was slipped into the

same place and its transition volume noted ; then removed, and the thermometer

substituted and noted as before. This was the general course of observations

when the temperature had to be carried above 600░, a funnel only 18 inches long was

used. The state of the liquid in the tube was closely examined by means of a

watchmaker's lens, and could at all times be seen distinctly by transmitted light.

One set of tubes were of hard Bohemian glass, one-eighth of an inch bore and one-

fiftieth of an inch thick. These sometimes burst when the pressure was calculated

to be about 400 atmospheres, if the laws of density and pressure hold good at these

extreme points. The force of the explosion was quite what might be anticipated : it

was as if the liquid, which never exceeded three grains in weight, had been ful-

minating powder. The thick glass funnel was shattered into small fragments

immediately opposite the tube. Other sets of tubes were of soft glass, one-twentieth

of an inch thick and one-fifth or one-sixth of an inch bore. None of these burst ; at

a very high pressure one merely gave way, breaking across into three pieces as if cut

by a file. The author then gave the details of his experiments in a tabulated form,

each noting the low temperature and volume, the maximum volume and temperature,

and the transition volume and temperature, with notes of the successive appearances

noted in the liquid at its surface and in the vapour. The surface of the liquid at one

stage always assumed a flat form, showing cessation of capillarity ; often assumed

a conoidal  form,  wasting at the  apex ;  sometimes  two  surfaces  showed themselves
                                                                                                                                                  ;

the conversion currents seen clearly in the early stages often changing into zigzag

motions of spherules of vapour at the transition point. In this way the author ex-

amined sulphuric sether, alcohol, sulphuret of carbon, distilled water, chloroform,

dichloride of sulphur, anhydrous oil of turpentine, acetic acid, and sulphuric acid.

On a Laio of Mutual Dependence between Temperature and Mechanical
                       Force. By J. J. Waterston.

The author began by stating that the experiments performed by MM. Gay-Lussac

--12 REPORT 1853.

temperature evolved by a small compression of a volume of air to the diminution of

temperature required to produce the same condensation under a constant pressure,

although originally intended to supply the data required by La Place in his peculiar

views on the transmission of sound, have also been employed with good effect in ad-

vancing the physics of gases with relation to temperature and mechanical force.

The ratio is in fact approximately an initial or differential ratio, which affords the

means of obtaining integrals that express simple laws of great importance. The ex-

MM.periments of  Clement and Desormes have shown that the value of the ratio is

constant throughout a considerable range of temperature and density ; and Mr. Ivory

proved that it is constant under every change of density anq,temperature as long as

the laws of Marriotte and of Dalton and Gay-Lussac are maintained, or the air-

thermometer is an exact measure of heat (Phil. Mag., 1827). The mathematical

reasoning is much simplified by reckoning all temperatures from the zero of gaseous

tension. This zero by M. Rudberg's experiments, confirmed by Magnus and

Regnault, is situated at minus 461░ upon Fahrenheit's scale, or minus 273░"89 Cent.

To save circumlocution, the author calls this the g temperature. This g temperature

of a gas is a definite and essential quality belonging to it, to be classed with its

density, volume and pressure. The author then proceeds to lay down the dif-

ferential equations, simplify their expressions by the results of experiments, and

--state the final equations deduced by integration, from which he draws the following

conclusions: 1. When air is compressed or dilated, the g temperature varies as

the cube root of the density, and the tension as the fourth power of the g tempera-

ture or cube root of the fourth power of the density. 2. The mechanical force

exerted by a given quantity of air while freely expanding from one density to

another is proportional to the difference of the cube roots of these densities, or to

the difference of their g temperatures, and the fall of temperature is proportional to

the force expended. 3. The mechanical force exerted upon a given quantity of air

while compressing it from one density to another is proportional to the difference of

the cube roots of these densities, or to the diffei-ence of their g temperatures, and the

rise of temperature is proportional to the force exerted. 4. The total force exerted

by a volume of air while expanding to infinity is equal to its tension acting through

three times its volume and the limit of its g temperature while thus expanding

in zero, and the same reasoning applies to compression. 5. The total mechanical

force exerted by a volume of air while expanding to infinity is proportional to its

AG temperature. 6. given quantity of air while expanding under a constant

pressure from one temperature to another exerts a mechanical force equivalent to

one-third the difference of temperature, and the quantity of heat required to change

the temperature of air under a constant pressure is four-thirds that required to effect

the same change of temperature with a constemt volume. Hence the author shows

that 1 lb. raised through 600 feet is the mechanical equivalent of 1░ of heat applied

to 1 lb. of water; but if 0-267 be the specific heat of air under a constant pressure,

800 feet will be the number equivalent to 1░ of heat, which is the number ex-

perimentally deduced by Mr. Joule. The author notes this as perhaps the simplest

example of that correlation of natural forces brought to light by the elegant researches

of Mr. Grove.

the tepid waters of the tropical seas. With the first of these, which has been so
fully treated of in the Geological Section, we at present have no concern ; and it is
to the second that attention is proposed to be directed. One cubic inch of water,

--when invested with a sufficiency of heat, will form one cubic foot of steam the

water before its evaporation, and the vapour which it forms, being exactly of the
same temperature, though in reality, in the process of conversion, 1700 degrees of
heat have been absorbed or carried away from the vicinage, and rendered latent or
imperceptible ; this heat is returned in a sensible and perceptible form the moment
the vapour is converted once more into water. The general fact is the same in the

case of vapour carried off by dry air at any temperature that may be imagined, for
down far below the freezing-point evaporation proceeds uninterruptedly, or is raised
into steam by artificial means. The air, heated and dried as it sweeps over the
arid surface of the soil, drinks up by day myriads of tons of moisture from the sea,
as much indeed as would, were no moisture restored to it, depress its whole surface
at the rate of 4 feet annually over the surface of the globe. The quantity of heat

thus converted from a sensible or perceptible to an insensible or latent state is
almost incredible. The action equally goes on, and with the like results, over the
surface of the earth as over that of the sea, where there is moisture to be withdrawn.
But night and the seasons of the year come round and the surplus temperature thus
withdrawn and stored away at the time it might have proved superfluous or in-
convenient, is reserved, and rendered back as soon as it is required ; and the cold of
night and rigour of winter are modified by the heat given out at the point of con-
densation, by dew, rain, hail, and snow. There are, however, cases in which, were
the process of evaporation to go on without interruption and without limit, that
order and regularity might be disturbed, which it is the intention of the Creator,
apparently for an indefinite time, to maintain, and in the arrangements for equalizing

temperature the equilibrium of saltness be disturbed in certain portions of the sea,
and that of moisture underground in the warmer regions of the earth.

   Thirty-six years ago Sir John Leslie pointed out that the waters discharged by
the rivers of southern Europe were not sufficient to supply the Mediterranean with
store enough for vapour for the countries on its shores, and that the immense
amount drawn off by the arid borders of Northern Africa, which from Alexandria
westward suppHed nota single rivulet, required to be provided forby an inward current
from the outer ocean through the Straits of Gibraltar. Founding apparently on
this. Sir Charles Lyell, in his geological work published in 1832, assumed the filling
up of the Mediterranean with salt ; and a doctrine about to be shown in conflict
with a first law of hydrostatics which nothing can upset, is still retained amongst
the dogmata of orthodox geology without anything whatever to support it. The
error seems to have been fallen into from the assumption that the water at the
surface of the sea would remain in its place exposed to the action of the sun until
evaporated up to the point of saturation, and only begin to descend on being
transformed into solid salt, in which condition it would remain of course accu-

mulating in the recesses of the sea. In point of fact, however, the instant the upper
stratum of a fluid becomes one atom lighter than that beneath, it inevitably begins

to descend, all other portions following it according as additional gravity is acquired
by them. So soon as this mass of brine grows high enough to run over the barrier

of the inland sea, it must, as a matter of necessitj% flow outwards to the external
ocean, where no such brine existed, and mingled with the average of the sea. It is
matter of easy demonstration, that without some such arrangement as this, the Red

Sea must long ere now have been converted into one mass of salt ; and its upper waters
at all events, being, on the other hand, known in realitj' to differ at present but little
in saltness from those of the southern ocean. Here we have salt water flowing
in perpetually through the Straits of Babelmandeb to furnish supplies for a mass of

vapour calculated, were the strait shut up, to lower the whole surface of the sea
8 feet annually, and even with the open strait, to add to its contents a propor-
tionate quantity of salt. But an under-current of brine, which, from its gravity,
seeks the bottom, flows out again to mingle with the waters of the great Arabian Sea,
where, swept along by currents, and raised to the surface by tides and shoals, it
is mingled by the waves through the other waters which yearly receive the enormous

strength of sea water, and rendered uniform in constitution, by the agitation of the
8torms which then prevail. Flowing back again from the coasts of India, where
they are now in excess, to those of Africa, where they suffer from perpetual drainage,
the same round of operations goes on continually ; and the sea, with all its estuaries
and its inlets, retains the same limit, and nearly the same constitution, for un-
numbered ages. Capt. Haines, in his survey of the Arabian seas, describes the
perplexing currents betwixt the Straits of Babelmandeb and Cape Aden ; strong
bands of inshore currents sixty miles in breadth or so running in one direction,
while similar bands of an outward current run in the opposite direction ; and
currents similarly turbulent and irregular are found at the mouth of the Persian

Gulf. Dr. Buist has no doubt that both may be explained on the principle so
well laid down by Dr. Scoresby in reference to the Gulf-stream, where the tropical

current running northvvard meets and intermingles with the polar one running
southward. Speculating on these matters some j'ears since, Mr. Maury, of the United
States Observatory, had, from a totally different series of considerations, come
to exactly the same conclusions as these Dr. Buist had arrived at. So eager was
this distinguished observer to follow up the subject, that he afterwards oflFered

a sum equivalent to 300/. annually for the collection of information at Bombay
to enable him to construct for the Indian seas wind and current charts, similar
to those he had constructed for the Northern Atlantic, and these, it is under-
stood, are now in a state of great advancement. The money was respectfully
declined; some Bombay merchants having undertaken to provide for his use, at
their own charge, the information desired, conceiving that it was enough that

British traders should receive from America a survey of the currents of the English
seas in the East without at the same time accepting funds from a foreign state which
the British Government had failed to provide. Such were looked on as the advantages
likel)"- to accrue from the labours of Mr. Maury, that an estimate was published,
showing that, assuming the statement of the Royal Society to be correct, maps and
sailing directions for the Eastern seas, such as had been provided for the Northern

Atlantic, would save to the ports of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay from a quarter

to half a million annually in freights.

        On Drawings of the Moon, By James Nasmyth, F.R.A.S.

   These magnificent drawings of the moon, three in number, were exhibited and de-
scribed, in the absence of the author, by Prof. Phillips. The first was a drawing of the
moon's visible surface 6 feet in diameter. The two others were drawings, on a larger
scale, of two particular portions of the lunar mountains. They were executed in a
very peculiar style, white on grey ground, with shadows, wiuch conveyed a very clear
conception of the relief and depressions of the several parts of the surface. Mr.
Phillips described several of the ring mountains, mountain ranges, and other pecu-
liarities of the surface as depicted upon them. In particular he drew attention to
long narrow bright lines, like the meridional lines on a globe, which in some places

were seen to stretch across a large portion of the disc. He stated the ingenious expla-
nations of these features given at a former meeting by Mr. Nasmyth, and the experi-
ment which he had devised to illustrate the cause and nature of them. Mr. Nasmyth
held them to be fissures filled up by some very dense or highly reflective mineral sub-
stance which had been forced up from underneath the solid crust of the moon by the
same agency which had produced the cracks or fissures as they were seen to traverse

hill and valley, mountain and crater, in nearly unbroken lines, regardless of surface
inequalities, which facts appeared to Mr. Nasmyth to justify and confirm his conclu-
sions as to the nature and cause of these bright radiating lines. Professor Phillips
stated that these lines were only seen when the light of the sun fell in particular angles
upon them. If he were to offer a conjecture as to their origin, he would say that they
originated in some peculiarity of the reflecting surface of the moon, by which the
peculiarities of what lay below the surface were manifested.

Oil Photographs of the Moon. By John Phillips, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.

   The fascinating processes of Photography can perhaps be hardly ever more use-
fully applied than in fixing on metal, paper, or glass pictures of objects which are
                   TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                   15

--known or supposed to be variable, the law or rate of such variation being put as a

problem to be determined. The moon, our friendly satellite, is exactly in the condi-

tion to require this kind of investigation ; and if photography can ever succeed

in portraying as much of the moon as the eye can see and discriminate, we
shall be able to leave to future times monuments by which the secular changes
of the moon's physical aspect may be determined. And if this be impracticable, if

the utmost success of the photographer should only produce a picture of the larger

features of the moon, this will be a gift of the highest value, since it will be a basis,

an accurate and practical foundation for the minuter details, which, with such aid,

the artist may confidently sketch.
   When, therefore, at the Ipswich Meeting of the Association, the 2-3-inch Daguer-

reotype of the full moon, which had been taken by Professor Bond from the great
Achromatic of Cambridge, U.S., was shown to astronomers, their gratification was

extreme. Humboldt possesses one of these curious light-pictures of the moon, of

2 inches diameter, prepared by Mr. Whipple, of Boston, U.S., in which the so-called

seas and annular mountains are clearly distinguished*.

  The Committee, to whom the Association, at its Belfast Meeting, committed a

Survey of the Physical Aspect of the Moon, were not negligent of this powerful aid

to an accurate drawing. The great telescopes of Birr, which in regard to light, defi-

nition, and steadiness, offered the greatest temptations to this trial, were at the

disposal of the Committee ; and to them, and the genius of their noble owner, we
must probably look for photographs of the moon on the largest scale, and with the

deepest contrast of light and shade. But they are not yet mounted equatorially, and

in the mean time I thought it useful to try the power of my own 6^-inch achromatic,

the work of our excellent artist Cooke, which is driven equatorially by very equable

clock movement in the open air.

   Before my attempt was made, some trials were made by Mr. De la Rue and others,
but I am not able to say what is the value of their results.

   Though prepared in some degree for this experiment in the commencement of this

year (1853), it was not-^ill the middle of July that I was able to submit an excited

collodion surface to the concentrated rays of the moon. On the 15th and 18th of
July, with my friend Mr. Bates, 1 obtained the pictures now presented for considera-

tion. They prove beyond a doubt that the research is of a useful and practicable

kind, and, if I mistake not, will be followed by far better things.
   In the expectation that this will become a favourite object of inquiry among phO'

tographers, I solicit a few minutes' attention to some of the conditions of the problem,
for, without a right notion of the thing to be done, much disappointment will attend

the trials.

First, it must be remembered that, as moon-light is fully 100,000 times weaker

than sun-light, and only appears to us bright in consequence of the general dark-

ness around, photographs can only be taken quickly by very sensitive surfaces. The

moon's image in the telescope has not, indeed, really more actinic effect on the silver

surface than some of the duller terrestrial objects which are slowly depicted in the
camera. On a highly sensitive collodion, the feeblest radiants operating for the
shortest time produce some effect ; but firm impressions can only be had by the
integration of these differential quantities. In the telescope which I employ, with a

sidereal focus of 1 1 feet, the moon's diameter, as traced on the collodion, is about

li incht ; and the aperture being 6^ inches, the light of the moon's image is aug-
mented about 26 times as compared with the brightness of the object seen directly

by the eye. The time required for this image to be firmly impressed doei not

exceed 5 minutes, when the moon has a maximum south declination, and an

elevation of only 12░. 1 think it probable that when her declination is at a maxi-

mum to the north, and I employ the most sensitive collodion, she will draw her

myown likeness in  camera in 1 minute, with sufficient firmness for printing. |

* Kosmos, iii. part 2. 362.

   t The moon's mean diameter being -j-j-pth of her mean distance from the earth, the
mean diameter of her image on my collodion plate would be r2 inch, but the actinic focus is

on the outside of the focus for white light 075 inch.

Д Since this was written many trials have been made ; the result being that a picture, 2

inches in diameter, may be taken by using the Huyghenian eye-piece in 30 seconds.

                                                                                   ]
--16 REPORT 1853.

   In the great mirror of Lord Rosse (6 feet in diameter), having a sidereal focus

of 52 feet, I saw a moon-image, of extraordinary beauty, or rather magnificence,
nearly 6 inches across. The light received on this image (supposing the loss by

reflexionequalto that by refraction)* was -^ of that on mine, so that the picture

might probably be impressed on a collodion surface in one-fourth or even one-sixth
of the time required on mine ; or in the same time as on mine, it would give a twice
magnified image (-v/'i), viz. a moon 12 inches across. I confidently believe that

the master of this mighty engine will make it do its work.
   I now turn to a different view of the subject, which is, however, of fully equal

importance ; viz. the nature of the movement by which the telescope must be
made to follow the moon. The clock now usually employed, with centrifugal
balls, I find quite equal to follow star, sun, or moon, by an easy variation of its
rate. The moon's motion in her orbit is variable, but not so much variable as to
require in a few minutes any differential rating of the clock set by trial to her

mean rate for the hour. It must, however, be accurately set to this rate, for,

otherwise, in direct proportion to the magnifying power, will be the brush or

indistinctness of every meridional outline, and the equatorial extension of ever)' part

of the picture by an angular quantity (in) expressing the clock error. The moon
has never, at two succeeding moments of time, the same declination ; and except

about the epochs of greatest north and greatest south declination, her change of de-
clination is sensible in a few minutes. Except at these times the change of her

declination is sensible in the picture obtained by an exposura of even 5 minutes ;

as may be seen by the photograph of 15th July, where the north and south edges

are brushed, and the craters appear elongated in a meridional direction, the western
edge remaining quite sharp. This difficulty might be practically overcome by a
piece of mechanism connected with the clock, giving to the telescope a slow motion

--in declination (-h or ) proportioned, in a given short time, nearly to the number of

hours from the nearest epoch of greatest north or greatest south declination.
   The image obtained by the photographer should not only be perfect, but must be

taken on a surface quite fine and true, so as to bear magnifying by eye-glasses. In
this particular, at present, only the silver-plate and the collodion film on glass have

claims to approbation. 1 am not able to report at present the possession of such

perfect images, as to bear any but very low magnifiers ; but this imperfection of the
images will probably diminish or vanish by further trials, or by the aid of more

fortunate experimentalists.

   Supposing our photographic power to be raised so much as to copy on silver,
glass, or paper, all that the lens can show, what will be the picture presented under
a magnifying eye-glass ? Let us assume in the case of Lord Rosse's telescope,
a first image of 12 inches in diameter, and that it will bear magnifying eight times.

This will be equivalent to 96 inches diameter for the moon, and about -- of an

inch for a mile. The physical maps of Yorkshire which I now exhibit in comparison

are on nearly the same scale (-- th of an inch to a mile), and if inspected at a

distance of 10 inches will give a fair notion of the apparent magnitudes of objects on

the moon on this condition, which nearly expresses a magnifying power of 1000.

It is obvious therefore that by such means we may have a record of the moon's

physical aspect under every phase of illumination, under every condition of libration,

nearly as we should see her at a distance of 240 miles, undimmed by more than a
Wefew miles of the strata of the earth's atmosphere.
                                                      should see and measure on

the glass or the metal, her mountains and valleys; her coasts and cliffs; her glens

of upheaval, or explosion ; her lava streams, and the scattered heaps projected from

Wethe interior.  should spy out the various actinic powers of the difl'erent parts

riments known to me from which it can be determined what is the proportionate loss oi pho-

efficacious than achromatics, which are suited, as mine is, to astronomical observation.

some reasonable conjectures on the mysterious light streaks which radiate from

some of her mountains.
   To what degree of minuteness shall we see the objects ? This question has not been

much considered with reference to photography, or the kind of objects which the
moon exhibits. If we assume that one minute of angle :s a good general rneasure

for the visibility of areas presented to the eye, and therefore that areas are visible at
a distance about 3000 or 4000 times as great as their diameters, an area on the

moon, 70 miles across, can beseeФby the naked eye; magnifying this 1000 times, we
may see an area on the' moon t^Su of a mile across, or 370 feet. But though a
spot of such dimensions can be seeii, it cannot be defined under such a power as

square, circular, elliptical, or triangular.

   To be thus clearly defined, so as to be positively drawn or described, its diameter
must be such as to subtend nearly 3' of angle ; so that to be clearly defined to the

naked eye, black spots on a white ground must have a diameter of about j^ of

=radius=200 miles,  and under the   magnifying power        of  1000, 4rT=-r          of a Di'le

1056 feet.

   But this calculation applies to black spots not greatly varying in their diameters.

We have on the moon many cases of entirely different figures, arched, or

triangular shadows, long streams of light, and long stripes of darkness. I was

much impressed while at Parsonstown with the minuteness of some of the ' rillen,'

as the Germans call the narrow deep often winding clefts, such as those about

Aristarchus, and the much finer ones on the north-east of the Mare Humorum, of which

I have made drawings. On returning home, I made some trials of the visibility of

narrow spaces, as compared with square areas of the same breadth. The results, which

are of a kind to encourage greatly our surveys of the moon, appear in the sub-

joined table, and indicate that black narrow spaces not exceeding 12 feet in width,

are within the magnifying power of the great Rossian reflector. To what extent

the photographic power of the instrument is competent to define such shadows,

or the mechanism which must be employed to follow them exactly, are points for

experiment to settle. As far as the eye is concerned. Lord Rosse's mirror has light

enough for such a power, but the eye is more sensitive than collodion.

Howbands might be visible.  much of this the really/ unclear' condition of our

atmosphere will allow to be realized, remains to be determined by experiment.

On the Surface Tempei'cdure and Great Currents of the North Atlantic and
  Northern Oceans. By the Rev. William Scoresby, D.D,,F.R.S, L.l^E.,

   Cor. Mem. of Institute of France, &jc.

The currents of the ocean, exerting as they do so great an influence on the condi-

tion of the air, the earth, and of the sea itself, constitute a subject of very important

consideration in [ihysical geography, and, indeed, in general science ; and they are

specially interesting as a compensating instrumentality against the extremes of con-

dition to which the fervid action of the sun in the tropics, and its oblique and inferior

--action in the polar regions, tend, an instrumentality serving not only to moderate

the extremes of temperature, but to render the general surface of the earth more

favourable for the comfort and benefit of its inhabitants.
   Our knowledge of the great currents of the ocean has hitherto been mainly derived

from the observations of navigators on the differences found betwixt the ship's

actual position during the voyage, as determined by celestial observations, and that

of the daily reckoning from the course steered and distance run. The results of

observations of this nature, extensively collected and collated, are found in the labours

of Major Rennell, Lieutenant Maury of the United States Navy, Mr. Findlay, &c.

   Dr. Scorest)y then noticed the errors to which this mode of investigation is ordi-

--narily subject from defects in the log, compass action, and steerage of the ship all

of which are liable to render the determinations uncertain unless where numerous

observations are found accordant, or those in diflFerent voyages made mutually cor-

rective.

The process he had used, affording data for the present paper, consisted mainly in

the observing, during the progress of the ship, of the differences occurring in the

surface temperature of the ocean, which in many cases were such as to give unques-

tionable indications of currents coming from different regions, though not generally

serving to determine the exact direction or velocity.

His observations would refer, in the first instance, to the currents nf the North

Atlantic, as indicated by thermometric changes and peculiarities within a belt of

ocean about 220 miles in average width, extending in a VV. by S. direction from the

eptrance of the English Channel to Long Island, proximate to New York.

   Four transatlantic passages made by himself, with numerous voyages by Captain
Jos. Delano, a scientific American and excellent observer, who had furnished him

with the results of many of his researches, had supplied the materials for the present

determinations. These materials, extending to about 1400 observations (usually

taken six times a day) on the temperature of the sea, being placed on a chart along

with the projection of the ship's track on each voyage, were then tabulated, and the

leading indications finally represented in a diagram (Plate I.) before the Section.

Of thirteen passages tabulated, seven were made in the spring of the year, two in

summer, one in autumn, and three in winter. Taking the middle day of each pas-

sage, the mean day at sea was found to be May 18-19, a day fortunately coincident,

with singular nearness, with the probable time of the mean oceanic temperature.

The results indeed thus derived could not be considered as complete, nor the

normals of surface temperature in the different sections of the route conclusive yet
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

they exhibited, in certain particulars, facts of considerable interest and importance.

The mean surface temperature of the whole range of observations was 56░, the

mean temperature nf the air in the same passages (the result of 1000 to 1500 obser-

vations) being 54''"2, indicating the prevalently received fact of the general superiority

of the temperature of the sea over that of the atmosphere.

Though the observations were not sufficient for conclusive determinations of the

effects of latitude and season on the surface temperature, yet they obviously yielded

something sufficiently proximate to be not unworthy of notice, especially for the early

part of the passage westward, from longitude 12░ to 36░ W., and latitude 50░ to 46░.

And within this limited range, the observations under discussion seemed, in respect

W.of latitude, to indicate an increase of the surface temperature, steering  by S. from

the English Channel, of about three-quarters of a degree for each degree of latitude

southward in winter, and a change of about a degree of surface temperature for each

degree of latitude in summer.

In regard to the effects of season (taking the average) within the same portion of

the  transatlantic passage,  there appears to  be  a range  of 9░  or                    10░                the highest being
                                                                                                         ;

about 61░ in July and August, and the lowest 51░ to 52░ in January and February.

The analyses of the observations on the various passages yielded, as to changes in the

--surface temperature, betwixt 12░ and 30░ W., something like the following series :

In specifying the general results of all the observations on the oceanic temperature,

we find the first and leading fact to be, a division of the transatlantic belt into two

characteristic portions of nearly equal extent, differing, in a striking and singular

manner, both in their ordinary temperatures, their extremes, and their changes. ^

   Thus for nearly half the passage across from England, that is, as far as longitude

38░ W., in a W. by S. direction, the surface temperature was not found to descend

below 50░ even in the winter passages, nor to rise in any part of the year (as far as

the observations go) higher than 66░. But on reaching 42░ W. a temperature of 44░
was met with, and at 48░ to 50░ W. longitude a minimum of 32░ was not uncom-
mon, with a maximum sometimes reaching to 69░. Further west, in 58░ to 60░
longitude (the mean latitude being about 42░ N.), along with a minimum tempera-
ture ranging from 32░ to 42░, a maximum was found as high as 74░. From this
meridian to 72░ W. similar differences of temperature, except near the American

coast, were found to be prevalent.

In regard to mean differences of the extremes of temperature, taking the averages

of all the observations within meridians of 2^ in width, the results are still more

striking ; for in the first half of the passage, going westward, we find a meanrange of

surface temperature,  for    each  2░ of longitude, of only  11░*3                       whilst             in the western
                                                                                      ;

half the mean range extends to 29░'7. Within the first half, too, where the extremes

of temperature of the whole section were found to differ only 19░, the difference

betwixt the highest and lowest temperature observed in the second or westerly half,

reached to 42░.

   This diversity of temperature clearly pointed out the two great and well-known

--oceanic currents-- one from the tropics, the other from the Polar regions meeting,

coalescing, and interlacing within the range of the belt of waters referred to ; the
former current yielding an occasional warmth of 20░ to 22░ above the mean atmo-

spheric temperature, and the latter a frequent cold as much below it.
   But the phaenomena may be rendered more intelligible and instructive if we note

the appearance and trace the progress of the more marked alternations in sailing
from the English Channel westward ; say from longitude 12░ W., in the mean latitude
of 50░ N., to that of 72░ W., in the 4 1st parallel. This belt, extending to 60░ of
longitude, may be conveniently taken in six decimate sections, as represented in

Plate I., several of which, it will be seen, afford peculiar and characteristic differ-

ences.

The first three of these decimate sections exhibit, for the most part, a striking

W.uniformity of character ; for as far, at least, as longitude 38░                                          no particular in

the differences of surface temperature strikes us, except a gradual rising of the means,

within two degrees' space, from 52░-9 to 58░'7, during a descent in the mean lati-

tude from 50░ to 46░ N. But in longitude 38░ to 42░ W. the range of oceanic tem-

                                                                                                            2*
--20 REPORT 1853.

perature obtains the first marked increase, indicative of a slight action of a current

from the southward.

In the fourth decimate section, 42" to 52░ W., however, the indications respect-

ively of the two great currents of the North Atlantic become striking and charac-

teristic. Beyond the meridian of 42░, where the cold current from the north becomes

first decided, an increase of its ptevalenc)', gradually becoming more and more con-

spicuous, is observed. Thus in the two degrees' space, from 42░ to 44░ W., the

somewhat low temperature of 44░ was only observed in one out of //nV/een passages ;
but in the next two degrees a like moderate fall of temperature (about 7^ below the

mean) occurred in three or four of the passages ; in the next meridional stripe, cold
water was met with in eight of the passages (four or five falling from 10░ to 16░

below the mean) ; in the next, the cold water occurred in nine or ten passages (six
falling 10░ to 24░ below the mean) ; in the next stripe, longitude 50░ to 52░ W., the
cold water was met with in eight passages (five falling 12░ to 22░ below the mean).

Within the same section, 42░ to 52░ W., very perceptible marks of an ascending

tropical current occurred, yielding, in alternations with the cold water from the north,

an occasional warmth of 66░ to 68░. The prevalency, however, of the occurrence

of warm water in this position of the Atlantic appears from the observations tabu-

lated to be in reverse order (when sailing westward from longitude 42░) to that of

the cold current ; the first two-degree stripe presenting a rise of from 63░ to 68░ in

six passages ; the next, a rise of similar extent in five ; the next, a smaller rise in four

the next, less marked in three ; and the last, 50░ to 52░ W., in four, but still less
marked. Hence from these observations it appeared, that the greatest prevalence of

the polar currents (betwixt 42░ and 52░ W.) is within the meridians of 46░ and 52░,

and of the warmer current in 42░ to 46░ W.

It is within this meridional section mainly, corresponding in its central part with

the eastern edge of the great bank of Newfoundland, in which the icebergs and drift

ice from the north are usually met with ; so that the prevalence of a descending

polar current obtains actual demonstration.

   The fifth decimate secfion, reaching from 52░ to 62░ W., is found to be equally
characterized by peculiar phaenomena as the one preceding it. The general preva-

lence of the descending polar current is shown by the minimum temperature of each

meridional space of 2░, ranging betwixt 32░ and 42░, with a mean of the five minima

of 37░'2. The prevalence of an ascending current from south-westward is, in like

manner, shown by the occurrence of a maximum surface temperature ranging betwixt

63░ and 74░, with a mean of the five maxima of 68░"9.

But the characteristic features of this fifth decimate section were found to consist

in the sudden7iess of the changes of the surface temperature and the various alternations,

indicative of singular interlacirtgs of warm and cold water.
   In a passage in the " Patrick Henry" in May 1844, made by Dr. Scoresby, these

sudden and alternating changes were remarkably prevalent. Thus when in longi-

tude 57░ 0' W. (lat. 41░ 31' N.) the surface temperature, at 8 a.m. of May l7tb,

was found to be  60░-5                        but after sailing W.N.W. (true)  10 miles, it was found to
                                           ;

be 50░, and at noon 16 miles further on the same course 46░. At 2 p.m. of the

same day, longitude 57░ 55' W., the sea was still at 46░; but at 4 p.m., after 15
miles' sailing W.N.W., it had risen to 57░, and in 15 miles further in the same

direction it was found to have fallen to 42░! The next day. May 18th, presented

further remarkable changes. At 8 a.m., longitude 59░ 52' (latitude 42░ 8' N.), the

surface temperature was 46░; but at 10 a.m.,  15  W.miles                      ^ S., it had risen to

61░, a change of 15░ in two hours ! At midnight, again, of the 19th-20th the sea
was at 50░ ; four hours afterwards, 26 miles to the S.W. by W., it was 63░.

   Within this decimate section the cold or polar current was found to be chiefly pre-

valent in the first and last of the two-degree spaces, but the most so in the last, that

is, in longitude 60░ to 62░ W. ; and the most prevalent examples of the Gulf-stream
appeared within the meridians of 58░ and 62░ W.

The sixth and last section of the belt of waters traversed in the transatlantic pas-

sages under discussion, is found to be chaiacterized, especially within the three

westernmost spaces, 66░ to 72░ W., by a singular depression of the surface tempera-
ture generally, the mean temperature of all the observations registered on the chart

being 49░'4, and of the last three stripes 46░'7. As some of the voyages, however.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  21

here failed, the mean of the registered observations may be a little too low ; but the

obvious deduction nevertheless remains untouched, of the descent of a polar curient

within the tract of the Gulf-stream by the coasts of New England.

   The relations of the Polar current aiid Gulf- stream, as thus indicated by the analyses
of thirteen transatlantic passages generally, change, it should be observed, materially
иwith the seasons of the year. Thus the descending Polar current, which appears so
prevalent within the western half of the belt of waters referred to in the discussion
of the whole of the voyages, is found to be of comparative small importance in the
summer and autumn passages, whilst the Gulf- stream is then the most predominant.
Hence the shifting of the upper margin of the Gulf-stream northward at these sea-

sons, as popularly understood, obtains very decided confirmation.
    In the results thus derived from the discussion of original observations on surface

temperature of the North Atlantic, there will be found a general agreement with the
conclusions of many other observers ; but these now communicated, it is presumed,
will be found of some importance as to the specific information yielded in respect of
the belt of waters referred to. The indications, too, of a variety of effects from the
meeting of contrary currents, are perhaps as conclusive as they are in some respects
remarkable ; for from the results now obtained, taken in connexion with a few
auxiliary facts, we may safely infer the following varieties of operation derived from

the meeting of the polar and tropical currents within the track discussed :

    1. Strata Currents, consisting of a continuance of the respective currents after
meeting in or near their original direction, by the overlaying of the denser waters

from the North by the warm water of the Florida stream. Of this characteristic
we have the most striking evidence in the observations of the Coast Survey of the
United States, by intersections of the Gulf-stream. Thus in tracks across the stream
having a general surface temperature of 80░ to 82░, a depression of 10░ to 15░ was

usually found at depths not exceeding 120 fathoms ; of 20░ to 25░ at depths short of
500 fathoms ; and in cases of 700 fathoms and upwards, a reduction sometimes of
about 40░ below the surface temperature ! So that the existence of strata currents

--in this region of research the Gulf-stream flowing above and the polar current
--below seems to be unquestionable.

  --2. Interlacing Cm-rents where the polar and tropical currents on meeting seem to

run past each other in repeated alternations of comparatively small breadth, in the

--manner of the fingers with the clasped hands were strikingly shown in the rapid

and great changes of the surface temperature within the fifth decimate section ; and

there is reason to believe that in these interlacings the edges of the respective waters

flowed past each other with little intermingling, as if guided by walls in separate

channels.

    3. Deflected Currents-- where currents on meeting from different but not exactly

--opposite quarters, as, for instance, from the S.W. andN. are partially or mutually

deflected into an easterly direction, so as to give rise to certain branches falling, as

to one, on the southern coasts of Europe, and, as to the other, on the Noiway and
Spitzbergen shores. This species of mutual action in dense streams of water may

find familiar illustration in places where the ebb-stream from a river falls into the

--tide-stream of the coast the former pushing away the other, and each for a time

pursuing a separate deflected course, with but little apparent intermingling.

  --4. Passing Currents where they run in parallel but opposite courses, and over
--separate ground as in the distinctive Gulf-stream, in its general body, and the inshore

polar current running within it over the St. George's and other American banks. Of

the distinctiveness of the inshore polar current. Dr. Scoresby adduced this very

--striking evidence, 1st, that in observations on the temperature at the surface and

bottom on the St. George's Bank made on one of his voyages, the surface tempera-
ture was, with trifling difference, maintained below : thus in latitude 40░ 43', longi-
tude 68░ 35', the surface and the bottom, in 35 fathoms water, were both (May 22) at
the temperature of 46░ ; and nearer the shore, in 69░ 39' W., when the surface was

at 47░, the bottom in 39 fathoms was at 45░ ; and 2ndly, that the New England and
New York pilots remark, in regard to an inshore current guided by the direction of
the wind, that the current running south-westerly under a north-easterly gale is much

stronger than the contrary current urged by a south-westerly gale.

    In regard to the surface temperature and great currents of the Northern Ocean,
--22 REPORT 1853.

Dr. Scoresby could on this occasion only briefly touch. The discovery, in personal
researches near the western coast of Spitzbergen, of comparatively warm water,
increasing in warmth with the depth, he had long ago set foith, in the ' Account of
the Arctic Regions,' as an indication of the extension of a branch of the Gulf-stream
into the Icy Seas of Greenland ; whilst the descent of apolar current, as indicated by
the general set to the south-westward of the Greenland ices, had in the same work
been amply proved and illustrated. This south-westerly drift from the east side of
Greenland, associated with the southerly set out of Baffin's Bay, sufficiently explained
both the cold surface temperature met with in the researches of the present paper,
and the occurrence so prevalently of icebergs and drift ice in and near the meridians
embraced by the banks of Newfoundland. And it might be reasonably inferred,
perhaps, that both the position of these banks and the characteristic differences of the
currents within the fifth and sixth decimate sections, so fully discussed, would have
their true explanation in the consideration of the polar currents descending in two

--branches the main one by the east coast of Newfoundland, the westerly and smaller

one by the Strait of Belleisle.
    Connected with this subject, it is very interesting to trace the ceconomy and beneficial

effects, as in many respects most obviously elicited, of the currents of tte ocean.
For here we find, as in all the Creator's works, the striking marks of benevolent
design in the ordering and Controling of the most subtle, or apparently vaguely
acting agencies, to the benefit of the earth and its inhabitants. Of such indications

nsay be noticed :

    1. The grand ceconomy of oceanic currents in their equalizing tendency on the
extreme temperatures of the difl^erent regions of the globe, from which the climate
of the British Islands, for example, notwithstanding some minor disadvantages,
derives such marked benefit in the diminishing of the range of temperature.

    2. The maintaining, by the reciprocating currents, of the equable saltness of the
ocean, and so preventing the dift'erences in evaporation from the surface in the
tropical and polar regions from destroying the characteristic quality of the salt sea.

   3. The production by current eddies of sand-banks, favourable for the habitation of
fishes, of which the banks of Newfoundland may be pointed to as characteristic

examples.

   4. The mingling of the waters of all regions of the globe, and the manuring, as it
were, with fresh soil, of the great pastures of the creatures inhabiting the ocean.

   5. The carrying away of large portions of the ice-formations of the higher lati-
tudes for dissolution in a warmer climate, thus preventing the entire polar regions
being filled with ice, and that ice being gradually pushed forward and maintained by
its direct action on climate, which so might have rendered large portions of the now
temperate zones uninhabitable or unsuitable for man.

   6. And, in order to the due operation of counter and reciprocating currents betwixt
the equatorial and polar regions, we must not overlook the a-conomic design obvious
in the distribution and configuration of the continents of the eastern and western
hemispheres, betwixt which we find two great meridional channels permitting a free
circulation of waters betwixt the two continents on opposite sides of the globe, and
running, not improbably, from pole to pole

On Deep- Sea Soundings and Errors therein from Strata- Currents, with

BySuggestions for their investigation.      the Rev. W. Scoresby, D.D.,

F.R.S., Corresp. Institute of France, t}c.

   No long time has elapsed since the notion was very prevalent among seamen, that

it was impossible to sound the ocean beyond the depth of a very few hundreds of
fathoms. It was imagined that in water exerting a superincumbent pressure on the
plummet greater than the weight of metal, no sounding-lead would sink ; a curious
notion, which could not have been otherwise than a delusion, unless the water of the
sea had been indefinitely compressible, so as to have become of equal density, at
least, with that of the metal of the plummet.

   There is a difficulty, however, though of a very different nature from that just
noticed, in respect to' the obtaining of correct information in very deep soundings,
which seems, from the confidence given to recent experiments, to have been
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                           2$

altogether overlooked. To this difficulty, and the errors likely to be produced

thereby on the determination of depths, it was one of the objects of the author

of this communication to elucidate and establish.

He did not refer, however, to cases where the depths were not very profound, or

where the time occupied by the descent of the plummet was inconsiderable ; for he.

Dr. Scoresby, had frequently reached depths of near a mile, or even more than a

--mile, in the Greenland Seas at a period when such soundings were novel or
--unprecedented with results, owing to peculiar and favouring circumstances, he

believed, perfectly satisfactory. But far otherwise than satisfactory, as he expected

to be able to show, must be some of those extraordinary soundings of recent years, in

which depths of five, six, or nearly eight miles were supposed to be established.

If the sea were a stationary body, or if its currents were uniform movements

of the entire mass of waters from the surface to the bottom, then the plummet

mi^ht be fairly expected to take a direct and perjiendicular course downward, so

that the length of line run out would be the accurate measure of the depth sounded.

But if in the place or region of sounding, strata-currents, so prevalent in the Main

Ocean,  should  be  running  in  different  directions                                               or, what  would  have  the same
                                                                                                  ;

effect, if one stratum of water, say a superficial stratum, should be at motion and the

main body below at rest, no correct results could be derived from the experiments

referred to, where the time occupied in the running out of the line extended, in some

of the more interesting cases, to many hours.

Under such circumstances, during the passage of the plummet through strata-

currents, the line, it must be obvious, would be carried away in its different portions

by the movements of the water, for which the tendency to assume a perpendicular

position below the point of surface-suspension could afford no adequate corrective.

Thus suppose the surface-stratum, W, to be running westerly, and the lower

stratum, E, easterly (or at rest) with a difference of velocity of two miles an hour.

The descent through the first portion, where the vessel would participate in the

action of the current, might be quite perpendicular ; but on the entering of the

plummet into the lower stratum, the lead and line would be carried, or, in relation

to the surface position, appear to be carried eastward, at the rate of two miles in the

hour. Hence in the case of the experiments of Captain Denham, whore the descent

in the last four miles required above an hour and a half of time per mile, the

plummet might be carried some miles away from the perpendicular, so as to

occasion a very large error in the depth apparently determined. In respect to

Captain Denham's deep-sea soundings, indeed, the error assumed is but conjectural,

depending on the circumstance of the actual existence in the place of experiment
--W.latitude 36░ 49' S., longitude 37░ 6'
                                            of strata-currents. But in some of the

deep soundings attempted in the Gulf-stream, where, in the difference of the

temperature above and below (some 46░), we have conclusive evidence of strata-

currents, the determinations must, it is to be believed, have been more or less

--inaccurate, probably greatly erroneous.
    In regard to the proportion of error being without data both as to the flow

of the different currents, and the measure of resistance, under the circumstances,

afforded by the water to the attainment of a perpendicular position by the plummet

no satisfactory estimate can be offered ; but that a considerable resistance would be

presented against the corrective tendency of the plummet, so that the line, however
24 REPORT--1853.

thin, would be greatly carried away, evidence from analogous facts may be satis-

factorily adduced.
   Thus, the manner in which the deep-sea lead is carried awaj-, and the deter-

minations rendered uncertain, when soundings are attempted in depths only of
50 to 100 fathoms, from a ship having but very little headway, might alone justify
the asserted grounds of probable error on the deep-sea soundings referred to.

    But further evidence of resistance in water, against the assuming of a straight
position of a rope or line, under tension, where it may have been previously thrown
into a curve, may be derived from some striking facts in the author's personal
experience whilst engaged in the Northern Whale Fishery. Let the annexed
diagram be supposed to represent one of these characteristic cases, where a boat is
seen with its bow in contact with a large field of ice.

A whale, it is assumed, has been harpooned from this boat, which, as in such

circumstances generally happens, retreats for shelter beneath the ice-field, drawing

out the line with great force after it. Having pursued its original course beneath for

a distance probably of a mile, the necessity for respiration induces its return. Its

probable course may be shown by the line in the diagram, one end of it being

attached to the boat, and the other, by means of a harpoon, to the whale here

Arepresented as having risen to the surface astern of the fast-boat.  few minutes

previous, perhaps, to the reappearance of the whale, the line attached to the boat,

which might have been for some time in a state of quiet or unaltered tension, is, by
a second eflfort of the entangled animal, powerfully withdrawn, so that the boat may

be pressed against the ice, as at first, with a force, possibly, equivalent to that of a

ton weight ! Yet, in this case, whilst the direction of the action on the boat is ahead,

say, northward, the actual place of the whale exerting this singular energy, may be

asteiii, or southward, the resistance of the water on the line preventing its taking a

straight direction, and causing it to sweep round a body of water in a circuit,

something after the manner of resistance of a more solid material.

Observing this curious fact whilst he, the author of the communication, in very early

life occupied the station of harpooner in the Greenland Fishery, he successfully availed

himself of it for facilitating the capture of whales which might have been "struck"
by any of his associates. In the case of a whale being harpooned in " clear water,"

where the "fast-boat," unencumbered by ice, was free to follow the course of the

entangled animal, the practice of the other pursuers, as they might successively come

up to assist in the capture, was ordinarily to distribute themselves in different angles

in considerable advance of the fast-boat. But he, noting carefully the cessation of the

advance of the original boat, which often happened, or its gradual deviation from the

course at first pursued, was accustomed to take up a position either astern of the

fast-boat, or wide upon its biam on the side towards which the deviation tended,

calculating that the resistance of the line by the water would cause the direction of

the boat's deviation to lag far behind that of the whale. The result was so satisfac-

tory, that in a large majority of cases, where the rule applied, his boat was found

so near the wounded animal on its reappearance at the surface, that he was most

frequently successful in striking the second harpoon.

Hence, under such variety of illustration applicable to the case of deep-sea

soundings in the regions of strata-currents, it appeared to be an inevitable result.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  25

that the sounding-line in these attempts must be so carried away with the moving
strata of waters as to render the length of line run out a verj' imperfect indication of
the depth reached by the plummet.

   Dr. Scoresby next proceeded to communicate his plan for the determination of
surface-currents, and relatively of strata-currents.

 --The ordinary mode of determining the set and velocity of currents by the
--differences betwixt a ship's position on each day's run as determined by celestial

observations and the "dead-reckoning" is necessarilj' and obviously very uncertain,
often entirely delusive. None of the elements of the log and reckoning are or can
be correct ; the distance run, the compass course, the steerage of the ship, are all
more or less inaccurate. The author's own experience had afforded numerous
cases in practical navigation of great and remarkable differences betwixt the day's-

reckoning and celestial observations, such as might have been taken as indications of
currents of considerable influence, where, it was almost certain, the main differences
were really due to bad steering (when scudding or sailing with the wind on the beam

or quarter) ; to errors in the distances indicated by the log, or to peculiarities or

changes in the ship's local attraction.

   No doubt broad determinations as to great and decided currents, and proximate

results by means of multiplied observations on currents of moderate velocities, are
derivable from the ordinary process ; but for really satisfactory results, far more
accurate and conclusive processes need to be instituted. And it would be well
deserving of an enlightened government of a maritime country like ours to employ
some of their smaller war- vessels, and so to afford useful and instructive practice

to junior officers, in investigations concerning currents, and particularly strata-
currents. And for such investigations certain modes, Dr. Scoresby believed, might
be made easily available, calculated to yield much valuable and interesting informa-
tion on this important subject.

   Two leading processes were then described as appearing to be applicable to these

determinations :

   1. The planting in particular positions in the ocean, from an attendant vessel,
buoys with flags, kept in their places by a resisting apparatus below the surface,
which may be denominated a airrent-measurer, and determining, after a night's

interval, for instance, the changes of their position from celestial observations.

  A convenient construction of the current-measurer,

with a view to portability of stowage, might be a double
oblong frame of iron, attached by a transverse pin as a
hinge, by the middle of each, so as to allow of their being
spread out as vanes in a vertical plane, or placed flat on
each other when not in use. These frames, which might
be 6 or 8 feet in length by 2 or 3 in breadth, being covered
with linen, would, when sunk in the water, as indicated
by the annexed figure, afford sufficient resistance, pro-
bably, for all the purposes contemplated.

    2. Placing, during a calm, a small boat in the water,
constructed for the purpose, light, and slightly resisting
of motion, with the current apparatus for the determination

--of the relative set of strata-currents. The current-mea-

surer, attached and suspended by a small wire run off a
reel fixed in the bow of the boat, might be let down to
various depths in succession, with a register-thermometer
attached at each new depth, when the motion of the boat
and its direction, as shown by the position of a surface-
float or buoy, would, after but short intervals of time,
indicate, proximately, the relative motions of the surface-
water and the water at the several depths of the resisting
apparatus below ; whilst the register-thermometers might
give useful information on the extremes of temperature of
the various sections of water passed through.

    By these arrangements information would be obtained as to the following

particulars :

   By the surface-buoy (1) we should ascertain, if the weather were sufficiently calm.

the highest and lowest temperature would be shown at each of the depths examined

(that is, when the changes were in one way, as from warm to cold), and thus the

several results might be compared with the SKr/ace-temperature taken at the com-

mencement, and at each change of depth.

The cases in which such experiments would be the most interesting, would pro-

bably be found in places of the ocean where great differences of temperature are met

with at comparatively moderate differences of depth. In some of the positions

examined, for instance, by the officers of the United States Coast Survey, the tem-

perature was found to sink, from about 80░ at the surface, sometimes to 70░, or even

65░, in depths not exceeding 120 fathoms, and down to 64░ or 63░ (near 20"^ lower

than at the surface), in depths of 120 ranging to 480 fathoms; whilst a tempera-

ture as low as 44░, or less, was met witli at the depth of about 700 fathoms. Now,

--in such cases cases pievailing extensively within and about the edges of the Gulf-

stream, or within the changes of surface-temperature in the transatlantic passage

we should probably obtain by the processes described results of no ordinary interest

and importance.

The results, it must be admitted, could only be proximate ; for the boat, moved

by the deeply-sunk current- measurer, it is obvious could not follow vertically above

it ; but under the action of an obliquely ranging wire, when both boat and wire must

present a force of resistance, the boat must take a position behind. Yet, if the cur-

rent diflFerences were considerable in velocity and direction, perhaps experiments

continued for a few hours at a time, and repeated under a due variety of circum-

stances, might afford data for mathematical determinations of resistance and cor-

rections. And, in certain cases, in regions where the great oceanic currents overlay

one another, like those from the Polar Seas and the Tropics, conclusions abundantly

satisfactory might, no doubt, be realized.

On a proposed Barometric Pendulum, for the Registration of the Mean
  Atmospheric Pressure during long Periods of Time. By W. J. Macquorn

   Rankine, C.E., F.R.S.S. Loud, and Edinb.

   The author proposes to use the variations of the rate of a clock to determine the
mean barometric pressure during long periods.

   For this purpose the clock should be regulated by a centrifugal or revolving pen-
dulum, part of which should consist of a siphon barometer. The rising and falling
of the mercury would affect the rate of the clock ; so that from the number of revo-
lutions of the pendulum in a given time might be deduced approximately the mean
height of the mercurial column during that period.

   The author investigates the formulae to be used for this purpose, and points out
the nature and mode of determination of the corrections required for temperature,
obliquity of the barometer, and centrifugal force, and also for the difference between
the square root of the mean of the squares of the barometric heights, which is the
quantity ascertained in the first instance, and the mean of the heights, which is the

quantity sought.

           On the Meteorology of Hull. By William Lawton.

After describing the instruments used and their situation with regard to the town

and surrounding objects, the author referred to the observations themselves, which

consist of three separate series. 1st. The observations on temperature of Dr.

Fielding, late of Hull, extending from 1831 to 1836 (both inclusive), left in the

form of a chart. These have been reduced to their numerical value and placed in a

tabulated form. 2nd. Mr. Lawton's observations of a general character, commen-

cing with January 1849, and still continued. 3rd. The Literary and Philosophical

Society's observations, commencing with 1851, and also continued.

The following table headed Atmospheric Pressure, represents the mean barometrical

observations for each month and for the year. The first three columns are the

results of the author's observations taken daily at 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. The first

column represents the average highest monthly maxima for the years 1849, 1850, 1851

and 1852 ; the second column the average lowest monthly minima ; and the third
column the mean monthly height for the same period.

The fourth and fifth columns give the highest and lowest readings for each month

from the Philosophical Society's Register, and the sixth column of the same table

the mean of each month for the year 1851, which closely coincide with Mr. Lawton's

observations for the same period. The mean height of the barometer for December

of that year was the greatest yet registered, being 30*34 ; the Philosophical Society's
30'264. By a reference to the third column containing the mean height on the

average of four years from 1849 to 1852, it will be perceived the readings are the

highest in February, March and September, and lowest in January, October and

November.

The mean heights of each of the four years observed have not varied above "05 of

an inch.

   To this table are added the results of four years' observations made at Wakefield
by W. R. Milner, Esq., Surgeon, during the same period, and kindly furnished

by that gentleman.             --Table L Atmospheric Pressure.

and sink twice to minima about 4 a.m. and 4 p.m., Mr. Lawton referred to the
observations, to see how far such ebb and flow of the mercurial column was borne
out. In his own observations taken at 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. there was no evidence of
such fluctuation ; but in the Philosophical Society's Register taken at the time of the
greatest ebb and flow, the mean of the morning readings in each month of the yeai-
is in every case above the mean of the afternoon readings, as will be seen by the

following Table.

   To the combined influence of the Sea and the Humber in mitigating the heat
of the summer day and softeniog the cold of the winter's night at Hull, a third
may be added, namely, the large surface area of water, which in the form of spacious
docks and harbour occupy a space of from CO to 70 acres. The effect of this
area of water passing through the centre of the town must be in summer to absorb
heat, which houses, streets, or dry ground would reflect into the atmosphere, and in

winter to communicate during the night a portion of the heat absorbed during the day.
   It is to be much regretted that no data whatever exist as to the temperature of

the docks, the Humber, and the sea washing the Yorkshire coast, a blank in meteo-
rological science which the author hopes to fill up.

   It may next be interesting to show the extreme monthly maxima and minima
registered at Hull. For this purpose Table IV. is constructed, showing the highest
and lowest monthly maxima and minima from the observations of Dr. Fielding and
Mr. Lawton, to which is added a similar table again copied from Professor Phillips's
work before mentioned.

climate, at particular seasons, with that of Halifax, situated in the Yorkshire hills.
York in the valley, and Keyingham in the Holderness level, Mr. Lawton has added
Hull. It will be' seen that'in the cold month of January Hull has the warmer cli-
mate, April and July rather colder, October rather warmer.

   la conclusion, Mr. Lawton presents a few facts referring to the chief meteorological
features of the present year. The mean temperature of February was 32░'2, being
9░ below the average of the past four years. The lowest of the month was 18░, the
highest 38░. Snow fell on eighteen days.

   The mean temperature of Marcli was 35░"4, being 8░ below the average of the
same period. Snow fell on twelve days.

   During a considerable portion of March, April, May, and June, easterly and
north-easterly winds prevailed. The fall of moisture was also in excess, being,
during the first six months of the year, in inches, 5"47 above the average of the pre-

vious four years.

   The atmosphere, during the months of June, July, and August, was unusually

cloudy.

   No thunder-storm worthy of note has occurred in this neighbourhood during the

present year.

   But in the summer of 1851 thiinder-stormsof extreme severity occurred on the 21st
June, 29th July, 13th and 17th of August. The one on Saturday the 21st of June
continued from 3"30 to 5'30 p.m., during which there fell in inches 1'68 of rain, the
heaviest fall of many years. The storm of the 29th of July continued from 5"30 to 7
P.M., and was remarkable for the long continuance of vivid fork and sheet lightning
prior to rain descending; the quantity of rain in inches was 76 hundredths, which
fell in about one hour. That of the ISth of August was accompanied by a terrific
and most destructive bail-storm.

On the Action of the Winds which veer from the South- West to West, and
                    North- West to North. By R. Russell.

In almost all the violent storms which occur in the British islands, the currents

above seldom coincide with those at the surface of the ground, which statement also

often applies to ordinary weather, when there is little atmospheric disturbance. On
previous occasions, Mr. Russell had endeavoured to show that many of the phe-

nomena of our storms would ultimately be explained by the mutual action of the

under and upper currents. He had never seen an instance of a British storm that

admitted of being explained on the rotatory theory, and he thought this theory

altogether erroneous as applied to our high latitudes. A south-east current in the

upper regions of the atmosphere seldom occurred in Britain, but south-east surface

winds were common in moist and rainy tracts of weather. In these circumstances,

however, an upper current of S.W. overlies the S.E., and supplies it with rain. Di-

rect E. winds, prevailing not only at the surface, but ;it those atmospheric heights

where the cirrus clouds are formed, aie much more common than from the S.E.,

Aand undivided currents from the N.E. are still more frequent.  west wind seldom

or never blows below when an east wind prevails above ; but on the contrary, it is

very common for a S.W. current to prevail above, when a N.E., E., or S.E. wind

may blow furiously below. The solution of many of the primary phaenomena of

those storms which commence in Britain with easterly winds and terminate with

westerly or northerly winds, is to be found in the mutual action of the upper and

Alower currents moving in different directions, and not in the principle of rotation.

current from the N.W. at the surface of the earth never blows for any length of

time with an upper current from the S.W. ; but in certain tracts of weather, it is

very common for a S.W. under-current to prevail, while a N.W. or N. wind is

blowing above. It has been noticed that gales begin to blow from the S.W. or S.,
            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                   3S

and afterwards veer round by W. with great violence to N.W. or N. The advocates

of the rotatory hypothesis find a solution of this by supposing that at those places

where the wind veers from S.W. by W. to N.W., a vast body of air is in a state of

gyration from right to left, and in a state of translation from S.W. to N.E.

TTie centre of rotation is supposed to lie far to the north of the stations where

the wind goes through these points. This is a very plausible explanation of

the veerings, and is always adduced in support of the rotatory hypothesis, in

favour of which much may be said in one class of storms, but in these there

can be no rotation, as the S.W. wind flows in one broad stream over the island,

and no observations can be found to indicate a recurring of the S.W. wind.

WIn the class of storms where the wind goes through the course of S.W.,

to N.W., an upper current from the N.W. prevails. The veering, Mr. Russell is
of opinion, may be accounted for in the same way as variations in the summer

months, which arise, he thinks, from an intermixture and interchange which is

effected along the course of the wind, the hot air rising up and the cold air de-

Ascending.  similar phenomenon is to be seen in the commingling of water.

This, too, he believed, affords a proximate explanation of many of our easterly gales ;
and so the reversal of the lower current by the heat of the sun during certain states

of our atmosphere in summer is maintained bj' the constant ascent and descent of

the air of the two opposite currents, so far as the south wind extends. Every gust

of the breeze must be considered as the effect of vertical gyrations caused by air of

different specific gravities. As soon as the sun lessens his heat, the disturbing

influences are diminished, and at last night brings a calm at the earth's surface,

while the north current above still flows on. The length of time which the wind will

blow from the S.W. is very uncertain. It commonly varies from eight to forty-

eight hours, and in some cases it continues for days. The wind at once turns round

to the N.W., when the barometer again begins to rise. The cause of this change of

иwind to the N.W., he believed, is merely the upper current resuming its sway at the

surface of the earth by putting the thin stratum of air which has been flowing from

the S.W. into the same course as the current above. The temporary eruption

of the S.W. wind, which has been heated over the warm ocean and replenished by

moisture, appeared to him to be a parallel phaenomenon to the southerly breezes

which play over our island during the day in summer when the N. wind is prevailing

above. These dry breezes are daily called into action by the solar rays disturbing

the equilibrium of the air in the lower depths of the atmosphere where rarefaction

takes place. In this manner, then, may the moist S.W. winds from the Atlantic be

hurried over the continent of Europe, and when once set in motion they possess a

self-sustaining force in mingling with the dry cold current which overstratifies them.

Although it may be against general theory and beUef, he thought that the returning
polar current in our latitude is much more frequently from the N.W. than from the

N.E. Both Mr. Green and Mr. Mason were of opinion, from their aeronautic

experience, that in whatever direction the wind might blow at the surface of the

earth, at 10,000 feet the current was invariably from some point between N. and W.

This opinion was no doubt carried too far, but it clearly showed the frequency of

the N.W. wind above the lower currents. Many of the storms which begin to

blow from the S.W. and veer round to N.W., are apparently caused by the mutual

action of two currents from these quarters stratified over one another. In these

storms, too, the bEirometer does not usually give much warning of their approach

indeed the mercury will sometimes be actually on the rise when cirrostratus cloud,
the precursor of the S.W. wind, is already formed along the western horizon. On

the contrary, the storms which come on with easterly winds give notice of their

approach by a fall in the mercury. In conclusion, Mr. Russell observed that the

extraordinary change of the wind from S.W. to N.W. had been noticed by Shak-

speare, and he had some very beautiful lines on the subject, which Mr. Russell

quoted.

slight frost, and about noon a thin haze came over and covered the sun, which still

shone with considerable power ; and there were a few scattered light clouds. At the

time stated above, four mock suns, or parhelia, were very visible, situated at equal

distances in a circle round the true sun, two being in the same vertical with him,

and two in the same horizontal range. These displayed splendid prismatic colours.

Shortly afterwards two other mock suns appeared, of a pale white light, in the

same horizontal range with the true sun and two of the bright mock suns. Each of

the mock suns appeared as large as the true sun, and through him and the four hori-

zontal mock suns a stream of pale white light passed to a considerable distance be-

of it, and to a considerable distance beyond the two outside ones. The wind being
scarcely perceptible, the haze hung over the sun for a long time. The phsenome-
non was in full splendour for upwards of two hours ; and it was a considerable time

afterwards before all traces had disappeared.

On the Graduation of Standard Thermometers at the Kew Observatory.
                            By John Welsh.

In the year 1851 the Committee of the Kew Observatory, impressed with the

importance, in meteorological investigations, of possessing thermometers of a better

class than those hitherto procurable from opticians, took steps with the view of

producing such instruments, under their own superintendence, for distribution to

institutions and individuals who might require accurate standards of reference. The

Committee were furnished with the information necessary to carry out their inten-

tions by M. Regnault of Paris, who had been accustomed to construct his own

thermometers by a method proposed by himself, and with an accuracy previously

unknown: they were also supplied, under his directions, with the requisite apparatus.

It has been assumed by physicists that at all temperatures, as high at least as that

of boiling water, the apparent expansion of mercury in a glass envelope is uniform

Afor equal increments of heat.                  mercurial thermometer may therefore be called a

standard instrument when the divisions of its scale correspond everywhere to equal

volumes of the contained fluid, and when the readings are known for the tempera-

tures of melting ice and of water boiling under a certain barometric pressure. If the

tube were perfectly uniform in its bore, it would only be necessary to make a scale

of equal parts between the freezing and boiling-points, and to extend the division

above and below these points ; but as perfect tubes are in practice not procurable,
it becomes necessary, in dividing the scale, to make allowance for the variations in
the tube's capacity. These variations are obtained by carefully measuring a short
column of mercury (1 inch or less in length) as it is made to pass along the tube

by successive steps, each of which is as nearl)' as possible its own length. In
the thermometers constructed according to M. Regnault's process, the divisions do

not represent degrees of the ordinary scales of temperature, but are of an arbitrary

value, differing for each instrument, and requiring separate tables for each ther-
mometer to convert the scale readings into degrees ; the divisions at all parts of the

scale being equivalent to equal volumes, although their lengths may vary very consi-
derably. Mr. Welsh described a raodification which he had made in M. Regnault's
process, by which he has been enabled to divide the scales of the thermometers gra-
duated at Kew at once into degrees, the readings being afterwards subject only to the

small errors of manipulation, and such errors as arise from the unavoidable changes
which take place in the zero-points of all thermometers. The freezing-points are de-
termined in the ordinary way by immersion in well-pounded ice, from which the water
is drained off as it melts. The boiling-points are determined by the apparatus
devised by M. Regnault, in steam, whose elastic force is exactly equal to that of the
atmosphere at the time, a correction being made for the difference of the barometric
pressure from the adopted standard pressure. The boiling-points, besides being
determined for the usual position of a thermometer, with the stem vertical, are also

observed in a similar apparatus with the stem horizontal ; so that, if the instrument

should ever be used in any other than the vertical position, the proper correction may
be applied. The difference between the boiling-point of a thermometer, in the two
positions, is found to be from 0░"2 to 0░5 Fahr., according to the thickness of the

glass and the form of the bulb. After the graduation of a thermometer has been
completed, its accuracy is examined by a subsequent calibration with a longer column
of mercury. If the length of the column, with reference to the scale divisions,
is everywhere the same, the graduation is considered good ; but if any difference is
found to exist, a more complete examination is made by using columns of different
lengths, each of which is nearly an aliquot part of the range of the scale, the remain-
ing errors being deduced from these measurements by the method adopted by Mr.
Sheepshanks for the thermometers used in connection with the national standard
yard. It is, however, seldom that any appreciable correction is found needful. It
has long been known that the freezing-point of a thermometer is not constant, but
rises by a considerable amount during the first year after its construction. There is,
however, another peculiarity in thermometers which is less known. If a thermo-
meter, after having been for some weeks exposed to the ordinary temperature of the
air, is placed in melting ice, its freezing-point will be, for example, 32░'2 ; if the bulb
is then put for two or three minutes into boiling water, and soon afterwards again
placed in ice, the reading will no longer be 32░'2, but will have fallen to nearly 32░'0 :

--if in a day or two it is again placed in ice, the freezing-point will have risen a little
    about 0░'l; and if again tried, after two or three weeks, the freezing-point will
be found to have acquired exactly the original position of 32░"2. This has been found
to be the case with every thermometer examined at Kew, whatever was its age ; the
difference in the freezing-point, before and after boiling, being about 0░'17 Fahr., and

varying inappreciably in different instruments. This peculiar displacement of the
freezing-point seems to be owing to a temporary alteration in the dimensions of the
bulb caused by a considerable change of temperature ; the glass, after having been
expanded by heat, requiring a week or two to contract to its original size. It appears,
therefore, that the alteration in the freezing-point of a thermometer depends upon two

separate causes, the one being a slow contraction of the bulb, continuing for many
months but ultimately ceasing, and the other a temporary alteration in the dimensions
of the bulb, produced by a sudden and considerable elevation of temperature, which
disappears in two or three weeks. The rise in the freezing-point of ordinary ther-
mometers is probably due to a combination of both these causes ; for if a thermo-
meter has its freezing-point set off' soon after being blown and filled, there will be,

first of all, the comparatively rapid contraction of the bulb due to the great heat to
which it has lately been exposed, and afterwards the more gradual contraction which
continues for several months. The author recommended opticians, instead of
" pointing off" their thermometers immediately after being filled, to allow them to
rest for a month or six weeks, so as to avoid at least the first great change which
occurs ; but of course the longer they are kept the better. Mr. Welsh mentioned

another fact which he had observed in thermometers. He took about fifteen ther-
mometers, and, after carefully ascertaining their freezing-points, kept them exposed
to the temperature of boiling water for about 60 hours, allowing them afterwards to
cool very slowly. It was then found that the freezing-point had been permanently
raised in all of them by about 0░'3 to 0░'4 Fahr. The effect of a subsequent suddeii
elevation of temperature was exactly as before, to lower the freezing-point by nearly

                                                                                                    3*

0░'2 ; the reading which was found after the long-continued boiling being again
restored in about a fortnight. He was not yet prepared to say whether any eflfect
is produced by the boiling in the way of bringing the freezing-point of a newly-
made thermometer to a permanent position, irrespective of the temporary altera-
tion caused by a sudden elevation of temperature.

                                 Strength of Materials.

                 On the Elasticity of Stone and Crystalline Bodies.

                   By Professor Eaton Hodgkinson, F.R.S.

    It is generally assumed by writers on the strength of materials, that the elasticity
 of bodies is perfect so long as the material is not strained beyond a cei'tain degree.
 But from the experiments I made several years ago, at the instance of the British
 Association, on the strength of hot and cold blast-iron (vol. vi.), I was led to con-
 clude that the assumption was very incorrect, as applied to cast iron at least ; and
 further experiments rendered it probable that it was only an approximation in any.

 Among the bodies of most value in the arts, cast iron holds an important place
 and I found that bars of that metal, when bent with forces, however small, never

 regained their first form, after the force was removed ; and this defect of its
 elasticity took place whether the cast iron was strained by tension, compression, or
 transverse flexure. I subsequently found that in the first two strains (by tension
 and compression), the straining force might be well represented by a function

--composed of the first and second powers of the change of length produced, thus,

                                         w=ae-- Je^

                                  --w=-a'c h'(?,

 where w is the weight applied, ethe extension, c the compression, and a, a, b, b'

 constant quantities. If the elasticity were perfect, the part depending on the second
 power must be neglected. The necessity of a change in the fundamehtal assump-

 tions for calculating the strength of materials may be inferred from the fact, that in
 computing the breaking weig?it by tension, from experiments on <?-aMsverse flexure and
 fracture, we obtain the strength of cast iron three times as great as from numerous ex-
 periments I have found it to be. The formulae of Tredgold give this erroneous

 --result, and those of Navier are in accordance with them.
     Stone. To obtain the elasticity of stone, I had masses of soft stone, obtained
 from various places, sawn up into broad thin slabs, 7 feet long, and about 1 inch
 thick. They were rubbed smooth, and rendered perfectly dry in a stove, and were
 bent transversely in their least direction by forces acting horizontally. The slabs,
  during the experiments, were placed with their broad side vertical, and had their
  ends supported, 6 feet 6 inches asunder, by friction rollers, acting horizontally and
  vertically. It resulted from the experiments (as shown in a former volume of this
  Association), that the defects of elasticity were nearly as the square of the weight
  laid on ; or consequently, as the square of the deflexion nearly, as in cast iron. The
  ribs never regained their first form after the weight was removed, however small
 that weight had been. From other ribs of stone, obtained from various localities,
  and broken transversely by weights, acting vertically, and increased to the time of
  fracture, the ratio of the deflection to the weight applied was found in various
  experiments to be nearly as below :-

included, according to the conclusions of Poisson, or the experiments of Wertheim,
which are at variance with each other. But these last changes are so small in the

bodies I am contemplating, that they may be neglected for all practical purposes.
Thus, from my experiments, the utmost extension of a bar of cast iron, 50 feet long,
is about 1 inch, or ^^dth of the length, and therefore the change of lateral dimen-

sions of the bar being only a fraction of this eotjdth, according either to Poisson
or Wertheim, it is too small to need including. The experiments from which I

deduced the utmost extension of cast iron, are given in the ' Report of the Com-
missioners on the Strength of Iron for Railway Purposes.' If the body strained

were wrought iron, brass, or others of a very ductile nature, the change of lateral

dimensions might, in extreme cases, be included. I beg to mention, with great

deference, that the profound work of Lame, lately published, ' On the Mathematical

Theory of Elasticity,' in which the elasticity is considered as perfect only, does not
appear to apply to such bodies as I have here treated of.

   The labours of the Ordnance Survey Department have been directed during the
past year to the determination, according to the theory of minimum squares, of the
most probable corrections to be applied to the angles of the principal triangles.

   This process, which is a most laborious one, involving the solution of about 1300
equations of condition, is now well advanced, and every exertion is being made to
hasten its completion. Until it has been finally completed the computations of
distances cannot be properly undertaken, for it must be borne in mind that the trigo-
nometrical operations of the Ordnance Survey embrace a connected triangulation, ex-
tending through the length and breadth of the United Kingdom, which must be con-
sidered as a whole, in deducing the results.

   Besides preparing for the publicatiou of the principal triangulation, the Ordnance
Survey Department are about to publish a volume of Levels in Ireland, and another
of the Meteorological Observations made at the Ordnance Survey Office near Dublin,
the printing of both works being at the present time in progress.

              On a Simple Instrumentfor graduating Glass Tubes.
              By Thomas Andrews, M.D., F.R.S., M.B.LA.

This instrument is intended to supply the chemist with a means of accurately gra-
duating his glass measures of capacity. The divisions admit of being varied in length

to the j7;ooodth of an inch, so as to allow the graduation to be adapted to the changes

In calibre of the vessel. They are obtained by the action of a micrometer-screw,
1 inch long, on a wooden block on which a standard scale is firmly fixed ; but the
details of the construction could not be rendered intelligible without a figure. Scales
exceeding 3 feet in length may be divided by means of this instrument, which the
author has very successfully employed in the construction of thermometers for delicate
investigations. The dividing instrument itself, and a thermometer graduated by its
aid, were exhibited to the Section.

On the Effect of Sulphate of Lime upon Vegetable Substances.
                    By Chevalier Claussen.

   About six weeks since I was engaged in making various experiments on the effect

of sulphate of lime upon vegetable substances. A portion of the substances then
used by me was thrown carelessly aside, and upon returning to my experiments about a

fortnight afterwards, I was surprised to find that decomposition had not taken place in

those parts of the vegetables which had been subjected to the action of the sulphate,

while those which had not been so treated were completeh' decayed. Among the

articles experimented upon were a number of potatoes, each of which was affected by

the prevalent disease ; some of these remain sound to the present daj', the others
have some time since completely rotted awaj'. Subsequently, I procured some more

potatoes, and also some beet-roots, the former being, as far as I could judge, all
diseased. I divided the potatoes into three portions. One lot I placed in a vessel

with a weak solution of sulphuric acid, and from thence I placed them in a solution

of weak lime-water. In the second lot the process was reversed, that is to say, the

potatoes were first placed in the lime-water, and then in the acid. The third lot was

left untouched. Ten days afterwards I examined the potatoes, and found, as I

expected, that the potatoes which had not been treated with the sulphate were rapidly

decaying; those which had been first placed in the solution of lime and then in the
acid were more nearly decomposed ; while those which had been treated in the mode
first described remained as sound as when first taken in hand. Upon being cut open

the diseased part of the potatoes was not found to have spread internally, and the

flavour of the root was in no degree affected by the application of the process, nor do

I think that its germinating power was injured by the effect of the sulphate. The

effect upon the beet-roots was similar to that produced upon the potatoes, and which

would seem to be somewhat analogous to that of galvanizing metals, viz. protecting
the substances from the effect of atmospheric agencies. 1 may add, that muriatic

and other acids have been employed by me on other occasions with equal success, the

only agents required appearing to be those which will most readily produce a sulphate
in contact with the substances required to be preserved. As at present it does not.

appear that any means can be successfullj' adopted to prevent the potato from beco-

ming diseased while in the ground and arriving at maturity, it would certainly be of

immense advantage if anything could be discovered by the use of which the roots
when taken up could be prevented from that absolute decay and irreparable loss to

which potatoes affected by the disease are liable. The results which 1 have described

Howseem to me to point to the possibility of arresting this loss.  far the plan sug-

gested may be practicable or applicable upon a large scale, my present very pressing

and numerous engagements have hitherto prevented me from ascertaining. I do not

think that any insuperable difficulty exists with respect to the application of the pro-

cess. The acid employed by me was very weak, about 1 part to 200 of water; the
lime-water was about the consistency of milk. The materi;ils are not therefore

expensive; and when the value of the crop to be saved is taken into consideration,

it would be a matter well worthy of being tested by some of those extensive growers
of potatoes in the county in which the British Association is now holding its sittings.

For my own part, I should be most happy, if by any suggestion of mine I had merely
been the instrument of directing the attention of scientific men to the subject of the

possibility of preserving from total destruction a vegetable so valuable and so indispen-

sable as the potato.

Rev. Thomas Exley, A.3I.

From phgenoraena, I infer the existence of an element in great abundance, which I
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                            SSk

call electrogen ; the proof will be given in a work which I hope speedily to publish,
in which 1 have clearly proved that each tenacious atom attaches to its sphere of
repulsion a number of aetherial atoms, such that the sum of their forces is exactly equal

to that of the atom to which they are attached. These are luiiformly disposed, and

therefore, as Newton has shown, have the same effect as if placed in its centre : this

may be called the attached atmosphere.

Circles being described on each of these as centres, with the radius of an aetherial

atom, and a sphere concentric to the tenacious atom, touch them internally, and an-

other externally ; then between the attached atmosphere and the inner sphere will be

a spherical shell equal in thickness to the radius of the aetherial atom, less the diameter
of the tenacious atom ; the aetherial atoms in this shell are all repulsive and equal

together to the attraction of the tenacious atom, and hence it may be called the neutral

shell. After this succeeds another shell, whose thickness is equal to the diameter of

the central atom ; in this the setherial atoms begin to attract more and more from the
concave to the convex side, to the surface of which the united actions bring an atmo-

sphere of electrogen ; the electrogen is abundant, so that by the pressure of the atmo-
sphere the centres are within the spheres of each other's repulsion. The difference

of conducting power will be found in the difference of these shells.

Suppose two tenacious atoms the force of one ten times greater than the force of

the other, but its sphere of repulsion ten times less ; calculation gives the repulsive

force between the centres of its attached atmosphere, which force in one million
times greater, and shows its diametrical shell contains ten times more atoms crowded

in a space many times less, the difference being chiefly on the convex side. Hence

electrogen cannot by any moderate force enter its diametrical shell ; it will be a con-

Aductor, because the electrogen easily floats on its surface.  moderate force will

bring electrogen into the shell of the other, which will prove more or less an obstruc-

tion to the passage of electrogen ; it will therefore be a non-conductor and an electric.
    Suppose, now, the balls of a long conductor brought near the sides of a charged

electric. Tiie electrogen, tending outward from the positive side of the electric, affects

the contiguous air to the conductor, and along it to the negative side, where the

effect is increased by the tendency of electrogen to supply the defect on that side ; when

brought to the striking distance, a spark passes from the positive side and another

to the negative side, and the equilibrium is quickly restored from both sides towards

the middle of the conductor, although it pass but to a short distance. The passage of

the spark is quite different from the conducting of the fluid; in the spark a body of

electrogen forces its passage in a prepared direction, but a current is propagated along

a conductor from atom to atom. Thus, in the wire of the electric telegraph, by the

action of the galvanic apparatus, the lines of electrogen along the sides of the wire are

affected through the whole length, and as there is a continual supply from the appa-

ratus, the whole line is at once and continually put in motion, each atom of electrogen

taking place of the next through the whole line, so that the apparatus causes the

passage of the atoms nearly at the same time to proceed at the other end, distant 30,

50, 100, or 1000 miles; a greater distance requiring of course a greater intensity

of galvanic action. It ought not to excite surprise that these effects are so readily

produced, when we consider that the wire of itself, in certain positions, without any

galvanic apparatus, would convey electricity to the earth, to which in high latitudes

it always has a tendency to move along any conductors in the air ; hence the air itself
assists the transmission, which would be instantaneous, and of equal amount in every

part of the wire, were it not for want of perfect conductibility ; as soon as electrogen

begins to enter at one end, an equal portion tends to go off at the other end, the cur-

rent being at once produced in the atoms which occupy its whole length.

 On the Decomposition of Water under Pressure, hy the Galvanic Battery.
                       By John P. Gassiot, V.P.R.S.

   It is a well-known law, long since discovered by Dr. Faraday, that whatever may
be the liquid electrolysed by the galvanic battery, and whatever may be the size of the
electrodes used, the same amount of chemical decomposition takes place in each cell
of the battery ; if water is placed in any number of separate vessels, connected by
platinum electrodes with each other, and thus introduced within the circuit of a gal-
vanic battery, the same amount of the mixed gases will be evolved from each vessel.
--40 REPORT 1853.

    If, instead of allowing the gases to escape from each, such vessels are closed, a very

considerable amount of pressure is obtained. The late Professor Daniel many years

since experimented with a closed glass vessel, as did Dr. Leeson, but in each instance,
before any great pressure was obtained, the vessels broke with very considerable vio-

lence.

    Will Faraday's law hold good under extreme pressure ? Is there any point at

which the pressure will recompose the hydrogen and oxygen evolved by the electrolysis

of water ? Is there any point at which water under such pressure will cease to be

electrolysed? and will it, under such circumstances, continue a conductor?

    All these questions appear to me to be well worthy of examination ; and although

the experiments I have hitherto made are far from being conclusive, they prove that,

as far as I have been able to obtain apparatus of sufficient strengtli to withstand the

pressure, water does continue to be electrolysed according to the law of Faraday, and

that the gases under such a condition do not recombine.

  My first experiments were made in glass tubes ; in each end I inserted a platinum

wire, and filling the tube with diluted water slightly acidulated with pure sulphuric

Aacid, the ends of the tubes were closed by mechanical pressure.                                                                                                     voltameter con-

structed on the principle of Mr. Martyn Roberts, and a galvanometer were introduced

in the circuit of a battery consisting of 10 small cells of Grove's. Many experiments

were made with such and similar apparatus, but all the tubes brokelong before any great

amount of pressiu'e had been obtained.

    Finding it was useless to expect any results from using glass, I then attempted the

experiment with metal.
   Into a copper tube, a hole of J inch diameter, and about f inch long, was bored.

This v?as insulated by being placed on a piece of dry leather, a platinum wire attached
to a platinum plate being introduced into the copper vessel, which had been previously

filled with diluted water slightly acidulated.

   The air from the water had been carefully extracted by boiling under a good

air-pump; as before, I used 10 cells of a small Grove's battery, a galvanometer and

a Roberts's voltameter being introduced iu the circuit, and the circuit completed by

making the  copper vessel negative  and                                                           the platinum   wire  positive                                      when  10*5  of the
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

mixed gases had been evolved in the voltameter, the tube burst with considerable vio-

lence ; taking the capacity of the tube at ^^ths of a cubic inch, the pressure thus ob-
tained was about 525 atmospheres.

   Since that period I have had an apparatus constructed by which I can collect the
amount of gas from the vessel in which it is confined, for unless some mode could be

devised by which this could be effected, no satisfactory result could be expected.

   In all my previous experiments I calculated on being able to collect the gases by

opening the vessels under water, but finding it indispensable that the apparatus should

be much stronger, and consequently larger, I was compelled to use other means.
   The apparatus in which my experiments have since been conducted, were constructed

entirely of platinum encased in solid pieces of gun-metal about 6 inches in diameter.
   The first had a capacity of -j^ths of a cubic inch. In one experiment, after 103

cubic inches of tlie gases had been evolved, a loud explosion took place ; the concus-

sion was so great as to extinguish the two gas lamps in my laboratory ; my assistant,
who was observing the apparatus, saw a sudden appearance of light as of a flame

round the upper part of the apparatus as the gas escaped, the leather washer driven
out in perfect shreds, and from the upper valves being perfectly dry, no gas had

escaped previous to the explosion.

of the explosion, as the wire attached to the upper part, which was the negative elec-

trode, would otherwise have had a coating of copper, whereas it was perfectly clean.

    The above experiment will give a pressure of 171 atmospheres.

    Another apparatus was then constructed, having a capacity of -j^jths of a cubic inch.
   I will not occupy the time with any detailed account of experiments which have now

occupied me some years, as after an accident I have often been detained for months
before I could obtain another apparatus, but I will briefly describe two which may be

interesting to this Section of the Association.
    In the first, after 110 inches had been evolved in the voltameter, I opened the

valve of the apparatus, and collected the same quantUy which had been under pres-
            TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                             41

sure ; the capacity of this vessel being -j^ths of a cubic inch, gives a pressure equal to

275 atmospheres.
   In the second experiment an explosion took place when 179 cubic inches had been

evolved by the voltameter; the concussion was so loud that a friend who was in the
laboratory likened it to the report of a company of soldiers firing with blank cartridge.
The leather (placed between two portions of the apparatus to ensure insulation) was

forced out with such strength as to pass through the hat myof assistant, who was about

4 feet from the apparatus.
    In this instance, presuming that the whole quantity of gases as evolved in volta-

meter had also been evolved in apparatus, we obtain the enormous pressure of 447Д

atmospheres.

   In one experiment we have an undoubted pressure of 275, and in the other a cal-
culated pressure of 447 atmospheres, at which water is electrolysed and conducts with-
out apparently offering any extra resistance to the current, for during the whole of
these experiments the needle of the galvanometer remained steadily deflected.

           On the Corrosion of Iron-built Ships by Sugar Cargoes.
                By John Hall Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

The author stated that his attention had been drawn by his brother, Mr. George

Gladstone, to the fact that the owners of iron-built vessels object to sugar cargoes, on

account of the rusting of the metal by the saccharine juices that exude from the casks;

and this had led to a chemical examination of the reaction then instituted. It was

found that when pieces of iron were placed in bottles containing a solution of cane-

sugar, the metal at the edge of the liquid soon became deeply corroded, but that

which was permanently immersed in the fluid remained bright for a considerable

time. The solution soon gave indications of the presence of protoxide of iron, which

absorbing oxygen from the atmosphere was speedily thrown down as the red sesqui-

oxide, leaving the sugar free to dissolve a fresh quantity of iron, the precipitated

oxide in the mean time forming a deposit. After eighteen months, the liquid was of

a deep red-brown colour; it became pale blue with ferrocyanide of potassium, black

with sulphuret of ammonium ; alkalies produced no precipitate ; nitric acid peroxi-

Adized it.  portion dried and analysed gave 2078 parts of metallic oxide to 100 of

combined sugar, which is almost exactly in the proportion expressed by the formula

Cjj Hji Oji, FeO. The author, however, considered that this might differ from the
true composition by an equivalent of water. No such iron compound could be

formed by direct combination. In vain was it attempted to dissolve any freshly-

precipitated and well-washed oxide of iron in a solution of sugar; and almost equally

unsuccessful was the attempt to do so when the oxide was liberated by means of

potash in the presence of sugar itself. It was found that under all circumstances of

dilution or quality of the sugar solution, iron was attacked ; the presence of zinc in

contact with the iron did not prevent its being acted upon ; nor was there any marked
difference when the salts of sea-water, or the nitrates, sulphates, or chlorides of the

alkalies were added to the solution. No other ordinary metal was found to be so

easily acted upon as iron. Copper was very little affected by the sugar. Lead was

slowly attacked, indications of the presence of its oxide in solution being obtained

after three days' exposure. Tin appeared to give the binoxide. Zinc was little
aftected when alone ; it seemed to be dissolved more quickly when in contact with

iron.  It  is doubtful  whether  mercury  was  touched  by the  sugar  solution                                       silver
                                                                                                                   ;

certainly was not. The author regretted that his experiments did not suggest any

method by which the corrosion of iron ships by sugar cargoes might be prevented.
They showed rather the strong disposition to combine that there is between the two
substances; and how a small quantity of sugar may eat continuously into a large
sheet of iron. The attention of chemists was especially drawn to the fact that the
iron enters into combination with the organic matter, not when it has already been
oxidized, but only when in a metallic condition, rendering the action, as would be
imagined, more complicated.

              On the Spontaneous Decomposition of Xyhidine.

                   By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

This was a description of the changes that had taken place in a specimen of xyloi^
--42 REPORT 1853.

dine, made by treating arrow-root with nitric acid of specific gravity 1-5. After re-

maining about six years unaltered, this specimen suddenly began to give off gases,

and in a few weeks' time nothing remained of the original xyloidine, but in its place

a light brown viscid liquid.

After describing the various chemical substances of which this decomposed mass

Weconsisted, the author proceeds, "  may suppose that the decomposition of this

sample of starch xyloidine has taken place in somewhat of the following manner :

some of the peroxide of nitrogen has split up into nitric oxide and nitric acid, whilst

a small portion of the nitrogen has combined, as might be expected, with some of the

hydrogen of the compound to form ammonia, and a larger quantity has combined

with carbon and hydrogen to form prussic acid. During this process oxygen must

have escaped as such, or combining with carbon have passed off as carbonic acid, or

it may have been consumed in the formation of the slightly acid principle which has

been described as found in considerable quantity among the resulting solids.
   " Whether the ammonia and the nitrous fumes have reacted upon one another

with the formation of nitrogen gas and water, I know not.
   " The separation of so much carbon in the form of cyanogen must be looked upon as

the principal cause of so much water being produced, for the viscid mass is essentially

Aa strong aqueous solution of the organized bodies. very large portion of the starch,
freed from its combined nitric acid, has remained in a gummy condition, perhaps as

dextrine, though it was certainly not of the variety colourable by iodine ; whilst the

change had advanced further with another portion, and it was converted into sugar.

These substances, with traces of a bitter principle, and of a singular odoriferous sub-

stance, were the only products of decomposition, at least as far as I could detect."

              On the Conduction of Electricity hv Flame and Gases.

                   By W. R. Grove, M.A., Ph.D., F.R.S.
  A somewhat extended series of researches has been recently carried out by

M. Edmond Becquerel with a view to determine the conducting power of flame and
of hot ail'. These investigations have led M. E. Becquerel to conceive that he has
proved the conducting power of both for electricity. The apparatus employed was a

platinum tube, with the conducting wire passing through it. Mr. Grove has adopted

a somewhat different arrangement. This consisted of a glass tube, with two copper
wires inserted through corks at either end ; from these within the tube proceeded a

piece of platinum wire, which, by connexion with the battery, could be brought to a

state of intense ignition. In this state these were adjusted at the distance of -^'jjth

of an inch apart, and then connected with the powerful voltaic combination of
Mr. Gassiot. Notwithstanding the proximity of the wires, no trace of electricity
could be detected as passing through the interposed stratum of heated air. Mr. Grove
inclined to the opinion, that the effect described by M. Becquerel was more analogous
to the disruptive discharge than to conduction, as it was stated not to take place until
the solid bodies arrived at red heat, and then to be increased by attenuating the gases,
though at temperatures below that point ; no degree of rarefaction allowed any elec-

tricity to be transmitted.

                     Note on the Formation of Magnesian Limestone.

                By Professor Johnston, M.A., F.R.S. L.^ E.

   The author produced specimens of magnesian limestone formed by deposition from
a spring near the village of Neesham upon the northern banks of the Tees. This

limestone possessed the colour, general appearance and porous structure of the lime-
stones of the county of Durham, and contained as much magnesia as some of the
purer beds of magnesian limestone in tliat county. From the production of this
limestone he reasoned as to the deposition of dolomitic limestones in general, and the
relative probability of the two theories which ascribe their magnesia to the impreg-
nation of previously existing limestones, either by sublimation from beneath, or by

percolation from above. He considered both agencies inadmissible as general causes,

and was favoiu'able to the view that as a general rule magnesian limestones were de-

rocks by percolation was by no means unlikely.

             On the Properties and Composition of the Cocoa Leaves.

                By Professor Johnston, M.A., F.R.S. L8fE.

    After describing the remarkable physiological properties of the leaves of this plant,
the author explained that they yield to aether a peculiar volatile resinous substance
possessed of a powerful odour, in which the peculiar virtues of the leaf are supposed
to reside. The plant is as jet to be obtained in too small quantity in this country to
admit of a complete chemical examination of the substances which the leaves contain.

         On the Causes, Physical and Chemical, of Diversities of Soils.

               By Professor Johnston, M.A., F.R.S. L. 8f E.

    In this paper, the author, assuming as a general rule that the materials of which
soils are composed are derived from the rocks on which they rest, and that therefore
the agricultural is very materially dependent upon the geological character of a
country, showed how physical and chemical influences subsequently interfered almost
everywhere materially to modify the agricultural indications of geology.

   I. Among physical influences, he showed
   How1. the flatness of a country and the absence of outfalls causes the rain-water

to stagnate, covers it with bogs, and obliterates the agricultiu-al influence of the rocks

beneath.

   How2. high and sloping lands yield their finer particles to the rains which fall

upon them, to be borne down to lower levels. Thus the granites yield their felspar
and the red sand their fine marls, and thus from the debris of the same rock, often

extending over large areas, regions of very different soils are established.

   How3. along the line of ancient or existing water-courses, a ribbon of varying

breadth is found in every country, upon which the soils consist of these fine matters
separated and sorted by the action of water, and possessing agricultural characters
more or less different from those which naturally belong to the geological formations

on which they rest. And these differences become the more marked along the courses

of great rivers, or of such as descend from great distances, and flow through various
geological formations, of which they wash out, bear away, and intermingle ihe debris.

   How4. along the shores of the sea, successive elevations of the sea establish upon

the same geological formation belts of sand, very unlike in agricultural value.

   These remarks were illustrated by an agricultural map of New Brunswick ; and the

conclusion the author endeavoured to establish was, that the physical geography, the
hydrography, and periods of elevation of a country were scarcely less important than

its geological structure in determining the agricultural value of its surface.

   II. Among important chemical influences, the author mentioned as of much weight
    1. The production of acid matters in the soil wherever vegetation existed. Such

acid matters are constantly produced wherever vegetable substances undergo decay
in the surface soil, and sometimes in such quantity as to render the soil sour to test
paper. These acids are washed downwards by the rains which sink into the soil. As

--they descend, they dissolve out of the soil such earthy substances lime, alumina, oxide
--of iron, &c. as they are capable of taking up, and these they bear away with them

in a fluid form wherever they flow. Thus they gradually establish differences, both
chemical and physical, between the upper and under portions of the drift or rocky
debris from which the soils are formed, and at last render the uppermost layers in
which the plants grow, totally different in its agricultural character from that which
belongs to the original unaltered materials themselves. Hence the thin non-calcareous

--soils which cover the chalk and other limestone format ions the constantly recurring
--necessity for the re-addition of lime to cultivated land the benefits from bringing up

new soil from beneath, and of many other agricultural practices.
    2. The firing of the forests in new countries, where hot summers scorch vegetation

and raging fires spread their devastations sometimes over thousands of square miles.
 Such fires are almost invariably attended by sti'ong winds, which bear away the ashes
 of the burning wood to immense distances. Thus in a single day all that the trees
 have been extracting from the soil during a whole half-century is swept away ; even
 the surface soil itseu is sometimes scorched and swept bare. After a time a new
--44 REPORT 1853.

vegetation springs up to suffer the same fate ; it may be in another half-century, and
thus a constant chemical robbing and exhaustion of the soil takes place. Thus bar-
renness at last overspreads regions which are naturally fertile, and which rest upon rocks,
the debris of which naturally yield the materials of a rich agricultural surface. Such
results of burning are often observed in North America, and the author advanced the
fact as one of personal observation which he had been led thus chemically to explain.

 --The general conclusion to which the author arrived was this, that while the geo-

logy of a country has certain broad and undoubted direct relations to its agricultural
value, yet when we follow the subject into detail, these relations become more and
more indirect ; other influences, cjiemical and physical, come into play and assume
the character of leading agencies, and as we investigate them more and more closely,
we almost seem to lose sight of geology altogether.

   Description of some new kinds of Galvanic Batteries, invented by

                                 M. KuKLA of Vienna.

   The combination used in one of these is antimony, or some of its alloys, for a nega-
tive plate, with nitric acid of specific gravity r4 in contact with it, and unamalga-
mated zinc for a positive plate, with a saturated solution of common salt in contact

with it. A small quantity of finely powdered peroxide of manganese is put into the

nitric acid, which is said to increase the constancy of the battery.

   The alloys of antimony which M. Kukla has experimented with successfully are

the following :
                                         Phosphorus and antimony.

                                     Chromium and antimony.
                                         Arsenic and antimony.
                                          Boron and antimony.
    These are in the order of their negative character, phosphorus and antimony being
the most negative. Antimony itself is less negative than any of these alloys. The
alloys are made in the proportions of the atomic weights of the substances.
   All these arrangements are said by M. Kukla to be more powerful than when
platinum or carbon is substituted for antimony or its alloys.
    In this battery a gutta percha bell cover is used over the antimony, and resting on
a flat ring floating on the top of the zinc solution, this eflfectually prevents any smell,
and keeps the peroxide of nitrogen in contact with the nitric acid solution.
   When a battery of twenty-four cells was used, M. Kukla found that in the third and
twenty-first cells, pure ammonia in solution was the ultimate result of the action of

the battery, but only water in all the others.
   This experiment was tried repeatedly, and always with the same result.

  A battery was put into action for twenty-four hours ; at the end of that time the

nitric acid had lost j^ths of an ounce of oxygen and \t)x of an ounce of zinc was con-

sumed. Now as one quarter of an ounce of zinc requires only 0*06 of an ounce of

oxygen to form oxide of zinc, M. Kukla draws the conclusion that the rest of the
oxygen is converted directly into electricity, and this view he says is confirmed by the
large amount of electricity given out by the battery in proportion to the zinc con-
sumed in a given time ; in the above battery each zinc plate had a surface of 40 square

inches.

   The addition of peroxide of manganese does not increase the efiect of the battery, but
it makes it more lasting ; the peroxide of nitrogen formed in the bell cover taking
one atom of oxygen from the peroxide of mnnganese. This is evident from only the
oxide of manganese being found in the battery after a time. In the salt solution no
other alteration takes place than what is caused by the oxide of zinc remaining in a

partly dissolved state in the solution.

   For this battery M. Kukla much prefers porous cells, or diaphragms of biscuit
ware, as less liable to break, and being more homogeneous in their material than any

other kind.
    This battery is very cheap, antimony being only 5d. per lb. wholesale, and the zinc

not requiring amalgamation.

   The second arrangement tried by M. Kukla was antimony, and amalgamated zinc

with only one exciting solution, viz. concentrated sulphuric acid. This battery has
great heating power, and the former great magnetizing power ; it however rapidly

decreases in power, and is not so practically useful as the double fluid battery, which

will last about the same power for fourteen days, when the poles are only occasionally

connected as in electric telegraphs ; certain peculiarities respecting the ratio of inten-

sity to quantity when a series of cells is used, have been observed, which differ from

those remarked in other batteries.

M. Kukla, on directing his attention to the best means of making a small portable

battery for physiological purposes, has found very small and flat Cruikshank batteries,

excited by weak phosphoric acid (1 of glacial phosphoric acid to 20 of water), to

be the best; phosphoric acid being very deliquescent, and forming with the zinc,

Aduring the galvanic action, an acid phosphate of zinc.                  battery of this description

does not decrease in power very materially until it has been three hours in action.

On Changes observed in Wood from the Submerged Forest at Wawne in
                  Holderness. By T. J. Pears all, F.C.S.

"While the agricultural drainage was cutting, the remains of a forest was found,

principally consisting of gigantic pines. Sections of the timber having been obtained

for the Hull Philosophical Society, they were carefully piled away ; some days after-

wards they were found giving a peculiarly penetrating and setherial odour, showing

that  some  great changes were  taking  place                            after they were  separated  from  each

  On Crystals from the Sea-coast of Africa, By T. J. Pears all, F.C.S.

   The crystals here shown were obtained by Capt. Mitchell of the Merchant Ship
и Frankfield,' while searching the coast of Africa between Saldanah Bay and the island
of Ichaboe for guano deposits.

   The crystals are of carbonate of lime, enclosing sand; 15 to 20 per cent, sand are
obtained from some specimens.

   The crystals are very hard and have sharp cutting edges, so as to make it a painful
task to walk upon them. The beach was covered with crystals to the extent of miles
about three miles was walked over, but it seemed as far as the eye could reach, and
was half to one mile in breadth. Some of the specimens are from 4 to 5 inches in
length, showing a thickness of half an inch, and from 2 to 3 inches across the plane;
the report given was that some of the crystals protruded up from the sand so far as
to wound the ankles and legs without great care in walking over.

   Some crystals seem to be opake, with the sand enclosed, except at the edges ; 15 to
20 per cent, of sand is obtained from portions of crystals; carbonates of lime and
magnesia with small quantities of saline matter. Common salt principally can be
obtained by breaking them up in distilled water. They are extremely soluble in

diluted nitric acid.

    Mineralogists and chemists are perfectly well aware of the stony substance called
'Fontainbleu Sandstone,' where the sandstone is found having forms of crystals of
carbonate of lime ; these crystals now exhibited show the fact of sand of the beach en-
closed without altering the general form, and also that the crystal has at its base
adapted itself to the sand and other crystals.

   These specimens show the great facility on that coast of producing mineralized
crystals, and also suggests the opportunities constantly offered to intelhgent mer-
chant seamen, of bringing home specimens of great interest which are uncommon in

most parts of the world, except in some places, where they may visit, and where there
may be abundance.

On Lime Flowers, or peculiarly formed Substances from the brickwork of one

   of the Reservoirs of the Hull Water-works before final completion for use.

   These strange productions were found on one side of a reservoir, neither at the
 46 REPORT--1853.

 end nor on the other sides; the brickwork with the mortar and cement had not pro-
 (lerly set, and when the first quantity of water let into the reservoir was withdrawn,
 these substances were found upright on the brick slope; they consisted of irregular
 tubes terminated by a sort of expansion or bulb. They stood erect in many cases,
 from the joints of the brickwork having strange shapes ; but some closely resembled
 tulips, the tube having a sort of bulb about the size of a small egg ; some of the tubes
 were found prostrate, that showed they had attained the altitude of 14 to 18 inches.
 They were all of a gray-white colour, of a rough exterior; inside the tubes and
 bulbs they were much whiter, and the substance appeared in concentric layers; they
 were formed, it was supposed, from the soft mortar, by the pressure of the water and
 filtration of fluids and air tlirough (he side, as on that part of the reservoir the whole
 excavated earth had been thrown up more than 20 feet above the surface of the water

 in the reservoir.
     These substances at their base showed the tubular portions attached to the brick-

 work, the mortar, and the cement ; they dissolved readily with effervescence in diluted

  nitric acid.

     These substances were not observed until the water had been withdrawn, they
 were then found in parallel lines to an extent of 150 to 200 feet, and so numerous
 that a small cart might have been filled with these brittle exudations. However much
 the pressure of water and the passage of air and gases might have in some way contri-
 buted to these forms, one learned naturalist had considered it probable that some species
 of Flustra might have lent its assistance to some of the shapes. Mr. Pearsall stated
 he had not heard of similar formations.

 On the Employment of Pentasulphate of Calcium as a Means of preventing
   and destroying the Oidium Tuckeri, or Grape Disease. By Astley
    Paston Price, Ph.D., F.C.S.

    Of those substances which have been employed to arrest the devastating effect* of
this disease, none appear to have been so pre-eminently successful as sulphur, whether
employed as powdered or flowers of sulphur, or by sublimation in houses so affected.
But notwithstanding the several methods described for its application to the vines, I
am not aware that any has, or had, appeared prior to 1851, when these experiments
were instituted, by which sulphur might be uniformly distributed over, and become to

a certain extent firmly attached to the vines.
    Three houses, situated at Margate in Rent, in the vicinity of the one in which

the disease first made its appearance in England, having been for five consecutive
years infected with the disease, and notwithstanding the employment of sulphur as
flowers of sulphur, no abatement in its ravages could be detected, I was induced to
employ a solution of pentasulphide of calcium, a diluted solution of which, having been
found to act in no way injuriously to the young and delicate shoots of several plants,
was applied to the vines ; the object in view being that the pentasulphide should be de-
composed by carbonic acid, and that 4 atoms of sulphur, together with the carbonate
of lime formed, should be deposited in a uniform and durable covering on the stems
and branches of the vines affected. Although but few applications were made, the
stems became coated with a protective deposit of sulphur, and the disease gradually
but effectively disappeared, insomuch that the houses have been, and now are, entirely
free from any disease or symptoms of infection.

   The young shoots are in no way affected by its application, and the older wood

covered with the deposited sulphur continues exceedingly healthy.

   The specimens exhibited to illustrate the durability and pi-otective influence of the
deposited sulphur were from vines which in the autmnn of 1851 were covered with the
disease, but which since the autumn of 1852 have received no further treatment.

   The vines in the immediate neighbourhood, and adjoining one of the houses, are
covered with the disease, but, notwithstanding their close proximity, no indication of
the disease has at present been detected in either of the three houses.

  A solution of pentasulphide of calcium is prepared by boiling 30 parts by weight of

caustic lime with 80 parts by weight of flowers of sulphur, suspended in a sufficient
quantity of water ; heat is applied until the solution has acquired a dark red colour,
and the excess of sulphur ceases to dissolve. The clear solution is drawn off, and after

12 to 20 times its volume of water previous to being employed.

On a Neto Method for determining the Commercial Value of Oxide of
          Manganese. By Astley Paston Price, Ph.D., F.C.S.

   It is well known that several methods have been described for determining the
commercial value of oxide of manganese, that is to say, for estimating the amount of
available chlorine capable of being obtained from a given sample of manganese.

   There are, however, certain practical inconveniences attendant on the employment
of many of these processes, most of them demanding an amount of time and manipu-
lation which it is most desirable to obviate.

   The method I have for some time employed, and which I have found to give accu-
rate results, is based on the conversion of ai'senious into arsenic acid by means of
chlorine, and the transformation of arsenious into arsenic acid by the employment of
a solution of hypermanganate of potash.

   The specimen of manganese under examination is dissolved in a normal hydro-
chloric acid solution of arsenious acid ; and the arsenious acid remaining unchanged
into arsenic acid is determined by a standard solution of hypermanganate of potash.
In employing a solvent containing a reducing agent, it will be found that the solution
of the oxides of manganese is materially facilitated, and may be effected at a low

temperature in a very short space of time.

  --In adopting this method, some difficulties presented themselves :

   On dissolving arsenious acid in hydrochloric acid, terchloride of arsenic is given

ofi^ and it becomes difficult to obtain a correct normal solution. This difficulty is
avoided by dissolving the arsenious acid in a solution of caustic potash, and then

adding the alkaline solution to an excess of hydrochloric acid.
    Another difficulty occurred in effecting the solution of the oxide of manganese in

the ai-senical solution, as in proportion to the elevation of temperature does the loss
of terchloride of arsenic increase. This source of error is prevented by employing a
dilute acid solution of arsenious acid, and adapting one of Will's nitrogen bulbs, con-
taining a solution of potash, to the flask in which the oxide of manganese is dissolved.

Any terchloride of arsenic which may pass over is there effectually retained, provided
solution be effected at a low temperature. The normal solution of arsenious acid is
made by dissolving 113'.53 grs. of arsenious acid, corresponding to 100 grs. of per-

oxide of manganese, in a solution of potash, and then adding hydrochloric acid until

the solution occupies 100 measures.

  A standard solution of hypermanganate of potash is obtained by diluting, for

example, .5 measures of the normal solution of arsenious acid, corresponding to 5 grs,
of peroxide of manganese, and then determining the number of measures of the solu-
tion of hypermanganate of potash that are required to transform the arsenious acid

therein contained into arsenic acid.

    These two solutions being obtained, an estimation of the value of a specimen of

oxide of manganese may be expeditiously and accurately made.
   Ten, or any number of grains of the specimen under examination, are placed in a

small flask, to which 10 or more measures of the normal arsenical solution are added,
and to the flask is adapted one of Will's nitrogen apparatus, containing a solution of
potash. The flask is then placed in a water-bath, or a gentle heat is applied until
solution is effected. The contents of the flask, after having been allowed to cool, are,

together with the solution of potash, transferred to a larger flask, and diluted with
water. The amount of arsenious acid remaining unchanged is then determined by the
addition of the standard solution of hypermanganate of potash, and the quantity thus
indicated being deducted from the number of grains of arsenious acid employed in the
first instance, will give the value of the specimen submitted to analysis.

    In order to obtain correct results by this method, it is of course necessary that the
hydrochloric acid and the potash employed should be free from sulphurous or nitric
acid, or any other reducing or oxidizing impurities.

On a New Method for determining the Amount of available Chlorine con-
  tained in Hypochlorites of Lime, Soda or Potash. By Astley Paston

   Price, Ph.D., F.C.S.

Numerous as have been the methods proposed for determining the available amount

of chlorine in bleaching powder and other hypochlorites, there is not one that I am

acquainted with by which correct and expeditious determinations can be made. The

following method is based on the known reactions of hypochlorites of lime, potash or

soda, and hypermanganate of potash, on arsenious acid, the former of which reactions

has, as is well known, been frequently proposed as the principle of many ingenious

chlorimetric processes. The application of hypermanganate of potash to the estima-

tion of iron and other substances having been attended with such good practical results,

I am led to anticipate that the extension of its application to the estimation of chlorine,
in the manner hereafter described, may tend to simplify the manipulations, and curtail

the time now requisite for determining the commercial value of the hypochlorites in

the several conditions in which they are met with and employed in the arts. The first

point to be attained, in the correct estimation of bleaching powder, is to effect complete

solution without endangering a loss of available chloi'ine. This may be effected by

weighing a given quantity of the specimen under examination into a large flask, and

adding a normal solution of arsenite of potash or soda in such quantity that an excess

be always present, and after dilution with water, gradually pouring in during agitation

Aan excess of hydrochloric acid.  normal solution of arsenious acid is obtained by

dissolving 139-63 grs. of arsenious acid, corresponding to 100 grs. of chlorine, in a so-

lution of potash or soda, and diluting the solution with water to 1000 measures. If

50 measures of this normal solution be measured into a flask, and after dilution with

water be acidified with hydrochloric acid, and to it be carefully added from a graduated

burette a solution of hypermanganate of potash until the solution acquires a decided

pink colour, the value of the solution of hypermanganate of potash will be obtained,

as the number of measures employed will correspond to 5 grs. of chlorine. Having

obtained a normal solution of arsenious acid and a standard solution of hypermanga-

nate of potash, the commercial value of the hypochlorites of lime, potash or soda may

be most easily determined. 100 grs. of the bleaching powder under examination are

placed in a flask graduated to 1000 measures; 500 measures of the normal solution

of arsenious acid are then added, and after dilution with water hydrochloric acid is
gradually poured in until a slight excess has been employed. The solution is then
made up to 1000 measures. If 100 measures of this solution be now transferred into

a large flask, and after dilution with water, a standard solution of hypermanganate of

potash be gradually added from a burette until the solution assumes a distinct colora-

tion, the number of measures employed will indicate the amcmt of arsenious acid re-

maining unchanged into arsenic acid, which quantity being deducted from the amount

of arsenious acid originally employed will give the proportion of available chlorine
contained in the sample of bleaching powder. Thus supposing that 10 grs. of bleach-

ing powder had been employed, and that 50 measures of the normal solution of arse-
nious acid, corresponding to 5 grs. of chlorine, had been added, and that 30 measures

of the standai-d solution of hypermanganate of potash, corresponding to 3 grs. of chlo-

rine, had been necessary to transform the excess of arsenious into arsenic acid, then

the 10 grs. of bleaching powder would have contained 2 grs. of chlorine, or the value

of the specimen would be 20 per cent.

   Instead of employing 1 00 grs. of bleaching powder, and proceeding as before men-

--tioned, any number of grains may be taken, 30 grs. I have found to be a very con-
--venient quantity, which being placed in a flask, a known quantity of the normal

solution of arsenious acid is added, and after dilution with water, a clear solution is
obtained by the addition of hydrochloric acid. To this a standard solution of hyper-
manganate of potash is added, and from the number of measures employed the value
of the sample under examination is determined. With a small amount of practice,
the estimations may be made in a very expeditious manner, and the results obtained

I have hitherto found to be most satisfactory.
    In the estimation of the commercial value of the hypochlorites of potash or soda,

the amount of available chlorine will be indicated in the same manner, and with the
same degree of accuracy, as the determination of the value of bleaching powder.

             On the Chemical Constitution of the Humher Deposits.
                             By J. D. SoLLiTT, Hull.

  By far the largest constituent part of the Humber mud is an exceedingly fine sand,

the particles of which are so minute as almost to float in water, and being of
such a quality as to render the whole perfectly unstable and liable to be moved about

by the slightest motion of the water ; many of the particles of this sand, when examined
by a powerful microscope, appear to have their corners worn down by the attrition of

one particle against another so as to be reduced to nearly a globular form, and great
numbers of those particles are so small as not to be more in diameter than a fourth part

of that of a globule of human blood, or about jj^dth part of an inch : hence the sand

which forms about 75 per cent, of the Humber deposit is, so far as relates to its particles,
almost in the condition of a fluid easily displaced and driven about by every tide, both
when it rises and when it falls. The author stated that in a gallon of water taken from,
the Humber when the water was agitated by the tide either running up or down, there
were from 315 to 320 grs. of this above-named fine deposit, and that it was so exceed-

ingly fine, as not all to have settled at the end of ten hours from the taking of the
water from the river.

   The first sample of the deposit, of which is given the analysis, was taken about
eight miles above Hull, namely, at

                                                        Brough,

  This sample contained no carbonate of magnesia. Mud taken three or four miles
below Grimsby, is nearly all sand, and of a much coarser kind. In some places it

is a mixture of the coarse sand with a little of the finer deposit of the Humber, which
is found at all the places higher up the river.

On the Comparative Richness of Auriferous Quartz extracted at different
               Depthsfrom the same Lode. By Dr. J. Blake.

The writer stated that no shaft had yet been made in California deep enough to

test the correctness of the opinion that auriferous lodes diminish in value as they

Adescend, but he described a circumstance which seemed to confirm that view.

horizontal mass of auriferous quartz was discovered in Grass Valley, which measured
60 yards by 45, and was from 6 to 18 inches thick ; in the centre it was depressed
10 yards below the surface, its edges cropping out all round. Everj' part of this
mass had been removed, and was found to contain 1 oz. or 1^ oz. of gold to the

ton ; some part was extremely rich, affording 60 oz. to the ton. No continuation

of this quartz vein could be found in the valley or surrounding hills, but at some
distance above a similar vein occurred in which the proportion of gold was much
smaller. In another locality a more than average amount of gold had been obtained
from a lode which appeared to have been the upper part of a vein. The writer had
never heard of ' nuggets ' being found in mining operations.

   The cornbrash frequently abounds in fossils ; out of sixty-five species collected
more than half were bivalve shells. The author expressed his opinion that certain
oolitic Terebratulse (viz. T. digona, obovata, lagenalis, ornithocephala) should be con-
sidered as forming only one species, at the same time admitting that these form?
characterized particular strata and localities. He also pointed out that nearly half
the bivalves, and six out of eight sea-urchins, were identical with species found also

in the inferior oolite, but not in the intervening great oolite.

Notice of the curious Spiral Body in certain Fossil Sponges, and of several

   other remarkable Fossils from the Yorhshire Strata. By E. Charles-

   worth, F.G.S.

    Mr. Charlesworth exhibited a diagram of a specimen of Choanites Kmigi,
described by Mr. Cunnington at a former meeting of the British Association, and
stated that he had formerly doubted the correctness of Mr. Cunnington's account,
but now agreed with him that the spiral body was an essential part of the sponge.
The remarkable fossils were an Inoceramus from the chalk, and a coprolitic-lpoking
substance from the lias.

    During the last year, in a brick-field near Leeds, have been discovered the remains

of the Hippopotamus. From the specimens already placed in the Museum of tha

Leeds Philosophical Society, it appears that the bones have belonged to not less

than three individuals. Of these, two were adults, but of different size, their molars
being considerably worn. The youthful condition of the third is shown by the
canine teeth being perfectly smooth and pointed, and by the apophyses having
separated from the metacarpals and vertebrae.

   These remains were found at a depth of 9 feet in a bed of clay, and 20 feet above
the present bed of the river. This bed of clay, along with sand and gravel, which at
distances of even a few yards pass and repass into each other, constitute an extensive
flat deposit in the lower valley of the Aire, commencing a little above Leeds, and
extending along the valley of the Aire, varying in breadth from one to three miles,
until it becomes continuous with a similar deposit in the valley of the Calder.

Pursuing the course of the Aire further towards the sea, we find the plain which the

river traverses becoming wider, and at length continuous with the flat district of th^
lower part of the Ouse, and of the Trent, and of the other tributaries of tha
Humber.

   At Leeds this flat valley formation rests upon the outbreak of the coal measures.
It consists of clay, sand, and gravel, irregularly deposited under the varied in-
fluence of currents and eddies, and forming in the neighbourhood of Leeds a deposit
averaging from 10 to 20 feet in thickness. The gravel is chiefly formed of millstone-
grit and other sandstones, with occasional portions of mountain limestone, from th╗
strata traversed by the river in the upper part of its course.

   Along with the remains of Hippopotamus have been found in this valley deposit, the
bones of the Elephant, of two bovine animals, apparently the Bos latifrons and

                                                                                               4*

fir, and others, and hazel-nuts.

On a Chemical Cause of Change in the Composition of Rocks.
       By Professor Johnston, M.A., F.R.S. L. ^ E.

   Tlie first example of a chemically altered rock adduced by the Professor, was the
rottenstone of Derbyshire, a light and porous substance used chiefly for polishing
metals, and stated in Phillips's ' Minei*alogy ' to be composed of silica, alumina, and
carbon. It is obtained from a ridge known as the Great Fin, on the right-hand side
of the road from Bakewell to Buxton. This ridge is covered with "drift" 10 or 20
feet thick, consisting of brown clay, with fragments of black marble, chert, and rotten-
stone. The rottenstone is so soft wliilst in the soil that the spade goes through it
readily, but it hardens on exposure ; the holes from which it is dug are sometimes

only 2 feet deep, at others from G to 8 feet. On examining a series of specimens, Pro-

fessor Johnston found that whilst some were homogeneous, others had a nucleus of
black marble; he then treated specimens of the black marble with weak acid, and
found that on the removal of the carbonate of lime, there remained from 30 to 35 per

cent, of a siliceous substance perfectly like the natural rottenstone. He concluded

that there existed in the soil some acid which penetrated it and dissolved out the cal-
careous matter of the rocks below. The agent in this case might be said to be the
carbonic acid of the air brought down by rain ; but there were instances not capable
of explanation by this agency alone, and attributable to other acids, which are con-
stantly being produced luider certain conditions and exercise a much wider influence.
The acids he alluded to were those which are produced naturally and everywhere by
the decay of vegetable matter. The bottoms of peat bogs present verj' strong evidence
of the action of acids; the stone and clay are bleached and corroded, only siliceous
and colourless materials being left. The source of the acid is here the same as in the
former instance ; the vegetable matter growing on the surface produces in its decay
acid substances which exert a chemical action on the subsoil, and escape by subterra-
nean outlets, cai'rying away the materials dissolved in their progress. Another instance
was aflPorded by the mineral Pigotite, formed in the caves of Cornwall by water dripping
from the roof; this water contains a peculiar organic acid, derived from the soil of the
moors, which dissolves the alumina of the granite and combines with it. The organic
acids are very numerous and differ in composition, but agree in producing chemical
action upon rocks. They are produced over the entire surface of the earth, especially
over uncultivated tracts, and are among the means pi'ovided by nature to dissolve the
mineral food of plants; they are also amongst the chief causes of the exhaustion of

--soils. The author then alluded to Professor Way's examination of some of the green-

sand strata of Surre}', known as firestone, a light and porous rock, containing
silica in a soluble state. It was well known that common sandstone, quartz, or rock
crystal were not acted upon by potash or soda at ordinary temperatures ; but of the
firestone 30 per cent., and sometimes .50 or 70 per cent., may be dissolved. In all
such cases the silica must have been originally in a state of chemical combination
with lime, alumina, or something else, which has been subsequently removed. The
silica in the rottenstone was soluble, but he had never met with instances of black
marble in a bedded state converted into rottenstone. He believed, however, that a
similar cause, operating over a wide area, and during a long period, had produced the

altered condition of the firestone. Professor Johnston then alluded to the nodules of
phosphate of lime in the greensand and crag, and suggested that the phosphorus had
been derived from animal remains in higher strata, dissolved out by acids, and re-
deposited at a lower level. The last example was the Jireclay of the coal-measures,
8 stratum almost imiversally found beneath beds of coal. It differs from the other
clays both in colour and composition, being whiter, and containing less of those sub-
stances which acid bodies could dissolve, viz. the earthy bases, which would render
the clay fusible in fire ; the condition of the fireclay might be accounted for by the

action of acids developed during the production of the vegetable matter now forming

coal.

        On the Waste of the Holderness Coast. By George G. Kemp.

   The writer computed the actual waste on this coast at from 1^ to 4 yards per an-
num, the amount varying with the conditions of the shore and the direction of the
currents. The average loss of land amounted to 33 acres annually ; whilst the de-
struction of public and private roads, houses, and churches, was not less injurious.
The causes of the waste are, the action of frost and rain producing falls of the cliff,
and the agency of the sea in removing the beach and making hollows at the base of the
cliffs. To these was added another, viz. the removal of the shingle for ballast, mend-
ing roads, paving streets, building walls, and a variety of other purposes. At Horn-
sea, 500 tons of beach had been removed in a week, and near Spurn Point 1000 tons
had been taken in a day. The floor of the beach was thus lowered, and the natural

defence of the coast removed. Mr. Kemp urgently recommended that a grant

should be obtained from Government to repair the breaches which the sea had made,
and that the removal of the shingle should be absolutely prohibited.

[Mr. Kemp has, since the Meeting, added to his paper the following series of Mea-

   surements taken along the line of the Holderness coast, from Spurn Point, and
   continued to Flamborough Head, of objects from the nearest point of the cliff.

On the most Remarkable Cases of Unconformity among the Strata of York-
                     shire. By Professor Phillips, F.R.S.

On the Dispersion of Erratic Rocks at higfter Levels than their Parent Rock
                in Yorkshire. By Professor Phillips, F.R.S.

   The Professor stated that in a comparatively uiodern geological period, every part
of Yorkshire, below the level of 1500 feet, was covered by the waters of a glacial
sea. icebergs appear to have floated over the whole of this district, depositing
where thev melted, or were overturned, the materials brought from the higher hills,
which at that time were partly covered by glaciers. Amongst these were blocks of
stone from Cumberland and the North Riding, now found perched on the limestone
hills. Some of them must have come over the Pass of Stainmoor, a height of 1440

Afeet, and been thence radiated over all the eastern parts of Yorkshire. remarkable

case of local distribution occurred in the country of Ribblesdale, where in several
places, as on Feizer and Giggleswick Scar, the blocks of ' Horton Flag ' (Carabro-
Silurian) were found perched on broad surfaces of limestone resting on these flags.

On the east side of Ribble, above Langcliffe and Settle, there were large blocks near

the summit, 150 or 200 feet above the level of the rock from which they were
derived. At Long Scar, blocks of limestone lay on the hills immediately over their
source. These erratic blocks were not much water-worn, and must have been trans-

ported by ice ; no violent rush of water would have accomplished it. He believed
the glacial movement to have been one of Continental elevation and depression, occu-

toying a long period of time, and that the assigned depression of 1500 feet affected
the land far up towards the north, and to the east and west, but ceased, or grew
knuch less, towards the south.

On a new Plesiosaurus in the York Museum. By Professor Phillips, F.R.S.

    It was a curious circumstance, that each of the three great Plesiosauri lately dis-
covered in Yorkshire belonged to distinct and undescribed species. One of these,
described by Mr. Charlesworth at a former meeting, was now in the possession of
Sir P. Crampton, in Ireland ; the other two were in the York Museum. One of
them was 18 feet long, and had a very small head ; the other was nearly equal in size
to the large Plesiosaurus of the Kimmeridge clay. Its head is 42 inches long, and
tnuch narrower in proportion than in the other species ; the neck is much shorter,
being only half as long in proportion as in the P. dolichodeirus. The paddles are
6 feet in length, and offer analogies to Pliosaurus. The vertebrae are like those of the
other species ; the teeth slightly different. It was found in Lord Zetland's works,
at Lofthouse, on the Yorkshirs coast.

          On the Formation of Boulders. By the Rev. T. Rankin.

   The writer's observations were made in some of the valleys on the Scotch borders,
with the view of exciting Mr. Hopkins to re-examine the theory which he had em-
braced with some hesitation, and whether it be tenable. Mr. Rankin endeavoured
to explain the phsenomena of the boulder formation by a general deluge, and subse-
quent river-action.

On the Classification and Nomenclature ofthe older Pala:ozoic Rocks ofBritain.
             By the Rev. Professor Sedgwick, M.A., F.R.S., &c.

    The term Palaeozoic includes all the known fossiliferous rocks from the Permian

--to the lowest Cambrian. It is separated into three natural divisions : 1st. Lower

division, including all deposits which have been called Cambrian and Silurian.
2nd. Middle division, including the Old Red Sandstone ; and the whole Devonian
series, of which the lowest group appears to be wanting in the English sections.
3rd. Upper division, including the Carboniferous and Permian series. If the old terms.
Primary, Secondary and Tertiary, be retained, the three above-named divisions make
up the Primary System of Britain ; and to these divisions, collectively, the author
applies the term Palceozoic System. They do not interchange species with the fossils

                                                                                    J
                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                           5$

of the Secondary System, including under that term all deposits from the Triassic to
the Cretaceous. They are characterized by Graptolites and many peculiar genera of
Corals, by a vast abundance of Brachiopods, by Trilobites, and by peculiar forms of

Cephalopods. On the other hand, a few species are continued through a great as-

cending series of groups, from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous ; and between the
successive primary or palaeozoic groups, it is very diflScult, and sometimes (in the
actual state of our information) impossible to draw a well-defined line of separation.
Hence (although all the types of organic life, from the oldest palaeozoic to the modern,
belong properly to one Systema Natures) it is convenient for description to regard
the palaeozoic fauna as a sufficiently distinct Systema Naturce to have a separate
aame as a system.

   In vindication of the previous statements the author quotes the following exam-
ples of fossils which have a wide palaeozoic range :

           Favosites alveolaris, from the Bala group to the Devonian inclusive.

                  gothlandica ,, ,, ,, Carboniferous ,,

and he doubts not that several other species might be added to the list.
   After these preliminary remarks the author gave the following Tabular Views.

   This tabular view (chiefly derived from the Welsh sections) agrees very nearly with

one published by the author in the 2nd Fasciculus of the Palaeozoic fossils in the
Cambridge Museum, two changes only having been introduced : 1st, the Longmynd
slates are arranged provisionally with the lowest or Bangor group ; for they form
the oldest group (not metamorphic) in the Cambrian and Silurian country, and by
the gentlemen of the Government Survey they are regarded as the base of what is

here called the Bangor group. 2ndly. The May Hill sandstone and Pentamerus
limestone are now cut off from the Caradoc sandstone, and placed at the base of the
Wenlock group. Some of the reasons for this latter change were given in a paper
read before the Geological Society of London, Nov. 3, 1852, and are now published

in No. 35 of the Journal of the Geological Society of London (Aug. 1853).
   The previous tabular view is derived from the sections of Siluria and Cambria.

   * This sub-group (Llanberris slates) is of great thickness, and includes several bands of
slates and hard grits which are below the great quarries of Nant Francon and Llanbeiiis.
These quarries are immediately under the so-called Harlech grits. .

    In this tabular view (derived from actual sections in the north of England) the Skid-

daw slate may be put on the same parallel with the old slates of the Longmynd. The
older roofing-slate of the second group (e. g. the slates of Borrowdale) may be (pro-
visionally) compared w ith the Llanberris and Nant Francon slates of the Welsh
section. In the mountains of Cumberland w^e have found no trace of the Lingula flags,

or of the Tremadoc slates with their subordinate beds of granular magnetic iron ore.

But the green slate and porphyry (of group second) are the exact counterpart of the

   A* still higher group (c) of the Permian series, not here noticed, is found in Nottingham-

shire and the southern part of Yorkshire. It is composed of gypseous red marls and thin-

bedded limestone.

slates and porphyries of Arenig and Cader Idris. In Cumberland, the porphyritic

impress is so far continued in the ascending section, that the Coniston limestone
(group three), at the south end of the countj% becomes interlaced with the highest
beds of the second group. Hence the second group of this second tabular section

appears to represent, with a different mineral type, both the Festiniog and Lower
Bala groups. The Coniston limestone is identical, in structure and fossils, with the
Bala limestone; and the Coniston limestone and flagstone represent (as to thickness,

in a degenerate form) the whole series of upper Bala rocks (36 of the 1st tabular

view).

Continuing this comparison through the upper or Silurian series, we may safely

identify the great zone of the Coniston grits with the more sterile portions of the

AMay Hill sandstone (Wenlock group, 4o).  part of the Ireleth slate group (5o,

5b, 5c), however different in structure, is in the exact place of the upper p?rts of the
Wenlock group (i.e.4b,4c,4d). The upper stage of the Treleth group (5rf), together
with a portion of a higher stage (6a), is in the place of the Ludlow stage (5a). And,
lastly (excepting a few beds at its base), the sixth group (of Benson Knot, Kirkby
Moor, &c.) unequivocally represents the upper stages of the Ludlow group (5c

and 5c?).
   If we assume the approximate truth of these identifications, it must be obvious

that the Cambrian sections are palseontologically more perfect than the Cumbrian,

and are therefore more fit to supply us with the means of a correct classification and

nomenclature.

Returning then to the Cambrian series as defined in the first tabular view, the

author remarks upon its enormous thickness, its unambiguous development, its

physical characters, and its organic remains ; whereby it is very widely separated

from the overlying and generally nnconforinahle Silurian series. If the May Hill

sandstone be struck off from the inferior groups with which it has been classed in

the ' Silurian System,' it becomes (as in the tabular view) the paleeontologica!, as

well as the physical base, of the ' Silurian System.' For in the May Hill sand-

stone the great palseontological, as well as the great physical, change takes place,
whereby the Silurian and Cambrian groups do admit of a clear separation. The

Cambrian series is paheontologically quite as distinct from the Silurian as is the De-

vonian from the Carboniferous.

While the May Hill sandstone, with a perfect Wenlock group of fossils, was classed

under one name with the Caradoc sandstone, which has a perfectly Cambrian group

of fossils, no wonder that Cambrian and Silurian rocks should have been regarded

Nowas of one palseontological type.  that this erroneous nomenclature and classifica-

tion has been corrected, the author does not believe that the two series (Cambrian

and Silurian) will prove to have in their fossil lists more than six or seven per cent,

of common species. M. Barrande's investigations in Bohemia give not more than

about five per cent, of species common to rocks which answer to those which are here

Newcalled Cambrian and Silurian. Mr. Hall's investigations in     York give, for that

great region, a still smaller per-centage of such common species. An examination of

all the fossils derived from the lower division of the palaeozoic rocks in the north of

England, after they have been separated into two great groups--one representing all

fossils found below the Coniston grits, and the other representing all the fossils found

--from the Coniston grits inclusive, up to the base of the old red sandstone, gives (out
of a total of J 65 species) not more than three and a half per cent, of species common

to the two groups*.

After these facts, the author contends that there is now no rational ground of

dispute either as to the classification or nomenclature of the great groups of strata

which form the lowest division of the British Palaeozoic series.

The nomenclature here presented has the priority in time. The physical sequence

was made out (as to all essential points) by the unassisted labours of the author,
who first adopted the name Cambrian for the vast groups which form the so-called

Cambrian series. The nomenclature is not only palaeontologically right, but is geo-

graphically true and congruous ; for every rock of which the true place had been

determined by the author of the ' Silurian System' is still called Silurian ; while

   * Several sections from Wales and Cumberland were exhibited in illustration of the clas-
sification here vindicated ; but they are necessarily omitted in this abstract.
--68 REPORT 1853.

the vast (and generally unconformable) inferior groups, which collectively are found

in Cambria, and are assuredly not found collectively in any Silurian section, are

still called Cambrian.

The preceding classification places the Silurian series on its true physical and true

palfeontological base ; but it does exclude from that series the shelly sandstones of

Caer Caradoc, and the calcareous flagstones of Llandeilo.

To confirm the preceding conclusion, the author then went on to a discussion of

certain sections examined (by Professor M'Coy and himself) immediately before the

meeting of the British Association at Hull. They were prevented from extending

their examination to the sections of Builth and Llandeilo by a very vexatious acci-

dent                      and their joint remarks, so  far as they appear in  this abstract, relate to sec-
                       ;

tions at the south-west end of the Longmynd, and to sections through the typical

Caradoc sandstone, where it forms a well-known terrace, ranging from the banks of
the Onny to the banks of the Severn.

 --(1.) Sections of the Pentamerus Limestone and May Hill Sandstone of Norbury and

Linley. From these rocks (which rest unconformably on the old Longmynd slates)

they obtained the following fossils, the species determined by Professor M'Coy :

* Ptilodic/ya lanceolata, as at Dudley.

* PalcBopora interstincta, common to Cambrian and Silurian.

*Favosites multiporatus,                               ditto.

*Petraia bina, as in Wenlock limestone and May Hill sandstone.

* , unnamed species, same as at May Hill.

*Encrinurus punctatus, common to Cambrian and Silurian rocks.

                          and May Hill sandstone.

* euglypha as in Wenlock limestone, and Dudley.

*Orthis elegantula, common to Cambrian and Silurian.

* pecten,                                          ditto.

* Davidsoni, as at Wenlock limestone of Walsall, and sandstone of May Hill.

** Spirigerina reticularis, common to Cambrian, Silurian, and Devonian.

* Litiorina octavia, as in Wenlock limestone.

   Upon this list it is remarked, that out of fifteen species eight have not yet been
found, except in the Wenlock group or its equivalents ; and that of the remaining

seven species, one ranges through both the Silurian and Devonian series, while the

other six belong to species already known to be common both to Cambrian and Silu-
rian rocks. On the other hand, all the types hitherto regarded as exclusively cha-
racteristic of Cambrian rocks are wanting. Hence the author (along with Professor
M'Coy) arranges the Pentamerus limestone, &c. of Norbury at the base of the Wen-
lock group, and cuts it off from the Caradoc sandstone. He further remarks, that
those fossil species which are admitted to be common to the Cambrian and Silurian
rocks, appear chiefly to abound in the uppermost beds of the Cambrian series ; as
also in the May Hill sandstone, which is the true base of the Silurian series. In other
words, the common species abound in the very beds where we should expect to find

--them.
    (2.) Section of the Onny in descending order. The lower parts of the river banks
were under water during the author's visit to the country along with Professor
M'Coy ; but the following facts were partly supplied by excavations which had been
kindly made, at the author's request, by Mr. Duppa of Cheyney Longville, in places

out of the reach of inundation.
   In the first excavation, 200 yards above Stretford Bridge, abundance of the fol-

lowing fossils :--

                          Graptolites Ludensis.                      Calymene tuberculosa.
                          Odontochile longicaudata.                  Cardiola interrupta.

   Between this locality and the following is a change of surface, and no rock is
distinctly seen for some hundred yards. This is the place where we might expect

the May Hill sandstone and Pentamerus limestone.

   About 300 yards above Longville Bridge the following fossils ate abundant, with'

out intermixture of the above-named species :

                                                                                            a

   In a second excavation, 30 yards higher up the river, occurs a bed with innume-

beds of Horderley.
   In this section, therefore, the highest beds are undoubted Wenlock shale, the

lowest are undoubted Cambrian (Caradoc sandstone of the Bala group), and the in-

termediate May Hill group is lost. These facts do not invalidate, but, so far as they

go, confirm the conclusion drawn from the Norbury section ; and tend to prove that
the author was in error, when, in a previous communication, he placed the Penta-
merus beds within the limits of the Caradoc group (paper read before the Geol. Soc,

Nov. 3, 1852).

extending along the road to Church Preen.

   "Beneath the above conglomerates, in the large quarries at W. edge of Round Nursety

   These sections (at Shineton, &c.) had been previously examined, in detail, by
Mr. Salter, whose list of fossil localities w,as kindly communicated to Professor
M'Coy and the author before their visit to the country.

   The conclusion from the above facts seems to be inevitable. The great (and sup-
posed) typical section of Caer Caradoc and Wenlock Edge is not, probably, a con-
tinuous, but a broken section ; and the conglomerates, grits, Pentamerus limestone,
&c. (which overlie the Olenus shales) must here (as at the Malverns) be cut off from
the Caradoc terrace, and arranged with the Wenlock group, as in the above first ta-

bular view.

   From all the above facts, as well as from facts previously published, the author

 concludes, that in no part of Wales, or the adjacent counties, is there any one con-
 tinuous unbroken section through which we can ascend from the Cambrian to the
 Silurian groups. There is a physical break between them ; and in very near coordi-
 nation with that break (often marked by a discordancy of position) there is a great
 change in fossil species. The author showed the bearing of these views on the sec-
 tions from the Ciea Hills to the Longmynd, and on similar sections from the vicinity
 ofLlandeilo ; and from both districts drew confirmations of his conclusion, //iФ< all the
 oldei- groups of North and South Wales, and of a part of the Silurian district, up to the

base of the May Hill sandstone, must retain the name ' Cambrian,' which has the

 claim of priority, is geographically true, and palieontologically right.
    The author, after referring to the history of the investigations into the Silurian

 and Cambrian systems, remarks that he never had the expectation of establishing, by
 the evidence of fossils, a separation between Cambrian and ' Lower Silurian' rocks,

which has been attributed to him. He had from the first a contrary opinion, founded

both on sections and fossils.

    That the fossils of the whole Bala group and the fossils of Snowdonia were iden-
tical with the fossils of the so-called Lower Silurian groups, was certain long before
there was any matter of dispute about the Paleozoic nomenclature ; but that was
considered by the author as no reason for extending the Lower Silurian nomenclature

over all the older groups of Wales. It was, however, a very (jood reason for keeping
the Lower Silurian nomenclature in abeyance ; and pretending to no strictly defined
nomenclature of Lower Silurian or Upper Cambrian rocks, till it could be permanently
fixed both by true sections and corresponding groups of fossils. That period it has at

length reached through the determination of the May Hill group ; which group was

introduced, or immediately preceded, by great physical movements indicated here and
there by great masses of conglomerate, by great groups of rock with a new physical
type, and generally in a position discordant to the Cambrian series ; and at the same
time by a great change in the organic types ; i. e. by the sudden disappearance of
the undoubted Cambrian types, and by the sudden appearance of undoubted Silurian
types. Such phsenomena may well be considered as the prelude to a new system or
a new series of physical groups demanding a separate name. The scheme of no-
menclature and classification, given in this communication, does not deprive the
' Silurian System ' of a single stratum or a single group of fossils which belong to it
on a right and natural interpretation of the sections. At the same time, the original
Silurian map is on this scheme not greatly changed. The groups of Caer Caradoc
and Llandeilo become indeed absorbed in the upper Cambrian groups, among which
they find their true geographical and true sectional place ; but the greater part of the
rocks hitherto called Caradoc sandstone still have their place in the map of Siluria
under another name (May Hill sandstone). The remarkable groups of Tortworth

and the Usk ; all the groups of May Hill and Woolhope ; all the Silurian groups on

the west side of the Malvern Hills (with an almost evanescent exception at Holly
Bush) ; the groups of Abberley, Presteign, Aymestry, and Ludlow ; all these groups

will remain almost untouched, or with one new Silurian colour for the May Hill beds.
A distinct colour for the May Hill sandstone must appear at the base of Wenlock
Edge. Further north the changes in the Silurian map will be more considerable

but it will be compensated, for the loss of certain Cambrian groups, by a large ex-

tension of the May Hill sandstone through the chain of the Berwyns, and thence, as
in the Government map (iu which it is laid down under the erroneous name of " Middle

Silurian"), to the sea near Conway.
   The author then compares with the results of his investigation the nomenclature

and classification adopted in the publications of the Geological Survey of Great
Britain, in which only those lower groups which are without fossils are ranked as

' Cambrian'. He objects to the extension of the meaning of ' Llandeilo rocks,' so as
to make them comprehend the Upper and Lower groups of Bala ; and to the use of
such a term as ' Middle Silurian,' embracing the May Hill and Caradoc sandstones.
The distinction of these two sandstones was first made out in the Cambridge Mu-
seum by Professor M'Coy, after a detailed examination of the Cambrian and Silu-

rian fossils collected by the author ; it has since been confirmed by an examination of
sections in the field ; and the author believes there is no alternation of Cambrian and
Silurian rocks, no confusion of these separate groups, and no well-defined great

' middle ' group, blending the characters of the two extremes. He claims the right

to suggest to the Government Survej' a return to the nomenclature иwhich he was
the first to propose, and of which he now vindicates the justice and propriety.

   In this way (and this way only) can there be an end of controversy. The groups
will have their first names, and their right geographical names. While the rocks of
Cambria are called Cambrian, the rocks of Siluria will be called Silurian ; and not
so much as one single bed of rock will be seen out of the limits of the true Silurian
colours of the Geological map, of which bed the right place had been fixed in the

original sections and details of the ' Silurian System.'
    Finally, the author contends that the most recent and mature works of great Con-

tinental and American palaeontologists (such as Barrande, D'Orbigny, Hall, Rogers,
&c.) do not invalidate, but confirm, the views here communicated to the British As-
sociation. These authors have not, indeed, ever entered on any formal discussion of
British palaeozoic nomenclature. They have taken the British groups and names as
they found them published ; and naturally left their final adjustment to British geo-
logists. But they have presented the data in a form clearly showing the general
equivalency of the so-called ' Lower Silurian ' to the Cambrian rocks ; and the re-
sults which they have obtained appear, not only to the author of this communica-
tion, but also (as he can aflSrm) to some of the great American geologists themselves,
to confirm in all important points the physical and palaeontological separation between

the Cambrian and Silurian series.
   The author ended by stating, as an excuse for the very great and unusual length

of his paper, that he believed it, out of comparison, the most important communica-
tion he had ever made to the British Association. It contained historical and geo-
graphical details, and several illustrative sections (of which little or no notice is taken
in this abstract), and exhibited conclusions derived from evidence, the unfolding of
which had taken many years of hard field-labour. And as some of its conclusions
were still controverted, they were, on that very account, specially fitted for a calm

discussion in the Geological Section (of the British Association), in which he had, at

this meeting, the honour to fill the Chair,

             On Pseudomorphous Crystals in New Red Sandstone.
                    By H. E. Strickland, M.A., F.G.S.

   These pseudo-crystals were cubical projections from the under surfaces of laminsB
of white sandstone, of the age of the red marls, and had been detected at various
localities in Gloucestershire, Nottinghamshire, and Cheshire. They might have been
formed in cavities left by the decomposition of iron pyrites, or by the removal of

crystals of common salt. That the latter was really the case seemed evident from
some of the specimens, in which the faces of the cubes were concave, and exhibited
concentric lines. The author inferred that the crystals of salt were formed on, or in
the mud of the shore, during a temporary exposure to the sun, and being again
covered by the sea, the crystals had dissolved, and their form had been assumed by

the material of the next succeeding deposit.

On some Ayrshire Fossils. By Wyville T. C. Thomson, LL.D.

Dr. Thomson exhibited a collection of fossils from the Lower Silurian (or Cam-

brian) rocks, on the South bank of Girvan Water, in Ayrshire : they were obtained

by breaking up the rock, and still retained their natural surfaces in very great per-

fection                            whereas, fossils  of the  old rocks in general only retain  their  real  surfaces

   On a singular Fault in the Southern Termination of the Warwickshire
                  Coal-field. By Charles Twamley, F.G.S.

   This narrow coal-field is described as extending from Polesworth, near Taraworth,
to Sow, three miles east of Coventry. At the Victoria Colliery, near Bedworth, the
coal-seams lie nearly together, with very thin partings, and measure from 8 to 10
yards. At Polesworth the seams are widely separated, forming, with the interposed
strata, a thickness of more than 70 yards. The fault described is in the Victoria
Colliery ; the coal lies at the depth of 225 yards, dipping S.W., 12 inches in the
yard. In driving a gate-road southerly a fault occurred, the coal-seams being cut
off in succession ; the top one disappearing first, and the bottom one last. The road
was continued on a level, through fractured rocky shale containing coal fossils, for
about 120 yards, when the coal-seams were again met with, in the same order in
which they disappeared : the bottom one first occurring and the top one last ; but
the dip had increased from 12 to 20 inches in the yard. The interval in the top coal
was 180 yards wide; in the bottom coal 120 yards, and in a band of ironstone
below the coal 80 yards. The level at which the coal reappears is 22 yards higher

than it would have been but for the fault. A headway was driven upwards 60
yards, and a shaft sunk downwards 40 yards in the shale, without finding a trace
of coal. The fault has an irregular N.W. and S.E. course at right angles to the

dip of the beds.

              On the Structure of the Endochrome in Conferva Linum.
                          By Professor Allman, M.D., M.R.I. A.

The cells of this plant are filled with a deep green endochrome, which when

liberated from the cell and examined under a power of about 150 linear, is found to
be composed of exceedingly delicate utricles, filled with homogeneous green matter
which surrounds a central nucleus-like body. The form of this body is peculiar,
being that of a more or less circular disc, with a thickened ring-like margin, and
generally bent irregularly on itself. lodme, by turning it blue, proves it to be a
starch-granule. In one or two instances, the endochrome-utricles were found after
the application of iodine, with their green contents contracted towards one side, and
the starch-granule lying free in the otherwise empty portion of the utricle. In some
cases two or three starch-granules were found in a single utricle.

    It frequently happens that the utricles become ruptured, probably by the endos-
mose of water, or by the actual solution of their very delicate walls, and thus liberate
their contents ; the starch-granules were then seen to float away perfectly free upon
the field of the microscope. In none of the utricles could any true nucleus be

detected.
    Besides the simple utricles with their green contents and starch -granules, others

were not unfrequently met with of a larger size, and filled with a brood of smaller
Utricles, exactly similar to those just described ; like them filled with homogeneous

--green contents, and containing a nucleus-like starch-granule.
    It is thus proved, 1. That the green matter in Confei-va Linum is immediately
 contained in distinct cells or utricles. 2. That it surrounds in each utricle a, pecu-
liarly formed starch-granule. 3. That these utricles are themselves the product
of parent utricles, in whose cavity they are formed ; the endochrome of Conferva
Linum thus possessing an independent organization by which it is enabled to mul- "

 tiply itself within the filament.

formed starch-granules. In many instances, utricles were met with of a large size,
and filled with a brood of secondary utricles, each containing homogeneous green

contents, surrounding a nucleus-like starch-granule.

    This communication was merely a recapitulation of the results obtained by
the author, and fully communicated in Reports published in former volumes. Its
object was to introduce a letter from Messrs. Lawson and Co. of Edinburgh, who
stated that by adopting the plan of cutting off the luminous rays by the use of
cobalt blue glass, as recommended by Mr. R. Hunt, they succeeded in obtaining
healthful germination far more rapidly than under ordinary circumstances. They
had constructed a house glazed with blue glass, and in this all their seeds were
tested. This practical application of a scientific discovery was of the utmost value
to them. Tropical seeds under the same circumstances were found to germinate in
a few days, -whereas in ordinary conditions many weeks were required for the
 completion of the process.

    It was the purport of this paper to show how exceedingly rich the vicinity of Hull
 is in those beautiful forms of living atoms called Infusorial shells, or Diatomacese,
 upwards of 145 species having been found and examined by the authors of the paper.
 The contents of the paper not only went to show the beauties of those formations, hut
 also the great value of some particular species as test objects for microscopes, parti-
 cularly the Pleurosigma attenualum, P. slrigomm, P. elongatum, P. qiiadratum,
 P. fasciola, &c., the delicate markings on each of which had been first discovered by
 the authors of this paper, and their superiority, above all others, as test objects pointed
 out. The paper then went on to show tlie errors into which the Rev. W. Smith had
 fallen with regard to the number of markings in the inch on each of those delicate
 coverings, and also the impossibility of the markings being the result of internal
 Btruoture. It was likewise stated, that in making a large drain in Holderness for the
 purpose of taking the water from the low lands into the Humber, an immense bed of
 fossil DiatomacesB had been discovered, which bed consisted of almost 100 different
 species, but generally of the smaller kinds ; and that in examining tlie matter taken
 from a large submerged forest on the Holderness coast, an immense number of fossil
 freshwater Diatomacese had been found, although the sea washes over the same at every
 tide, clearly showing that the forest had been overthrown by some great run of fresh
 water long before the sea had reached the point which it now has. 1'lie paper con-
 cluded by the authors entirely disagreeing with those naturalists who wish to place
 these living forms in the vegetable kingdom, the motions of many of them being more

  rapid in proportion to their size than that of several larger animals.

                               Zoology.

                On the Structure of Hydra viridis.
           By Professor Allman, M.D., M.R.I.A.

The author had been recently led to examine Hydra viridis, with special reference

to its alleged non-cellular structure, as maintained by Ecker, and has arrived at con-

clusions entirely opposed to those of the German physiologist.

Hydra viridis, like all the other Hydroid zoophytes, is composed throughout]of two

distinct layers ; to the external of these the author gives the name of ectoderm, and

to the internal that of endoderm. When examined under slight pressure and with a

power of about 100 diameters. Hydra viridis may be seen to possess throughout the

whole thickness of its substance a multitude of clear spaces, which at first look like

cells, but by a careful examination may be satisfactorily proved to be mere vacuoles.

So far Ecker is right in asserting the existence of vacuolae in the tissues of Hydra,

but he is (juite wrong in his opinion as to the relation of these vacuolae to the inter-
vening substance. The vacuolee of the endoderm may be seen to be separated from

one another by multitudes of green spherules, to which the characteristic colour of the

species is due ; and it is the appearance thus presented which has led to the erro-

neous belief that the spherules are imbedded in a continuous semifluid matter in

which the vacuolce are excavated.
   By a little manipulation, however, the tissue of the endoderm may without

difficulty be broken up into detached portions, each almost always containing one,

or occasionally more of the clear vacuolse, surrounded by green granules, and isolated

hy a distinct though extremely delicate cell-membrane. It is therefore evident that

the substance which separates the vacuolae of the endoderm is not continuous, but

is contained as cell-contents in true cells, that the vacuolae are excavated in this

protoplasm, and that the green spherules are imbedded in it. The cells themselves

appear to possess but a verj'  weak union  among one  another                                       they are easily sepa-
                                                                                                 ;

rated by a slight force, and on becoming free, immediately assume a spherical figure

without any trace of their having been previously united into a tissue.

Those endodermal cells which present a free surface in the gastric cavity are

deficient in green spherules, but contain a large vacuola, with one or more brown

granular masses, which appear to be immediately included in a small secondary cell,
in which they are probably elaborated by a true secretory action; they may perhaps
he fairly assumed as representing the biliary secretion in the higher animals. Whether

the cells, however, which thus constitute the gastric surface of the endoderm are

entirely destitute of green spherules, the author could not positively assert : it is

certain, that in the disintegration of the endoderm, several cells are liberated con-

taining both green spherules and brown granular masses, the latter immediately in-

cluded in minute secondary cells, but from what part of the endoderm they were

derived he could not determine. The cells which thus constitute the immediate

walls of the stomach, cannot be viewed as forming a third layer distinct from the

endoderm.

The green spherules possess an exceedingly definite form, and the author was of

opinion that they must be viewed as cells. They present in their interior a lighter
coloured space, which appears sometimes circular, sometimes somewhat fiask-

shaped, and sometimes triradiate, a difference perhaps depending on the difference of

aspect in which it presents itself to the eye.

The structure of the ectoderm differs in no essential point from that of the endo-

derm, except in the fact that its component cells are totally destitute of green sphe-

rules and brown granules, while one or more thread-cells, each immediately enclosed

in a secondary cell, constitute their characteristic contents ; besides the thread-

cells they contain homogeneous colourless contents with vacuolae.

   Hydra is certainly destitute of cilia on any part of its external or internal surface,
and yet weak currents may be distinctly seen in the fluid in contact with separate

portions of the endoderm. It appeared to the author that the true cause of these

currents is to be sought for in certain chemical changes, which, by virtue of their

vital endowments, these cells, Uke secreting cells generally, effect in the fluid in con-

tact with them.

   In the tissues of Hydra viridis nothing beyond the elements now mentioned could

be detected. There is no trace of nervous or muscular tissue, and the high degree of
contractility presented by the animal, must be an endowment of its simple cellular
structure, but whether residing in the membrane of the cells or in their contents, or
ia both, we have not yet sufficient facts to enable us to determine.

                                On the Structure of Bursaria.
                        By Professor Allman, M.B., M.R.I.A.

In this communication the author advocated the unicellular structure of the true

Infusoria as maintained by Siebold. The phsenomena presented by Bursaria incon-

testably prove it to be a solitary cell with an inversion of its wall at one spot,

constituting a deep horn-shaped depression, which terminates behind in a blind

extremity. The whole of the external surface of the animalcule is thickly set with

vibratile cilia, and within the horn-shaped depression, along the entire of its convex

side, there runs a broad band of vibratile organs, which appear to be very delicate

plates rather than cilia.

The contents of the Bursaria-cell are remarkable. Under slight pressure and a

magnifying power of about 100 linear, the whole of the interior appears at first to

be composed of a cellular parenchyma. It is, however, easy to convince oneself that

this appearance of cells is due to the presence of simple vacuolae, thickly distributed

through a semi-fluid granular substance. When by rupture of the external wall,

a portion of these cell-contents escapes into the drop of fluid in which the animal is

placed for observation, it may be seen to possess the property of immediately as-

suming a definite outline ; it generally acquires a nearly spherical figure, and with a

number of contained vacuolse, it then so exactly resembles a parent cell with second-

ary cells in its interior, as to be very likely to give rise to erroneous views of the

structure of the animalcule from which it had been liberated. It is not easy to

decide whether the masses of escaped cell-contents possess a power of independent

motion ; there is reason, however, to believe that such power is really possessed by

them, and that it manifests itself in slight changes of shape, which after consider-

able intervals may be witnessed in them, and which cannot be referred to any purely
mechanical cause. In the unmutilated animal a movement of the contents may

be frequently seen through the transparent cell- wall, during which the vacuolae con-

stantly change their relative position to one another.

In the midst of the cell-contents is a sinuously bent cylindrical body of a yellowish

colour, and somewhat granular structure ; it is solid, and appears to lie quite free in the
surrounding substance. It is to the homologues of this body in so many Infusoria,

that Ehrenberg has so variously attributed a digestive or reproductive function, or

that he has assigned some undefined glandular office. Siebold, however, has certainly

indicated its true signification when he supposed it to represent the nucleus of the

unicellular solitary cell, forming the body of every true Infusorial.

In a well-fed Bursaria, masses of alimentary matter may be seen enclosed in little

cavities scattered through the substance of the animalcule. These cavities seem to

have no definite position, and there appears to be no doubt whatever that they are

mere vacuolse temporarily excavated in the substance of the cell-contents, for the re-

ception of the alimentary matter. Their contents, when presenting any definite form,

may be seen to consist chiefly of minute Desmidieos or DiatomacecB or Infusoria, but

most usually the cavities contain nothing but granular brownish masses. The author

' had not succeeded in witnessing the actual reception of food, and could not state,

from direct observation, how this gained admittance to the interior ; there seems

  little doubt, however, that it is first carried into the horn-shaped depression, through

I

 whose walls it is then forced into the interior of the animalcule, and when once in-

 I

I troduced into the semi-fluid cell- contents, each little alimentary mass forms around

it a vacuole. In this vacuole digestion goes on, and during the continuance of the

process each may be seen to contain, besides its solid contents, a transparent colour-

 less fluid. The temporary digestive vacuolse seem capable of formation in any part of

\

from the surface of the Bursaria. It is probably either a gemma or an embryo set free
by the manipulation employed in the examination, but to what exact part of the
parent animal it is indebted for its origin, the author could not satisfactorily discover.

              On the Nature of Ciliary Motion. By P. Duncan.

    The author detailed what had been done by English observers on this subject, and
came to the conclusion that the cause of the bending and returning of the cilium resided
 in the cell-wall of the cell which sustains the cilia, and that to a greater or less extent
 the whole of the cell- wall is contractile.

   Of the Influence of the Circulation of the Blood on the Mental Functions.
                                     ByB.. Fowler, M.D.

     This is a practical question, for as the whole body of an animal is a secretion from
 the blood of its parents, is kept in repair and rendered sensitive and contractile by the
blood, and in ratio of its purity, and as all we can know of the external world is by
 inference from the subjective sensations impressed on our organs of sense, it is obvious
 that our knowledge must be dependent on tlie fitness of the bodily organs for being
 adjusted by the mind, and receiving impressions from existing objects, analogous to a
 telescope which must be adjusted by the mind of the astronomer, and reflective or
 refractive of the im])ressions it receives.

     Cretins, unfitted for the functions of life by impure air and insufficient food and filth,
 are restored by removal to pure air, wholesome food, cleanliness, and exercise. Bvit
 the result is obviously i-eferable to the agency of the blood; man, therefore, is a coil,
 secreted by his parents and actuated by vitality and animated by mind.

     I have in former papers, read in this Section, adduced facts to prove that vitality
 and mind are forces, and in correlation with the physical forces. Alike to these,
 their jmanifestation is in ratio of the fitness of their coils. The circulation of the blood
 is in a real coil of tubes, it is the oxygen of the decarbonized blood which excites the
 propulsive motion of the heart and arteries. The stimulating eifect of the oxygen

 may be fully estimated by the pain it excites on an abrased surface or cut, and the
 sufierin" of a person i-ecovering from suspended circulation. The nitrous oxide gas
 is described by Sir H. Davy to have excited feelings of extended touch. It is still

 the opinion of some persons, that the impulse given to the blood by the heart is the
 only impulsive force actuating the circulation, but there are facts adduced by the late
 Sir Charles Bell, to prove that the muscular coat of the minute arteries assist in

working the functions of secretions, and that in the instances of tears, saliva from

conceptions of food, and many other instances well-known to physiologists, that minute

arteries are excited by retransmissions from conceptions.

  May not the flow of blood through the capillaries be accelerated by the electricity

evolved from the chemical affinities of oxygen with the carbon ?

In the year 1792, while making experiments on frogs and rabbits, and some experi-

ments with zinc and silver suggested by Galvani's discovery, I divided the nerve of

one of the legs and tied the crural arteries of the others ; the muscles whose arteries

were tied soon lost their contractility, while those whose nerves were divided, but
whose arteries were not compressed, were excitable for months after the nerve had
been divided. From these facts I inferred that the blood and not the nerves influ-

enced communication by the brain, and was the source of both sensibility and con-

tractility. The frogs were kept in a large pan of water renewed every day, and their

skins as little injured as could be avoided ; but when the skin was lightly brushed so

as to excite the sensitive extremities of its nerves, a blush was seen on its surface, and

the muscles were excitable by zinc and silver in contact with the trunk of the nerve

and with each other.

   This appeared to me then, as now, a proof that both sensibility and contractility
were communicated analogous, as it now seems, to the sensitiveness communicated to
Talbotype paper by chemical preparation. May it not be by the blood projected to

the eyes of cats, owls, and all animals who seek their prey in the dark, that the retina

is rendered sufficiently sensitive to the smallest degree of light ?

   The late Sir William Herschel says, in one of his astronomical papers, that he always

sat in a moderate light, and without moving his eyes, so that the retina might recover

Weits sensibility before he looked into his telescope.  grope our way from a bright

sunshine to a diorama, but all is light when we return, and the sensibility of the

retina has been revivified by the blood, and the absence of exhausting light. As it is

with the eyes, so I infer that it may be with the brain, the organ employed by the

mind to effect the thinking functions.

Blood, says Sir A. Cooper (Guy's Reports), was seen to flush the surface of the brain

(perceivable from the loss of a part of the skull and dura mater) with every change of

thought, even the most indifferent ; and any one may have observed that the scalp
is overheated and the brain sensitive of an accelerated circulation in it when the mind

has been long and intently thinking, that with every thought there is a retransmission

or projection of blood, not only to the brain, but also to the part whose functions are

required for action.

  We have proofs in such cases as those described by Dr. Yellowly in the Medical

and Chirurgical Transactions, and others, so ably commented on by Sir Henry

Holland.

   The sensibility communicated by the blood in a like case appears to me the efficient

cause of consciousness. I have thus far spoken with reference to the red arterial

blood only. The venous black blood injected into the brain by Bichat. destroyed life
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

and Sir A. Cooper could also suspend all its phenomena by pressure on the carotid and

Nowvertebral arteries.  since all the blood in patients in cholera is black, how is it

that their consciousness is not suspended ? Mr. Magendie, in his able pamphlet on

cholera, says that the intellect of one patient continued clear for more than two hours

after the pulse in the wrist had ceased to beat. I asked him how he reconciled this

Myfact with those recorded by Bichat ; he answered, "  friend Bichat, if living, would

have to write that paper over again." May not the following aid our conception of

two facts so seemingly incompatible? The skull cannot probably contain more blood

at one time than at another, but the proportion of the venous blood may be abnormal,

and by its congestion and pressure (as the finger on the denuded brain of the beggar)

render a patient comatose. In cliolera there is no pressure by venous blood, for all

the fluid parts of the blood have been discharged from the bowels.
   That conceptions are more vivid when we are in such a state of excitement

as to accelerate the circulation of the blood in the organs in which conceptions are

produced, as in emotions, passions and intensely pleasurable or painful sen-
sations, cannot but have been noticed by all who can and do give their attention to the
operations of their own minds. The painter seems to see on his canvas such a con-
ception of the face ; he by trying to paint the lover sees " his mistress where she has not

been," and such conceptions are the object of most illusive appearances. Appear- .

         On a New Species of Cometes ; a Genus of Humming-Birds.
                             By John Gould, F.R.S.

   The author gave an interesting account of the family of humming-birds, and of the
species which were new in his collection. Of the genus Cometes, to which the new bird
belonged, two species had already been described, the C.Spargmutrus and C.Phaon,
and he proposed for the third species the name of C. Mossia, after its discoverer.

                 On the Artificial Breeding of Sahnon in the Swale.
                    ^^ John Hogg, M.A., F.R.S., F.L.S.

    In the latter part of the autumn of 1851, two or three gentlemen of Richmond
caught with a net three or four male and female salmon when they were observed to
be about to deposit their roe and milt in the gravel-beds which they had made in the
river Tees. They expressed into a vessel with fresh water some of the roe from the
female salmon, and afterwards did the like with the milt from the males. They
returned the fishes to the river. After shaking together the roe and milt, they in a
day or two deposited them so mixed in beds in the gravel of a small stream, tributary
to the Swale near Richmond, and carefully staked off the ground with thorns and
whins to prevent the access of small tvouts, minnows, and other fishes, which would
have greedily devoured the roe. In the spring of the following year 1852, the gen-
tlemen were happy to find that some fry of the salmon had emerged from the roe or
ova so artificially fertilized and deposited ; and the experiment, in fact, succeeded.
Again, on Christmas Eve of last year, 1852, the same gentlemen obtained from the
river Tees some more male and female salmon, and expressed from them respectively
some roe and milt. These were conveyed to the Swale, or one of its tributaries near
Richmond, and the result was, this spring (.-Vpril 185.3), still more satisfactory, inas-
much as many of the ova produced a fine stock of healthy fry. These active gentlemen
and practical ichthyologists, to whom the author referred, consider that they have now
the means of ensuring a supply of that noble and useful species, the salmon, in the
waters of the Swale. That beautiful river, as it is satisfactorily recorded in the Annals
of Richmond, had many years ago an annual supply of salmon ; but owing to the
erection of a mill-dam some years since between Richmond and the sea, the free access
up and down the Swale was prevented, and consequently the salmon took to other
rivers. The removal of the dam, at least for a portion of the season, will this year be
effected. The author also communicated a similar important fact respecting the arti-
ficial breeding of the common trout; as he with pleasure learnt this spring that
Major Wade, of Hauxwell Hall in this county, had during the last autumn and the
April of this year, been equally successful with the ova and milt taken from female
and male trouts. Mr. .J. H ogg then made a few observations on the facility of this me-
thod of the artificial propagation of fishes ; and trusted that it only required to be better
known to secure a more universal adoption of it, which would stock many of our rivers,
lakes and waters throughout the kingdom, and consequently prove a source of wealth
to poor persons, and give an abundant supply of delicious and wholesome food to all
classes. By the same method the roe and milt might be obtained and conveyed in

--proper boxes filled with water and some gravel even to distant places, probably, in

time, to many of our colonies in foreign climes, and so be a ready means of exporting

as well as of importing different species.

On some discoveries relative to the Chick in Ovo, and its liberation from the
                   shell. By F. R. Horner, M.D. of Hull.

   The author observed, that the chick in ovo had ever been a deeply interesting sub-
ject of investigation to the physiologist as well as to the naturalist, both of this and
of other countries, inasmuch as, from the facility of observation, it so admirably
illustrated the order of development and gi-owth of the various organs and parts of
                           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          69

the body. After describing the usual phsenomena observable in the egg during the

last forty-eight hours of its incubation, as well as at the period of hatching, Dr. Horner

stated that the special object of his comnjunication was, to announce the discovery of

the true nature of the sound which is heard within the egg during the last two days

of incubation ; and also to show what is the exact mode by which the chick breaks

the shell.

The opinion so universally held, not only by amateurs and breeders of poultry, but

also by natui'alists and physiologists, that the tapping, or more correctly speaking,

crackling sound, heard in the egg on the twentieth and twenty-first days of incuba-

--tion, were caused by the efforts of the chick to break the shell, he proved to be

erroneous, by the following experiments : first, by breaking a hole in the large end

of the egg, when the bill of the chick was seen to be quite stationary, and never

coming in contact with the shell, though the sound referred to continued before;

secondly, that the sound was heard in other instances before the bill had emerged

from the folds of the membrane which envelopes the chick, and consequently, there-

fore, could not be then used to break the shell ; and thirdly, by enlarging the aper-
ture in the shell first made by the chick so as to isolate the bill, and prevent the pos-

sibility of its coming in contact with the shell, when still the same sound continued

t╗ be produced as before, thus proving that the sound heard within the egg was not,

and could not be produced by the bill of the chick breaking the shell.

   On examining a recently-hatched chick, by placing the ear and also the stethoscope

on its breast and sides, a precisely similar sound was identified as had been heard

within the egg. Thus, observed the author, )ny inquiry was complete, viz. that the

sound heard within the egg during the last two days of incubation is not caused by the

tapping, or by any other mode of contact of the chick's bill with the shell, but that it is

truly respiratory, and produced by the transmission of the air through the lungs ; in

other words, that it is nothing more than the natural respiratory sound of the chick.
Such explanation receives also collateral testimony from the discovery of physiologists

that air first enters the lungs of the chick about the end of the nineteenth day, viz.

at the very period at which this sound, truly respiratory, first begins to be heard;

and yet more, the author ascertained that the frequency of the respiratory act

accorded with the repetition of the sound within the egg. The action of the heart ia

a newly-hatched chicken, he observed, was so rapid, that it could not be counted;

whilst its impulse and sound were discerned with difficulty.

The opinion that the shell is broken by a cutting, or scraping motion of the bill,

through the agency of the pointed horny scale at its end, was shown to be fallacious,

as the membrane which lines the shell is in the first instance left entire, while the

shell itself without has been chipped or broken off. The author then observed that

the shell is really broken, bit by bit, and with apparent ease, by a healthy chick ; and

generally by a single smart blow only, though in some instances the blow is imme-

diately repeated, or double                                                                                                                       that  each  strike  of the  bill  is                                                                           made  with considerable

heard,    by placing  the  ear  against                                                                                                                 the   part when broken                                                                                   that  when  the  period of

hatching approaches, the chick, which previously had occupied but two-thirds

of the egg, now raises itself in the shell by a hustling struggling motion; and by

thus unpacking, as it were, of itself, acquires more liberty for its efforts of liberation

from the egg. He explained that the reason why the shell is always broken by the

chick from left to right, is, because, the chick is so packed in the shell that its head

always reclines under the left wing, and on the leftside of its body, so that it can only

work and turn with facility towards that side.

            Notice of Jelly Fishes. By Dr. Lankester, F.R.S.

The observation was made on the coast of SuflFolk, between the rivers Orwell and

Deben, on the 5th, 6th, and 7th of August last. Their numbers were so great as

seriously to interfere with fishing operations, and every receding tide left the shore in

many places covered with them. The most common species was the yiurelia aurita,

taken. Noctiluca miliaris was so abundant, that a hand-net was soon filled on carry,

rescent.

On Photographic Plates and Illustrations of Microscopic Objects in Natural
                          History. By Dr. Lankester.

   The object of the author was to draw attention to Photography as a means of pro-
curing accurate copies of objects of natural liistory, more especially of those only seen
by the microscope. The disadvantage of drawings in natural history was, that they
more often represented the views of the author than correct delineations of the object.
This was so much the case with drawings of microscopic objects, that the representa-
tions of different observers of the same thing could hardly be recognized as similar.

    Dr. Lankester exhibited a series of drawings of the British Freshwater Polyps,
executed by Prof Allman, which he stated were intended to illustrate a work on this

subject to be published by the Ray Society. Among these Avere several new species,

and he especially called attention to one of these, which seemed to be an exception to
the general law tliat the polypidom of the polyp-bearing animals is fixed. In this
case the polyp stalk possessed the power of moving, as well as each individual member

of the mass.

   The author had observed at Peterhead that the young of the whiting and pollack

frequently sought safety from their pursuers in the umbrellas of the various species of

Medusae. He especially mentioned the Cyanea aurita, and also a species called

destroy fish for food, as had been sometimes supposed.

Notes on a living Specimen of Priapulus caudatus, dredged off the Coast of

          Scarborough. By John Phillips, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.

The specimen, of which drawings were exhibited to the Section, was sent alive to

the author by Mr. John Leckenby of Scarborough, in the month of February 1853.

It was kept in life three weeks, by renewing of the sea water, with sea-weed and sand.

The animal was never observed to make any special efforts to take food, though on

the affusion of fresh sea-water, faecal matter was ejected from the anal opening near

the base of the plume. In the sunshine it became active, drawing in and exserting

the anterior proboscis, quickly and even suddenly ; opening and again contracting the

large caudal plume                                                                                       bending, extending, and shortening the body without any settled

order of changes. The diameter was variable in every part, but near the base of the

plume it was sometimes thrice as large as at other times. When in a state of great-

-- --est activity a few days after it arrived in York, agitation of the vessel occasioned

some disturbed contraction of the plume ; the penicilli of this appendage would con-

tract separately on being touched ; after repeated contacts, the whole would be shut
up so as to resemble a narrow papillated rachis. The surface of the whole body is

annulaled                                                 the rings (about forty) being prominent on the body, but only marked by

numerous small prominences, papillary and blunt on the body, mucronated, a little

recurved and horny on the proboscis, where they are ranged in twenty-four beauti-

fully exact lines, continued to the centre of the variable disc which terminates the

proboscis. When the proboscis is drawn inward, the disc becomes folded, so as to-

represent, in some degree, the oral aspect of a Cyprsea, and the skin between the

mucronated lines is curiously folded and packed.

The skin is translucent enough to show, during the retraction and exsertion of the

proboscis, internal movements manifested by shady parts pushed far forward and

backward ; but these movements are disguised by the partial opacity caused by many

white narrow longitudinal bands, which being collected togetlier to closer proximity
in one particular band, make there a narrow continuous ridge, terminating near the

anal opening.

The plume when expanded shows, on each of its penicilli, a roughly papillous sur-

                  On the Connexion between Cartilage and Bone.
                     By Peter Redfern, M.D., Lond., 8^c.

   The author described in detail the nature of the structure of bone and cartilage at their
junction, and pointed out that the relation between them is much more intimate than is
generally supposed, and that it accounts satisfactorily for the characters of disease of

the articular surfaces of bones. It shows likewise the actual passage of cartilage into

bone.

                On a curious Exemplification of Instinct in Birds.
       By the Rev. Francis F. Statham, B.A., F.G.S., Walworth.

   The author stated that his communication partook more of the nature of an anec-
dote than of any elaborate disquisition. He made some references to the theory of

the facial angle, as indicative of the amount of sagacity observable in the animal race,

but expressed his conviction that this theory was utterly at fault in the case of birds

many of those having a very acute facial angle being considerably more intelligent than

others having scarcely any facial angle at all. Size also seemed to present another ano-

maly between the two races of beasts and birds                                                                                                                                                                                                             for while the elephant and the horse

were among the most distinguished of quadrupeds for sagacity and instinct, the larger

birds seemed scarcely comparable to the smaller ones in the possession of these attri-

butes. The writer instanced this by comparing the ostrich and the goose with the

wren, the robin, the canary, the pigeon, and the crow. The author then proceeded

to describe in detail the particular case of instinct which formed the subject of his

paper. It referred to the poisoning of two young blackbirds by the parent birds

when they found that they could neither liberate them nor permanently share their

Captivity. The two fledgelings had been taken from a blackbird's nest in the garden

of S. Swonnell, Esq., of Surrey Square, London, and had been placed in a room over-

looking the garden, in a wicker cage. For some time the old birds attended to their

wants, visited them regularly, and fed them with appropriate food but at last, getting
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             .;

wearied of the task, or despairing of effecting their liberation, they appeared to have

poisoned them. They were both found suddenly dead one morning shortly after

having been seen in good health ; and on opening their bodies, a small leaf, supposed

to be that of Solamtm nigrum, was found in the stomach of each. The old birds im-

they truly partook of the characters of the genera Tetrao and Galliis. Specimens of
these birds were now alive in the Gardens of the Zoological Society of London.

                    On the Mode of Growth of HaWchondria suberea.

                           Bi/ H. E. Strickland, M.A., F.R.S.

This species of sponge, which is frequently ohtained by dredging, has long been

known for the peculiarity of its habitat. It is found investing the surface of old dead

univalve shells, which ot'ten present the appearance of being actually converted into, or

replaced    by, the     substance of   the  s.ponge                                   for we find  that  the spiral                                             cavity of the
                                                                                   ;

shell is continued through the sponge for a considerable number of volutions, and is

always inhabited by some species of hermit crab. This has been explained by Dr.

Johnstone, in his ' History of British Sponges,' who supposes that the sponge by some

means dissolves, or absorbs, the larger volutions of the shell, and only leaves a small
portion of the apical volutions undestroyed. On carefully examining some specimens

which I lately dredged up, 1 found reason to believe that the sponge does not, as sup-

posed, remove any portion of the original shell, but merely prolongs its spiral volutions

Ijeyond their original extent. It is true that the enveloped portion of shell is often

corroded and imperfect; but this is owing to its having been in a dead and decayed

condition before the sponge began to grow : for in other cases the shell is sound,

full- sized, and with a perfect mouth ; and yet the spiral cavity is continued beyond it

for several volutions, through the substance of the sponge. In a specimen now pro-

duced   is  a  perfect  shell  of the  Nassa  macula,                                 a    small  species of univalve                                                                                  and yet the
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

sponge has grown to such an extent as to suggest the idea of having been modelled on

the much larger species, Na.isa reticulata. The continuation of the spiral cavity

through the sponge is evideritly due to the presence of the hermit crab, round whose

spiral body the sponge continues to grow, beyond the margin of the original shell. On

first noticing this peculiarity, it occurred to me that it might throw light on the very

remarkable spiral tube, filled with flint, which perforates certain fossil sponges from

tbe chalk, as described by Mr. Charlesworth in the Geological Section. It appears,

however, that the tubes in the fossil sponges do not taper, like those which in the

recent sponge are modelled on the continually enlarging body of the hermit crab, and

consequently the nature of the former structure still remains to be explained.

On Preserving the Balance between Vegetable and Animal Organisms in
                    Sea Water. By Robert Warington.

The public were first indebted to Mr. "Warington for a statement of the conditions

in which animals could be kept in fresh water without changing the water. It is not

suflicient that there be plants alone ; but where the higher animals such as fish are kept,

it is necessary that some beings should exist which will feed on the decaying vege-

table matter. This desideratum is supplied by the various forms of phytophagous
MoUusca. The author's success with fresh water led him to try experiments with sea
water, and the results of his investigations were given in this paper. The most im-

portant fact established was, that marine aninials could be kept in sea water without

changing in the same manner as in fresh. The conditions of the existence of sea-

water creatures are, however, much more varied than those of fresh; hence the dif-
ficulty had been proportionally great in arriving at a successful issue. The nature of

the plants in the first place is a matter of importance. The author found that the

green sea-weeds answered better than the red or brown. In introducing animals they

should be healthy and uninjured. Those should not be put together which devour each

other.      Ciabs,  especially  the    common  crab,                                  are  very   destructive                                                   so are gobies, bleu-
                                                                                                                                                             ;

nies, and rock-fish. The sea water should be kept of a proper gravity. It should be

about 1-026 at a temperature of 60░. Rain or distilled water should be added from

time to time to supply any loss. All dead animal or vegetable matter of any kind

phould be removed.

                 GEOGRAPHY AND ETHNOLOGY.

On the Influence of the Invasion of the Danes and Scandinavians, in Early
      Times, on certain Localities in England. By Sir C. Anderson.

Having lately visited Denmark and the northern parts of Europe, the author
had been much struck with the similarity pervading the Danish and English

languages, and he had thought it might not be deemed superfluous if he ventured
to lay before the Meeting some of the results of his inquiries. The similarity he
ascribed to the influence which the Danes possessed when they made a conquest of
this island, and planted themselves as settlers in it. Sir Charles proceeded to give

several examples in support of his assertion.

          On the Dialects North and South of the Humber compared.
                             By Charles Beckett.

   Mr. Beckett commenced by observing that the boundaries of English counties
were various, and often arbitrary, the most natural being rivers. The river Hum-
ber, from its width and length,'has always formed a most distinct boundary, not
only between two diflferent counties, but also between two classes of peasantry,

--difl^ering much in many respects, in origin, physiognomy, manners, conformation,

and dialect. Abundant evidence exists of Danish origin in the names of towns

and villages in both counties; no less than 212 places terminating in "by" in

Lincolnshire, whilst in the north and east ridings of Yorkshire 135 of the same
were found. This termination always points out a Danish origin. Several other
Danish names of places, persons, and things, are also found. The distinction
between the peasantry north and south of the Humber cannot escape the attentive
observer. The Lincolnshire peasant is somewhat more phlegmatic, his physiognomy
less marked and acute, and the face more oval in form than that of the York-
shireman. His manner is more amiable and polite, but less decisive and acute.
This harmonizes not only with his own appearance, but, singularly, also with the
general mildness of the aspect of the landscape around him. These inquiries are
the more interesting, because the progress of civilization, increased travelling facili-
ties, and the lapse of time, all tend rapidly to efface ethnological distinctions. The
successive irruptions of the Roman, Saxon, Danish, and Norman people into this
country, were analogous to the warping of low land by successive tides ; the exist-
ing language being a rich alluvium left by them all. Yorkshire has probably several
dialects; Lincolnshire, two, according to Halliwell, the north and the south.

--Both agree in the broad pronunciation of many syllables as, for instance,

changing one into two : as, sea, sea-ah ; seat, se-at ; beast, bee-ast. Both use many
archaic words, each county, however, having its own. The intonations and
inflexions of the voice vary also in the two counties. But the chief difference hes in
the relative value of the two vowels i and o. These are rendered ei in Yorkshire, and

 double or long i in Lincolnshire : as, wife, weife, wiife ; life, leife, iiife, respectively.
These apparently trivial difl'erences are in fact sufficient to change the whole character

of the vernacular speech. The o also has similar varieties ; thus in Yorkshire we
have now, noo, and thou, thoo. In Lincolnshire these would be thaou, naou. Some
other characteristics were also mentioned. On the whole the Lincolnshire dialect
 is more soft and agreeable, contains fewer obsolete words and accents, and ap-
 proaches more nearly to pure speech. The paper closed by inquiring how far
 climate and the social history and progress of the two counties might have operated,
along with some difl'erences of origin, in leading to these probably transient eth-

 nological distinctions.

 Substance ofa Topographical Essay on the Navigation ofthe Rivers " Plata,"

   " Parana," " Paraguay," " Vermejo," and " Pilcomayo." By Herman

    C. DwERHAGEN.

    In 1828 M. Herman C. Dwerhagen published some observations on the immense

 importance of the free navigation of the river Plata and its various ramifications to
 the Republics of Buenos Ayres and Bolivia, which, he complains, met with no
fi REPORT 1853.

attention either from natives or foreigners, because they were unacquainted with
the geography of both these Republics. This consideration has induced him to

publish a map, which, although on a small scale, he considers sufficient for the
object he had in view, although it only contains the names of the chief towns
and such places as the navigation of the rivers lead to. The author states
that the navigation of the river " Plata" would eternally unite the territories of
Buenos Ayres and Bolivia, as it is navigable from its mouth in 35░ S. latitude, to
the junction of the Jauru with the Paraguay in 16░ S. latitude, being an inland

navigation of 19░ in extent ; the principal provinces in Bolivia, which would be directly

benefited by the free navigation of the Paraguay (a branch of the River Plata), are

Moxos, Chiquitos, and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.
    These extensive territories, the most fertile in Bolivia, about 43,000 square leagues

in extent, produce little or nothing at present, compared with what they might

produce if they had an outlet for their products, which consist of sugar, rice, coffee,
indigo, cocoa, cotton (that of Moxos being one of the best in the world), grain,
many kinds of valuable drugs, and amongst them bark, dyewoods, tobacco, canes,
numerous kinds of wood of the most beautiful description, hides, tallow, &c,,

articles which cannot on account of their bulk be sent over the Cordilleras to a
port on the Pacific, as the expense of the carriage would exceed their value on their
arrival there. The author considers these territories as the most choice in the Republic,

and in proof states that they met the especial favour of the Jesuits, and have now

the advantage of being peopled by industrious and intelligent Indians ; and all that

is wanted is the introduction of steam-navigation to bring forth the natural capabi-
lities of the country, and to produce a most extensive commercial intercourse betwixt
the States of Buenos Ayres and Bolivia, in lieu of the present slow mode of com-
munication by vessels. These are sometimes made fast to a tree for a fortnight
waiting for a fair wind, during which time the whole extent of the navigation might
be accomplished by a steam-vessel ; so that a large territory, now producing but
little, might, by having proper stations on the Paraguay and the aid of steam
navigation, become productive in the most extraordinary degree, and greatly in-
crease its population. At present, the only port which Bolivia turns her attention
to is Lamar, alias Cobija, on the Pacific, but by the plan now under consideration,
the intercourse with Buenos Ayres and Europe would be made easy and constant,
and the navigation round Cape Horn avoided. The passage from Buenos Ayres to
latitude 16░ 20', that is, to the mouth of the river Jauru, might be made in about

a fortnight as soon as the navigation of the river should be properly understood,
allowing the same rate of time as is required for an equal distance on the river
Mississippi, and the return would be effected in less than half the time. The mouth
of the Jauru is on the same parallel of latitude as the town of Santa Anna, the capital

of the province of Chiquitos, and distant from it about 70 leagues, and is a much
less distance from various other towns of the same province. From the capital of
Matagroso it is about 73 leagues, and about 100 leagues from the nearest towns in

the province of Moxos.
    This steam navigation being once established, the inhabitants of Bolivia might

with ease bring all their own products down to Buenos Ayres and Montevideo, and
take back in return such articles as they might require, all of which would be

found at either place at reasonable prices. All these remarks apply with equal force
to the noble river Pilcomayo, which is navigable nearly as far as Chuquisaca and
Santa Cruz de la Sierra ; thus by means of this celebrated river, which runs through
a most fertile country, supplies of sugar, coffee, cotton, tobacco, &c., and in fine

all the products of the East and West Indies and Brazil, everything which
nature is capable of producing within the tropics, might be received. The navigation
of the Pilcomayo is said to be obstructed by three falls, which might perhaps be
remedied ; but if not, such steam-boats would have to be constructed as would
navigate betwixt them, and proper arrangements made to facilitate the transhipment
of the goods from one steam-boat to another. All this would attract the attention of
the Indians and bring about a trade with them, for they would soon begin to cul-
tivate all kinds of tropical productions ; in addition to this, on the banks of this river,
honey, wax, skins, and many other articles are to be found, besides the finest wood
in the world ; and in fine, the navigation of the " Pilcomayo" would more rapidly
promote the civilization of the Indians of the Chaco, and of that part through which

A Sketch of the Progress of Discovery in the Western Half of New Guinea,

  from the Year 1828 tip to the Present Time. By G. Windsor Earl.

This paper is a continuation of an essay on the same subject by Mr. Earl, which

appeared in the Transactions of the Geographical Society in 1837. In 1849 the

Dutch war- schooner Circe was sent by the Netherlands Government to explore the

north coast of New Guinea, for the purpose of choosing a site for another settlement.

Port Dory and the trading ports on the shores of the Great Bay were investigated ; after
which the Circe proceeded to the eastward along the coast, intending to examine

Port Humboldt, but contrary winds prevented her from entering the bay, after having

arrived within a few miles of the head. Nevertheless, the information collected was

considered sufficient to authorize the establishment of a settlement, and a garrison,

consisting of burghers, or native militia, was fixed there in the early part of 1852.

Mr. Earl is of opinion that this settlement is likely to prove useful to shipping em-

ployed in the traffic between India and the west coast of America, as the neighbour-

ing coast has hitherto afforded no place of refuge for distressed vessels, which is so
much the more necessary from the savage character of the inhabitants. The only

discovery of importance made during the voyage of the Circe was between Dobie

and the Arimoa Islands, where the low land, through an extent of nearly 100 miles,

was found to be the delta of a large river, called Ambermo by the natives, which,

from the immense quantity of alluvium that has been deposited' at its mouth, form-

ing a shallow bank, extending many miles out to sea, may be a river of importance,

affording access to the interior. Some mountains were seen far inland from the

mouth of the river, which were conjectured to be the same lofty range seen from

the south-west coast in 1828, and supposed, from their white appearance, to be

Acovered with snow.  lithographed sketch of this range, by one of the artists

attached to the Dutch Expedition of 1828, accompanied the paper.

                On the Currents of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

                          By A.G. FiNDLAY, F.R.G.S.

    The progress of meteorological science having been pre-eminently fostered by the
British Association, it was thought that one hitherto much neglected, but very im-

portant branch of it, would form a fitting subject for their consideration. When it is

remembered that of the surface of our planet, the proportion of water to land is at
least 391 to 100, or nearly four times greater in area, and that the phaenomena of
the atmosphere must be exhibited much nearer their normal condition at sea than
on land, amid the infinite variety of terrestrial disturbances, the nature of oceanic
circulation must be allowed to be of no small importance in the generalization of
atmospheric phaenomena, and the distribution of climate.

   Yet this branch of natural science has had as yet but few votaries. The labours
of Lieut. Maury at the National Observatory of the United States have of late
drawn attention to it, and it is hoped that England may enter into an honourable
rivalry in this domain of science. It was, however, with deference urged that the
labours of our American brethren had not, as yet, added much to our knowledge of the
North Atlantic currents, as it was left to us by the personal labours of Major Rennell,
who gave us the first memoirs on the subject as it now stands in 1778 and 1793.

   It is with the currents of the North Atlantic only that we are tolerably intimate,
but even this knowledge is imperfect, for we know nothing of submarine or subsurface
currents, though such knowledge is greatly attainable. Of the other parts of the
wide world of waters we are in great ignorance, and it is in the Pacific, the Asiatic
Archipelago, and the Indian Ocean that the real harvest of maritime meteorology is

to be gained.

   There are several difficulties in the formation of an entire system from the labours

of Rennell ; the waters constantly setting into the Sargasso Sea, the origin and con-
tinuance of the North African and Guinea currents and of the Arctic currents are

not satisfactorily explained by him, but by analogy with the Pacific currents and
further observations, these anomalies may perhaps be removed.

   The Arctic current setting southward out of Baffin's Bay and between Iceland and
Greenland, passes down Labrador and Newfoundland, and turns to the westward in

soundings along the coast of the United States as far as Cape Hatteras, in opposition
to the direction of the Gulf-stream ; this was first explained by Mr. Redfield in
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  1^7

1838. The warm Gulf-stream closes in with the land in its northern progress at

Cape Hatteras, and the line between this and the cold inner currents is a nearly
perpendicular wall of warm and cold water in juxtaposition. At the banks of
Newfoundland the Arctic current flows beneath the Gulf-stream and transports

icebergs into its warm waters. Another feature of the Gulf-stream lately elicited
by Bache and other officers of the U.S.N., its bifurcation off Cape Hatteras, may be

attributed to the recurving of that portion of the equatorial current which flows
to the northward of the Bahamas. Between Porto Rico and the Bermuda Islands,

some singular phaenomena were observed in May 1850 by Lieut. Walsh, U.S.N.,

the currents at the depth of 126 fathoms flowing in opposite directions on consecu-
tive days, generally with greater velocity, and always different in direction to the
surface current, indicating a sort of eddy. The Gulf-stream does not stop at the
Azores, as was supposed by Rennell, but a portion is propelled toward the Bay of
Biscay, and producing the temporary Rennell's or 'thwart- channel current, and
probably impelled by the prevalent S.W. wind, it reaches the western shores of the
British islands and the coast of Norway, causing the climates of these countries to
be in marked contrast to those of Greenland and Labrador in the same latitudes. It

also reaches the S. and W. shores of Iceland, as shown by Capt. Irminger of the

Danish Navy. The portion which strikes the coast of Portugal passes southwards,
forming the North African current, and south of Cape Verde and Cape Roxo it
turns to the westward into the great equatorial current, and does not probably form
the initial portion of the Guinea current flowing eastward into the African Bights.
The equatorial current, with less regularity on its eastern side, but constantly on
the western, flows from east to west within the tropics, and the northern portion
forms the commencement of the Gulf-stream ; that southward of Cape S. Roque on
the Brazil coast, flows southward as the Brazil current, whence it is deflected to the

eastward as the Southern Connecting Current across the Atlantic into the Indian
Ocean south of the Agulhas Bank off the Cape of Good Hope. The Agulhas cur-
rent flowing to the west around the Cape, and then along the west coast of Africa

northwards to the Bight of Biafra, enters the southern portion of the equatorial
current, which flows in opposition to and in juxtaposition with the Guinea current.
The waters thus circulate around the parallels of lat. 30░ in each hemisphere, the

central portion of the North Atlantic on this line being known as the Sargasso (or

weedy) Sea.
   The Guinea Current, a warm stream setting to eastward, or in opposition to the

equatorial currents, along the coast of Guinea as far as Fernando Po and Princes'
Island, has been attributed to a prolongation of the North African current ; but
why this latter should turn to the east instead of to leeward or to west has not
been explained. It was here affirmed to be an independent stream, originating in
mid-ocean, in the zone of equatorial calms, between the N.E. and S.E. trade-winds,
and the true character of which is cleared up by the existence of a similar current in
the Pacific, which was first placed on the charts laid before the Meeting, and pre-

sently alluded to.

   In describing the currents of the Pacific Ocean, we enter upon comparatively a
new subject; but from a collection of observations arranged on the charts laid before
the meeting some new features and extended knowledge may be established. It may
be asserted, however, that the waters of the Pacific do not appear to move with
so great velocity and apparent regularity as in the North Atlantic, and this espe-
cially so in its south-western portions. The southernmostmovement is in the Antarctic
current, moving with a velocity apparently of 10 to 35 miles a day from southwards
towards the north and east, down to lat. 33░ or 34░ S. Of many particulars we are
still ignorant, which is to be regretted, as it has an important bearing upon the track
of our Australian homeward-bound ships. It is analogous to the Southern Con-
necting Current in the Atlantic, and, as has been demonstrated by Duperrey, it

strikes the west coast of Patagonia about the parallel of Chiloe, one portion passing
south and east around Cape Horn, and carrying the drift-wood to the Falkland
Islands, and even 900 miles eastward of them. This current also flows past Tristan

d'Acunha to the E.N.E., and also past the islands south of New Zealand. The

northern branch of this cold antarctic current is a remarkable one, and was first de-
monstrated by Humboldt in 1802, and hence called the Peruvian or Humboldt's
Current. It is a moving mass of cold water, of great depth, moving northwards
--78 BBPORT 1853.

along the American coast, as far as Cape Blanco, whence it is deflected to the

W.N.W. towards the Galapagos Islands on the equator, where it produces some

singular effects : there appears to be a constant struggle between these cold waters

and those of the very warm counter current to the northward. Henceforward this
current must be considered as forming the initial portion of the great South Equa-
torial current, which flows in a westerly direction between 4░ N. and 26░ S. But
in its progress it has many variations, in its eastern portion, and especially among

the archipelagos in the central portion of its course. Notwithstanding these ex-

ceptions, which cannot be further noticed in this abstract, it assumes the true character
of a strong westerly stream about the islands north-east of Australia, and a portion

passing to north-west by the New Hebrides and New Caledonia, has been termed

Rossel's Drift; but this portion is not constant. It runs strongly past the north

coast of New Guinea, but between the neighbourhood of the New Hebrides and
Torres Strait there does not appear to be any well-marked current. A portion of
the South Equatorial Current, south of New Caledonia, is turned to W.S.W. to-
wards the Australian coast, and thence descends to the southward, a warm stream

of 1 or 2 miles an hour, to the southern part of Australia, where it turns eastward,
joined by the current through Bass's Strait and south of Van Dieraen's Land.

Thus, on a minor scale, it resembles the Atlantic Gulf-stream or the Brazil current,

and appears to circulate around the space between New Zealand and Austraha.

   The Northern Equatorial Current flows from east to west in the Pacific, between
lats. 10░ N. and 24░ N. There is a paucity of observations on the eastern portions
of its course, and it has no well-marked commencement, as is the case with the
Southern Equatorial Current ; but it is strong and regular in many portions of its
progress, and it may be traced with great exactness through the various ranges of
islands which it traverses (the authorities for which were cited) ; and having brought
the great mass of tropical waters across the breadth of the North Pacific, and, as is
the case with the southern portion, with a gradual augmentation of heat, it has been
usual to consider that it then passed onwards through the Asiatic archipelago. But
in giving a connected view of the Pacific currents, it is confidently stated that some

very important branches of the subject have been entirely overlooked, or only slightly

hinted at. Two currents, at least, of immense magnitude have not yet appeared on

our physical charts, and were placed for the first time in a Directory for the Pacific
Ocean, in 1851, by the author. The authorities and details for these currents were
laid before the meeting. One of these is a great belt of water lying under the zone
of tropical calms, and flowing to the eastward ; and a second was a Gulf- stream of
the Pacific, hinted at by M. Tessan in 1837-44 as perhaps existing in the central
portion, but which was here traced to Japan, and hence named the Japanese

current.

   The Japanese current is a continuation of the Northern Equatorial Drift, which
being obstructed by the Philippine Islands, turns to the northward towards the
Loochoo Islands and Japan, off the south coast of which it is a most violent north-
easterly stream, as was demonstrated from the Japanese charts of Von Siebold and
Krusenstern, the observations of Capts. King and Gore, Krusenstern, Broughton, and
others. Its further course is manifest from the dense fogs entered by Capt. Beechey,
anditreaches the shores of Kara tschatka, as shown by M. de Tessan. Japanese junks
have been drifted and wrecked on Kamtschatka, on Kodiack, at Oregon, and at the
Sandwich Islands-- all evidences of the easterly set, and we have the observations of
Admiral Du Petit Thouars, as recorded by M. de 7"essan, for its central portion.
On its reaching the shores of America, it turns to southward, like the Gulf-stream,
andflowing southwards past the coast ofCahfornia, a portion continues towards central
America ; but the chief portion re-enters the equatorial current past the Sandwich

--Islands a fact proved by the pine timber of N.W. America drifting on to the

eastern sides of that archipelago. This current, here imperfectly developed, it is
true, must be an important assistance to vessels proceeding from China towards
Oregon, California, or Panama, following as it does the great circle route between
these places. It is thus shown that the waters of the Pacific circulate around the
parallels of 30░ N, and S. as axes.

    Between these two systems of revolution there exists another important current,
here named the Equatorial Counter Current, from its relation to the great tropical
or westerly drifts on either side of it. It is an easterly stream setting across the
              TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                  ^9

entire breadth of the Pacific between the latitudes of 4░ or 5░ and 10░ North. Only

one small portion of its course had been previously noticed. Without quoting the

observations here, it may be stated that, proceeding from west to east, the remarks

and experience of Krusenstern, Duperrey, Liitke, Hunter, Wilson, the U.S.. Explo-

ring Expedition, Du Petit Thouars, the Prussian ships Mentor and Princess Louise,

Liitke again, the Dutch frigate Koerier, Beechey, and Vancouver, besides other facts

drawn from natural phaenomena, will demonstrate    its      almost                           permanent existence
                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and these observations are almost all authentic, and above suspicion.

The current system which thus centres at Panama is most singular, and, as far as

known, is unexampled : the only approximation to a similar position is in the Bight

Weof Biafra.  have here the waters of the equatorial counter-current, frequently

those of the Peruvian current from the southward, and of the Mexican currents

almost always from the northward. The outlet as a surface current to these great

masses of water does not seem to have been detected as yet.

In assigning a cause or combination of causes for these mighty operations, we are

met with many and, at present, insuperable difl5culties. Our knowledge of many

Wemost material facts is most incomplete.  know little or nothing of the maximum

density of sea water. Dr. Marcet places it at a temperature of 22░ Fahr., M. Erman

at 25░, Col. Sabine at 42░, and Sir James Ross at 39░"5. The latter states that the

zone of equal density arising from temperature is in a mean lat. of 56░ 26' S.

Whatever may be its maximum density, it is certain that we can sink a sounding

weight to an enormous depth (8| miles of line having been run out), but the author

did not admit the experiment as satisfactory, and concludes that it has not informed

Weus of the depth of the ocean.  know little of the ratio of absorption and radiation
--of heat a most powerful cause. The effect of the rotation of the earth is difficult to

be calculated without these additional elements, nor can the accumulated action of

tides, if any, be estimated, though more exact and extended observations will doubtless

enable us to integrate all these sources of motion, and assign to each its amount of

action.

The action of the wind, it was maintained, was the chief and efficient source of

surface current action, and a diagram of the trade and passage winds was offered to

explain this. Thus the north-east and south-east trade-winds, blowing towards the

equator, impel the surface waters in the same direction ; but the winds meeting, neu-

tralize each other as to horizontal motion, and rise up, depositing their great moisture

in the deluges of the equatorial rains. From the fact of the unequal distribution of

--land and water in the two hemispheres, in the south the proportion being 100 land
--to 628 water, and in the north 100 to 154, this line of junction is to the north of

the equator ; thus the mathematical and atmospheric equators do not coincide. The

countries in south latitudes are as remarkable for dryness as those in north are for

wetness; and Panama, lying in this junction, is inundated with rain during the

--northern summer, sufficient water falling to feed the high level of any canal that

may be made with locks.

From the waters being impelled thus to the western side of each ocean, it might

readily be argued that the Atlantic would be several feet higher than the Pacific,

and such was formerly supposed to be the case ; but engineering operations have

shown that they are sensibly the same ; and this equality of level must be owing to

the compensative efi^ect of the equatorial counter-current.

The great utility of a proper knowledge of ocean currents may be made evident by

Aan example.  ship sailing from Shanghae in China to Panama, may in ignorance

follow the  apparently direct course,  a distance  of 8982  miles                            but her voyage would
                                                                                          ;

be extended by adverse winds and currents (the latter 600 or 800 miles) to the

extent of not less than 1800 or 2000 miles. But if our acquaintance were more

complete, and analogy be borne out by facts, by taking a proper course, of about

--9500 miles, she would be assisted 900 miles in her course by current and fair

winds, thus making the unknown voyage 11,000 miles, and that on correct prin-

ciples 8600, a difi"erence worthy of being appreciated in this commercial age. Again,

as to the influence of ocean currents upon commercial products. The famous Sea

Island cotton of the United States owes its superiority to the warm waters of the

Gulf-stream flowing past these sea islands. The trade-wind, passing over the Gulf-

stream, and absorbing its saline vapours, deposits them on the sea coasts in ques-

tion, and causes the peculiar growth of the long-stapled sea- island cotton. The
80 REPORT--1853.

north-east portion of Australia is now looked at with great interest as a site for
colonization. It may be predicted that a similar climate will be found there ; the
ocean, being abnormally warmer than the land, will favour the growth of cotton, as

it does on the east coast of the United States.

Manners and Customs of the Yacoutes. By Prince Ern. Galitzin, Cor-

   responding Member of the Royal Geographical Society of London. TranS'
   lated and communicated by Dr. Norton Shaw.

The Yacoutes among themselves are known by the name of Sokha. It is be-

lieved that they are of Tartar origin, which fact is confirmed by the similarity of
the tongues, as well as by a great number of usages common both to the Yacoutes

and to the Tartars. They live partly in that region of Siberia, the centre of which

is the town of Yacoutsk ; and partly also in the different districts of the Yeniseisk's
government. Their stature is middling, their complexion swarthy, and their hair

black.

As wealth among the Yacoutes consists in numerous flocks, from this circum-

stance it follows that they take care to live dispersed in small groups of two or

Athree yourtes, so as to have at hand sufficient pasturages.  certain number of

these little villages form a notchlegh, administered by a kniazetz or small prince.

Several notchleghi compose an oulouse, which is governed by a golova : these different

functions are elective. The inhabitants of a notchlegh call themselves tjonobout, or

of the same kind. When they make an election, each elector deposits his vote in a
box divided in as many compartments as there are candidates ; then the votes are

counted, and the candidate who has obtained the largest number is proclaimed.

Besides, it is always in the power of the governed to depose the chief with whom

they are dissatisfied, in order to proceed to a new election. The district of Yakoutsk

contains six ouloiises, with a population of about 40,000 ; there are besides, about

30,000 yacoutes settled in the government of Yeniseisk and in other parts of Siberia.

   Their little boats made with the birch-tree's bark, called vefotchki, are constructed
with much skill ; the seams, after having been laid on with tar, become waterproof.
Besides this, they make use of a kind of canoe, made with the trunk of a tree. la

the building of it they begin by making on one side of the trunk a longitudinal cleft,
which does not quite extend itself to the extremities ; this cleft is next widened gra-
dually by means of wedges larger and larger, so as to make a sloping opening,

which, when wide enough, forms the interior of the small craft. In order to render

it more spacious, sometimes they add side-planks at the upper part.
   The winter's yourtes of the Yacoutes have the form of truncated pyramids. They

are square. To construct them, they make use of poles fixed in the ground in an
inclined position, and they spread on them a mixture of dung and soil. The roof is

flat and made with planks of birch-tree's bark, which possesses the property of being
almost inaccessible to rottenness. Seldom any floor is to be found. The hearth or
tchouval occupies the centre ; above there is a chimney made with planking laid on
with clay. This dwelling, however light be its construction, is sufficiently warm to

be able to live in it in the winter season ; besides, it offers the advantage of being
constantly ventilated by means of the hearth, which being always lighted, purifies

the air. During the summer months, the Yacoutes construct for their use teraporaiy

yourtes without hearth in the localities to which they remove in the hay-harvest
season. There is a Yacoute among the wealthy of the country who possesses as

many as 1000 horses. However, being impossible to gather a sufficient quantity of

hay for feeding all of  them,  the  owner  feeds  only a  certain number of  them                     the
                                                                                                   ;

others wander about and get grass and moss by removing the snow with their fore-

hoofs.

   The tail forms an indispensable part of the costume of the Yacoutes ; both men
and women wear it so long, that in order to support it they tie it behind round the
waist. The summer costume of the men consists of a kaftan (a Turkish vest) de-
scending to the knees, made with China tissue or with cloth, lined all round with
some stuff of a showy colour. For their feet they have boots with a soft sole. The

Sarama is a kind of buskin made with horse-hide which is waterproof. Trowsers

of reindeer-skin, a cap and gloves which have only the thumb, complete their gar-

ment. This costume is common to both sexes. In winter, for the simple kaftan.

they substitute a furretl dress. They wear also torbases or furred boots having the

hair outside. During this severe weather the traveller puts on a large riding-coat,

called sana'iak, made with reindeer-skin, having equally the hair outside ; he applies
upon his forehead, cheeks, and ears, pieces of fur made on purpose, and surrounds

his knees with soutouvi or bands. The furred robe which the women wear in winter,

is called parJca. It is made with reindeer-skin, and has the form of a long shirt.
The sleeves and the collar are trimmed with furs of the finest quality. The dress

of the wealthy Yacoutes is often very expensive.

   The Yacoutes are kind and officious; hospitality towards strangers is one of

their virtues. At the same time they are suspicious, mistrustful, and timid. When

occasion requires it, they are extremely sober, and a little sora or sour butter

suffices for their nourishment ; but as soon as necessity has ceased to compel them,

they become such gluttons as to render it difficult to give an idea how far their

Agluttony goes.  Yacoute is capable of devouring an extraordinary quantity of

meat ; but cares Uttle about its quality or its freshness. The entrails of the animals

and the ox's hide are aliments which do not cause him any disgust. To eat a fresh

ox-hide, they are satisfied with putting it for a little while under hot ashes in order to

make the liair fall off.  Fat in a liquid state  is  one of their most exquisite dainties
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

they feed upon it without measure. Among them the faculty of being able to eat

much is considered as a kind of merit fit to draw upon them respect. It is not

uncommon to hear them say, when they praise some one of their people, "outio

asatchi khisi 1" namely, that man there eats well.

The chamans or sorcerers continue to exert a great influence on this credulous

people. They feign to entertain relations with the souls of the dead, and by this

means often extort from the relatives of the dead, with the pretence of obeying

an injunction come from the other world, furs and even cattle. It is well known

that these jugglers give themselves up to the practice of gross sorcery.

The Yacoutes have for the bear a kind of superstitious fear ; they believe that in

this animal the spirit survives the body. In spite of this, they do not scruple to

shoot a bear and to eat its flesh ; but it is by observing certain forms which they
suppose have the power to turn aside the witchcraft. Imagine some Yacoutes

travelling, and in crossing a forest that they should meet a bear. All begin by

taking off^ their caps, lavishing upon him many salutations, and calling him by

the name of (i/ioiie (lord), of worthy old man, of good father, and so on. In the

meantime they beseech him, in the most humble terms, to allow them to continue

their journey, assuring him, that instead of forming any bad design against his

lordship, on the contrary, they entertain the greatest respect for him. But whilst

addressing these fine words to the animal, our cunning Yacoutes go forward, choose

a tree suitably situated, in order to be safe from behind, and then shoot the animal

dead. This first point settled, they make haste to skin it, and having cut it into pieces

without breaking the bones, which they put aside (it will soon be seen for what rea-

son), they cook the said pieces. During the preparations, a man of tlie same party

has taken care to knead witli clay lightly moistened, a little statue representing

Boenai, the Great Spirit. The meat being cooked, the caldron is raised in address-

ing a prayer to Boenai and to the Spirit of the forest. According to the beHef of

the Yacoutes, each forest is placed under the direct influence of a spirit. Then they

sit down round the smoking soup, and each of the guests takes care to pour on the

fire the first spoonful of gravy. Then the feast begins. Whilst it lasts, the guests

often apostrophize the ghost of the bear which they have thus despatched. " No," say
they, " don't believe us capable of having perpetrated such a murder. Among us,

poor Yacoutes, the art of making guns and deadly balls is unknown. They are

either some Russians or Toungouses who have done the evil deed." After the repast,

the bones of the animal are carefully put together, wrapped up with the idol in a
piece of birch-tree bark, and then hung up to a tree. " You see it well," they go on
repeating during the ceremony, " far from being murderers, it is on the contrary we
who gather together here the bones of this bear killed by others."

  Marriage is performed without any kind of ceremony. When a Yacoute wishes

to obtain the hand of a girl, he must agree with the father respecting the price to be

paid for her ; this purchase-money is called the kolim. The wedding and the banquet

which accompanies it, take place in the house of the father-in-law of the bridegroom,

but at the expense of the latter. The rejoicings are prolonged twice twenty-four

hours. During the Jcourourne (banquet) they drink a quantity of Jcoumise, a kind of
fermented beverage made with mares'-miik ; more rarely brandy distilled from corn,
which is scarce and consequently expensive. They eat horse-flesh, beef, and moles
as dishes of the first course. As a second course, they serve on the table a dish
filled with drippings. This is considered the most refined dainty. The khamiak,
which is a large spoon, goes all round, and each guest drinks plentifully of the nec-
tar. There are some gluttons among them, who, after having crammed their stomach
with meat, are still capable of swallowing a hundred spoonsful of melted fat. The
bridegroom cannot take away his bride until the kolim has been wholly paid for;
otherwise sbe continues to live with her father. Sometimes the debt is only dis-
charged by instalments, paid at long intervals, and at each of these instalments, the
husband comes to spend a few days with his wife.

On Iceland, its Inhabitants and Language. By John Hogg, Esq., M.A.,

   F.R.S., L.S.,R.G.S. Sfc, Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society of Lite-

    rature.

   The author commenced this paper by observing, that the large volcanic land on
the western boundary of Europe, surrounded by the North Atlantic Ocean, and
partly within the Arctic Circle, is only known in England under the inhospitable
name of Iceland. The like inhospitable name of ' Ullima Thule ' having been by
some geographers assigned to it, he showed that there was no reasonable foundation
for such an opinion. Mr. Hogg said, if what Solinus stated was correct, viz. " that
Thule was five days' sail from Orkney," he conceived that one of the Feroe Isles
would better correspond : but, on the other hand, Tacitus, in his account of the

--circumnavigation of Britain, writes, that the Orkneys were then discovered, and

" from thence Thule was visible," consequently Mainland, the chief of the Shetland
Isles, which is quite mountainous, would very probably be the land there discernible.

No Roman remains have been found in Iceland ; but if that nation had extended its

conquests to its desolate shores, they would doubtless have continued their explora-
tions to Greenland and the northern coasts of America. Such however was not

the case. And since the island itself, as far as is yet known, is altogether volcanic,
it may not have been in existence at that early period ; but, like the ancient Isle of
Thera (hodie Santorin), or that very modern one lately called " Graham Islet," ia
the Mediterranean, it may have sprung up through volcanic agency, subsequently
to the time of the Roman Empire. History does not state when Iceland was first
discovered, and nothing certain is known of it till the ninth century of our aera;
though from the Icelandic Annals it would seem that it had been before then tem-
porarily inhabited, perhaps, as some have asserted, by the Irish.

   The author briefly gave a description of the settlement there by the Norwegians,
or Nordmenn of Scandinavia. He then more fully pointed out its geographical
position, and compared its form and extent with those of Ireland, obsei-ving that if
the latter island could be moved so as to bring its present east side with the point
called "Wicklow Head," due south, the general appearance of Ireland and Iceland
would better agree. He showed that both islands possess many fine bays, inlets, or
fiords, and havens ; also many rivers, lakes, and tracts of bog or marsh. Iceland
is however very much less fertile, and is more covered with lofty mountains, which
attain to between 6000 and 6500 feet in height. Those termed in Icelandic
Jiikulls, i. e. 'ice mounts,' occupy the central parts of the island, and run out to
the N.W. and N.E. From their melted snows and glaciers, the Geysers and other

intermittent hot-springs are principally supplied.

   Mr. Hogg then compared the population of the two islands, and noted that
although Ireland had been during some years, previous to the census in 1851,
reduced about 20 per cent, by emigration and other causes, still it numbered rather
fewer than 6,661,840 souls ; and the city of Dublin itself estimated somewhat above
238,300, whereas Iceland, once possessing 100,000 inhabitants, now reckoned only
48,000 over its whole superficies, and the entire population of its capital Reikjavik

does not exceed 500.

This comparative account sadly exhibited the deserted state of a country very

similar to Ireland in its natural dimensions. The interior or central parts of Ice-

land are not inhabited, and are but little known to the traveller.

The author, after describing the general aspect of the island, and its total want of

trees, added a brief description of Mount Hecla, and its three somewhat conical

summits. As the poets of Grecian antiquity had dedicated one of the tops of the

Bifid Parnassus to Apollo, and the second to Bacchus, so he conceived the Skalds

or Bards of Iceland ought to have assigned the first summit of the Trifid Hecla to

Odin, the second to Frea (Friga), and the third to Thor.

According to the recent survey and measurement of Prof. Bjcirn Gunnlaugsson,

the altitude of the highest top of Hecla is 4961 Danish feet, or somewhat above 5100

AEnglish feet.  brief description by a late traveller of the view from one of its

summits was given.

The author alluded to the wonderful Geysers, and other boiling springs, which

after certain intervals spout jets of water and steam high into the air, and proved

that some of them had existed for at least six centuries and a half.

   Then followed an account of the climate in summer and winter ; the aurora
borealis, and other meteorological pheenomena ; also of the continuance in June and

July of sunshine during the night, and of the want of it in the day through the cor-

responding period in December and January.

   An enumeration of some of the chief volcanic products and minerals was made j

and the poverty of vegetation, the few wild emimals, and those which are domesticated,

were noticed.

Next, concerning the ethnology of the Icelanders. These were characterized as

a plain, but well-made, not very robust race, of good height, with reddish hair and
blue eyes. They are short-lived, content, and moral, although much addicted to

drinking. They are naturally lazy, phlegmatic, and not very hospitable. Profess-

ing Lutheran tenets, they are religious, fond of their native land, and well-educated.

Crimes are very rare. Owing to the severity of the climate, they are warmly clad;

both sexes wearing old-fashioned garments of a coarse dark cloth, Wadmal. The

houses, or rather huts of the lower class, are low and miserable, and from the

scarcity of timber, are mostly built of lava. They are very filthy and want fresh air.

Fuel is scarce ; peat, as well as the remains of fish and birds, are its substitutes.
   Their diet consists of salt fish, fermented milk, rancid butter ; also train oil is

much esteemed. Salted mutton is used, and fresh fish in summer. Wheaten bread

is scarcely ever to be had ; sometimes barley cakes are eaten, but the usual bread of
the peasantry is made from the poor flour of the Iceland Lichen {Cetraria Islandica),

In summer travelling is efl^ected on horses ; in winter in sledges, which are the

only carriages known.                                                 ^-

The occupations of the Icelanders  are  chiefly breeding horses,      catlle and sheep
                                                                                                                                        ;

fishing for cod and seals, and in certain rivers for salmon ; salting and drying fish and

mutton. Much attention is given to the care of Eider ducks, their down being a

most valuable export. Little is done in commerce as yet, except by the Danish

merchants. The other principal exports are dried salt fish, fish roe, pickled mutton,

skins, fur, wool, feathers, train oil, and tallow. Brandy and salt, with most of the

other necessaries of life, are imported; so are manufactured goods.

   Nearly all the lower classes can read and write ; and in every hut is found the
Bible. During their long winter, the Icelanders spend much time in reading, at

which season both sexes knit and weave. Small plots of ground are here and
there cultivated for gardens, in which some common vegetables are with difiiculty

grown ; there are no corn-fields ; only meadows and pastures in the valleys ad-

joining upon lakes and streams.

The Icelanders have several diseases, which are very fatal*, and vast numbers of

the children die when infants.

Mr. Hogg made mention of the Icelandic language, which is the original Nor-

wegian, or Norse, scarcely at all altered by length of time, or contact with other

nations. It belongs to the Scandinavian branch of the great Teutonic family of

many ethnologists ; or, according to Jacob Grimm, it forms a dialect of his fourth
division of the Germanic language. The author is more inclined to esteem it, with

Rask and later authorities, a sister language, rather than a mere cognate dialect of

   * Dr. Latham obser\'ed (after the paper was read), that, according to Dr. Schleisner, the

temperature of the blood of the Icelander is sensibly higher than that of any other European.

                                                                                                   6*

the German. It is characterized by the absence of aspirates and gutturals, and thus
possesses a softer sound and pronunciation.

    This dialect of the Scandinavian remained unchanged, whilst that of the Danes
having altered much, it could no longer be termed Donsk Tunga, ' Danish tongue,' as
the language which prevailed throughout the North and in Iceland was at first called.
It then came under the appellation of Norraena Tunga, the ' Northern tongue,' or
Norse, that afterwards designated more especially the Norwegian dialect. The
latter continued the same for a long time, while that of Sweden soon altered. In
the ninth century the Norwegian colonists took into Iceland their language, where
it continued in its purity for ages. But the ancient dialect in Norway at length ex-
perienced a great alteration in consequence of the union of the country with Denmark,
and thus Norwegian and Danish soon assimilated and became the same.

    Consequently, the original Norwegian, which still continued to be used in Ice-
land, obtained a new and more fit title, viz. Islenzka Tunga, the ' Icelandic tongue.'
Indeed, this identical language is now so little altered, that the lower class of Ice-
landers still read and understand the Sagas and ancient Eddaic poems.

    The author said, " want of time forbade him from adding any particulars con-
cerning the structure or grammatical peculiarities of the Islenzka Tunga : " he there-
fore concluded by giving some examples of Icelandic words, for the purpose of show-
ing how similar they are to the corresponding vulgar words still spoken by our com-
mon people in this part of the north of England. These had most likely been in-
troduced by the Nordmenn--or Northmen of Scandinavia under the general term

--of Danes when they spoke the same original Norwegian as the Icelanders do, during

their invasions in the ninth and tenth centuries of this portion of Northumbria.

   According to Adelung (Mithridates, vol. ii. p. 305), Von Troil, in his 'Letters

from Iceland,' has reckoned four principal dialects (hauptmundarten) of the Ice-
landic. These, however, the author apprehended, only present very slight differences,

except in the sea-ports where many Danish words are used, inasmuch as the same
pronunciation prevails throughout the island, and is found to be, even among the

lower class, nearly identical.

   Mr. Hogg illustrated his observations by pointing out the localities mentioned
on two recent and beautiful maps of Iceland from the collection of Icelandic maps in
the possession of the Royal Geographical Society of London. These are entitled
"Uppdrattr Islands," and were executed under the direction of Mr. O. N. Olsea
from the measurements of Mr. Bjorn Gunnlaugsson, Professor of Mathematics at
the College of Bessastadt in Iceland. They were published in 1844 and IS49 by the
Islenzka Bokmentafelag, or Icelandic Literary Society at Copenhagen.

Notes on a Journey to the Balkan, or Mount Hccmus, from Constantinople.

   By Lieut. Gen. Jochmus. Drawn up and communicated by John

   Hogg, M.A., F.R.S., L.S., R.G.S. ^c, For. Sec. R.S.L.

   Previous to the reading of this communication, Mr. Hogg stated, that the author
is Lieut." General Jochmus, a native of Hamburg, long an officer in the army of the
Sultan, and afterwards Minister for Foreign Affairs of the administrator of the Ger-
manic Empire. It describes a journey to the Balkan from Constantinople, which was
undertaken in October 1847; but the notes were written in that capital in January
1848. Time did not allow of the full reading of this valuable communication, and
therefore Mr. J. Hogg was only able to submit to the Section certain passages from
the "Notes" themselves, but he gave a preliminary sketch of the route pursued by
the author, and of the principal objects of his journey.

   Many defiles and passes of the noble Balkan range, the Mount Hsemus of anti-
quity, so named, probably, from at/xof, a wooded district, and now called in Turkish

Emineh Dagh, which rises to about 6000 feet above the sea, were correctly described,
particularly that portion which extends from Burgas on the Black Sea to Tirnova,
the capital of Bulgaria ; also along the coast of that sea to Varna, the former Odes-
sus, and thence through the territory of the ancient Triballians to Silistria (Duro-
sterum) on the right bank of the Danube.

   The General was enabled to determine some portions of the Balkan which were
either before uncertain, or altogether unknown, and likewise to correct in several
places the great Austrian staff map. Indeed, be has shown that there are no less
than thirteen practicable defiles, besides many cross-roads, between the pass of Ke-

zanlik and Cape Emineh, and not five only, as Von Hammer enumerates. And he

observed that " the most extraordinary fact is that Marshal Diebitsch, as well as
Darius, crossed the Hasmus by roads unknown to that most learned historian of the

Turkish empire."
   General Jochmus likewise establishes several ancient localities where Darius halted

with his army. At Bunarhissar, near the Kuchuk Balkan, he unsuccessfully searched
for the ancient inscription with the letters like " nails," mentioned by Herodotus
(Melp. c. 91), and which Abdallah Aga described to him as being "in ancient
Syrian or Assyrian (Eski Souriani)," and which he "maintained having seen in the
Tekeh every day for upwards of the eight years which he passed there as a Der-
vish," But he seems to have been more fortunate in finding the clear streams of
the Teams, near the latter town, and which have been incorrectly named Teara Sugi,
or 'Teara's Waters,' by Von Hammer. He has identified the ancient river Artiscus
of Herodotus with that now named Teke, near the new Bulgarian colony of Dewlet

Agatch, in the former territory of the Odryssse.

   Mr. Hogg said it was one of the chief objects of the author to ascertain the line of
march and operations of Darius through this country, and he dwelt on the following
passage : " Darius crossed the Bosphorus on a bridge of boats connecting the two conti-
nent at the site of the present new Castles of Asia and Europe (see Gibbon, and Herod.

Melp. c. 87), encamped successively at the sources of the Tearus (Bunarhissar), and
on the banks of the Teke, or Artiscus (at Dewlet Agatch), and following the
direction of Burgas and Achioly, and subjecting the sea-towns, he passed after-
wards the Balkan by the defiles parallel to the sea-coast from Mesivria to Jowaa
Dervish, moving from south to north, by the same roads which were chosen by
Generals Roth and Riidiger, and by Marshal Diebitsch himself, who proceeded from
north to south in 1829. The Russians also in 1828, and Darius about 2300 years
before them, passed the Danube ' at that part of the river where it begins to branch
off' (Melp. c. 89), that is, near the modern Issatscha."

   The route to the Great Balkan, the true Hsemus range, which General Jochmus,
looking to the nature of the country, supposes that Alexander the Great took in his
march from Amphipoiis to the Danube, he has fixed, where Alexander must, either
at Bogasdere, or at the entrance of the neighbouring valley Charamd^re, at the foot
of one of the wildest gorges of the Balkan, have fought the battle with the
Thracians, as is recorded by Arrian (lib. i. c. 1). The aspect of those defiles, the
steepness of the mountains in parts of that ascent of the Balkan, and the distance

from Amphipoiis, caused the author to arrive at that conclusion.
   But as to the site of the battle between Alexander and the Triballians, which

occurred about 335 B.C., the General, exploring the country to the west of Varna
on the Black Sea, says, " the Parawadi river runs nearly parallel to the Hsemus and
to the Danube, and considering that from Varna, as well as from Parawadi, the
distance to Silistria is computed at twenty-four hours, or three days' march, there
can be no doubt but that the Parawadi river is the Lyginos described by Arrian
as 'distat id ab Istro, si quis .(Emum versus proficiscatur, itinere tridui.'" The
Lyginos is not stated by the historian to flow into the Ister or Danube, as the great
Austrian map and other authorities have made it, "at Dshibra Palanka, between
Nicopoli and Widdin, opposite to some islands. It is this collateral circumstance
of the islands at the mouth of the Dshibra Palanka river which most likely caused

the error, for Arrian speaks of an island of the Lyginos."

   From an examination of the district adjoining upon the two lakes of Devno to
the west of Varna, General Jochmus is persuaded that the isthmus between those
lakes, a little west of Buyuk Aladin, is the ground of Alexander's action, it being
" formed into an island by the two principal outlets of the Parawadi, or Lyginos
river, which traverses" both the lakes.

    Further, the General has thus determined Alexander's line of march and exploits

from Macedonia to the Danube. He thinks he proceeded "from Amphipoiis
(Emboli), leaves Philippi (ruins of Filibfe) and Mount Orbelus on its left, crosses

the Nesus (Carasu), and following the high road by the present Fereshik, Dimotika,
Kirklissia and Aidos, gets to the foot of Mount Hiemus, where he arrives ' on the
tenth day.' Here he fights the action with the Thracians at Bogasdere, or Charam-
dere, forces these defiles, and crosses the Haemus (Balkan) by the main road to
Parawadi, ' on the Lyginos.' From Parawadi, Alexander moves by the present
S6 REPORT--1853.

high road straight on to Silistria, but hearing of the retreat of the main body of the
Triballians towards 'the island of the river (Lyginos), whence Alexander had departed

the previous day,' he countermarches also in search of the enemy, whom he meets

and defeats on the grounds between the two lakes of Devno. Thence he arrives ' in
three days' on the Danube (at Silistria), crosses that mighty river, defeats the
Getse* ; repasses the Danube, and undertakes his expedition against the Agriani and
Paeoni." (Arrian, Exped. lib. i. c. 1-5.) " It remains," continued the author,

" to be observed, that whilst the Getse, who in the time of the expedition of Darius
against the Scythee (Herod, lib. iv.) lived south of the Danube, are found by

Alexander already on the left or northern bank of the river, in the fertile plains of
Wallachia, the Triballians, on the contrary, hold the former territories of the Getae
as far south-east as Varna."

    It is therefore "seen that Alexander has passed in his march on Silistria the
Kamshik at Koprikoi, and the Lyginos at Parawadi, at the same points chosen by
 Marshal Diebitsch in his reverse operation from Silistria, against the defiles of the
 Balkan after the battle of Kulerdja and the capture of Silistria. Arrived at Kopri-
koi, the Russian array strikes off to the east, and forces those passes of the Haemua
chosen by Darius, because it lay in the plan of the Russians, as it did formerly in those
of the Persians, to occupy first the ' sea-towns,' before continuing their operations,

--Darius from south to north, Marshal Diebitsch from north to south. Nature has

so strongly marked the best amongst the difiicult passes of the Heemus, that, at the
distance of very many centuries, the three great commanders are found to operate
by the same lines."

    General Jochmus, returning to Varna from the isthmus between the upper and
 lower Devno lakes, his guide " indicated the grounds, north of the village of

Jenishekoi', as the scene of the great battle of the 10th November 1444, a.d. Two
tumuli were pointed out to him by the denomination of Sandshak Tepe, and Murad

 Tep^. They are about the centre of the line which Sultan Murad's army of 40,000
 men must have occupied." The last named Tep^ he holds " to be the spot where
 that Sultan had ordered the lance with the treaty to be exposed to the sight of his
 indignant army, and where King Wladislaw's head was planted by its side. The
 Sandshak Tepe is the neighbouring mound, where, according to the Turkish war-
 custom, the great imperial standard was displayed."

   The ground there, as laid down in a plan in Hellert's French translation of Von
 Hammer's 'History of the Ottoman Empire,' was found to be "altogether fictitious;"

 and it is a very incorrect representation of the "battle of Varna." The General
 then gives further details of this great battle, and describes the present condition of
 the fortifications of Varna. He also mentions the attack of the Russians in 1828.

    General Jochmus made many remarks of a military nature respecting the chief
 positions, towns, and stations in this part of the Turkish dominions ; and also many
 accurate personal observations on the routes and natural features of the Balkan,
 which contribute a valuable addition at this time to our present knowledge of that
 mountainous range. There are likewise interspersed throughout his communication
 many interesting accounts of the political condition and manners of the different races
 whom he visited.

 the Great Balkan from Varna to Tirnova, and from Varna to Burgas on the Black

both in language and appearance. In Nargo, the other half of Worms, half Nucko,

and a few spots on the opposite coast, there are Swedes and Esthonians mingled.
In Manno, Kynb, parts of Osel, Moon, Dago, and patches of the continent, the

present population consists of Esthonians who have displaced Swedes. The earliest
notice of these Swedes is in the laws of the town of Hapsal, a.d. 1 294. Henry the

--Lett mentions Swedes in Reval. The local names are Swedish, Stoorby, Soderby,

Lyckholm, Kluttorp, Parsaker, &c. ; so are the personal,--Knuter, Mats, Lars,
&c. Runic letters are used in their calendars. Thursday is an unlucky day to
begin work on ; Friday a lucky one for marrying,--notions pointing to Freya and

Thor. Superstitions and legends are numerous. Dialects not fewer than 5 ; privi-

leges neither a few nor unimportant.

A colony of these Swedes from Dago has been transplanted to the parts near

Berislav, in the government of Cherson ; their localities being Schlangendorf, Mil-

hausendorf, Gamle Svenskby, and Klosterdorf.  The  date       of  this  is  recent                           that of
                                                                                                     ;

island occupations uncertain. Probably it belongs to the 9th, or 10th, or llth.

centuries, t. e. the great epoch of the Scandinavian piracy.

Going beyond the details of these small localities to the ethnology of the neigh-

bouring parts of the continent at large, we find that the displacements have been

inordinately great. The Prussians and Lieflanders belong to Prussia and Livonia

(Liefland) 'only as an Englishman does to Britain, and they are Prussians and

Livonians only as Englishmen are Britons. They occupy countries that originally

belonged to Liefa and Prussians, just as the Angles occupied countries which were

originally British. The true and original Liefs (Livonians) were Finns, of the same

branch with the present Esthonians ; indeed, a few true (Finns) Liefs exist, at the

present time, in Livonia. The Livonians, however, commonly so called, are Letts,

or Lithuanians. The true Prussians were Letts or Lithuanians ; the present Prussians

are Germans. How far, then, did the area of the Finn population akin to the

Liefs and Esthonians originally extend ?  Certainly into      Courland                                       possibly  at a
                                                                                                          ;

very early period (some centuries b.c.) to the mouth of the Elbe. And how far

extended the Lithuanian area ? Into West Prussia at least. If so, and if the west-

ward extension of the Finns be real, the direction of the Lithuanic must have been

from some part of the interior of Europe towards the coast. Did Lithuanian tribes

cross the Baltic ? The general tendency of opinion is to attribute all the commercial

or piratical activity of the Baltic tribes to the Scandinavian branch of the Germans.

The foundation of this doctrine is the name Goth. Few hesitate to consider the Goths

of Gothland (isle and provinces), the Jutes of Jutland, and the Gothones (Guttones)

of East Prussia as populations bearing a name essentially the same. Few doubt

about this name being German, and applied to Germans. Yet this fact, upon which

so much turns, is more than doubtful, a. No Germanic population can be shown

to have borne a name like g-i, previous to its having occupied the country of some

non-Germanic population, so-called ; so that the Germans of the several Goth
countries were Goths only as the Englishman is a Briton, i. e. not at all. b. The

population to which the term g-t can be shown to have been most unequivocally

and undoubtedly applied is Lithuanic (Ф. e. the old Prussian of the country of the

Guttones, Gothones, or Gythones). Reduce the inferences derived from this

erroneous assumption to their proper dimensions, and then consider the ethnology

of Scandinavia. The two provinces of Gothland, the island Gothland, the Goth-

land (so to say) of the Guttones, must be placed in the same category. But the

Guttones can no longer be made German, on the strength of their name. The

evidence of their Germanic character is reduced to the single fact of their being

found in the ' Germania' of Tacitus. This is not sufficient to stand against the pre-
ponderating facts in favour of their being Lithuanians or Prussians. The author

believes that Scandinavia (in the first instance Finn) received two streams of
occupancy and conquest ; one Lithuanic for Gothland, &c., and one German, that

spread from Norway southwards and eastwards. The chief proofs of this lie in the
admitted facts of Scandinavian ethnology interpreted diflferently. There are numerous
Lithuanic words in the Scandinavian language ; there are the political and other
peculiarities of the Goth-lands ; there are elements common to the two mythologies.
--88 UEPORT 1853.

&c. Admit nothing but Finns and Genuans, and all these points are difficulties. The
hypothesis of Lithuanic as well as a German conquest accounts for them. Jutland
was probablv a land of Lithuanic settlements, intermixed with Slavonic ones from

Pomcrania, &c.

The Jstecs.-- No offspring of parents like themselves, nor yet likely to be the

parents of offspring like themselves ; consequently no specimens of any new race

Their likeness to certain outlines on Mexican monuments not accidental. This ac-

counted for by supposing that the physical or social conditions of the locality

to which they are attributed, favour such degenerations as they exhibit; the

tendency to them being endemic. In the point nearest to their attributed locality

of which any notice is in print. Gage found the people ill-shapen and goitrous. At

the same time their appearance is not that of the Cretins of Europe : of these they

are the American analogues. An intermixture of Spanish (or other) blood, as

suggested by good authorities, would most easily account for certain points (e. g,

the hair) in which they differ from the American Indian, and approach the

Spaniard, Jew, &c.   It is doubtful, however,  whether the assumption is necessary

at the same time it is compatible with the present view. The existence of Indians

in a state of independence for one of the frontiers of Vera Paz is an actual fact.
The Lacondona Indians are in this predicament. They are also inaccessible. The

existence of Casas Grandes in the locality to which the Astecs are attributed is

likely. Upon the whole it is believed that'they come from a locality where certain
tendencies to degeneration are and have been endemic, and where there may be soine

--architectural remains, and some vestiges of independence, facts which, even if

adopted, by no means imply the truth of the so-called nariative of Velasquez, or
the details of the history of the two children. As to the name Aztec, they are only

Astecs, so far as they represent an outlying portion of the Astec empire as opposed

to Spanish America.

Notes of an Excursion to the supposed Tomb of Ezekiel. By T. K. Lynch.

   The traveller arrived at Kiffell on the 4th of May, 1848, a palace which was tra-
ditionally supposed to be the burial-place of the prophet Ezekiel. After traversing
many miles of ground, he at last came in sight of the fort, which he entered, and
requested to be conducted to the tomb of the prophet. The chief of the inhabitants of
the town, who were few, consequently accompanied him to the place, and, having tra-
versed a spacious court, they entered a large hall, supjjorted on two rows of pilastered
columns, and in the recess at the extreme end of the hall was a case resembling that
of a gigantic opera-glass, which contained a copy of the five books of Moses. The
whole of this precious manuscript was written on a single scroll, which, for conve-
nience sake, was rolled into one case as it was uncovered from another. Leading

-- --out from this hall, on the south side, was a littie dark chamber, which contained the

tomb itself ' the very grave of Ezekiel ' enclosed in a wooden case, which was
covered with English chintz, by no means of the finest texture or newest pattern.
Above the tomb arose the spiral dome, which internally was handsome, gilt and
enamelled, and was illuminated by many small lamps, kept constantly burning,
suspended over the sarcophagus. Around this hall, besides several small dark
closets for private devotions, there was another mysterious chamber, which was
lighted up by a single lamp, and contained three graves, said to be those of the
principal Jews who accompanied Ezekiel.

         On the Interior of Australia. By Augustus Petermann.

   At a time when the exploration of the unknown interior of Australia was earnestly
thought of, the probable character of that extensive region became a subject of
particular interest and of legitimate inquiry. Scarcely one-third part of Australia

could be said to have been even partially explored, and by far the largest portion
was therefore entirely unknown. This unknown interior of Australia had frequently
been a matter of speculation, at first founded on very few facts. But as our
knowledge increased, and actual facts became more numerous, the theories had been
modified. One of these hypotheses was, that the interior, to a certain extent,
consisted of a shoal sea. It was in 1814, only forty years since, when the ex-
ploration of inner Australia might be said to have been systematically commenced,

that Mr. Oxley, the first Surveyor-general of New South Wales, a man of acknow-

ledged ability and merit, pushed his investigations into the interior of that

continent. By tracing down the rivers Lachlan and Macquarie, he was checked

in his progress westward by marshes of great extent, beyond which he could

not see any land. He was therefore led to infer that the interior was occupied by a

shoal sea, of which the marshes were the borders, and into which the rivers he had been
tracing discharged themselves. This opinion was probably supported by the fact that
the mouth of the largest of the Australian rivers, the Murray, had been overlooked by
Capt. Flinders, and was not discovered till fifteen years after Mr. Oxley's discoveries,
by Capt. Sturt. In 1845, Mr. Eyre, one ofthe most distinguished explorers of Australia,
announced that he had arrived at dift'erent conclusions, namely, that the interior would
be found generally to be of a very low level, consisting of sand alternating with many
basins of dried salt lakes, or such as were covered only by shallow salt water or mud,

as was the case with Lake Torrens. He also said that it was more than probable
there might be many detached, and even high ranges, similar to the Gawler Range,
and that, interspersed among these ranges, intervals of a better or even of a rich and
fertile country, might be met with. In 1850, Mr. J. B. Jukes, in his valuable
work on 'The Physical Structure of Austraha,' stated his opinion to be that the

interior consisted of immense desert plains, which seemed to extend to the sea coast
round the Gulf of Carpentaria on the north, to that ofthe great Australian bight on
the south, and to stretch along the north-west coast to Collier Bay. The general
opinion at present entertained on this point seemed to be very similar to that of
Mr. Jukes, excepting, perhaps, that it was thought that the deserts did not reach so
far to the north, and the northern parts were copsidered to consist of some fertile
--90 REPORT 1853,

and promising regions. The chief grounds on which these deductions had been
made were the known facts as to the climate and meteorology of Australia, and the
absence of large rivers and other features. It was well known that the Australian
colonies were subject in summer to occasional blasts of what is called the hot wind,
from its extremely high temperature. This hot wind always blew from the interior;

in New South Wales and Tasmania, its direction being from the north-west, and

from the north in Port Phillip and South Australia. The breath of this wind was
like the blast from a fiery furnace, increasing the mean temperature of a summer's
day, on the westerly side of the eastern Cordillera, 40░ ; on the eastern side, both

in New South Wales and Tasmania, 25░ to 30░ ; and while during the hot wind

the thermometer rose to 100░, or even 115░ in the shade, with the southerly squall
there was sometimes a sudden fall of full 40░ in the course of half or even a quarter
of an hour. This wind swept up from the interior clouds of dust and sand, some-
times intermixed with gritty matter, large enough to strike with painful acuteness

on the face. Count Strzelecki, while sailing from New Zealand to New South

Wales, was prevented from making the harbour of Port Jackson for two successive
days, by the violence of this hot wind. Though sixty miles from the shore, the
heat exceeded 90░, and the sails of the ship were covered with a small powder by
the breeze. The hot winds were, indeed, identical with the sirocco blowing from
the great Sahara of Africa, and similar winds in other parts of the globe. It had
been justly said that these hot winds, experienced in the southern parts of Australia,
could have no other origin than by a current of air blowing over some large expanse
of burning desert, and our knowledge of the adjoining regions entirely corroborated
this assumption. The discoveries of Capt. Sturt, in his last expedition in particular,
indicated the very nest and hot-bed of the winds. The situation of Capt. Sturt's
desert was such that there was good reason to think its influences would extend to
the whole of the coasts, even to those of W^estern Australia, which were the furthest
from it, namely, about 1350 geographical miles; unless the wind blowing from it
were inteixepted or deflected in the intervening spaces by mountains, or else
ameliorated by countries of different character. The influence of the hot winds
from the Sahara had been observed in vessels traversing the Atlantic at a distance
of upwards of 1100 geographical miles from the African shores by the coating of
impalpable dust upon the sails. Mr. Petermann proceeded to describe the results of
his investigations, which tended to point to the supposition that a great part of the
interior of Australia consisted of sterile deserts ; that the Torrens Basin and Sturt's
Stony Desert formed the centre of the largest of these deserts, which probably ex-
tended from 200 to 300 miles around the latter, and that a fringe of 200 to 300 miles
extended all along the great Australian bight to Western Australia, and along the
western coast as far as the Gascoyne Basin, or even the river Fitzroy. It also
appeared to him that the whole of north-west Australia, north of Fitzroy River, as
far as the head of Carpentaria Gulf, was a region of the most promising character,
 and that from this region a spur of more or less elevated land extended as far as
the cluster of mountains discovered by Sir Thomas Mitchell, which gave birth to
many beautiful rivers flowing in all directions of the compass. This spur would
 necessarily form a bar between Sturt's desert and the Gulf of Carpentaria. It
seemed to him most probable that this promising district of north-west Australia
 extended far to the south, to the middle of the continent, and be5'ond it, at least to
the latitude of Gascoyne River. One significant fact supported the latter opinion,
 and that was the occurrence of large trees which had been floated down the rivers

--of north-west Australia, and found at their debouchures, an occurrence unknown

 in snuth-western Australia. In conclusion, Mr. Petermann said that by taking his
 suggestion in connexion with the proposed expedition of Mr. Ernest Haug, he could
 not but hail with lively satisfaction the determination by which it is hoped a portion
 of this extensive and promising district would be explored and laid open for the
 benefit of mankind.

 On a Second Journey to St. Lucia Bay, and the Adjacent Country in

                    South-East Africa. By R. W. Plante.

    Having explored the coast in the neighbourhood of St. Lucia Bay, Mr. Plante
 was desirous of going beyond that district. In the journey of which this paper
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                       91

was a notice, he lost no time in getting to that district ; and with only one deviation
to the Unga range of mountains, he passed through the Zulu country, arriving at
the river Umfaiosi in one month from Natal, in company of a party of about 200.

From this point they proceeded on foot. Two days from Umfaiosi brought them to

an arm of St. Lucia Bay ; here they had to ford the water, at a place two miles in
width, and breast deep. The maps of this part of the country represented the mouth
of the bay as communicating with the sea, whereas it runs into the river Umfaiosi.
The bay was estimated at about eighty miles in length, and of an average width of
eight or ten miles. Flamingoes, ducks, cormorants, and other water fowls were
found on its banks. After four days' journey along the banks, they diverged into
the woods, where there were large numbers of land shells, and five or six new kinds
of trees, the timber of which might prove commercially valuable. Two days from
the bay took them into the Araatatu country, a small tribe allied to Padua, and
principally distinguished from the Zulus (who are chiefly a pastoral people) by sub-
sisting more extensively on the produce of their gardens. Next to this tribe were
the Amutangus, a more powerful tribe, who combined the occupation of agricultu-
rists and hunters. In the latter character they were particularly successful, even
against the largest animals. The tilling of the ground was principally left to the
women, who worked very successfully. Their basket manufacture also might vie
with that of any country. The people were well- formed, and exhibited a high de-
gree of civilization, rarely found in these districts. The next five days' travelling was
highly monotonous ; when they crossed the Pengola, and entered the Makasan country,
a district seldom visited by the white man. The Makasans were very friendly,
but very poor, through having been at war for two years with their neighbours.
Dwarfs are very common in the district ; one, who was a kind of factotum to the
late king, being only 3 feet 7 inches high, though beautifully proportioned. Idiots,
apparently from sun-strokes, were also very common. An error on the maps was
noticed here. The river Pengola did not run into the sea, but into another river,

called the Uzatu, so that the author asserted that no river or other water could enter
the sea between Umfaiosi and Delagoa. The range of the Drachimbirgo here came
in view, and, at the point where the author turned back, they were not more than
fifty miles from the sea. After travelling about 300 miles from the Umfaiosi,

they found a wood with a stream of water running through it. Sickness becoming now
prevalent in the party, it was determined to return to Natal, which was efi^ected
with much diBSculty, owing to the rivers having swollen to such an extent as to
make it hazardous to cross them. However, this was accomplished by the assistance
of the oxen, who were good swimmers, the author twisting the tail of one of them

round his wrist, and guiding its progress with his other hand.

An Inquiry into the Variations of Climate within the Tropics, in connexion
   with the Vertical Action of the Sun and the actual Motion of the Earth,

   especially with reference to the Climate of the Gulf of Carpentaria in

  North Atistralia. By Trelawny Saunders, F.R.G.S.

   The prevailing opinion on tropical climates regards the whole area within the
tropics as equally objectionable to European constitutions. But the evidence of
Capt. Stokes and others on the climate in the Gulf of Carpentaria proves that the
range of the thermometer in that region contributed to render it peculiarly
healthful. The thermometer had been observed as low as 50░, the air cold and
bracing, and the effect on health, under great deprivations, had been proved to be
excellent. It was a fundamental idea, in regard to the distribution of temperature,
that it graduated from a line adjacent to the equator towards the poles. Mr. Saun-
ders proposes to show that the relative duration of the sun's vertical action within
the tropics produced five distinct zones, presenting characteristic and distinguishing
features. The passage of the sun's vertical action between the tropics described a
--92 REPORT 1853.

continuous spiral line on the earth's surface. In passing over the 3J░ adjacent to

each tropic, the sun was vertical within that extent of latitude for sixty-three suc-

cessive days. He was vertical for only one-sixth of that time over the same extent

of latitude' in any other part of his course. The result was, a band of deserts under

each tropic around the earth, with exceptions which arise only from preponderating

local causes. He was vertical for thirty-five days between the parallels of 10░ and

20░ in passing to the tropic, and after the interval of sixty-two days already

mentioned, he again passed vertically over the same latitudes in thirty-four days.

After leaving 10░ on the passage towards the adjacent tropic, he did not return to

it again until 130 days had transpired, within which period he had been twice vertical

over the latitudes between 10░ and 23░. But when he left 10░ on his passage across

the equator, to the more distant tropic, he did not return to the same latitude until 240

days had passed away. He did not return to either tropic until 36.5 days had elapsed.

The excessive heat under the tropics arose from the long continuation of his vertical

action, while he was over them. His absence from the equator never exceeded 185

days, and for that period only when he left it to go to Cancer and back. In

passing to Capricorn and back, he occupied only 180 days. This difference was

Nowsuggestive.  for the result, 'i'he two extreme torrid regions under the tropics

had been already noticed. The equatorial region is characterized by constant

warmth and excessive humidity, producing exuberant vegetation and animal life in

abundant varieties ; the temperature being subject to very little variation. The
regions between it and the torrid deserts, from which the vertical sun was absent

for a lengthened period, present the most attractive inducements for the occupation

of the human race. Lakes and rivers abound. The earth there yields abundantly,

but the vegetation is free from the excessive development of the equatorial zone.

The temperature varies between wide extremes.

On late Surveys in Arracan. By Capt. Tickell.

        On the Popular Notion of an open Polar Sea. Is it the Fact?

                 By the Rev. W. Scoresby, D.D., F.R.S. ^-c.

   As far as historical records may guide us, the notion of an open sea at the Pole
appears to have been the suggestion of Robert Thome, of Bristol, about the year
1527, which led to the despatching of an expedition of two ships with the view of

finding a passage northward to India. It resulted in the loss of one of the ships and

the failure of the other.
    After this, at least eiyht other attempts of a similar kind, taking the line of direc-

tion generally betwixt Spitzbergen and Greenland, were made ; all of which, termi-

nating with the expedition of Captain Buchan in 1818, signally failed.
   The Hon.Daines Barrington, however, who held the opinion and urged the "pro-

bability of reaching the North Pole" by navigating the same route, brought forward
an extraordinary collection of instances in support of his views, in which very high
latitudes within the Polar Sea were asserted by diflferent adventurers engaged in the
whale-fishery, to have been reached. These records, supported by the opinion and
arguments of the late Sir John Barrow in respect to an open sea around the Pole,
and more recently by several of our arctic adventurers and writers on arctic research,
have led, in connexion w ith certain theoretic considerations, to the conclusion, now
popularly received as a fact, of "the open navigable Polar Sea."

    This conclusion, however, as Dr. Scoresby believes, cannot be maintained on the
principles and arguments by which it is assumed to be supported; on the contrary,
he ventures to undertake to show, not only that these considerations are inconclu-
sive, but that the facts or statements for the most part adduced are far more con-
sistent with the more natural inference of the existence of perpetual ices around

the Poles.

   The most convenient and satisfactory course for him. Dr. Scoresby, to pursue, in
the discussion of the subject of his present communication, might probably be to
take up the several reasons for an open Polar Sea, as put forth in series by Mr. Pe-
termann, in his pamphlet on the ' Search for Franklin,' who has compendiously

combined the whole argument.
    ] . Amongst the reasons adduced in support of the popular theory, Dr. Scoresby
       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                       93

first noticed the records of advances into extremely high latitudes collected by the

--Hon. Dairies Barrington, If these records were facts, or if a small portion of them

could be so established, of an open sea being found by many whalers up to latitudes

82░ and 83░, and in certain specified cases, to 86░, 88░, 89░ and 89i░, then might it
be difficult to controvert the popular theory. But none of these records. Dr. Scoresby

beUeved, had the authority of actual celestial observations registered in and de-

rived from the journals of intelligent navigators kept at the time. On the contrary,

-- --they were mainly the more remarkable asserted advances perhaps wholly derived

from hearsay testimony, or recollections of the adventurers after intervals of many
years. As to the utter unsatisfactoriness, or delusiveness, of evidence of this kind,

where a great or remarkable adventure was sought to be established. Dr. Scoresby

--gave some curious examples, showing, on the one part, the almost inevitable ten-

--dency to assume an extreme conclusion ; or, on the other part, from the peculiar
--defectiveness in calling up, by special effort, long-faded memorial impressions, the

doubtfulness and the proneness to inaccuracy of such recollections. And in support

of this tendency to error, instances were not wanting, in the records referred to,

--where the statements could be actually disproved, as in regard to the asserted

advance of a whaler, in 1773, to the latitude of 82░, the very year when the rigidly

examined condition of the Greenland ices by Capt. Phipps demonstrated the im-
possibility of advancing beyond 80░ 48'.

 --2. As to mild weather being found at Cherie Island, and other places, far northward,

contiguous to the open ocean, in winter. This fact, which is by no means a general

one*, is distinctly due to the prevalence of southerly winds, or winds coming from

--the proximate open ocean, on the occasions referred to an incident which had a

striking parallel during the early part of a recent winter in our own island. An

effect, then, derived from a source operating to the southward, can obviously yield
no evidence of the condition of the climate near the Pole, any more than the fact of
the water of a river flowing past us, which might happen to be warm, could justify

the inference that the temperature of the sea into which it flows must also be
warm

 --3. The finding of open sea on the northern coasts of Siberia and Nova Zembla, in

winter. To the application of this fact by Mr. Petermann, in reference to his project

of the practicability of a winter passage eastward along these shores. Dr. Scoresby
was not called upon to remark, but only to object to any conclusion being drawn

--from such a fact,-- on certain occasions experienced, with respect to the condition

of the Polar Sea far northward. The open water discovered, incidentally in winter,

in these situations, was probably due to a previous prevalence of southerly gales

setting the ice off the land. For as the polar ices afford, on their seaward margins

especially, innumerable spaces amid the separate pieces, either open or occupied

only by thin and easily crushable masses, there is always a yielding of the ice, in

regions not confined by land, to the influence of whatever gales may blow heavily

--and continuously. For by reason of the hummocky character of a great proportion

of the ices, the hummocks having, in many cases, large surfaces, with an elevation

--often rising to 20, 30, or even 50 feet, and so acting as sails the wind exerts a

powerful influence in drifting the general body of ice away from land, or sections of

lighter ice from heavier, whenever the wind blows in the proper direction. Under

such an action of wind, and under like circumstances, he. Dr. Scoresby, had often
witnessed the drifting away of great bodies of ice from land, or drift-ice from field-

ice, with a result in opening out a cZear navigable sea of the most surprising cha-

racter. In some cases, a heavy field, previously pressed upon by a pack of drift-ice,

has thus been cleared on its leeward side by a gale blowing off it, so as, in 24 to 48

hours, to leave a clear sea to leeward as far as the eye could discern from the mast-

head.

Hence no conclusion in favour of the theory of a navigable Polar Sea can be main-

tained on the occurrence of open water to the utmost extent of vision on the face,

Awhether northward or otherwise, of any particular coast.  southerly gale blowing

hard off a Siberian or Nova Zemblan shore, might suffice, after two or three days'

continuance, to clear away all ice not affixed to the shore, to the distance of very

many leagues. For a pack of drift-ice, if of great extent, is always capable of com-

pression under the force of heavy gales, even when containing no considerably

openings, by reason of the compacting of the innumerable pieces, and the squeezing

up of the smaller masses upon the larger, or upon each other.

   4. As to the rise of temperature in northerly gales, in winter, observed by several of

--our arctic navigators in regions westward of Baffin's Bay. This very partial fact (par-

tial as to the region where it has been experienced) has been applied as an argument

--in favour of the theory of an open Polar Sea, as if indicating a sea to the north-

ward of far greater warmth in winter than that of Regent's Inlet or Barrow's Strait.

--But, it will be obvious, on the principle of the rotatory character of storms a fact
--now generally admitted that the rise of temperature when the gale was from the

north would prove nothing in favour of the theory of a mild climate about the Pole ;
for the rise of temperature would be explained on the obvious principle that that

portion of the air had recently blown from the reverse direction, and probably had

gained its warmth from the open ocean.

But a rise of temperature might perhaps be urged as a fact belonging to northerly

winds generallj', and not limited to the case of storms. If so, the argument, to be

worth anything, in favour of a mild climate near the Pole, would require that the

fact should be the same in all other meridians of similar latitudes. But the fact is

not so. In the meridians of, and proximate to, Spitzbergen, where the sea is

navigable farther north than elsewhere, the northerly winds are prevalently colder

than the southerly. This fact, as to the months of April, May, and June, his (Dr.

Scoresby's) published records of temperature, extending to some seventeen years,

decidedly proved. The spring temperature, in the 80th and 81st parallels, he had

invariably found was the lowest in northerly gales. Thus, in an extreme case, which

is noted in his published journal of 1822, the temperature, April 29th, latitude

80░ 30', which, with a southerly gale, was at 32░, fell, on the gale shifting to the

north, to --2░, a change of 34░ in 16 hours! The foundation of the argument,

Atherefore, for a mild climate near the Pole, is here completely removed.  rise of

the winter and spring temperature, with north winds, at Melville Island, latitude

74░, cannot prove a mild climate near the Pole, when a. fall of temperature in spring

(the winter not being observed) near Spitzbergen, latitude 80░ to 80^░, occurs with

the winds from the north * !

5. As to the discovery of open and apparently interminable sea in Queen's Channel

and Smith's Sound, which have been assumed to be respectively entrances to an open

--Polar ocean. This assumption, Dr. Scoresby was prepared to show, was altogether

gratuitous. Capt. Penny, in the summer of 1851, sawopen water to the extent of vision

northward, from Baillie Hamilton Island. But such an opening-out of waters within

straits, or channels, or sounds, was, in the arctic regions, the common result of sum-

mer warmth, under corresponding hydrographical and ' cographical configurations
and conditions, and therefore proved nothing in respect to an open Polar ocean. He

(Dr. Scoresby) could point to the opening-out in summer of the bays, sounds, and

channels of Spitzbergen, Greenland, and the regions further west, as a very general

fact, and the exhibition of what deceptively appeared to be immense seas of open
water, as an usual occurrence, in certain positions of the Greenland Sea, much

further north than the sea seen by Capt. Penny.

Nor does the open water seen by Capt. Inglefield northward of Smith's Sound

afford any real ground for the asserted conclusion, that it was the entrance or com-

mencement of an open Polar sea. The latitude here reached was 78░ 28', being

but 45 to 50 miles further north than the marvellous attainment of Baffin in I6l6.

Beyond this, from N.E. to N.W., Captain Inglefield contemplated only an unen-

cumbered sea. But what did the observed facts prove? From the mast-head of
the Isabella, which could only command a view of the horizon of about 9 miles, or

of ordinary floating ice, perhaps 10 or 11 miles, no ice was to be seen northward.

Up to latitude 78░ 38' thtre was, therefore, a clear sea; but in 79░ there might have

been impenetrable ices. And this, it is almost certain, was the fact ; for some of the

men, as Capt. Inglefield tells us, saw an ice-blink to the northward, a sure indica-

tion of compact ice witliin 20 or 30 miles. No rational argument can be grounded
on such a fact as this. An apparently open sea, with not a sign of ice northward,

   * The obser\'ations of Capt. Maclure of the winter temperature at Banks' Land, in relation
to the direction of the wind, have yielded a completely neutralizing result of the argument

--here discussed, the greatest rise of temperature being found to be with east winds, not with

north.

of the year by a
passing the barrier for the first time, and then saiUng northward for two or three
degrees of latitude without interruption, the navigator might naturally infer a con-
tinuance of the open sea, not improbably to the very Pole. But experience would
soon teach him that the promising navigation was but limited; and certainly, betore
he reached the latitude of 81░, or thereabout, he would be stopped by impenetrable

and apparently interminable ices.            , ^. , ,                                                                                                                                                        .,                      was,  ^tvhat.. t4.hue ap-

after the manner of that succeeding to Davis's Strait, and that the open water was
due to the same circumstance,--the proximity of land, as Capt. Inglefield actually

ocean as it was assumed, the gale which drove the Isabella out of the Sound, south-
ward, should have raised waves of 20 to 30 feet in height, of which, it is believed,

there was no semblance.                                                                                                                                                                           ^       .     C,,h,annel,,         andj                   .,  open

waters amid the arctic lands, considered as a proof of a melioration of climate in
proceeding northward.--This popular inference, it may be satisfactorily shown, is

utterly inconclusive. For if the clear openings amid the northern ices just referred
to are demonstrably referable to the proximity of land, then the apparent mildness
of climate must naturally be explained, not by the assumption of an increase of
warmth with an increase of latitude, but to the form and contiguity of land. If this
were not so, then the profusion of animal life should increase, or at all events con-
tinue, in advancing in the highest attainable latitudes, whether land was there or
not. 'But the fact is not so. When, in summer, the coasts of Greenland and Spitz-
bergen for example, are swarming with aquatic birds and other creatures, let a ship
proceed to the highest attainable latitude north-westward of Hackluyt's Headland,
Spitzbergen, and ice will be found in the 80th or 81st parallel, with a greatly dimi-

nished quantity of birds and other animals ; and let the navigator push his ship as far
as possible into the northern ice, and he will soon, probably, find himself fast beset,
and with few living creatures--possibly almost none--to cheer his solitude. This
is a fact which, more than once, has been realized by personal experience,--a fact
conclusive in the way of proof that the profusion of animal life rae'c with in the ad-
ventures of our arctic voyagers, was not due to improvement of climate by reason
of advance towards the Pole ; for in the greatest advances northward which have
ever been made far away from land, animal life becomes less and less profuse, until,
in extreme cases, it almost disappears. So dependent, indeed, is the warmth of the

fact in regard to the highest latitudes that may be reached, nor is it the fact as to
the region about Wellington Channel ; for no instance appears ever to have been met
with there, in the higher latitudes reached in that region, at all comparable to the
wonderful extent of animal life which he (Dr. Scoresby) had shown in his publi-
cation on the ' Franklin Expedition,' pp. 68, 69, to have been met with in Regent s

Inlet, three or four degrees further south. Hence this argument also necessarily

falls with the failure of the assumed fact.

there is no foundation, of these being ices coming from the Pole, and that the ices

annually produced around the Pole are cleared away year by year. On the contrary,

the more probable inference is, that these ices are merely the excess of the winter
production, by the severe frost of the north, carried ofiF, under the wise and gracious

around the Pole which otherwise might be thrust southward, in process of time, so
as to render some of the loveliest regions of the earth uninhabitable, or unfit for the

production of those vegetable fruits, or for yielding those admirable conditions of

temperate climates, on which so much of human well-being and happiness depend.
   The arguments for an open Polar sea thus far met, include. Dr. Scoresby believed,

the chief of those popularly relied on, and it would be tedious to add more. But
the positive reasons for a contrary conclusion might require, on such an occasion,
some little consideration.

   And first, he might notice the grand and unquestionable fact of the extremely low

average temperature of the Polar regions as a powerful reason for assuming the
existence of perpetual ices in the far north. The mean annual temperature of

latitude 78░, near the western coast of Spitzbergen, has been shown, by personal
researches, published in 1820 in the 'Account of the Arctic Regions,' to be as low
as about 17░, or 1 1░ below the freezing temperature of sea- water; whilst in the more
enclosed regions westward, such as those of Melville Island, Regent's Inlet, &c., the
existence of a mean annual temperature of about 30░ below the freezing of sea-water
has been determined. The normal temperature of the North Pole, too, estimated in

the 'Account of the Arctic Regions' at 10░, and reduced still further by M. Dove
to 2░"3, must naturally lead to the inference of an accumulation of ice, rather than a

lacking of ice, in regions immediately surrounding the Pole.
   But the theory, after all, of the non-existence of an open Polar sea, has the most

--decided confirmation in these unquestionable facts : 1st. That of the many expedi-

tions expressly sent out with the view of reaching the Pole, or passing beyond it,
not one of them ever attained by sailing as high a latitude as 81░ N. 2nd. That

all the experience of the Hull whalers, comprising within the last 80 years, as
Mr. Munro has shown, 1949 ships (including repeated voyages), has yielded no
fact to prove an advance within the 82nd parallel ; and 3rd, that in a personal
experience of 21 years, wherein the highest attainable latitude was proceeded to
in seven to nine different voyages, no advance beyond the 8lst parallel was ever

made but once, when the extraordinary position of 81░ 30' was reached. And when
Captain Parry reached some 70 to 80 miles beyond this, it will be remembered that
from 81░ 6, on his advance, the further distance was effected by ice-travelling. On

the return of the party, indeed, they were able to take the water with their boats far
northward of where they had left it, and gained open water in 81░ 34'; but the fact
could not fairly tell against the foregoing views, as no doubt this special penetrability
of the ice was due to the proximity of islands on the north-east of Spitzbergen,
whose apparent termination in the high latitude (80░ 40') to which they have been
traced is by no means their certain limit.

    Everywhere else, as already shown, an impenetrable barrier of ice has always op-

--posed the advance of the navigator in the latitude of 80░ to 81░ a barrier, as it

appears in the early spring, so compact and continuous as to have led him, the
author of this paper, to suggest, so long ago as the year 1815, the probabihty of

access to the very Pole itself being had, by a transglacial journey. On the original
suggestion of the scheme, favourably as it was received by scientific men in Scot-
land, it met with discouragement, and even contempt, from others in England. The

attempt of Capt. Parry, however, in 1826, though necessarily failing because of the

season of the year in which it was undertaken (the height of summer), proved how
much the public opinion had changed on this subject ; whilst a letter, long after-
wards published by Sir John Barrow, went completely to show that the opinion was
now held by the gallant officer himself, that a continuity of ice exists from the 81st
parallel northward, and that the reaching of the Pole by ice-travelling, if commenced
at the favourable season, was by no means an improbable nor very difficult under-
taking. Such a project, indeed, it was evident, might be defeated, if the course were

interrupted by mountainous land ; but lofty ices, the accumulation of ages, might

--not improbably occur, an idea which on the first suggestion of the scheme he had

mentioned, which since then has had such singular support in the discovery of the
vast cliffs of seaborne ices by Sir James Ross, in the antarctic regions of the globe*.

gentleman wlio had been surgeon in a Hull whaler in 1837, stating that the ' Truelove ' had

Some suggestions for an improved system of Currency and Banking.

                         By Francis Bennoch.

Having explained the nature of money, and the kinds of money that are, or have

-- --been, in existence in England viz. gold, silver, and copper coins, bank notes ex-
--changeable on demand vtrith gold coins at a fixed rate of price in these notes, and
--notes in which the gold coins were left free to find their market price, he showed

that gold coins were only legal tender so long as they were of proper weight, and

that silver and copper coins could only be considered as tokens, because they were not

intrinsically worth what they circulated (or. He then argued that the pound ster-

ling had perpetually varied in its metallic value. The gold pound in 1352 weighed

360 grains, in 1552 it weighed 174 grains, in 1650 it contained 140 grains, in 1750

129 grains, and in 1850 it was only 123 grains. So that the pound sterling in 1850

was only one-third the weight it was in 1352. As it had been found necessary to

reduce the weight of the sovereign from time to time to bring it to bear a relative

value with silver, so now the question would arise, when gold was becoming more

abundant, whether we should increase the weight of the sovereign or decrease

the weight of the silver. He contended that, inasmuch as our great national debt

and every existing contract meant in reality so much weight of gold, it would be

most unfair to the debtor classes to increase the weight of the sovereign. Every

increase of an eighth to the weight of the sovereign would in reality increase the

national debt by one hundred millions of pounds sterling. He next proceeded to

show the advantages and disadvantages of our present system, and explained the

third kind of money of which this country had some experience from 1797 to 1819.

Instead of permitting the Bank of England to issue notes, he would have all issues of

legal tender money under the control of Parliament, and that it should be limited to

an amount equal to the annual taxation. Instead of the Government issuing, as now.

Exchequer bills, on which were issued Bank of England notes, he would recommend

the issue of Exchequer notes, which would circulate as money, and finally be received

back into the Exchequer in payment of taxes. This money being for State purposes,

there might also be a system of commercial money to work in harmony with it. All

banks issuing paper should be obliged to place in the hands of the Government, securi-

ties which could not be touched so long as a single note was in circulation, and as each

note would bear a uniform stamp, indicating its security, there would be abundant

--faith runs upon banks would never be made, and panics could seldom, if ever,

occur. The object in this discussion was not for the section to consider what money

was, but what money ought to be. Should it be value in itself, or the representative

Aof value?  metallic currency could never be depended upon for the due perform-

ance of its important functions ; when most needed as money, it was liable to be

exported as an article of commerce, or broken up for purposes of manufacture.

Under a paper money system properly arranged, such as had been suggested, all

sudden changes of value would be avoided, and panics unknown. The essence of

money was that it should expand and contract, so as to meet every emergency with-

out any violent action. National prosperity would be secured, because our money

would have the security of the nation. Growing prosperity meant increase of trade.

Increase of trade demanded extended circulation. Every advance in wages, or in

the price of commodities, required more money to pay for the same quantity of la-

bour or material than had been before necessary. The greater the amount of indus-

trial operations, the larger the sum of money required to pay the wages. Under

our present system, this necessarily withdrew bullion from the Bank ; reduced the

quantity of notes issued ; created financial alarm ; discounts were advanced in rate
manufacturers and merchants sold their goods at a reduced price to obtain the money

needed ; a diminution of production followed, and ultimately mills were closed and

hands thrown out of work. So that out of the highest possible prosperity, our

system of money managed to manufacture the direst adversity, and through panics

to lead to pauperism. Mr. Bennoch concluded by declaring that a metallic

currency was merely barter, and that a paper currency, based on national property,

was the wisest that could be adopted, inasmuch as it constituted nineteen-twentietbs

of our present system ; but that twentieth part had the power to disturb the whole.

--98 REPORT 1853.

   Mr. Cheshire (one of the Secretaries) read a communication from Lady
Bentham, widow of the late Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham, on certain
statements contained in a paper read before the Statistical Section at Belfast in
September 1852, entitled ' Statistics of Portsea and Portsmouth Dockyard,' commu-
nicated by the Portsmouth and Portsea Philosophical Society, and published in the
quarterly Journals of the Statistical Society in June and September of the present
year, in which her Ladyship corrected some inaccuracies relating to the dockyard.

On t?w Results of the Census of Great Britain in 1851, toith a Description of
  the Machinery and Processes employed to obtain the Returns. By Edward

    Cheshire, one of the Secretaries of the Section.

   The author commenced by reciting the onerous duties of the Registrar-General.
The objects of the census were explained, and the machinery employed to take it.
Great Britain was apportioned into 38,740 enumeration districts, and to each of
them a duly qualified enumerator was appointed. The author illustrated the extent
of this army of enumerators, and the labour of engaging their services on the same
day, by stating that it would take lOJ hours to count them, at the rate of one a
second, and that the army recently encamped at Chobham would not have sufficed
to enumerate a fourth of the population of Great Britain. The boundaries of the
enumeration districts, and the duties of the enumerators, were defined. The num-
ber of householders' schedules forwarded from the Census Office was 7,000,000,
weighing 40 tons. The processes employed to enumerate persons sleeping in barns,
tents, and the open air, and in vessels, were severally explained ; also the means by
which the numbers of British subjects in foreign States were obtained. The precauФ
tions taken to secure accurate returns were recited ; they involved the final process
of a minute examination and totaling, at the Census Office, of 20 millions of entries,
contained on upwards of 1^ million of pages of the enumerators' books. The latter
were nearly 39,000 in number. The boundaries of the fourteen registration
divisions were traced, and the plan of publication of the census was explained. The
number of persons absent from Great Britain on the night of the 30th of March,

--1851, was nearly 200,000 : viz. army, navy, and merchant service, 162,490; and

British subjects resident and travelling in foreign countries, 33,775. The various
causes of displacements of the population were recited ; and the general movement
of the population on the occasion of the Great Exhibition was alluded to.* The

--number of visits to the Crystal Palace were 6,039,195, and the number of persona

who visited it was 2,000,000 ; nevertheless, the landing of only 65,233 aliens was
reported in the year. The population of Great Britain in 1851 is subjoined :

England                           8,281,734    8,640,154           Total.
Scotland                          1,375,479    1,513,263

Islands                              499,491      506,230    2,888,742
Army, Navy, and Merchant Service       66,854       76,272    1,005,721
                                                                 143,126
                                     162,490                     162,490

Total                             10,386,048 10,735,919 21,121,967

In illustration of this 21,000,000 of people allusion was made to the Great Exhibi-
tion. On one or two occasions, 100,000 persons visited the Crystal Palace in a
single day, consequently 211 days of such a living stream would represent the num-
ber of the British population. Another way of realizing 21,000,000 of people was
arrived at by considering their numbers in relation to space : allowing a square yard
to each person, they would cover 7 square miles. The author supplied a further
illustration by stating that if all the people of Great Britain had to pass through
London in procession four abreast, and every facility was afforded for their free and
uninterrupted passage for 1 2 hours daily, Sundays excepted, it would take nearly
3 months for the whole population of Great Britain to file through, at quick march,

   * It is atated incidentally in the census, that in 1845 a million and a half of people on the Continent visited,
in pilgrimage, the Hols/ Coal at Trdves.

fowr deep. The excess of females in Great Britain was 512,361, or as many as

--would have filled the Crystal Palace 5 times over. The proportion between the

sexes was 100 males to 105 females, a remarkable fact, when it was considered
that the births during the last 13 years had given the reversed proportion of 105
hoys to 100 girls. The annexed statement exhibits the population of Great Britain
at each census from 1801 to 1851 inclusive :

hazard, were analysed into their constituent parts, and they gave some curious reФ
suits. About 5 per cent, only of the families in Great Britain consisted of husband,
wife, children, and servants, generally considered the requisites of domestic felicity;
while 893 families had each ten children at home, 317 had each eleven, and 64 had
each twelve. The number of each class of institution, and the number of persons
inhabiting them, are annexed :

French writer had suggested the term " specific population," after the analogy of
"specific gravity," in lieu of the terms in common use, "thinly populated" and
" populous." The statement annexed exhibits the area of Great Britain in acres
and square miles, the square in miles, the number of acres to a person, of persons

to a square mile, and the mean proximity of the population on the hypothesis of an

equal distribution :

land in each year from 1843 to 1852 inclusive, and the destination of the emigrants.

    Statistics relative to Nova Scotia in 1851. By Edward Cheshire.

   The author commenced by a short sketch of the history of Nova Scotia ; he defined
the boundaries of the province, and described the geographical features of the country
and its climate. The census of 1851 gave a population of 276,117, and exhibited a

Aremarkable equality between the sexes, viz. 137,677 males to 138,440 females.

--statement of the social condition of the people showed an excess of 3678 widows

over widowers, or 160 per cent. a result arising, probably, from the risks incurred

by the men (10,000 in number) engaged in the fisheries. The bachelors exceeded
the spinsters by 2367, or 4 per cent. The spiritual wants of the people were well

provided for, there being one clergyman to every 1000 of the population, but a

--lawyer and a doctor to every 2000 only. The number of afflicted persons in the

colony was as follows : BUnd, 136 ; deaf and dumb, 230 ; idiots, 299 ; lunatics,
166; total 831. Deafness and dumbness were 35 per cent, more prevalent among
men than among women, and idiotcy 43 per cent. The number of Indians and
coloured persons in the colony was 5964. As regards land, 5,000,000 acres were
available for tillage, of which only 1 in 26 was under cultivation. The following

--statistics relating to the fisheries possess interest at the present time : Number of

vessels employed, 8 1 2 ; their tonnage, 43,333. Numberof boats, 5l6l; men, 10,394;
annual value of smoked herrings, 217,270Z. ; number of nets and seines, 30,154;

annual value offish oil, 17,754?. ; quantity of salmon, I669 ; shad, 3536 ; mackerel,
100,047 ; herrings, 53,200 ; alewives, 5344 (the five latter are in barrels). Mining
was an important branch of employment. Manufactures and shipping were respect-
ively passed in review ; and the author concluded with a sketch of the constitution
of the province, and a statement of the various religious denominations : the latter
showed that one-eighth of the inhabitants were of the Established Church, and that

one-fourth were Roman Catholics.

                 On the Mortality of Hull in the Autumn of IS^Q.
                            By Henry Cooper, M.D. Lond.

   This paper was prepared from the official documents of the late Mr. Thorney (to
whose memory the reader paid a tribute of thanks and deep regret), and of Mr. Chat-
ham. Tables were shown to exhibit, first, the total number of cholera and diarrhoea

--cases the former, viz. I860, or 1 in 43 of the whole population ; the latter 256, or 1

in 355. The number of cases occurring in males was 885; infemales, 975. Yet allowing
for the difference of number between the excess in the whole population, the female
mortality was the greatest, one male having died to I'l female ; while, in the whole
population, there is one male living to 1"14 female. The diarrhoea return showed
no difl^erence in the number of the sexes. The cases were next analysed as regEU░ds
age, and it was shown that in cholera the infant mortality, though very high, was
not higher than that which occurs from ordinary causes of death at the same age.
The greatest mortality, compared with the annual average, appears to have occurred
in the prime of life (from 30 to 35), where the ordinary mortality is very low. There
is also an excessive mortality about 60 ; while the greatest immunity seems to be
enjoyed from 15 to 25, and from 40 to 60. In diarrhrea the important feature is
the great excess of infant and old age mortality. The localities in which there had
been the greatest mortality were indicated by marking each death upon a map in the
place in which it occurred. The map was tinted in shades, showing by deeper shades
the parts of the borough where the levels were the lowest, and in which, therefore,
the hygienic condition, as regards moisture and drainage, might be presumed to be

--the most defective. Three principles were found to govern and determine the position

of the greatest mortality the level, the density of the population, and their physical
and social character. These points were illustrated by specifying certain localities,
in which the number of markings showed the disease to have been rife. The last
analysis shown was that of occupation, which showed several curious results. The
general inference from this analysis was that 1738 of the labouring classes, and 122

of the gentry, traders, and well-to-do classes had suffered ; and, assuming the former
class to amount to 67,000, and the latter to 13,000, it follows that 1 in 40 of the
labouring class, and 1 in 131 of the well-to-do class were victims.

                       On the Prevalence of Diseases in Hull.
                      By Henry Cooper, M.D. Lond.

A few remarks were premised on the state of mortality in Hull, which has never

been stated oflScially for the whole borough, as the parts for which it has been

given have been separated in the returns, so as to give results likely to lead to false

impressions. Hull, including the Humber, St. Mary's, and Myton registration

districts, is given in one return ; Sculcoates, including the two Sculcoates, in an-

other ; the whole parish of Sutton, of which only part is in the borough, in a third,
and Drypool and Southcoates in separate returns. But the term " Hull " is popu-

larly applied in an extended sense to the whole borough ; so that the rate of mortality

of the part so named in the returns, and which, on several accounts, yields more

than its average of deaths, is erroneously attributed to the whole. The rate

given for Hull is 1 death in 29 ; for Sculcoates, 1 in 42 ; when the borough in

its entirety is taken, the rate is 1 in 33 ; and there is reason to believe that in

the present season it is considerably below this. Tables were then shown to
exhibit the relative prevalence of eight of the most common diseases not neces-

sarily fatal, viz. fever, rheumatism, pulmonary ^diseases, dyspepsia, neurosis,

cachexias, uterine diseases, and diarrhoea. These tables were founded on a

calculation of 21,712 cases of these diseases presenting themselves at the medical

charities of the town during a period of ten years ; and the proportion per cent, of

Aeach disease to the whole number observed, noted under each head.  great preva-

lence of chest affection, of dyspepsia and rheumatism is found to exist, and fever is

Aa comparatively rare disease.  second table shows, by curves, the prevalence of

the four more important of these diseases, viz. pulmonary diseases, dyspepsia, rheu-

matism, and fever, and the effect of the seasons of the last ten years upon their

intensity. Pulmonary diseases, commencing high, rise to their culminating point

in May, then fall to their minimum in August, and again rise to the average winter

level. Dyspepsia, coinciding with pulmonary diseases, in its time of attaining its

height, rises to a much higher point, and falls rapidly through the autumn. Rheu-

matism has its maximum in winter, with an exacerbation in August and November

--fever is singularly equable and remarkably low for a large town, not favourably situ-

ated nor well-drained ; its maximum is also in May or April. Zymotic diseases were

excluded from the calculation, as the cases are not received into the hospital, and

not treated in the dispensaries in such proportion as to give anything like an ade-

quate idea of their prevalence. The results tallied very accurately with the practical

expeiience of medical men, which thus acquired confirmation and exactness from the

application of the numerical method.

                    On the Education of the Poor in Liverpool.

               By the Rev. A. Hume,Z>..C.Z, L.L.D., F.S.A.

   I. Population of the Borough,-- The borough consists of five great portions, the
parish or ancient parliamentary borough, and four adjacent townships or portions
of townships. From a moderate estimate of the addition to the population since

the last census, the present population of the borough and of each of its constituent
parts is reached. The result is shown in the following table :
104 REPORT 1853.

   Again, the town is situated on the side of a hill rising from the riverside; the in-
habitants of the lowest portion consist mainly of the poorest or utterly destitute
classes, those of the middle portion of the middle or less afHuent classes, and those
of the townships of persons who are wealthy, or at least in comfortable circum-
stances. The first and most necessitous of these sets may be estimated at 180,000;

--hence there are about 87,000 in the second, and 132,000 in the third.
   II. Educational Demand. It is estimated from careful inquiry that two-thirds of
these, though not all belonging to the class "poor," take advantage of the education
which is provided for the poor, or which is not self-supporting. Hence, the children
in a mixed population of about 266,666 require to be provided for. The writer has
also found from a statistical inquiry on the spot, that in a mixed population, exactly
25 per cent, are of the ages most likely to attend school, viz. from 3^ to 12. Thus
the educational demand is fixed at 66,666.

  --III. Educational Supply. This was examined under the four heads of (1) Church

Schools, (2) Protestant Dissenters' Schools, (3) Roman Catholic Schools, (4) Ge-
neral Schools, or those unconnected with any religious denomination. By all
sections of the community the details had been furnished with great readiness.

   The Church Schools consist of two kinds, those that are practically so, e. g. con-
nected with public institutions, and those which are formally so, e. g. connected
with district churches and their congregations. The following table shows the
special eflforts of the church in the education of the poor :

   The schools under general management afford accommodation for 4451.

  We can now obtain a connected view of the entire provision that has been made

for the education of the poor in the town. It is the following :

  We can also compare the supply with the demand, in the form of an ordinary

account :

   The general result is, that the entire community have yet discharged little more
than half their duty on this subject, the existing accommodation amounting to only

57 per cent.

 --IV. Distribution ofEducational Facilities. The facts connected with this part of

the subject cannot but leave a painful impression on the mind ; for it is found that

the local accommodation in schools is in inverse ratio to the necessities of the town.

   The following facts refer to Church Schools. (1) Of fifteen ecclesiastical districts
in the townships, thirteen have permanent schools ; of sixteen districts wholly or
partially in the middle portion of the town, twelve have permanent schools ; of fif-
teen districts in the lowest part, embracing nearly the whole of the perishing poor, only
eight have permanent schools. (2) Of six districts in the lowest portion of the town,
forming a continuous belt from north to south of nearly two miles and a quarter,no< one

has a permanent set of schools connected with it. Thesecontain almost all the merchants'
offices in the town, and some of the principal shops ; the Town-hall, Custom-house,
Exchange, Post-office, railway station, and eleven or twelve of the docks. It is a
fact worth knowing that four of these districts are connected with churches built by
the corporation. (3) If the Exchange flags be taken as a centre, and a semi-circle
be described with a radius of 800 yards, it will contain five districts wholly and
seven partially, and will comprise a population of 70,000. Of these, four have no
schools whatever ; two have only temporary ones, and exactly the half are perma-

Anently provided for. (4) stranger entering the port, can walk from the landing-

stage on the river right up through the heart of the town, to Everton and Edge-
hill, without passing through a single district that contains a permanent set of

schools

   The schools of Protestant Dissenters are in general very ill-placed ; for the schools
follow the chapels, and these are removed from time to time, following the more

respectable portion of the population. Hence, of the 4869 for whom they provide

accommodation, only 350 axe provided for in the lower part of the parish or among
the perishing masses of the population !

   In general, the Roman Catholic schools are very well placed ; and the same may

be said of those that are of a general character.
   The distribution of school accommodation is exhibited in the following table :

Thus, if each of the three great divisions of the town be regarded as a separate

unit, the school accommodation in the townships and in the upper part of the parish

is almost sufficient ; while that in the lower part of the parish is between a third

and a fourth of what it ought to be. The better parts of the town, some sections of

which do not possess a single poor family of the most destitute class, have educa-

tional facilities almost thrust upon the people, until the noble feeling of self-de-

pendence is endangered, if not gradually broken down. On the contrary, in that part
of the town where the " people are destroyed for lack of knowledge,'' though its

necessities amount to two-thirds of the whole, the various religious communitias

have provided for it only seven, thirty-two, and forty -four per cent, of the i hotel

In one of the more respectable portions of the Borough, the township of Everton,

there are public institutions capable of accommodating nearly 2000 pupili, independ-

ent of about thirty private schools. All these are self-supporting. For the poor there

is school accommodation to the extent of 3,350 ; while an increase is in progress,

amounting to 1,270. Now, a school accommodation for 4,620 of this class, repre-

sents a mixed poor population of 18,480, and a general population in this township

of nearly 37,000. It is probable that Everton will not contain this number till

about the period of the next census ; so that ivhile the really poor are perishing in

ignorance, one of the best parts of the town is over-schooled. Three sets of schools in it,

built by Protestant Dissenters, Churchmen, and Roman Catholics respectively, have

cost about ^10,000, and afford accommodation for 2,600 pupils; but they lie in a

--straight line, the entire length of which is 230 yards I
   V. Remedies Suggested. These followed naturally from the previous statement of

facts. They were, (1) that the Church should establish a set of schools in every

ecclesiastical district  of  the  town  which is  not  so  provided for                                                         (2)  that Protestant
                                                                                                                             ;

Dissenters should combine to establish schools in the most neglected parts of the

town, which might be denominational but not congregational ; and (3) that the

Roman Catholic schools, and especially those under general management, should be

increased in number. Efforts of this kind, if well-sustained, would bring up the

--supply nearly to an equality with the demand,
   VI. Support. The irregular distribution of funds in school buildings is more

than equalled in this matter ; for as a general fact the merchants do not subscribe

to educate those near their offices, but those near their residences. Hence while the ne-

Acessities of district are ten times those of district B, the school subscriptions for B

are obtained ten, twenty, or thirty times as readily as those for A. In other words,

if the two districts are to be brought to the same educational level, the labour in the

--one case is 200, 300, or 400 times as great as in the other : that is to say, while

something or even much may be done, educational equality is a practical impossibi-

lity. This arises from treating parts of a great town, which only ser\'e partial pur-

poses, as if they were complete wholes.

   While the voluntary system in education affords a very unequal relief, it imposes
a most unequal burden. As the facts now stand, the intelligent and benevolent man

is heavily taxed for the possession of virtues that are somewhat rare, while the

ignorant and selfish man, who has perhaps added rudeness to his negative in the case
of some strong appeal, is rewarded for the coarseness of his moral sense by a per-
petual exemption from claims. It has been estimated that so many as 15,000 persons
ought to subscribe in Liverpool for the promotion of education, and that not more
than 2500 actually do so. In eighteen Church District Schools there are 8180 chil-
dren educated, and the entire subscribers are only 810. Probably not more than
1200 churchmen in all subscribe to any school whatever. For the education of 7000
Roman Catholic children, there are not fifty principal subscribers ; the remaining

expenses are met by the children's pence, congregational collections, and very small
contributions. The writer of the paper, therefore, is anxious to see the system of
Local Rates introduced, the working of which may be inferred from the following

analysis of persons rated to the relief of the poor in the borough :

Mechanics' Institutions, almost the only existing means for the education of the

adult population. He corroborated his statements by reference to similar remarks

made in the report of the Yorkshire Union of Mechanics' Institutions, by the Mayor

of Chester and the Rev. H. Gunn at the recent conversazione of the Lord Mayor
of London. He then noticed that a beginning had been made for such an advance

as he advocated, by the Act just passed for extending the operation of the Public

Libraries Act of 1850 to Ireland and Scotland, so that tovpn councils and boroughs,
the population of which exceeded 10,000, can now adopt proceedings to establish

public libraries and museums throughout the United Kingdom. He also remarked

upon the aid at present afforded to national and other schools as a step in the true

direction, and argued that government aid, instead of giving any establishments an

eleemosynaiy character, gave them a status and a position rather likely to be overrated

than otherwise.

   He went on to point out some of the ways in which it seemed to him that govern-
ment assistance might possibly be furnished, not only to a general museum of art in
the metropolis, but to all country towns, in proportion to their own contributions

either by subscriptions or a rate, as afforded at present to schools for the young

first premising that he thought it a thing of far more importance than it might at

first sight appear, to devise some good name by which such establishments should be

called. It is obvious that the name of Mechanics' Institutions is no longer applica-

--ble to those associations, which nevertheless continue to bear it actual mechanics

form but a minority of their members. Possibly part of their failure may have been

--caused by this " defect of title," the name " National Colleges " might perhaps be

suggested as the natural sequence of the " National Schools."

   Acting, then, on the principle already adopted in regard to grants to schools in

proportion to local funds raised, he would have in London a general British Museum

of all works of art as well as the one that already exists for the works of nature

one whose library, specimens, casts, patterns, models, plans of houses, apparatus,

maps, illustrations, and examples of all hints for improvements should be easily ac-

cessible to the community at large, on conditions similar to those already adopted

--by the sister institution for admission and inspection it should be a source of

example, advice, instruction and communication. All this of course implied a larger

annual educational grant, and a tenfold amount to that at present voted would in

all probability by the elevation of the people tend to their comfort and well-being

in various ways, and so to their being more universally beneficial to and not a burden
upon the state. He would then desire to see throughout the country buildings of

respectable or where possible of handsome appearance, and at the same time adapted

internally to the convenience and comfort of those resorting to them. These buildings

should, if carried out to a complete extent, contain a museum, library, reading-room,

lecture-room, room for philosophical experiments, and various other adjuncts care-

fully enumerated ; a taste for scientific pursuits would be fostered by the sight of

specimens of natural or artificial objects; the first sight of a butterfly or a bird

might excite the dormant spirit of a Le Vaillant or Audubon, or the mode] of an
engine some otherwise " inglorious " Fulton or Watt. Lecturers should be appointed

and partly paid by government, and a certificate of attendance on a three years' course

of lectures, and of adequate proficiency at the close of each year after due examina-

tion, might be a ground for a diploma for a license to lecture.
   The true and legitimate result of thus raising the mental culture of the people at

large is to elevate and refine the mind, and make it more susceptible of high and holy
impressions. The discoveries of Herschel do not lead men to disbelieve in God,

nor do the compositions of Haiadel act as a hindrance to the singing of His praise

in worship.
   Mr. Morris further advocated a large provision for the healthy and rational amuse-

ment of the people in connexion with the foundations he had been speaking of, and

after complaining of the low state of the taste of the people at large, showed that it

Amust be raised by general and not by individual means.  little knowledge is then

only a dangerous thing, if it be rested in as the end instead of being used as the

means to further imorovement.

SiatisHes relative to the Northern Whale Fisheries from 1772 to 1852.
           Bi/ Henry Mukroe, M.Б>., M.R.C.S., L.S.A.^c.

The first attempt by the English to capture the whale was in 1594. The Hull

merchants fitted out ships for the whale fishery as early as 1598, and at a very early

period discovered Jan Mayen or Trinity Island. The British legislature, to encourage

the prosecution of the whale fisheries, enacted in 1749 that the original bounty of

20s. per ton should be increased to 40s. per ton. In the year 1785, ^94,558 were

paid in bounties. From 1796 to 1821, a period of 25 years, the number of vessels

sent out increased to 64, the largest number ever sent. From 1821 to 1833 the

number of vessels sent out began to decline, owing probably to the year 1821 being

a disastrous one, 10 vessels having been lost. The year 1833 is the most prosperous

recorded, 27 ships bringing home the great amount of 5024 tons of oil, being on the

average of 186 tons per ship, whilst the average return per ship for the last 80

years was only 88 tons. During the last 80 years 194 ships have been fitted out

for the fisheries. Out of this number 80 have been lost, and six more taken in war-

time. Some of the ships have been as often as 58 voyages to the fisheries. For 10

years between 2000 and 3000 sailors were annually sent  in  the whaling  ships                       for
                                                                                                  ;

40 years above 1000 were sent at the average of 44 men per ship. During the period

of 80 years the Hull whaling ships have taken 85,644 men ; on an average of 1070

per year. During the period of 80 years the returns of oil per year have varied from

5 tons to 7976 tons of oil. The largest cargo of oil brought home was 285 tons.

During the last 80 years the gross amount of oil broughthome was 171,907 tons. The

highest price obtained for oil was in 1813, when it was sold as high as ^55 per ton,

and the lowest about 1805, when it was sold for ^20 per ton, being on the average

of ,if30 per ton for the last 80 years. The greatest amount of money realized in

one year by oil and bone was ^318,880. For 12 years the amount returned was

above .Б200,000 per year, and for 16 years above ^100,000. The gross value of oil

and bone brought home from the whale fisheries for the last 80 years amounts to

^6,847,580, being on the average of ^85,594 per year. The average success of

each ship for the last 80 years was ^3,513 per annum.

An Analytical View of Railway Accidents in this country and on the Con-
tinent ofEurope in the twelve years from 1 840 to 1 852. By F. G. P. Neison.

   The paper was illustrated by a series of elaborate tables, showing the average fare
per mile for each class, the number of passengers who have travelled by each class,
the moneys received from passengers by each class, the total mileage of each, the

average distance travelled by passengers in each class, the average distance
travelled by all classes of passengers, and the total number of miles travelled

by all the passengers collectively in each year. For fiist-class passengers the

minimum scale of fares was charged in the year 1846, but for the second and
third class passengers the minimum charges were made in the year 1847. Under

these dates the scale of charges gradually and pretty uniformly decreased, but since

then they have fluctuated at a somewhat higher price, and are recently showing a
tendency to increase. The average distance travelled by the passengers was shown

by the tables to be yearly becoming less and less. This is particularly observable in the

second, third, and parliamentary classes since the year 1844. In the period of 1844-4/

the distance travelled by all classes was 17"7 ; in 1848-51 it was 16'3 ; and in 1852 it

Ahad diminished to 15'8 miles.  most important feature shows itself in connexion

with the operation of cheap fares, not only on the average distance travelled by each

passenger, but also on the number of passengers. In the parliamentary class the

average distance exceeds that for either the third or second classes, and the number

of such passengers since 1847 (the period within which the parliamentary trains may

be said to be in regular operation) exceeds that of all the other classes with the
exception of the second class, and in the year 1852 very nearly equalled the number

of the second class ; while in the last year the mileage of the parliamentary class

actually exceeded that of the second class by 13,500,000 miles. In the period of

1840-51 the number of railway passengers was 478,488,607, of whom 237 were

killed and 1,416 injured, showing a ratio of I killed in 2,018,939. and one injured
in 337,916. Of engine-drivers, stokers, and guards, the number killed was 275,

and the injured 274, out of 40,486, showing a ratio of 1 killed in \77> and 1 injured

in 148. Number of porters and other servants, 359,683, of whom 683 were killed

and 343 injured; the ratio being 1 killed in 527, and 1 injured in 1058. During

the years 1844-51, 7,044,469,484 miles have been travelled by passengers, and 176

deaths have happened through accidents from all causes. Hence one passenger has

been killed for every 40,025,395 miles travelled. Supposing a person to be alvyays

in motion on a railway, and travelling at an average speed of 20 miles per hour, in-

cluding stoppages, he would travel 175,200 miles yearly, and he must constantly

travel 228 years to be killed by accidents from all causes. The period for which he

must constantly travel to be killed by accidents from all causes under the control or

the companies is 490 years ; and he must be constantly travelling 426 years to be

killed by accidents from causes beyond the control of the companies ; but if the

person is supposed to travel 12 hours only per diem for each of the 365 days in the

year, then in 456 years he will be killed by accidents from all causes ; in 980 years he

will be killed by accidents from causes under the control of the companies ; and in

852 years he will be killed by accidents from causes beyond the control of the com-

panies. Of the 237 passengers killed in the period 1840-51, 103 were killed by

causes beyond, and 1 34 by causes under, the control of the companies. Of the 1416

persons injured, 188 were injured by causes beyond, and 1228 from causes under,

the control of the companies. It was a popular error to suppose that third-class

passengers were the principal sufferers from railway accidents, the fact being that

the greatest proportion of accidents took place among the first-class passengers.

Taking the number of persons travelling, the number of miles opened, and judging

of the fact by every test, it appeared from the tables that there was a gradual

diminution in the loss of life on railways ; and, without any wish to defend the

management of railway directors, Mr. Nelson considered it satisfactorily proved that

there was a great improvement in the railway system. As an instance of the rash-

ness of passengers, he stated that three persons had been killed, and seven injured,

by leaping from the train while in motion, for their hats. The tables show that the"

deaths from collisions and from trains running off the line, which have constituted

a large portion of the whole, have been diminishing, while deaths from passengers

falling from the trains had scarcely varied. The death from axles breaking in the

four  years 1840-43 formed 8 per cent, of the  whole                                 but  since  1844  not  a  single
                                                                                  ;

death has happened from this cause ; and in regard to death from the breaking of
other parts of the machinery none have taken place since 1847. The deaths occasioned

by passengers jumping from trains while in motion have much increased since

1840, as well as the deaths from passengers mounting trains while in motion. The

deaths from causes beyond the control of the companies form 54*8 per cent, of the

number of injuries ; but the deaths from causes which arc under their control form
10'9 per cent., so that the tendency of accidents which may be considered to arise

from details of management is to inflict bodily injury rather than occasion death

for out of every 100 injuries about 11 deaths happen, while among the accidents

due to causes within the influence of the passengers themselves, for every 100 injuries

55 deaths take place. In the period 1840-43 the deaths from causes under the

control of the companies was 62*50 per cent, of all the deaths ; in 1844-47 they were

51 "56 per cent. ; and in 1848-51 only 43' 16 per cent., so that it was evident that the

class of accidents under the control of the several companies was decreasing in rela-

tion to the total accidents in a most satisfactory and very rapid manner. Referring

to the German railways, Mr. Nelson gave the following results for the years 1848,

--1849 and 1850 : length of railways open, 8480 miles (English) ; number of

passengers, 51,713,297; number of miles travelled, 1,155,436,890. During this

period only one passenger was killed, and 14 injured ; 53 railway employes were

killed, and 88 injured.

           On new Supplies of Gold. By William Newmarch.

The quantity of new gold produced in California and Australia to the end of 1852

is equal to at least 10 per cent, of the total quantity of gold existing in Europe and

America in the early part of 1848, or immediately previous to the first appearance

Weof the Californian supplies.  have seen also that the annual production of gold
--from all sources, which in 1848 was equal to 2 per cent, on the total quantity of
--gold then existing in Europe and America, had risen in 1852 to 7 per cent, on that

quantity.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  IH

   So far the whole, or nearly the whole, of the new supplies of gold have been
absorbed as coinage in America, in this country and Australia, and in France. And

not only has there been a large increase of the gold coinage in these countries, but
the amount of the convertible paper circulation probably in each of them, certainly

-- --in three, viz. England, France and Australia has been considerably increased within

the last twelve months ; and it appears that the increase in the circulation of coin
and paper has arisen almost wholly from a prior increase in transactions. It is a
question, however, for investigation, whether the absorption of the new gold as coin
can proceed to a much greater extent without affecting the value of gold as compared
with a larger or smaller number of commodities.

   In this country there has been, since the summer and autumn of last year, a
marked increase in the price of several descriptions of commodities ; and it does not

appear that that increase of price can in all cases be adequately explained as concerns
the commodities themselves by considerations of supply and demand ; nor, on the

other hand, does it appear that we are justified by the evidence in attributing to the
influence of the new supplies of gold any extensive or decided influence in raising
prices in this country. The facts, however, do justify us in believing that the new

-- --supplies have certainly begun indirectly and perhaps directly also to operate in

this country in a manner which does, and will, lead to higher prices.
   As regards wages, the indirect and direct operation of the new gold in establishing

higher rates is manifest and unquestionable ; and since the autumn of 1852 the rise
in the wages of artisan and manual labour in this country is equal to between 12 and
20 per cent.

   It seems to be established by the evidence, that whatever efifects may have been
produced in the United Kingdom, in raising wages and prices and in extending and

increasing trade, have been accomplished by means of reductions in the rate of dis-
count and interest and by advances of capital, and not in any way through the
medium of the circulation. It appears also that the eff'ect of the new gold in de-
pressing the rate of discount was essentially of a temporary character, and was con-
fined to the period during which the new gold was lodged, chiefly in the Bank of
England, in its progress from the mines to the general markets of the world.

   Since those temporary efl'ects have disappeared, the increased demands for capital,
excited by the low rates of discount and arising out of an extending trade, have

raised those rates to fully their previous height.

   In the Australian colonies the eff'ect of the new gold has been to add the stimulus
of a very low rate of interest, and of an abundance of capital, to the other great and
manifold causes of rapid development which they previously possessed.

   And, generally, we are justified in describing the efifects of the new gold as almost
wholly beneficial. It has led to the development of new branches of enterprise, to
new discoveries, and to the establishment in remote regions of populations carrying
with them energy, intelligence, and the rudiments of a great society. In our own

country it has already elevated the condition of the working and poorer classes ; it
has quickened and extended trade ; and exerted an influence which thus far is bene-
ficial wherever it has been felt.

    Such are the conclusions justified by evidence and facts.
   There still remain the conclusions which seem to be justified by speculation, and

these may be compressed within a smaller compass.
   Apparently there is good reason for believing that the future results of the new

supplies of gold will be, on the whole, not less devoid of evil than they have been

hitherto. There seems to be no authority for expecting that, under contracts now

existing, creditors will be sacrificed to debtors ; that the recipients of fixed incomes

will be hopelessly impoverished ; or that capital will cease to command a reasonable
rate of interest. On the contrary, the great revolution pursues its course so gradu-
ally ; it is moderated and checked in modes so infinite and subtle, and moulded by

--influences too delicate to be laid bare by any appliance of statistics ; that, so far as

we can judge of the future by that which now occurs around us, we may contem-

--plate without fear a change in the economical condition of the world, new and
--startling, doubtless, but already adjusting itself, without shocks or convulsions, to

the expanding intelligence and resources of mankind.
 112 REPORT--1853.

 On aproposed Planfor Decimal Coinage. By Theodore Wm. R athbome.

 On the Causes, Extent, and Preventives of Crime ; with especial reference to
   Hull. By the Rev. James Selkirk, 3I.A., Chaplai7i of the Hull Gaol.

    The subject of crime in the country in general is in these days attracting the
 attention of all classes of society. The causes of crime are almost the same every-
 where, and may be reduced to a very few.

    I. (1) The most prolific source of crime is beyond all doubt drunkenness. Testi-
 monies to the truth of this are borne by judges, magistrates and gaol chaplains, and
others who have had opportunities of investigating it. In 1851, 10,000 persons who
were tried at assizes and sessions in England were brought into that deplorable
condition by drunkenness, and upwards of 50,000 were summarily convicted in the
same year by the magistrates from the same cause.

    In the last three years in Hull 1325 cases of drunkenness have been taken before
the magistrates, and more than 1000 other cases of crimes chiefly occasioned by the
same vice.

    (2) Another source of crime is the neglect of children by their parents. This will

be obvious to all who are in the habit of visiting the streets inhabited by the more
degraded part of the population, whose children, in ignorance, dirt and rags are beg-
ging about the streets. Besides this, the filthy and confined and ill-ventilated state

of the abodes of this class has a tendency to promote crime, from the absence of all
possibility of decency and self-respect.

   A(3) third source of crime is the numerous low and ill-regulated places of amuse-

ment, which are particularh' attractive to, and frequented by, the lower orders. As
one proof of this it may be mentioned that the chaplain of the Preston House of
Correction sent officers to visit one of these places, and their report describes 700
boys and girls collected together to have their bodies poisoned with smoke and drink,
and their minds poisoned with ribaldry and obscenity. Unhappily these places are
numerous in Hull, and attended by youth of both sexes.

   (4) The associations formed at low lodging-houses is another source of much crime.
It is here that destitute and profligate persons are brought together in dense masses,

--and spend their time chiefly in corrupting each other.
   II. The Extent of Crime. The average number of committals every year in
England is about 115,000, and in Scotland about 24,000. The average number of
murders in the last ten years does not seem to have increased. It is about 67.
Compared with the increase of the population, very grave offences are rather dimi-
nished than otherwise. The greatest number of crimes are committed by persons
between eighteen and forty years of age, and many of these are by persons who have
not been brought up to any regular occupation. The education of a large proportion
of criminals is very meagre and limited, and particularly among the females. More
than 20 per cent, of the persons taken into custody in Hull in the last three years

are of this class.

   The number of persons that pass through the Hull gaol in a year is between 700

--and 800.
    III. llie Preventives of Crime. (1) This very important part of the subject has

of late years much engaged the attention both of the legislature and of philanthropic
individuals. Ragged and Industrial Schools, which have been established in the

metropolis and in the destitute and depraved districts of other large towns, have
proved a seasonable check to crime among the juvenile portion of the community.
Those which were established by Mr. Sheriff Watson in Aberdeen twelve years ago
have proved eminently successful. There has been a great decrease in the number
of juvenile ofl'enders, and a mendicant child is almost unknown.

   The one established in Hull contains ninety boys and fortj'-four girls, and such of
them as have been placed out in situations are doing well and giving satisfaction to

their employers.
    Great success has also attended the establishment of Reformatory Schools for

young criminals at Mettray in France, at Hamburg, and the one lately founded at
Red Hill, near Reigate, in Surrey.

    (2) Another means of preventing crime is the extensive circulation of religious and
moral publications, in a cheap form and in easy language.

    (3) The establishment of places of refuge for the reception of liberated prisoners
who have behaved well in gaol and express a desire for reformation. The number
of prisoners of this description is much larger than is generally supposed. It has
been calculated that three-fourths of the liberated prisoners never return to prison,
and that in the country at large 90,000 criminals in a year, whether deterred by
punishment or really reformed, against extraordinarily great disadvantages, do actually
return to a better course of life after legal imprisonment.

   The refuge for discharged prisoners at Durham, which has existed for the last five
years, has been attended with the best results. Out of 804 prisoners, 747 have been

reclaimed. The cost of the Institution has not exceeded ^60 annually, which is

about eight shillings for each reformed prisoner.
    It is the careful uptraining of the young in sound religious and moral instruction

that will do more to lessen the prevalence of crime than any mode that can be de-

vised. Let all public temptations to crime be lessened ; let the prisoner be treated
with kindness and consideration, as a man, though fallen ; let a spirit of Christian

love rule in the heart and be seen in the conduct of all who are employed around
prisoners ; and let the unhappy man or woman see that it is their restoration to
society as healthy members of the same, and not simply their punishment, which
is the thing aimed at ; we may then expect a great diminution of crime, and a vast
amount of real permanent good to attend our labours. The effect of this Christian

treatment of prisoners is no chimerical thing. It has been accomplished, and God's

blessing may always be expected to attend labours undertaken and carried on in

dependence on His promised aid.

--Parent Life-boat. The parent life-boat of Mr. Greathead only appeared in 1790,

but although a parliamentary grant of .Б1200 and other rewards were liberally be-

stowed upon this individual in consequence, public encouragement appears to have

been dormant until 360 plans and models were produced by the liberal reward of his

   Failure ofthe PrizeLife-boat. The prize was given to Beeching's boat, but her failure

on three occasions, with a lamentable loss of life at Rhyl and Lytham, shows that no

safe life-boat has, as yet, been adopted ; nor are such boats in sufficient numbers for

the wants of the community, even if they were perfectly efficient.

  --Want of Life-boats and consequent Loss of Life. Captain Washington, R.N., makes

known the astounding fact, as regards a maritime nation, that in 1500 miles of the

Scottish coast there are only 8 life-boats established ; and that no more than 75 are

provided for 2000 miles of the English coast; whilst 8 life-boats are all that belong

to Ireland. Capt. Washington shows, at the same time, that in 1850 there were 680

shipwrecks and 780 lives lost on the coast of Great Britain.

But numerous as were these calamities at that time, they have greatly increased

subsequently ; for 800 seamen perished on the east coast of England during the

calamitous winter of 1852-53, and an aggregate of 2000 Brilish seamen on our

coasts elsewhere.

 --Efforts of Public Bodies. Since the efforts of the Trinity Board, the Shipwreck

and other Societies, however great and meritorious, can only be partial, a centralized

system under Government, with funds voted by Parliament, seems to be absolutely

necessary                                              and  since  every seaman  pays 3d, annually from his  limited earnings, he

has every right to expect that the funds so raised should be turned to the best

--account.
   Life-hoats should he a National object. But the momentous question of efficient

life-boats can only be safely dealt with after the most patient consideration, founded

on extensive experiments as to the construction of the boats, and the rewards to be

given to those individuals who overlook the chance of salvage in order to save life,

--and thus make a sacrifice.
   Life-boat of Mr. Richardson. The boat to which I invite your attention, as being
safe under (it is believed) all circumstances, dates from the year 1830, when a wreck

at Weymouth, and the examination of Blanshard's pontoons, gave rise to the tubular

--boat.
   Description, &c. She is formed of two tubes of tinned iron, 40 feet in length by

2^ feet in diameter, tapering at the ends, and thus giving the appearance of shears,

as they rather approach one another towards the extremities. Iron frame-work,

securely riveted, unites the whole into one mass, which is further strengthened by

longitudinal bars of iron hoops within ; likewise, iron keels running from end to end

of the tubes. The latter, as an additional security, are divided into water-tight com-

Apartments occupied by air-pi'oof bags.  cork fender surrounds the fabric, on which

a platform is placed for the rowers and those who may be saved. She rows exceed-

ingly well, steers with facility, and is fast under sail. Sliding keels are proposed to

--be added to increase the stability.
   Experiments made with this Boat, After the most trying experiments, such as

landing through surf, and re-embarking on a lee-shore, towing in stormy weather

behind a steamer, without any one in the boat to steer, &c., Mr. H. T. Richardson

circulated a challenge to the Shipwreck and other Societies, and upwards of 50 life-

boats, and then made a voyage from Liverpool to Woolwich, expressly to meet and
compete with any boat that might be disposed to make a trial ; but not one ventured

--to do so.
   Published Account of the Life-boat. During this voyage of the Challenger life-
boat, which has been published by Pickering, she was subjected to various experiments

alongside the Leander frigate, and in presenceof the Port-Admiral, Sir John Oramaney,

--at Plymouth. Two officers then belonging to that ship thus speak of the boat :
   Naval Opinions of the Life-boat. " I think Challenger the only thing built, at least
that I have heard of, deserving the name of life-boat. She has no capacity to retain
water ; she cannot sink or capsize, as was fully proved when 80 men of the Leander
stood upon one tube. I would willingly take a boat of the same dimensions as one of
our cutters or quarter life-boat at sea, and feel convinced that many a valuable life

would be saved if a ship had such a boat belonging to her."
   "I witnessed," says the other writer, "one of the most severe trials that possibly

could have been put to any boat in the world, and she behaved admirably when tried

--alongside H.M.S. Leander, June 5, 1852."
   The Tubular ca7i scarcely be capsized. Hitherto it has been found impi-acticable

to capsize the tubular boat, because, not having a sea-bottom, the force of the waves
passes oiF and through the space between the tubes. But were she overturned, her
buoyancy would be as great or even greater than before, and with some little arrange-

ment, she would, as may be easily proved, be a serviceable boat with the bottom

upward.

 --Examination and Competition sought by Mr. Richardson. We may therefore hope

that a real life-boat has at length been constructed, as patented by Mr. Richardson,
who would be the first to condemn her if she prove unwoi'thy. What is sought is a

full examination by the authorities, and competition with the best existing life-boats;

with which object Mr. Richardson has recently expressed to the Shipwreck Fisher-

men and Mariner's Benevolent Society his readiness to meet any of their boats for

the purpose of trial, at any lime and place between the Land's-end and John o'Groats
House, or on the west coast of Ireland, between Cape Clear and the Causeway; and

thus to prove practically whether the tubular is or is not the best life-boat at present
in use to save life, as she would undoubtedly be the cheapest construction, if the
chivalrous object of the inventor shall be accomplished.

         On Reaping MacJiinery. By A. Crosskill, Beverley.

After some observations relative to the reaping-machine of the ancients, he
        TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS      115

remarked that, in taking a brief review of what had been done in modern times to

produce a reaping-machine, they might pass over some vague accounts which had

--been handed down from the past century, but which recorded nothing successful;

and they came to three inventors Boyse, Plunkett, and Gladstone--who, about the

year 1806, made reaping-machines, all modifications of a large circular cutter 5 feet

in diameter ; but they were soon laid aside, principally for want of sufficient mode@

of gathering the cut corn. In 1812, the late Mr. Smith, of Deanston, brought out

a reaping-machine, which appeared at intervals with different modifications, until

the year 1835, when it worked very successfully at the meeting of the Highland

Agricultural Society at Ayr, after which time it was laid aside, and had not since

been brought forward, There was another invention to which he would draw their

attention, on account of the great resemblance it bore to M'Cormick's Virginia

reaper, which had attracted so much notice during the last two years. In 1822, a

Mr. Ogle of Remington, near Alnwick, invented a reaping-machine, which was

worked upon wheat and barley ; but, as it received no encouragement, only one was

Amade.  description and drawing of it were published in 1826 ; and it was rather

a remarkable circumstance that this description answered in almost every particular

to M'Cormick's machine, which was invented ten years later, and at a distance of

5000 miles. They need be at no loss for an explanation of the failure of all these

schemes, many of which possessed considerable merit. Until the last two or three

years manual labour had been easily obtained in this country ; and at harvest time

especially, a large number of Irishmen came over to England, and obtained a liveli-

hood by assisting the farmers to gather in their crops. Owing to the rapid increase

of emigration, however, this temporary assistance was becoming every year more

and more precarious, and would in all probability entirely cease ;.and by a fortuitous

coincidence, the demand for reaping-machines, thtis occasioned, occurred at a time

when public attention was directed to them, in consequence of the prominent position

they occupied in the Great Exhibition of 185 1 . Amongst the American contributions

there were two reaping-machines, one invented by M'Cormick of Chicago, and the

other by Hussey of Baltimore. They were by no means the only reapers in use in

the United States, the great demand in that country having called into operation

numerous inventions for that purpose, but the two mentioned were very extensively

patronized. These two machines had been repeatedly tested, both in this country

and in the United States, and the question of superiority between the two was far

from being decided ; both had warm advocates, and they had received an equal share

of honour and prizes at various agricultural meetings and trials. In the year 1826

the Rev. Patrick Bell invented and constructed a reaping-machine, and succeeded in

making it work so well, that, in the year 1829, the Highland Agricultural Society

awarded to him the sum of Б50 for his invention. Most of these machines were

gradually laid aside. In 1852, when the American reapers were sent northward,

Mr. Bell put his old machine into thorough repair, and met Hussey's at the meeting

of the Highland Society at Perth. The superiority of an implement with self-acting

delivery over one which required the assistance of a man to take the corn off the

platform was so evident that the judges unanimously awarded the prize to Bell's

machine, and the same result had occurred at every trial in which it had since been

engaged. This machine was different from both the American machines, and cer-

tainly Mr. Bell was entitled to praise for the novelty of his invention, no resemblance

existing between it and Smith's, Mann's, Orme's, or any other that had been made

before it, except that the horses followed the machine, a mode of propulsion which

was in use at the time of the ancient Romans. In acknowledging their debt of

gratitude to the Americans for bringing over their machines and directing public

attention to the subject, and also for demonstrating, in a manner that must have

convinced the most sceptical and prejudiced, that reaping by machinery was as

practicable as thrashing, it must be a source of national pride to find that they had

in Great Britain an implement superior to any brought from foreign countries, and

which only required an opportunity to be fully appreciated. In looking forward to

the improvements to be made in reaping-machines, it must not be forgotten that the

hasty flight of the seasons rendered a succession of experiments almost impossible.

Reaping by machinery was yet new to implement-makers, but no one has had
much experience to bear upon the subject ; and they might reasonably expect that,

for some time to come, every harvest would add something to our stock of know-

                                      8*

ledge ; and continuous improvements would doubtless be made in the construc-
tion of these implements before they arrived at that perfection to which machinery
in all its branches was brought in this country. Models of Bell's, M'Cormick's and
Hussey's reaping-machines were exhibited and explained by Mr. Crosskill.

On the progress of Mechanical Science. Address delivered by the President

   of the Section,W iht,iAu Fairbairn, C.E., F.R.S., on the opening of the

     business.

    After briefly alluding to the progressive improvements that have taken place in
this country and America during the last half-century, Mr. Fairbairn observed, that
at the meeting of the Association at Belfast, several interesting papers were discussed,

such as those ' On Telegraphic communication by Land and Sea,' ' Improvements
on the permanent way of Railways,' ' On Lattice Girder Bridges,' ' On the Evolution
of Gas in Coal Mines,' ' On the Vortex Water-Wheel,' ' Iron Sleepers,' ' Tubular

Boilers,' &c. All those he considered as additions to our knowledge in the useful
arts, and calculated to promote the advancement of practical science.

    In his view of the progress of the mechanical arts for the last twelve months, he
alluded to the advices received from America on the subject of steam navigation, and
the wonders that were likely to be achieved by Capt. Ericsson in the completion and
substitution of the caloric for the steam-engine. The public, and particularly the
engineering world, were greatly interested by a question of such vast importance as a
new motive power ; and Mr. Fairbairn (although he did not participate in the belief of
its success to the same extent as some of his scientific friends), nevertheless, was bound
to admit the possibility of great improvements being effected by Capt. Ericsson, upon
those already introduced into Dr. Stirling's air-engine ten years ago. It was much to
be regretted that after two years' trial, the scientific world were not yet in possession
 of results suflScient to assure the ultimate success of the invention.

    In other respects the country had reasons for congratulation in the improve-
ments that had taken place in our ships of war, as well as our mercantile navy.
The introduction and successful application of the screw propeller, the concentra-
tion of the moving power, the saving of space and other advantages which distinguish
the steam flotilla of this country, were doubtless the precursors of a new sera in

naval history

    To be convinced of the changes now in progress, it was only necessary to notice

--the splendid sight which occurred at Spithead a few weeks since to witness ships

such as the Duke of Wellington, of nearly 4000 tons burden, 1100 men and 131 guns

-- --of large calibre, moving in and out of position regardless of wind or tide with a

facility that would have astonished the Rodneys, Howes and Nelsons of former
 days, and left the impression of a complete revolution in the naval tactics of the
 present as compared with the past.

    That improvements such as described had been effected did not admit of doubt,
 and in Mr. Fairbairn's opinion still greater changes were in progress in the application
 of steam upon a much more extended scale ; and he was persuaded that a few years
would witness in ships of war as well as merchantmen a different description of
engines than those now in use, where steam might be used at a pressure of 120 to
 130 lbs. on the square inch, and where a great saving of weight and space would be
 effected, and much increased speed obtained.

    In speaking of steam navigation, Mr. Fairbairn could not omit to notice one of
 the most gigantic undertakings that had ever yet been attempted in this or any other

country, naraelj', the Mammoth ship now in process of construction by Mr. Brunei

 and Mr. J. Scott Russell. The quoted dimensions of this vessel he gave as 680 feet
 long, 83 feet beam, 58 feet deep, and an aggregate nominal power of 2600 horse.
 'Ihis immense vessel would be constructed entirely of iron, and the hull or ship's
 bottom to the extent of 6 feet above the water-line would be double and of the cellular
 construction, so that any external injury would neither affect the tightness nor safety
of the ship. The upper deck would also be strengthened on the same principle, so
 that the ship would be a complete beam, similar to the tubes of the Britannia Bridge.
The vessel (according to the account) would be divided into ten completely water-
tight compartments, which would admit of further subdivision up to the lower deck.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  Il7

being from 4 to 8 feet above the water-line. Separate sets of engines, as well as
separate boilers, would be applied to work the screw distinct from those working the
paddle-wheels ; so that in the event of the derangement of any of the engines, those

--in working order would be available for the ship's progress.
   Railways. In this department of practical science Mr. Fairbairn noticed several
improvements that had been effected in the extension of power to the rolling stock.

On the London and North-Western and Great Northern Railwa3's, several large and
improved engines had been made to meet the demands of the greatly increased traffic

on each line, and the accumulating passenger traffic on the southern division of the
London and North-Western had been met by the introduction of an improved and
immensely powerful engine of an entirely new construction invented by Mr. J. E.
McConnel, the Company's engineer. Other lines were progressing in a similar ratio
both in this country and in Ireland, and steam locomotion, the great promoter of
civilization, was now extending itself in every direction and amongst all the nations

--of the earth.
   Manufactures. In this branch of known industry the same spirit of progress had
been observable as in other departments of practical science. The cotton, wool, silk

and flax manufactures, were never in a more flourishing condition. New mills were

rising in different localities, and Mr. Fairbairn stated that the industrial classes were

never at any former period so well paid for their labour, or in such comfortable cir-
cumstances as they had been for the last two years ; and this great and important
measure of comfort and prosperity was in a great degree owing to the improvements
in machinery, and the power which had thus been given for producing every description
of manufacture at a cheap rate. Amongst the most recent and probably the most
important improvements that had taken place in the manufacture of the textile fabrics,
was the new combing machine, which appeared to apply with equal effect to cotton,
flax and wool. This machine was of French origin, ingenious in construction and

beautiful in performance.
    In reference to national industry, Mr. Fairbairn noticed one of the most extensive

erections ever undertaken by a single individual or even by a company, in this or any
other country, the splendid manufactory then erecting by Mr. Titus Salt, at Saltaire,
near Bradford. This magnificent building covers an area of six acres, comprising
one large mill or building 550 feet long, 50 feet wide and six stories high, besides
offices, warehouses, weaving and combing sheds, and other erections which would
render it one of the most remarkable and most convenient buildings in the kingdom.

    It was intended for the spinning and manufacture of mohair and alpaca wool, and
other mixed fabrics in that new and important description of manufacture. Motion
was given to the machinery by steam-engines of 400 nominal horse-power, but of
sufficient strength to be worked to 1250 horse. The establishment would employ

--about 3000 hands.
   Mining and the Manufacture of Iron. These, like many other branches of industry,
have greatly increased in value, and the different mechanical and chemical applications
which had been brought to bear upon the subject, have not been without their use
and influence upon the community. Amongst other improvements was that of
 Mr. Grace Calvert of Manchester, for removing the sulphurous vapour from coal and
 coke during the process of smelting the ores in the furnace and the meltings in the
 cupula; by this process not only a considerable increase of strength was obtained, but
 a great saving in the iron was effected. In the application of the purified coke
 to the cupula, the increase of strength was found, by carefully conducted and
 repeated experiments, to be as the numbers 233 and 193, an increase of strength of

 about 20 per cent.

     On Improvements in Organ Machinery. By J. A. Forster, Hull.

   The first great principle to be kept in view in all machinery is simpUcily ; but in a
large organ, where there are thousands of small pieces of wood and metal, joined
together by means of centres, it is of the greatest importance. The second, is to
avoid friction as much as possible and to prevent stickings and cypherings ; and lastly,
to make the touch light and elastic to the organist's finger, at the same time avoiding
all noise. Many attempts have been made to lighten the touch of large organs, and
with various degrees of success. In 1831, Mr. Hamilton of Edinburgh, and Mr. Barker
--U8 REPORT 1853.

of Bath, each invented a pneumatic machine to act upon the manual valves, and, sin-
gular to say, they were both on the same principle, both had the same defects ; viz.
after the key was pressed down, a moment of time was lost before the corresponding
pipe emitted any sound ; this, in rapid music, although an apparent trifling diffi-
culty, must account for its not becoming in general use for large organs. The model
by Mr. Hamilton was exhibited before the members of the British Association at their
meeting in Birmingham in 1831. Mr. Barker (now resident in Paris) took out a
patent for his machine in France, since which he has made several improvements to
it ; further improvements have been made to it by the Chevalier Cavallee.

   The improvements now offered consist of a regulating screw and ball-valve, by
which means a more certain and instantaneous action is acquired ; also a perfectly
new system of centring the action, which is applicable to other parts of the mechanism
in organs, and by which means the friction is reduced to a nominal amount, and

noise entirely obviated.

   By the use of a peculiarly formed drill, where two pieces of wood are to be attached
together by means of a centre to form a moveable joint, the part that works in the

mortice has the surface completely cut away, with the exception of a small por-
tion, where the wire-centre passes through, which stands up rather proud, like a
small washer, on either side of the tenon; thus the large surface of the tenon is pre-
vented rubbing in the mortice at every movement of the joint. This drill (made

either for large or small work) may be used with very great advantage in the whole
of the mechanism of our organ, where two pieces of wood form a moveable joint.

   The next improvement is the introduction of a small stud, by which each lever or
square connected with the keys can be fixed separately; the old system is to pass a
wire through a range of from fifty to sixty squares or levers, which wire is secured to
a bar of wood by means of staples driven in fast. Should an accident occur to a
lever in a range or set, the whole of the machinery would have to be detached to get
to the damaged part, and this, in some instances, at a loss of several days' labour
whereas, by the new or improved system, the damaged part would be removed by
taking out a single screw, and replaced in as many hours as the old system would
occupy days.

   The next improvement is a new pedal-valve for large pedal pipes, to which I have
given the name of the " universal pedal-valve," in consequence of its being applicable
in any position in a simple box or wind-trunk, thereby doing away with the necessity
of a pedal sound-board with grooves. The advantages of this pallet is the large quan-
tity of wind it will allow to escape when open, and, being a ball-valve, the resistance
of the wind is in a great measure obviated : the expense of making it is less than the

old pedal-valve.

                            On t/ie Steam-Engine Indicator.
               By Joseph Hopkinson, Engineer, Huddersfield.

   The indicator is a quarter of a square inch, and each tenth of an inch on the index
represents one pound pressure to the square inch on the piston of the engine. The
spring compressed is the steam pressure, and distended, is the atmospheric pressure
upon the piston of the indicator. This spring is so adjusted as to meet the require-

ments of the pressure as it increases. When the steam exceeds twenty-five pounds

to the square inch above the pressure of the atmosphere, there is an additional
spring enclosed in a case for higher pressure up to seventy-five pounds to the
square inch or any other pressure required, to be screwed on the top of the casing.
The piston rod of the indicator passes up the centre of the spring and comes in
contact with the top attached to the second spring, so that instead of the resistance

of only one spring, there is a resistance of two springs for high pressure steam. On

the scale for high pressure the distances are marked thirty to the inch for steam above
twenty-five pounds, and one-thirtieth of an inch represents one pound pressure to the
square inch on the steam side. The scale on the vacuum side is ten to the inch,
or one-tenth of an inch represents one pound pressure to the square inch, as before
with high or low pressure steam ; there is a hole in the side of the tap ; when the tap
is open the hole is turned with its perfect side against the plug ; but when the tap
is closed, the hole communicates with the piston of the indicator and allows the
pressure of the atmosphere to the piston. The paper is fixed round the body of the
instrument so as to be firm ; the pencil holder is then parallel with the cylinder, so that
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  119.

any yielding of the pencil will not affect the pressure but the length of the diagram ;
the pencil screws backwards and forwards to adjust the pressure on the paper. The
diameter of the cylinder of the indicator is two inches and three-quarters, so that a

diagram may be obtained seven inches long, which will enable the operator to read

off more quickly and accurately than from the ordinary indicator.

                  On a Patent Safety Alarum for Steam-Boilers.
               By Joseph Hopkinson, Engineer, Huddersfield.

    The safety alarum is one of those precautionary contrivances to give warning,
should any derangement take place within the boiler, either from want of water, or
too much water, or an over-pressure of steam.

    Numerous have been the methods resorted to, to give the alarm and call the
attention of the stoker. The steam-whistle has often been applied for this purpose,
but so attached to the float-wire that it has been tampered with, and was soon out
of order. The safety alarum is free from those objections ; it is similar in principle
to the compound safety valve, the one already brought before this Section. It
is 60 constructed that when the water in the boiler gets to an extreme distance below
or above the level fixed, the alarm instantly commences by a steam -whistle, suflSciently
loud to be heard on any part of the premises, which will not cease until the water
has gained its proper level. Should the steam get too high, the same whistle com-
mences with a loud noise different in its tone, that it is easily distinguished whether
it be from want of water or from an over-pressure of steam, and it is out of the
power of any person to prevent its operating when any of these casualties take

place.

   The simplicity of the apparatus is such that it is not liable to derangement, there
being no stuffing-box or float-wire, or parts liable to be tampered with ; it is free from
the objection against the alarm-whistle to steam-boilers when connected to the float
wire or to a hollow float ; the weight on the valve is locked up inside the dome, and
the key in the proprietors' possession, which makes it a complete check, and renders
it impossible for the steam to be raised above the proper pressure, or the water to
ba below the level fixed, without being detected, for the power of detection is the
only real check against wilful and negligent conduct on the part of those in charge.

      On an improved Compound Patent Safety Valve for Steam-Boilers.
               By Joseph Hopkinson, Engineer, Huddersfield.

  --The valve is intended to provide against two contingences over-pressure of steam

and deficiency of water in the boiler. There is a separate arrangement for securing
these objects. The valve is an ordinary flat or concave disc, but there is some
novelty in the fittings. All the weight is placed within the boiler and suspended
from the underside of the valve ; over the valve is a lever (and fulcrum), and at its
extremity a spring balance, which, by a screw, can be regulated to press down
heavily or lightly, according to the pressure required. This spring balance, how-

ever, operates precisely the reverse of those which may be seen on the top of
locomotive engines. The maximum weight to be carried is within the boiler, and

the effect of weighting the external lever is only to decrease the internal weight and
thus to diminish the pressure of steam at which the valve will open ; should any
additional weight be clandestinely applied within when the boiler is being cleaned,

the spring balance will indicate the fraud. ITie contrivance for preventing the
dangerous consequences of deficiency of water, consists of a long lever, suspended
from attachment inside the valve tube. At the end of the long limb of the lever is
the float, and at the opposite end a weight which counterbalances it, so long as
the float remains immersed in the water ; should there be a deficiency to a dangerous
fixed point, the short limb of the lever will push up the safety valve, and thus

allow the steam to escape. This is an important feature of the invention and pro-
mises to be of service. It thus renders the working of the boiler, when the water
therein is deficient, absolutely impossible, and thus affords the most valuable means
of preventing steam-boiler explosions hitherto applied. The compound safety valve

is wholly beyond the control of the stoker or the engineer.

On an improved Patent Steam- Engine Boiler desir/nated the Greatest i?e-
  sistance Steam-Boiler. By Joseph Hopkinson, Engineer, Huddersfield.

   The boiler is a combination of three circular boilers laid horizontally to form the
furnace. The two side boilers or generators, forming the fire-box, are each 4
feet in diameter. The upper boiler is of the same diameter, with a dome at the
end forming a reservoir for steam. There is also an inverted dome ; to this part of the
boiler the sediment settles, and is blown out. The action of the flame from the
furnace is diverted by the inverted dome towards each side boiler, and made to enter
the tubes. Each side boiler is provided with seventy-five tubes 3 inches in diameter.
The length of each side boiler is 8 feet ; the upper boiler is longer than the side
boilers by the diameter of the dome. The front end of the upper boiler is egg-
shaped, and projects past the side boilers the length of the egg end, making the
extreme length of the upper boiler 14 feet. The centre boiler with the dome forms
the principal steam-chamber ; and the form gives plenty of space for this purpose,
thus preventing to a great extent that priming to which boilers with contracted
steam room are much subject.

    The space occupied by this boiler in width is 11 feet 3 inches, and its height from
the floor to the upper surface, exclusive of the dome, is 6 feet ; the width of the
 furnace is 4 feet 6 inches, and the length of the grate-bar 6 feet ; making the area
 of the grate surface 27 superficial feet. The effective heating surface of the fire-box
 and boiler, independent of the tubes, is 140 superficial feet ; seventy-five tubes in
 each boiler, of 3 inches in diameter and 8 feet long, gives 900 superficial feet of tube
 surface ; and the total amount of fire-box and tube surface is 1040 superficial feet,
 allowing 16 superficial feet of heating surface per horse power : this boiler, though so
 small of itself, will be sixty-five horse power.

    The largest diameter being 4 feet, if made of :J-inch plate, is equal in strength to
 a 6-feet boiler made of f -inch plate, and equal to a boiler 8 feet in diameter made
 of ^-inch plate ; the whole weight, including the 150 tubes, will not exceed five tons.

     The advantages to be derived by the use of such a boiler are, that the form and
 combination allow of simple construction, and avoid complication ; no angle irons
 or stays are required; small diameters are placed in such a position as to form
 a large fire-box. Each part is separate and easily connected or disconnected. Any
  single part can be removed without injuring the other parts ; and any one part can
 be replaced with a new portion, independent of the other portions, for transit to any
 part of the world : this boiler offers peculiar advantages, as a powerful boiler may
  be conveyed in separate portions, and put together with little trouble. Another
  advantage in this construction of boiler, is a large furnace, consequently the stoker
  is enabled to place large quantities of fuel in the furnace each time he fires ; thus
  the doors may be kept closed longer than with ordinary firing, thus preventing
  cold air from entering the tubes, a very important consideration with tubular boilers.

 A large furnace also affords unusual facilities for smoke consuming. Another im-

  portant feature is, the first cost is considerably reduced.

     For marine purposes, with slight modifications, this boiler presents many advantages;

  the principle of true construction will enable the expansive piinciple to be further
  carried out in marine engines, and thereby reduce the consumption of fuel. For
  war steamers these boilers can be so constructed, that should any single part become
  damaged, it could be shut off from the other, allowing the full power of the remaining
   portions to continue.

     The small space occupied in the height with this boiler, would also be of advantage,
  it being considerably below the water-line of a war steamer.

 A brief Description of Locking atid Cook's Patent Potatory Valve-Engine^

              and of its Advantages. By George Locking, Hidl.

      Tlie principal feature in this engine consists in one valve doing the work of two
  slide-valves and with fewer rubbing surfaces. All eccentrics, levers, &c. are dispensed
  with. The valve is placed between two ordinary rectilineal cylinders, and the rotatory
  motion is eflected by means of bevel gear fixed to the crank-shaft and valve-spindle;
  the pinion on the crank-shaft being to the bevel-wheel on the spindle in the propor-
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                            12t

tion of three to one, so that the valve makes only one revolution in the same time that
the crank takes to revolve thrice. The valve is a plain disc, perforated with three

apertures or steam-ways, heneath which, in the face of the seat upon which the valve

works, are also four steam-ways, two each for the right aud left-hand cylinders. The

valve in its rotatory motion is so constructed, that the steam-ways through it pass

over those in the seat, giving (during the time it takes to pass) free access to the

steam from the chest to the cylinders alternately above and below the piston. Like

the slide-valve, it is chambered, and the steam escapes to the exhaust-pipe or the

condenser as in ordinary engines.

Reversing is effected by a lever and sliding- box, each end of the box having a slot,

one of which is straight, the other diagonal, the length of each being equal from point

to point on the box longitudinally, the transverse distance of the diagonal being one-

sixth the circumference of the box. Through these slots are pins or drivei-s, made

fast to the valve-spindle, which keep the box in its position, allowing it to move up
and down when the lever is lifted or pressed, the spindle being in two parts and

forming a junction immediately between these pins in the centre of the box. By

moving the lever up or down, the spindle on which the diagonal slot is placed alters

its relative position to the other with the straight slot : thus the valve is carried round

one-sixth of its circumference, thereby changing the position of the steam-ways and

reversing the engine.

   The arrangements of the patent valve reduce the working parts, render the engine
more simple, lessen the friction, so obtaining a saving of power and rendering less
fuel necessary ; and as there are fewer working parts, the wear and tear will be dimi-
nished, and less oil, tallow, waste and labour required.

   Both cylinders will receive and cut off the steam at the same point. Another im-
portant advantage of the patent valve is the mode of working the steam expansively

and cutting it off at any point of the stroke, the valve requiring no additional power

to work it. The cost of the patent engine will be less than that of those now in use
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

consisting too, as it does, of little more than cylinders and cranks, it will be much less

Aliable to get out of order, and will occupy less room.  singular advantage is the

great ease with which it may be reversed when the steam is full on, for the engineer

by the use of a single lever can regulate to a nicety the quantity required, and ease,

stop, or reverse at pleasure.

On certain Improvements in the Construction of Steam Ships, Life-boats, and

   other Vessels ; also in Steam-Boilers, Propellers, Anchors, Windlasses, and

            On Recent Improvements in Machines for Tilling Land.

                     By Bernard Samuelson, Banbury.

   The plough, which has so long been the principal, and will probably remain for a
long time to come a most valuable implement of husbandry, has (among others) this
inconvenience, that whilst it loosens and reverses the top soil, it compresses the bottom
of the furrow in its progress. A partial remedy was applied to this evil at consider-
able expense by the use of the subsoil plough, which bursts the ground immediately
below the furrow.

    It has been sought to avoid the use of the plough entirely, in those cases where the
complete inversion is not needed, and hence the introduction of various pulverizers,
grubbers, &c., which have of late been used, no longer as auxiliaries, but as principals
in cultivation. For the same reason digging with the spade or fork, hitherto confined
to the operations of the gardener, has been practised recently with great success by

many farmers, amongst whom may be mentioned Mr. Mechi on the larger, and the

Rev. S. Smith, of Lois Weedou, on a more experimental scale. Horse and hand-
hoeing are becoming more regular every year, not merely for the purpose of destroy-
ing weeds, but also of exposing fresh particles of soil to decomposition, thus con-
stantly increasing and renewing the supply of food at the disposal of the growing
crop. Not content with these amplifications of the use of the accustomed farming
--122 REPORT 1853.

tools, other more expeditious and more complete machines of cultivation have been

--Bought after and invented. Omitting the various clod-crushers and harrows, these may

be conveniently divided into 1, ploughing machines drawn by stationary steam-
engines; 2, locomotive steam-jiloughs ; and 3, machines, chiefly rotatory, for pul-

verizing by means of forks, spades or claws.
   Amongst the first class, the most remarkable are the ploughing-frames of Lord

Willoughby d'Eresby and of the Marquis of Tweeddale, differing in their details, yet
both attended, more or less, with some of the inconveniences of the horse-plough; but
successful, inasmuch as they substitute a more expeditious and powerful agent for
animal traction. The Marquis of Tweeddale's ploughing machine consists of a frame,

containing two double ploughs, resembling the common turnwrist plough, one half of
each being in the air, whilst the other half is in the ground. The frame is drawn
across the field by wire ropes attached to two steam-engines stationed at opposite

headlands; both ploughs being reversed at each turn, so that the slices are always
laid in the same direction. The work of each plough is 15 inches deep and 13

inches wide, equal to 26 inches in the frame, and the execution is faultless. By
means of a beam about 18 feet long, projecting from each engine at right angles to

the ploughing-frame, and a simple apparatus attached to it, the ploughs are lifted at
each turn and deposited two furrows, or 26 inches, in advance of their previous posi-
tion. Thus the frequent removal of the engines is avoided. They are, however,
locomotive and run upon wooden rails laid for the purpose. The machine ploughs

three acres per day, and requires four men to work it, besides a man and horse to
bring water. The depth ploughed (15 inches) is unprecedented except by the horse-

ploughing of the Marquis himself, who, by the aid of the latter, so improved the fer-
tility of two entire fai-ms as to have raised their annual value in five years from 7s. 6d.

to 3/. per acre.

   A more decided advance in steam-ploughing has been made by Mr. Usher of Edin-
burgh, who boldly abandoned the old mode of traction altogether, and caused his

steam-engine to cross the land on a broad roller, attaching to it a cylindrical frame-
work of plough-points and mould-boards, which, whilst being lowered into the ground

to the required depth, is made to rotate, disintegrating the soil more completely than
the ordinary plough, without compressing the bottom of the furrow, the thrust of the
mould-boards at the same time aiding the forward motion of the engine, and enabling
it to mount inclinations which it could not cope with by the mere adhesion of the
roller. As at present constructed, the power is about 10 horses, and when worked to

a depth of seven or eight inches, it will plough about six acres per day. Its great

weight, about six tons, is a serious drawback, but that may be considerably reduced

and no other rotatory machine so successfully inverts the soil, though it is still excelled
in that respect by the ordinary traction ploughs. Usher's steam-plough has been re-
peatedly worked in the Lothians, and its use was not attended with any difficulties
beyond those which must be expected in all new inventions.

    With reference to machines for digging by means of spades, the author is not aware
of any that have been put into actual operation. The machine exhibited by Thomp-
son, in the agricultural department of the Crystal Palace of 1851, consisted of two

series of spades at right angles to each other, the second series covering the spaces left
by the first, and both being forced into the ground by a cranked shaft, borne in a

rectangular frame.

    The last, and apparently the most promising division, is that of the rotatory forking

or clawing implements.

   A light machine of this kind was constructed so long as thirty years back by Morton

of Leith; but it comes rather under the class of revolving harrows than of cultivators
properly so called. Foremost amongst the latter in point of date is that of Lady
Vavasour, exhibited at the show of the Royal Agricultural Society at Bristol, which,
though unsuccessful, may be regarded as tlie precursor of the more practical rotatory
forking and subsoiling machines that have since been constructed. Lady Vavasour's
implement consisted of a cylinder studded with prongs set spirally around it, which
penetrated the ground by the weight of the cylinder and framing, and broke or tore

it up as the latter was drawn forward.
    It was succeeded, after an interval of some years, by the cultivators of the Hon.

Mr. Clive and of Josiah Parkes. One of the latter has been used in subsoiling the
estate of Mr. Marshall, at Patrington near Hull Here the cylinder of Lady Vavasoyr,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.           12S

which liad the inconvenience of forming, as it were, a taking-up roller, round which

the earth wound itself, until it formed a solid mass, in which the prongs entirely dis-
appeared, is replaced by a number of discs revolving independently of each other;

tho prongs also being made so long that the earth cannot easily reach their roots.
Another step was the addition of cleaning or doffing bars, for stripping the soil from

the prongs. Of these, Roberts' machine affords an example. Its chief peculiarity,
however, consists in the prongs being made to feather, somewhat like the floats of
Morgan's paddle-wheel, the motion communicated to them resembling that of the

fork in the hands of a man.

   The labours of Hoskyns, the author of the ' Chronicles of a Clay Farm,' must not
be forgotten. He has described graphically the " points " which are requisite to make

a perfect steam cultivator, and consequently divested the subject, to the machinist, of

one of its chief difficulties.
   Besides a modification, proposed by Usher, of his steam-plough, in which he sub-

--stitutes rotatory prongs for his points and mould-boards involving, however, the diffi-
--culty, that he loses the aid to progression which the latter afford him two other steam

cultivators have been projected, both of which possess, in common with that suggested

by Hoskyns, the distinctive feature that the rotation of the cultivating tools is not derived
from the progress of the carriage. The first is that of Stephen Brown, who has two
series of rotatory cutters, the second set working in intervals left by the first, and both

driven through cross shafts from a small locomotive steam-engine forming part of the

implement, and which may either work its way across the field by its own adhesion,
or be drawn by horses. The second is the Canadian machine spoken of by Mr. Mechi

in a recent letter to the ' Times.' It does not differ greatly from the preceding in its
mode of operation, its novelty consisting in the arrangement of the parts, and in the

adoption of a very light and compact form of engine.
   The most recent rotatory cultivators that have been put practically to work are

Bleasdale's and Mr. Samuelson's. The former somewhat resembles Parkes' subsoilers,

but being calculated only to pulverize the surface soil, its weight is only about one-
half that of Parkes', and that weight (1 ton), instead of resting on two discs only, is

distributed over seven. The chief novelty in it is the cleaning apparatus, consisting
of an additional cylinder, suspended at "an angle of about 45░ above, and driven

from the shaft of the primary or digging cylinder, and therefore revolving in the
opposite direction to it. Its prongs act as a rotatory comb in stripping the earth from
those of the former. This machine was exhibited at the Gloucester meeting of the
Royal Agricultural Society, and on land previously broken by the plough acted admi-

rably as a pulverizer and a weed extracter.
   Whilst engaged in some experiments with a machine somewhat resembling that of

Parkes', Mr. Samuelson's attention was directed to the steel digging-forks which have
lately been substituted with so much advantage for the old trenching-fork, and it
occurred to him that, by substituting light steel prongs for the wrought or cast metal
ones hitherto used in rotatory implements, an efficient cultivating machine for horse
power, strong yet comparatively light, could be made. In following out this idea, he

has constructed his digging, or more properly, forking machine, not altogether unsuc-
cessfully, as may be inferred from the number of them which are already in use,

notwithstanding the recent date of its introduction.

   The forks of the digging machine are made of the best cast steel that can be pro-
cured, of a square section, slightly tapered, bent on the angle and in pairs, at a cherry
heat, and allowed to cool gradually. They are curved, so as to enter the ground easily,

but to lift the soil as they come out.

The upper portion of six such pairs being laid between two half-discs of cast iron,

grooved to receive them, the half-discs being afterwards united by bolts, form a dig-

ging wheel of which the discs represent the boss, and the points of the forks the spokes

Athe hoop or tyre is absent.  number of these digging wheels (seven in a full-sized

machine) are hung on a bar, around which they rotate freely. Between each pair of

wheels and on the same bar is hung a ring, which keeps them apart, and cleans the

sides of the bosses. Tlie frame containing the bar with the digging wheel also holds

a number of cleaners, the ends of which scrape the soil from the circumference of

the bosses and force it from the prongs. This frame, to which the shafts and draught

links for the horses are also attached, is itself hung in front on another bar, connect-

ing two segmental frames, one on each side of the digging frame. These contain the
--124 REPORT 1853.

wheels on which the implement rests when it is not in action, and which also serve to
regulate tlie depth to which the forks of the digging frame are allowed to penetrate
the ground. The segments at the back of the travelling wheel frames being toothed,
two pinions gear into them, the place of which on the segments determines the height
at which tlie digging frame is sustained ; a winch attached to the latter works the

pinions.

   When the horses move forward, the attendant throws out of gear a pawl, which
holds the pinions at any given point ; the digging frame runs down by its own weight,

the prongs enter the ground, and the depth of their penetration is increased or dimi-
nished by turning the winch in opposite directions, thereby causing more or less
weight to rest on the travelling and digging wheels respectively. RIeanwhile the
resistance offered by the earth in front of the prongs causes the latter to revolve, and
portions of the soil to be detached, which are thrown back, after having been lifted

and broken by contact with the cleaning bars.

  A full-sized machine weighs a ton, and breaks u|) (to a depth not exceeding 10

inches) a breadth of 3 feet at a time, equal to that of four ploughs, and equivalent to

about five acres in seven hours.

    The draught required varies, wilh the nature and state of the soil, from four to

seven horses. A smaller implement is made for occupiers of land whose horse-power

is limited, capable of working about three acres in the same time with three or four

horses.

    About thirty digging machines, corresponding with the description here given, are
at work in various parts of this country ; one of them in this immediate neighbour-
 hood, on the estate of Mr. Robert Harrison of Benningholme Hall.

     Whilst speaking of the digging machine, it is right to state that it possesses, in

common with all other rotatory implements hitherto made or proposed, this disadvan-

tage, as compared with the plough, that it does not completely invert the soil.
 However, the occasions for such inversion are much more rare when we work with
 an insti-runent which leaves the ground broken, hollow and mixed, like the digging
 machine, than with one which, like the plough, cleaves off a sHce and exposes its
 superficies only to the air ; there being, in fact, this essential distinction between the
 two machines, that one allows the air and water to descend, whereas in the other,
 fresh soil must be brought up, if it is to be acted upon by the elements. Hence also
 an inconvenience is avoided by forking, which often accompanies the attempts to
 deepen the mould, by means of the plough, in plastic soils ; namely, that the fresh
 soil so brought up forms a compact coating, and is consequently for several reasons
 injurious instead of beneficial to vegetation. Even were as many horses required
 for a given acreage with the digging machine as with the plough, there would still
 be a great gain both of horse and manual labour by the use of the former, since it
 effects at one operation the work of several ploughings and harrowings, or scufilings
 but in fact it succeeded, during the dry weather in June, in preparing the ground for
 a crop on the strong clays in the vicinity of London, where a combination of the best
 implements previously in use could make no impression upon it.

     The forks tend to pull out and leave the weeds on the surface, and it is therefore

  useful in eradicating the couch-grass, the vegetation of which, the action of the
 plough or scufHe, by cutting the tendrils, is calculated to promote.

      Whilst these improvements have been in progress, the sjnrit of invention has
 not slumbered even at the antipodes; and we shall shortly see exhibited in this
 country an Australian forking machine, not differing very greatly from some of those
  which have been noticed. Mr. Wilson, the inventor, appears to have taken his hint
 from noticing in a track of a waggon-wheel on soft ground that the side of the tyre

 tends to abrade and throw back the earth. He prolongs the spokes of his wheels

  beyond the tyre in the form of spuds, which are segments of an epicycloidal curve,
  with a view to their encountering the least resistance in front or behind as they enter

  the ground.

     Whatever may be the success of all or any of the cultivating machines which have
 been brought under notice, enough has certainly been done to demonstrate that we
  have entered upon a new epoch in the mechanics of tillage, and that how long soever
  the dominion of the plough may be destined to last, it is not henceforth to reign alone.
  Meanwhile the author was anxious to direct the attention of machinists to a branch
  of their profession, than which none stands more in need of cultivation, and none will

  more amply repay it.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  1^

  We are dealing with a department of industry, which, until lately, was oppressed

with an excess of human labour, whilst the whole of its produce was liable to be de-
preciated far more than any other in value, by a comparatively trifling increase in its
amount. But now the tables are turned ; the supply of agricultural labour diminishes
daily, whilst consumption is extending beyond all precedent, and the cultivator of the
soil looks eagerly to the mechanic to cheapen his operations, and, jointly with the
chemist, to aid him in making two blades grow where one only grew before.

On Railway Accidents by Collision, and Suggestions for their Prevention.
               By William Scoresby, D.D!, F.R.S.L^E.

   Tlie absorption of previously existing modes of travelling, for the most part, by that
of railway locomotion, has given to this method, in respect to its degree of risk of
personal injury, a vast measure of public importance. Each one of us, indeed, is
interested in the inquiry, of what may possibly be done to diminish these risks and

   It is not assumed by me that railways are necessarily or practically more imsafe

than former modes of conveyance ; on the contrary, estimated proportionally, or di-
viding the number of miles travelled by the amount of injury sustained, we should
have a result, I doubt not, still greatly in favour of railway travelling. For in esti-
mating the results of accidents, comparatively, we should remember that accidents by
coaches, involving occasionally fatal cases, were extremely numerous, and that of
these numerous accidents few became pubhcly known ; but accidents by railways, no
doubt sometimes very calamitous, are all recorded and generally become publicly
known ; whilst the enormous increase of travelling, ordinarily involving increase in the
number of accidents and quantity of injury, gives an apparent aggravation of the
comparative dangers. At the same time, accidents, it is notorious, are lamentably
prevalent, and far more so, doubtless, than are due to essential and unavoidable risks.

   The prevalent sources of accidents may be considered as divisible into three cha-

--racteristic classes: 1st, accidents from incaution or recklessness of passengers and

workmen ; 2nd, accidents from the giving way of machinery whilst the train is in
rapid progress, or from the engine or any carriage getting off the line ; and 3rd,

accidents from the collision of trains or carriages.
     It is to this latter source of accidents, yielding, I beheve, in respect to passengers

a considerable, if not a preponderating proportion of the injury referable to manage-
ment, to which I have now to direct the attention of the Section. And to this parti-
cular source of accident, presenting in its results catastrophes of the most appalling

character, a simple, and, as far as I am able to anticipate, effective remedy is capable
of being applied. The plan I have to submit for this most desirable and important

end comprises two leading pohits ; the systematic employment of the electric tele-
graph, with a separate wire from station to station for management purposes only,
 and the securing and maintaining thereby a clear line from any one station to beyond

--the next before a second train should proceed, a plan which, if fairly carried out,

 appears to be calculated, unless by the most wilful carelessness or desperate reckless-
 ness, to render collisions, if not impossible, certainly most rare.

    It may be sufficient for explanation here to take a particular case of a railway, having

-- --considerable traffic, suppose that of the down-line, and in reference to a series of

stations, which we may designate C, D, E, &c.

                                        I. ^s to the Arrmigements.

     1. That there be an electric telegraph at each station, or intermediately, so aФ

 generally not to exceed a distance of three or four miles.
     2. That there bs a separate set of wires, to be used for station or traffic purposes

 only, worked by a supplementary battery, with a simple single-lever telegraph.

   D3. That the wires be disconnected at each station, so that station should com-
 mimicate with C above and E below only, with a warning bell, sepai-ately, at the

 termini, indicating at once whether the message is from above or below.
     4. That a time-piece and register-book or journal be kept at each electric station,

 the book propei-ly ruled for notifying the passing of each train clear of the stations
 above and below, respectively, in the column prepared for the several entries, i, e. the

 particular train, whether express, slow, goods, &c.
126 REPORT--1853.

   5. That the semaphore for the guidance of the engine-drivers of trains on each

-- "Aline of rails be worked from within the electric-office by the attendant there, showing
   1. clear line to and beyond the next station." 2. " An encumbered line," for
caution. 3. " Danger," for stopping the passing train as soon as possible. And to
prevent interference, any ordinary signals for other management purposes might be
made at a distance from the station above and below.

                                            II. General Management.

   To be peremptory on all officers and men, but with a discretionary power with the

station-master only.

   Suppose the case of management at station D, in respect to signals to and from C
and E.

   1. That in respect to management at station D, the departure of each train from D,
as soon as it has gone quite clear of the station and is fairly on its way, be notified to C

and to E, and reciprocally from C and E to D, the quality of the train being indicated^

and the time being registered in the journal at each of the stations.
   2. That no second train be allowed to start from C until notice has been received

Dthat station is clear, so that at C it may be known that the whole line betwixt the

stations and beyond the next station is clear, and collision, whilst no new obstacle is

allowed, rendered impracticable.

   3. That in the case of express trains passing C without stopping, warning of an
encumbered line be given by the semaphore whenever a train is intermediate betwixt
C and D, that the engine-driver may bring his train to hand-speed.

   4. That no new obstacle be allowed at station D, or on the line near it (except in

a side line), without previo\is notice to C, waiting a reply indicating " all right." This
wiU apply to shifting of carriages by shunting branch lines, crossing lines or junctions.

    5. That, for security at junctions, crossing lines, &c., there be always an electric
station at, or within commanding view and range of such junction ; and that all trains
and carriages arriving therein should come up at slow speed, and never enter on the
main line till the signal of "clear line and station " be seen.

    6. That the telegraphing station at junctions communicate with the next station

Dthereon, as with d, as well as with those above and below.

    7. That no train pass any important junction but at slow speed.
   8. And that response be made to each signal, to intimate that the announcement
is observed and understood.
    Several of these rules, it is well known, are already prevalently in use, but not as a
general system. But luider the arrangements on the system suggested, regulating
the progress of trains so as to leave a clear line up to the i.^xt station and beyond it/
and allowing no new obstacle without a previous signal to the backward station, and
the response of " all right," it seems hardly possible, within the ordinary range of cir-

cumstances, for any collision to occur. And it will be obvious, that had such regula-

tions been in force, some of the most calamitous results from this fearful source of
accidents which have hitherto occurred could not have happened.

                   III. As to Discretionary Powers with the Station-master.

    It being admitted that a stringent regulation after the manner of the plan suggested
might retard the business operations on lines of great traffic, a discretionary power
with the station-master, to be exercised on his personal responsibility, would be de-
sirable, and might be necessary.

   By means of the time-book or journal, however, he could always ascertain with
 tolerable accuracy the time he had certainly at command, and by enforcing the rule
of a hand speed in the following trains, he might provide (except in tunnels where
more special rigidness of rule might be called for) against the risk of running into a

foregoing train.

   The carrying out a plan of this kind would obviously involve expense ; but it may
be questioned whether the results in damage to cai-riages and costly engines, and

awards of damages by juries, in regard to collisions, with the restraining of travelling
 by apprehension of personal danger, have not on the whole been as great or greater
 in expense and loss. But in any case the public might fairly pay for the additional
security, for which a very trifling advance on the fares would be sufficient to com-

pensate.

    In regard to the importance of an additional or special electric telegraph and
attendance, which constitute the basis of all the suggested arrangements, it may be
observed that such addition is urgently called for on many lines of great communica-
tion, by reason of the almost perpetual employment, at certain times, of the common
telegraph for its variety of purposes. This must necessarily embarrass the best of the

existing arrangements, and cause recourse to the telegraph, either as to intelligibleness

or promptness, often to fail in its intention.

    In regard to the effect of the plan proposed on the speed of fast trains, it would
probably do little more than regulate the distribution of the other trains more system-
atically. Yet the public safety is of such paramount importance as would be well
worth some little sacrifice of time were it found necessary.

   As to the probable effectiveness of a system of the nature of that now suggested,
we may refer to a recent case of collision, which from the alarming risks involved in
it, may emphatically serve us in the way of illustration. In the case of the recent
collision at Hornsey, by the obstruction of the line by an accident in shunting, the
proposed plan must have been an effective preventive ; for before the shunting, notice
must have been given to the station at King's-cross, so that if the express train had
started, the shunting would have been delayed; or if the shunting had been sanctioned,
the express must have been delayed (or gone on hand speed only) till a " clear line "
had been announced. Such an accident, therefore, in this case would have been im-

In regard to the provisions of this plan for the guidance and protection of trains

by the semaphore and other signals, I may, in conclusion, merely refer to one for

night-signals, being the employment (if it might be deemed of sufBcient importance)

.of a wire, with explosive or illuminating combustibles attached to different parts of it,

which could be ignited by the galvanic battery after the manner employed in blasting.

The fearful calamity on the Great Southern and Western Irish Railway, which

occurred on the 5th of October (within a month of the reading of the above commu-

-- Anication), may still further illustrate the character and probable effectiveness of the
plan here suggested for safety.  passenger train was accidentally brought to a

Astand betwixt Sallins and Straffan stations.  cattle- train, unwarned, runs into it

with a most appalling result. But, on the plan suggested, no such accident could

have occurred. The cattle-train would not have been allowed to leave Sallins station

till the line beyond Straffan was announced to be clear ; or, if it were passing Sallins,

without stopping, warned by the danger-signal there, it must have immediately brought

up its speed and awaited the signal "clear line." Thus a catastrophe, involving the

loss of fourteen or fifteen lives, with other serious personal injuries to the unfortunate

travellers (besides the heavj' loss and damage fensuing on the Railway Company),

must, on the system suggested in this paper, have been prevented.

On the Consumption of Smoke in Furnaces and Manufacturing Premises,
                   By the Rev. Francis F. Statham, M.A.

   Mr. Statham commenced by adverting to the fact, that all smoke consists of im-
perfectly consumed carbonaceous matter, and then proceeded to comment upon the
various plans which have been suggested for its more complete consumption, which
may be said to resolve themselves into one or other of the following systems :

   1 The more careful feeding of the furnace or fire, so as to ensure a gradual and
therefore more perfect consumption of the fuel employed.

  A2. skilful admixture of atmospheric air with the incandescent mass, so as to

effect a higher degree of heat, by which the smoke may be completely burned.
   3. The application of steam or water in fine jets, which seems to operate in a two-

fold way, partly by chemical and partly by mechanical action.
   And, lastly, by a process which it was the more immediate object of the paper to

explain, viz. by a subdivision of the current of smoke into small columns, each of
which may be dealt with more effectually than when united in one dense fuliginous

mass.

    For the suggestion of the first method, viz. the more careful feeding of the furnaces,
we are probably indebted to the illustrious Watt, who obtained a patent in 1785 "for
a method of constructing furnaces in such a way as to cause the flame of the fresh
fuel, in its way to the flues of the chimney, to pass, together with a current of fresh
air, through, over, or among fuel which has already ceased to smoke, or which is cob*

verted into coke, charcoal, or cinders intensely hot." This plan, which is a very

--obvious one one, indeed, so obvious as to be the guiding principle in each one's pro-
--per management of a parlour or study fire has been much improved in more recent

patents ; as, for example, in that of Heel, described in the Report of the Parliamen-
tary Committee which sat on this subject in 1819-20, and again still further in the

patent of Brunton and some more recent engineers. The principle common to most
patents of this kind is the arrangement of a hopper or a feeding machine discharging
its supply of fresh fuel upon a shelf or ledge in the front part of the furnace, in such
a way as that the fuel so supplied shall gradually be converted into coke, the smoke
and vapour arising from which, being made to pass over the inclined surface of the
rest of the blazing mass, are gradually consumed before they reach the chimney.
When sufficiently baked or coked, the supply of fuel on the ledge or shelf is, by a

simple mechanical contrivance, pushed forward or shot out on to the surface of the
already incandescent body of fuel, and a fresh supply is admitted by the hopper or

feeding cylinder, to be acted on as before. Many advantages result from this plan :

a great saving of fuel is effected, because no portion of the carbon is left unconsumed
the great bulk of the surface of the fire is always in a highly heated state, for the gas
given off" from the coking fuel tends to keep up a constant blaze ; and, finally, the
chimney no longer ejects its dense volumes of blackening vapour, but serves to carry
off all the sulphurous and heated air, and helps to maintain the draught necessary
for the proper working of the furnace or fire. But it is asserted, on the other hand,
that this plan labours under the disadvantage of not keeping the whole surface of the
lire unimpeded (a matter of great moment where a boiler is to be placed immediately
above), and that the introduction of the draught above, necessary to direct the stream
of smoke from the baking coal, interferes with the draught from beneath, and so
diminishes the intensity of the heat.

   The second plan is employed with considerable effect in the pottery districts of
Staffordshire. In this arrangement, the grating of the fire-places is made to incline,
rising from the back towards the front of the furnace, at an angle of about 45░. By
this means, the mass of the burning fuel is kept away from the mouth of the furnace,
where there is only a comparatively thin stratum of incandescent material, through
which the air from beneath can find easy play. Immediately above this thin layer of
heated fuel, a horizontal slit is opened, by means of which a rush of fresh air is con-
tinually supplied from the exterior, and this, mingling with the now heated air from
below, traverses the body of the fuel with considerable velocity, and raises the tempe-
rature of the whole mass to such a degree, that every particle of smoke arising from
the surface is entirely consumed. The fuel is supplied at intervals, and with discri-
mination, from above, and is scattered equally over the whole surface of the fire by
means of rakers and other contrivances. The only objection to this, which is called
"Whalley's Patent," is the evident and enormous consumption of fuel; but as coal,
being mined in the neighbourhood, is extremely cheap, this does not constitute so
serious an objection, in those localities, as might at first sight appear ; and there is every

reason to believe thatif thissystemwereuniversallyadopted in the Staffordshire potteries,
the neighbourhood, which is now completely begrimed by the volumes, not to say torrents,
of smoke which are continually poured forth from the conical chimneys meeting the
eye in all directions, would be as cleanly and as fresh as any other locality, in spite of the
enormous amount of manufacture which would still be as effectively carried on.

    But by far the most popular of the expedients which have hitherto been
devised for consuming smoke is the agency of steam. It is extensively employed in
 Glasgow and in the north generally, and is certainly deserving of the highest praise
for ingenuity and scientific aptitude. Ivison's Patent, which is the most effective ex-
ponent of this system, consists in the arrangement of a system of machinery by which
jets of steam are thrown through apertures of about jV*''' "^ ""^ '"'^l^ ''i diameter,
pierced in a kind of fan-shaped distributer, into the mouth of the furnace. The
quantity of steam thus admitted is very trifling, and being divided into comminuted
streams, it becomes rapidly mixed up with the rising smoke, and causes its speedy
disappearance. The theory of the process is more a matter for consideration with
philosophers than with practical men ; but the actual results are found to be of the most
 encouraging kind. The draught of the furnace is enormously increased ; so much so,
 as to render the tall ungainly chimneys which we so commonly see entirely unneces-
 sary ; and the smoke is go perfectly consumed, that not a particle is visible arising

from the chimney-top, except just at the period when a new supply of fuel is being
thrown on, and this creates but a partial smoke for a few moments.

   The fourth and last plan to which attention was called is one which occurred to the
author about eighteen years ago, when reading through a course of chemistry. As he
did not confine himself to the mere conception of the idea, but carried it out into
execution, and found it, so far as the experiments tried were concerned, perfectly
successful, he ventured to introduce it as a plan which might he adopted with success,
and easily modified to suit any existing state of circumstances. The principle upon
which this plan proceeded was to convert the chimney itself into a smoke-consuming

                                                  apparatus. For this purpose, it was supplied with a
                                                    series of crucible-ware pipes, packed close together,

                                                    so as to present the appearance from above of a
                                                 honeycomb, or of a magnified section of some plant
                                               of the cane tribe. The chimney thus arranged was
                                             made to bend and return through the furnace in such
                                                a manner as that the earthenware tubes might be
                                                   exposed to the heat of the fire and kept in a state of

                                        red heat. When once this condition was effected,

                                                 the smoke which arose from the surface of the fuel
                                             was completely consumed ; so much so, that though
                                                  a quantity of small coal was thrown on, the dense
                                                 vapour was entirely consumed in its passage
through the cellular chimney, and nothing but sulphurous and heated air escaped
from the vent. The experiment was tried on many difl^erent occasions, and always
with the same successful results. The furnace employed was one of Stourbridge
bricks, having an inner diameter of about 12 inches; but in this experiment the
comparative smallness of the apparatus would tell, not in favour of but against the
success of the ti-ial, inasmuch as a higher temperature could have been procured with
apparatus on a larger scale. From the issue of the trial on a small scale, the author
believes that it would be equally successful on a larger one, and he will gladly hear of
the adoption of this principle in any manufacturing premises of an extensive character,
calculated to test the invention to the full, and to prove the desirableness of its uni-

versal adoption.

On Railway Collisions, with Suggestionsfor their Prevention.

          By the Rev. Francts V. Statham, M.A.

The author expressed his belief that the greatest security of the public in railway

travelling would be found in precautionary measures, in the selection of careful and

steady men as pointsmen, signal-keepers, guards and engine-drivers, and in the con-

stant supervision of all the working machinery ; but he still thought that some addi.

tional contrivances might be devised, connected with the moving train itself, which

might render considerable service in avoiding collisions. The present modes of

avoiding railway collisions are almost totally ineffectual. The use of the railway-

break, and the expedient of shutting off the steam and reversing the locomotive, would

not bring a train moving at the velocity of 30 miles per hour to a state of rest under 300

yards. The problem to be solved was one, then, of retardation, and the contrivance

--desired one which should reduce this stopping distance of 300 yards to the minimum,
   say to 200, 100, or even 50 yards. He showed that an immediate stoppage would be

almost as fatal as a collision, and suggested that men of inventive genius should be

stimulated to seek retarding agents by the oflTer, on the part of government, of some

adequate premium. He commented on the importance of having some public ejcpc

riment-ground, duly fitted up with rails, locomotives, and carriages, for the trial of

promising schemes, and observed, that if, after two years' trial, no sufficient remedy

could be devised, the public would still have the satisfaction of knowing that their

lives were not imperilled without all the resources of modern science having been

ransacked in vain. The author expressed his firm conviction that some adequate

contrivance would hereafter be invented, and urged the importance of striving to

hasten the time when it might be made known and brought into active use.

Mr. Statham suggested for consideration the resistance to be gained by opposing a

larger surface than that of the ordinary train to the action of the air. The state of

Whythe wind was found already to influence the velocity of railway trains.  should

not its resistance be made available in a case of apprehended danger? For example,

let shutters or solid doors, of the height of the train itself, be fixed along at intervals,

and at a distance of about three or four feet on each side of each railway carriage.

Let a rod or a series of rods run along the floor-line of the whole train, by the motion

of which the engine-driver might instantaneously cause the whole of these doors or

flaps to fly open and remain at a fixed angle immediatelj' that he sees any danger of
a collision. Could it be doubted that such a contrivance would materially impede

the speed of the moving train, and assist in its retardation ? He suggested, as an
additional retarding agent, a large fan of sti-ong wood-work, which might be made

to lie folded at the back of each railway carriage, but which, by the contact of an-

other rod, might be made to fly open simultaneously with the shutters or flaps before

described.

   Another idea which had suggested itself to the author's mind, was the employment

of elecfro-magnetism as a retarding agent, making the iron rails themselves the basis

of operations. He then proceeded to detail minutely a plan for fitting up in the last
carriage of each train an electro-magnetic battery of soft-iron magnets, which mag-

nets could be charged or uncharged by the single contact of a piece of connecting

wire with a galvanic battery, to be placed in the charge of the engine-driver or his

assistant. A downward pressure of several tons might thus be easily gained, which

might be brought to bear on the surface of the iron rails, and which would have this

additional advantage, that it might be applied either instantaneously, or, by a simple
arrangement, magnet by magnet, as desired. And, finallj-, the author concluded by

suggesting an improved method of turning off" the steam, so as to drive it through a

series of minute jets facing the front of the train, by which he anticipated a small ad-

ditional amount of resistance, on the principle of the aeolipile of the ancients, or

Barker's hydraulic mill of modern times.

On an Experimental Apparatus constructed to determine the Efficiency of
  the Jet Pump ; and a Series of Besidts obtained. By James Thomson,
  AM., C.E., Belfast.

Mr. Thomson had last year given, at the Mechanical Section, an account of a very

simple machine which he had contrived for the purpose of raising water from beneath

the lowest available level of discharge, by means of a supply of other water coming

from a higher level. This machine he designated a Jet Pump, because it raised water

Aby the action of a jet.  drawing and an explanation of it, in its original form, are

to be found in the Report of the Transactions of the Mechanical Section for last year.

The machine is remarkably simple and free from liability to derangement, having no

valves, pistons, or other moving mechanisms. It consists indeed only of pipes with an

internal jet, and is capable of working properly when left entirely to itself without the

care of an attendant. It had at first been intended chiefly for one especial purpose,

namely, to empty the pits of his own patent vortex water-wheels, or other submerged

turbines, when access to them is required for inspection or repairs. During the

progress of the trials, however, which were made of it for this pui'pose, it soon gave

indications of being suitable for much more extensive uses, and of being likely to prove,

in certain cases, an advantageous machine for draining swampy lands or shallow lakes.

The cases of this kind for which its employment was contemplated are those in which

the low ground to be drained happens to have, adjacent to its margin, streams or

rivers descending from higher ground. With a view to determine its efiiciency and

its applicability in any particular cases of this kind, Mr. Thomson had recently con-

structed an experimental apparatus in which a Jet pump could be made to act subject

to great variations in the ratio of the height of lift to the height of fall ; and which was

suited for indicating accurately the quantity of water lifted, and the height of the lift,

corresponding to each quantity of water allowed to fall through any given distance

within the working range of the appai-atus. The results obtained give higher

efiiciencies than had been anticipated previously to the experiments, and remove all

doubt as to the quantity of water which can be raised in any ordinary cases of its

employment for the drainage of swampy land. They give, in fact, when taken in

conjunction with known laws of the flow of fluids through orifices, the means of

calculating, with full confidence, the requisite dimensions and proportions of a machine

for the performance of a stated amount of work in the raising of water.
         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                            131

With respect to the nature of the experiments, a statement of a few principal

points will here suffice, as the form and construction of the apparatus cannot be

minutely explained in the absence of the drawings, which were exhibited in the Section

by the author.
   One of the chief difficulties anticipated by Mr. Thomson, in his attempts to find

good modes of experimenting, had reference to the determination of the quantity

of water lifted by the pump from the low level to the discharge level, and of that let

Adown from the high level to the discharge level.  very simple and effective mode of
--obviating the difficulty was devised, as follows: An apparatus was arranged, not for

ineasuring the absolute quantities of water lifted and let down in various experiments,

b'ut only the ratios of these quantities to one another ; and it is to be observed^ that,

for the purpose in view, precision in the ratios of the quantities, rather than in their

absolute amounts, was to be desired.

  A vessel or cistern was provided and set up at a level above the jet pump ; and all

the water to supply the pump, as well as all the water to be lifted by it, was made to

pass through the cistern, and to issue by a slit in its bottom, about one foot long, and

of a width which could be varied at pleasure, but was usually about one quarter of an

inch. The water thus issued in the form of a thin sheet one foot wide and about one

quarter of an inch thick descending vertically. Out of this sheet of water any portion

desired could be taken and conveyed away by means of a small moveable wedge-shaped
vessel made to slide in below the slit of the cistern. The water thus abstracted was

conveyed down to the low level to be lifted by the jet pump, and the remainder was
used for supplying the power in the jet pump. By observation of the width of the

portion of water abstracted from the sheet, and comparison of that with the width of

the whole sheet, the ratio of the two quantities was determined.

The absolute quantities of water could be varied at pleasure, without any alteration

of their ratio, by increasing or diminishing the depth of water in the supply cistern

from which the sheet of water issued. Thus the absolute quantity was adjusted so as
to make either the high water supplying the power, or the low water lifted by the pump,
stand at any desired level while the pump was in continuous action. The one of those

two levels being thus fixed, the other, after some fluctuations, soon adjusted itself to

its permanent height, and the two permanent levels were then observed, and so one
experiment was completed. The series of experiments was made by successively

cutting out various portions of the sheet of water to be conveyed to the low level ; and
then observing the height of lift, and the height of fall, which corresponded to each

ratio of the quantity sent to be lifted, to the quantity sent to supply the power.

   The following table gives a summary of the chief practical results obtained. It is
derived frorn two sets of experiments made on a jet pump with a jet of seveTi-eighths of
an inch diameter. The height of fall varied from twenty-one inches to twenty-eight and

three-fourths inches, and the height of lift from six inches to thirty-six and a half

inches.

neously.

On a New Wheelbarrow. By Capt. F. Wilson.

   This harrow differs from those in ordinary use in the wheel being placed under-
neath and sunk into the floor of the barrow ; the weight is thrown on the wheel,
instead of being entirely between the hand and the wheel, an arrangement which

allows of doubling the load.

   The projection of the wheel inside the barrow is covered with an iron curved cap
with wooden sides, which to a certain extent may interfere with the free movement

of the spade; but it is so seldom used for such purposes, and the inconvenience so

slight, as not to require consideration.

   The floor of the barrow is broader at the handle than at the wheel. The handles

are a separate joint from the framework of the barrow, and are raised so as to decrease
the first lift as much as possible.

A brass pin is placed in the middle at the top of the pent-board, directly in a line

with the wheel, so that it will serve as a guide to the labourer, where he requires

accuracy in his work. A wooden frame can be attached to the top of the barrow,

close to the wheel, to prevent it clogging the cap.
