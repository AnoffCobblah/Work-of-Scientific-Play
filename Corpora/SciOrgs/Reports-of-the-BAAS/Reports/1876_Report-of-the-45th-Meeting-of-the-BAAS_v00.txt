sertion in the published Transactions of the Association, and that he should send it, toge-

ther with the original Memoir, by book-post, on or before  , addressed

                                                         22 Albemarle Street, London, March 5, 1875.

  Mt --*' Loed, By the desire of the General Committee and of the Council

of the British Association, I beg to lay before your Lordship the accom-
panying resolutions regarding the continuance of Solar Observations in

India.

    " Besearches of the character here contemplated ai;e of comparatively
recent date, and have been hitherto pursued with conspicuous ability by

independent observers. They may be divided into three distinct groups :

namely. Sun-spot Periodicity ; the relation of that Periodicity to Terrestrial

and Planetary phenomena ; and the Physical and Chemical changes of the

 sun's visible surface. It is the opinion of the Council of the British Associa-

tion that observations of the sun conducted under these three heads would
furnish results of the highest scientific importance, and that India, presenting
 as it does every diversity of climate and of atmospheric condition, and every
 degree of elevation from the sea-level to the greatest mountain heights, is a
 field eminently suited to the successful prosecution of such observations.

    " The specific proposal -which, on behalf of the Bi'itish Association, I
have the honour to submit for your Lordship's consideration is, that the
instruments recently supplied for the Observation of the Transit of Venus

should, now that they have served that purpose, be made to contribute to

 the equipment of a Physical Observatorj'' to be established in the Himalayas,
 the Nielgherries, or some other fit locality. These instruments are suitable
 for solar observations, and with the addition of a spectroscope and a few
 other minor adjuncts would suffice for the present. They would be ready to

 be brought into practical action the moment the necessary buildings, which

 might be of the simplest and most inexpensive character, are erected.
     " But to extract from solar observations their full value it is necessary
                          EEPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                       xlix

that they should be continuous. No day ought to pass without observations

of the solar surface. This can only bo accomplished by establishing, in
connexion witli the principal observatory, stations in positions selected with
tho view of rendering it in the highest degree probable that at one or other
of them favourable weather would always be found. When, therefore, the
results obtained in the proposed observatory shall have justified the extension
(and of such justification the Council entertain a confident hope), outlying

stations may be added, provided with the moderate equipment needed to

multiply the chances of that continuity of observation which it is so desirable

to secure.

    " It is specially agreeable to me, personally, to have the privilege of
bringing this important question under the notice of a nobleman whoso
scientific acquirements render unnecessary any lengthened argument to prove
that the proposed observatory is likely to redound to the honour of England,
and to materially assist in the advancement of Natural Knowledge.

                                                         " I have the honour to be,

--Second Resolution. "That the Council of the Association be reqtiested

   to take such steps as they may think desirable with a view to promote

   the appointment of Naturalists to vessels engaged on the coasts of
    little-known parts of the world."

   The Council drew up the following Letter, which was sig-ned by the
President, and forwarded to the Admiralty :

                                                      "British Association for the Advancement of Science,
                                                        22 Albemarle Street, London, March 9, 1875.

  --" Sir, The Council of the British Association have had recently referred

to them by the General Committee of the Association a question which in

--various forms has been already under their consideration the importance,

namely, of attaching Naturalists (that is to say, persons specially trained in

Natural-historj^ observation) to Surveying-ships generally, and more especially

to those engaged in the survey of unfrequented or little-known regions.

   " The Council have requested me to communicate to Her Majesty's Govern-

ment their conviction of the importance of making, wherever practicable, this
addition to Surveying Expeditions. They believe that such action on the
part of the Government would not only be of advantage to Science, but that
it would be conducive to the commercial interests of the country to an extent

far outbalancing the trifling outlay which such appointments would render

necessary.

  We" are here in reality only asking for a further application of the en-

lightened policy which enabled the Government to utilize the talents of such

men as Banks and Solander in the last century, and which has more recently
given scope to the abilities of such men as Darwin, Hooker, and Huxley.
Even in a commercial point of view the advantages which have flowed from

this policy have been quite out of proportion to its cost to the country.

   "The obvious desii-ability of associating trained observers with the Surveys

of the future is thus strengthened by the experience of the past. The Council
of the British Association beg therefore to urge upon the favourable con-
sideration of Her Majesty's Government the question submitted to tlicm by

the General Committee.

   as they may think desirable with the view of promoting any applica-
  tion that may be made to Her Majesty's Government by the Eoyal

   The Council deferred the consideration of this Resolution until action be
taken by the Royal Society.

   --Fourth Besolution. " That the Council should take such steps as they

         may think desirable for supporting the request to Her Majesty's

           Government to undertake an Arctic Expedition on the basis proposed

            body."

   The Council are glad to report that the efforts of the Learned Societies to
obtain a renewal of the Exploration of the Polar Seas have been crowned
with success ; the Expedition which has been despatched on this service has
been furnished with the best-known appliances for the furtherance of the

objects in view.

    --Gextlemen,

To those on whom the British Associatiou confers the honour of presiding

over its meetings, the choice of a subject presents some difficulty.
   The Presidents of Sections, at each annual meeting, give an account of

what is new in their respective departments; and essay's on science in

general, though desirable and interesting in the earlier years of the Associa-
tion, would be less ajipropriatc to-daj\

   Past Presidents have already discoursed on many subjects, on things
organic and inorganic, on the mind and on things perhaps beyond the reach

of mind ; and I have arrived at the conclusion that liumblcr themes will not
be out of place on this occasion.

    I propose in this Address to say something of a profession to which mj'

--lifetime has been devoted a theme which cannot perhaps be expected to

stand as high in your estimation as in my own, and I may have some

difficulty in making it interesting ; but I have chosen it because it is a subject
I ought to understand better than any other. I propose to say something on
its origin, its work, and kindred topics.

    Eapid as has been the growth of knowledge and skill as aijplied to the art

of the engineer during the last century, wc must, if we -would trace its origin,
seek far back among the earliest evidences of civilization.

   In early times, when settled communities were few and isolated, the

opportimities for the interchange of knowledge were scanty or wanting
altogether. Often the slowly accumulated results of the experience of the
wisest heads and the most skilful hands of a community were lost on its

downfall. Inventions of one period were lost and found again. Many a

patient investigator has puzzled his brain in trying to solve a problem which
had yielded to a more fortunate labourer in the same field some centuries

before.
                           ADDllESS.     Ixix

   The ancient Egyptians had a knowledge of Metallurgy, much of which ·s\as

lost during the years of decline which followed the golden age of their civi-
lization. The art of casting bronze over iron was known to the Assyrians,
though it has only lately been introduced into modern metallurgy; and
patents were granted in 1C09 for processes connected with the manufactui'C

of glass which had been practised centuries before*. An inventor in the

reign of Tiberius devised a method of producing flexible glass ; but the

manufactory of the artist was totally destroyed, we are told, in order to

prevent the manufacture of copper, silver, and gold from becoming depre-

ciated t-

    Again and again engineers as well as others have made mistakes from not
knowing what had been done by those who have gone before them. In the
long discussion which took place as to the practicability of making the
Suez Canal, an early objection was brought against it that there was a
ditFerenco of 32| feet between the level of the Eed Sea and that of the

Mediterranean, Laplace at once declared that such could not be the case,

for the mean level of the sea was the same on all parts of the globe.
Centuries before the time of Laplace the same objection had been raised
to a project for joining the waters of these two seas. According to the
old Greek and Eoman historians, it was a fear of flooding Egypt with the
waters of the Eed Sea that made Darius, and in later times again Ptolemy,
hesitate to open the canal between Suez and the Nile J. Yet this canal
was made, and was in use some centuries before the time of Darius.

    Strabo § tells us that the same objection, that the adjoining seas were of

ditFerent levels, was made by his engineers to Demetrius ||, who wished to

cut a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth some two thousand years ago.

^But Strabo dismisses at once this idea of a diff'erence of level, agreeing

 with Archimedes that the force of gravity spreads the sea equally over the

earth.

    When knowledge in its higher branches was confined to a few, those who

 possessed it were often called upon to perform many and various services for
 the communities to which they belonged ; and we find mathematicians and

 astronomers, painters and sculptors, and priests called upon to perform the

 duties which now pertain to the profession of the architect and the engineer.
 And as soon as civilization had advanced so far as to admit of the accumula-

 tion of wealth and power, then kings and rulers sought to add to their glory
 while living by the erection of magnificent dwelling-places, and to provide
 for their aggrandizement after death by the construction of costly tombs and

temples. Accordingly, we soon find men of ability and learning devoting a

great part of their time to building and architecture, and the post of
architect became one of honour and profit. In one of the most ancient
quarries of Egypt a royal high architect of the dynasty of the Psammetici
has left his pedigree sculptured on the rock, extending back for twenty-three

o-enerations, all of whom held the same post in succession in connexion with

considerable sacerdotal offices *.

    As there were in these remote times officers whose duty it was to design
 and construct, so also there were those whose duty it was to maintain and
repair the royal palaces and temples. In Assyria, 700 years before our era,
as we know from a tablet found in the palace of Sennacherib by Mr. Smith,
there was an officer whose title was the Master of "Works. The tablet I
 allude to is inscribed with a petition to the king from an officer in charge of
a palace, requesting that the Master of Works may be sent to attend to some
repairs which were much needed at the time f.

    Under the Eoman Empire there was almost as great a division of labour
 in connexion with building and design as now exists. The great works of
 that period were executed and maintained by an army of officers and work-
 men, to each of whom special duties were assigned.

     Passing by those early attempts at design and construction which supplied

 the mere wants of the individual and the household, it is to the East that we
 must turn if we would fiod the earliest works which display a knowledge of
 engineering. Whether the knowledge of engineering, if we may so call it,

 possessed by the people of Chaldaea and Babylonia was of native growth or
 was borrowed from Egypt is, perhaps, a question which cannot yet be
 answered. Both people were agricultural, dwelling on fertile plains inter-
 sected by great rivers, with a soil requiring water only to enable it to bring
 forth inexhaustible crops. Similar circumstances would create similar wants,
 and stimulate to action similar faculties to satisfy them. Apart from the
 question of priority of knowledge, we know that at a very early period, some
 four or five thousand years ago at least, there were men in Mesopotamia and
 Egypt who possessed considerable mechanical knowledge and no little skUl
 in hydraulic engineering. Of the men themselves we know little : happily,
 works often remain when the names of those who conceived and executed

  them have long been forgotten.

     It has been said that architecture had its origin not only in nature, but in
  religion ; and if we regard the earliest works which required mechanical

 knowledge and skiU, the same may be said of engineering. The largest

  stones were chosen for sacred buildings, that they might be more enduring

  as well as more imposing, thereby calling for improvement and invention of

  mechanical contrivances to assist in transporting and elevating them to the

position they were to occupy ; for the same reason the hardest and most
costly materials were chosen, calling for further improvement in the metal
forming the tools required to work them. The working of metals was
further perfected in making images of the gods, and in adorning their shrines

with the more precious and ornamental sorts.

   The earliest buildings of stone to which we can assign a date, with any
approach to accuracy, are the pyramids of Gizeh. To their builders they

were sacred buildings, even more sacred than their temples or tcmplo
palaces. They were built to preserve the royal remains, until, after a lapse
of 3000 years, which we have reason to believe was the period assigned, the
spirit which had once animated the body should reenter it*. Although
built 5000 years ago, the masonry of the Pyramids could not be surpassed in
these days ; all those who have seen and examined them, as I myself have

done, agree in this; moreover, the design is perfect for the purpose for

which they were intended, above all to endure. The building of pyramids
in Egypt continued for some ten centuries, and from 60 to 70 still remain
but none are so admirably constructed as those of Gizeh. Still many
contain enormous blocks of granite from 30 to 40 feet long, weighing more
than 300 tons, and display the greatest ingenuity in the way in which the
sepulchral chambers are constructed and concealed f.

    The genius for dealing with large masses in buUding did not pass away
 with the pyramid-builders in Egypt; but their descendants continued to
 gain in mechanical knowledge, judging from the enormous blocks which they

 handled with precision. When the command of human labour was unlimited,

 the mere transport of such blocks as the statue of Eameses the Great, for
 instance, which weighed over 800 tons, need not so greatly excite our

 wonder ; and we know how such blocks were moved from place to place, for
 it is shown on the wall-paintings of tombs of the period which still remain.

     But as the weight of the mass to be moved is increased, it becomes no longer
 a mere question of providing force in the shape of human bone and muscle.
 In moving in the last century the block which now forms the base for the
 statue of Peter the Great at St. Petersburg, and which weighs 1200 tons, the
 necessary force could be applied, but great difficulty was experienced in sup-
 porting it, and the iron balls on which it was proposed to roll the block along
 were crushed, and a harder metal had to be substituted:]:. To facilitate the
  transport of material, the Egyptians made solid causeways of granite from the
 Nile to the Pyramids ; and in the opinion of Herodotus, who saw them, the
  causeways were more wonderful works than the Pyramids themselves §.

    The Egyptians liarc left no record of how they afcon-,ph"f:hcd a far nicac

--difficult operation than the mere transport of Avcight that is, how they

erected obelisks weighing upwards of 400 tons. Some of these obelisks mnst
have been lifted vertically to place them in position, as they were byFontana

in Rome in later times, when the knowledge of mechanics, we know, was

far advanced*.

   The practice of iising large blocks of stone either as monoliths or as forming

parts of structures has existed from the earliest times in all parts of the

world.

    The Peruvians used blocks weighing from 15 to 20 tons, and fitted them with

the greatest nicety in their cleverly designed fortifications f.

   In India large blocks were used in bridges when the repugnance of Indian

builders to the use of the arch rendered them necessary, or in temples, where,
as in the Temple of the Sun at Orissa, stones weighing from 20 to 30 tons
form part of the pj'ramidal roof at a height of from 70 to 80 feet from the
ground J. Even as late as the last century, Indians, without the aid of
machinery, were using blocks of granite above 40 feet long for the door-posts
of the gateway of Seringham, and roofing blocks of the same stone for a span
of 21 feet§.

    At Persepolis, in the striking remains of the palaces of Xerscs and Darius,
more than one traveller has noted the great size of the stones, some of which
are stated to be 55 feet long and 6 to 10 feet broad.

   So in the Greek temples of Sicily, many of the blocks in the upper parts of

the temples are from 10 to 20 tons weight.
    The Romans, though they did not commonly use such large stones in their

own constructions, carried off the largest obelisks from Egypt and erected
them at Rome, where more are now to be found than remain in Egypt. In
the temples of Baalbek, erected under Roman rule, perhaps the largest

stones are to bo found which have been used for building since the time of
the Pharaohs. The terrace wall of one of the temples is composed of three
courses of stones, none of which are less than 30 feet long ; and one stone
still lies in the quarry squared and ready for transport, which is 70 feet long

and 14 feet square, and weighs upwards of 1135 tons, or nearly as much as

one of the tubes of the Britannia Bridge.

   I have not mentioned dolmens and menhirs, rude unhewn stones often
weighing from 30 to 40 tons, which are found from Ireland to India, and
from Scandinavia to the Atlas, in Africa. To transport and erect such rude

masses required little mechanical knowledge or skill, and the operation has

excited more wonder than it deserves. Moreover, Fergusson has gone far to
show that the date assigned to many of them hitherto has been far too remote,

most, and possibly all, of those in northern and western Europe having been

erected since the time of the Eoman occupation. And to this day the same

author shows that menhirs, single stones often weighing over 20 tons, arc

erected by hill-tribes of India in close proximity to stone buildings of

elaborate design and finished execution, erected by another race of men *.

For whatever purpose these vast stones were selected (whether to enhance

the value or to i^rolong the endurance of the buildings of which they formed

a part), the tax on tho ingenuity of those who moved and placed them must

have tended to advance the knowledge of mechanical appliances.

Tho ancient Assyrians and Egyptians had possibly more knowledge of

mechanical appliances than they are generally credited with. In the wall

paintings and sculptures which show their mode of transporting large blocks

of stone, the lever is tho only mechanical power represented, and which they

appear to have used in such operations ; nor ought we to expect to find any
other used, for, where the supply of human labour was unlimited, the most
expeditious mode of dragging a heavy weight along woiild be by human power;

to have applied pulleys and capstans, such as would now be employed in

similar undertakings, would have been mere waste of time. In some countries,

even now, M'herc manual labour is more plentiful than mechanical apjjliances,

large numbers of men are employed to transport heavy weights, and do the
work in less time than it could be done with all our modern mechanical ap-

pliances. In other operations, such as raising obelisks or the large stones

used in their temple palaces, where human labour could not be applied to

such advantage, it is quite possible that the Egyptians used mechanical aids.

On one of the carved slabs* which formed part of the wall-paneUing of the

palace of Sardanapalus, which was built about 930 years before our era, a

single pulley is clearly shown, by which a man is in the act of raising a bucket

--probably drawing water from a weHf.

It has sometimes been questioned whether the Egyptians had a knowledge

of steel. It seems unreasonable to deny them this knowledge. Iron was
known at the earliest times of which wo have anj^ record. It is often men-

tioned in the Bible and in Homer ; it is shown in the early paintings on the

walls of the tombs at Thebes, where butchers are represented as sharpening

their knives on pieces of metal colonred blue, which were most probably pieces

of steel J.  Iron has been found in quantity in the ruined palaces of Assyria
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and. in the inscriptions of that country fetters are spoken of as having been

made of iron, which is also so mentioned in connexion with other metals as

to lead to the supposition that it was regarded as a base and common metal.

Moreover, iu the Great Pyramid a piece of iron was found in a place where
it must have lain for 5000 years*. The tendency of iron to oxidize must
render its prcseiTation for any long period rare and exceptional. The quality

of iron which is now made by the native races of Africa and India is that
which is known as wrought iron ; in ancient times, Dr. Percy says the iron
which was made was always wrought iron. It is very nearly pure iron, and

a very small addition of carbon would convert it into steel. Dr. Percy says
the extraction of good malleable iron directly from the ore " requires a degree

of skill very far inferior to that which is implied in the manufacture of

bronze "f. And there is no great secret in making steel ; the natives of India
now make excellent steel in the most primitive way, which tliey have prac-

tised from time immemorial. When steel is to be made, the proportion of

charcoal used with a given quantity of ore is somewhat larger, and the blast
is applied more slowly than when wrought iron is the metal required J.
Thus a vigorous native working the bellows of skin would make wrought iron
where a lazy one would have made steel. The only apparatus required for
the manufacture of the finest steel from iron ore is some clay for making a
small furnace four feet high and from one to two broad, some charcoal for
fuel, and a skin with a bamboo tuyere for creating the blast.

   The supply of iron in India as early as the fourth and fifth centuries seems
to have been unlimited. The iron pUlar of Delhi is a remarkable work for
such an early period. It is a single piece of wrought iron 50 feet in length,

and it weighs not less than 17 tons§. How the Indians forged this large

mass of iron and other heavy pieces which their distrust of the arch led them

to use in the construction of roofs, we do not know. In the temples of Orissa

iron was used in large masses as beams or girders iu roof-work in the

thirteenth century ||.

   The influence of the discovery of iron on the progress of art and science

cannot be over-estimated. India well repaid any advantage which she may
have derived from the early civilized communities of the West if she were the

first to supply them with iron and steel.

   An interesting social problem is afforded by a comparison of the relative

conditions of India and this country at the present time. India, from thirty
to forty centuries ago, was skilled in the manufacture of iron and cotton goods,

manufactures which in less than a century have done so much for this country.

It is true that in India coal is not so abundant or so universally distributed

as in this country. Yet, if we look still further to the East, China had pro-

bably knowledge of the use of metals as soon as India, and, moreover, had a

boundless store of iron and coal. Baron Eichthofen, who has visited and de-

scribed some of the coal-fields of China, believes that one province alone, that
of Southern Shansi, could supply the world at its present rate of consumption
for several thousand years. The coal is near the surface, and iron abounds
with it. Marco Polo tells us that coal was universally used as fuel in the
parts of China which he visited towards the end of the fourteenth century,

and from other sources we have reason to believe it was used there as fuel
2000 years ago. But what progress has China made in the last ten centuries ?

A great future is undoubtedly in store for that country ; but cau the race who

now dwell there develop its resources, or must they await the aid of an Aryan
race ? Or is any thing more necessary than a change of institutions, which

might come unexpectedly, as in Japan ?
   The art of extracting metals from the ore was practised at a very early date

in this countrj-. The existence long ago of tin-mines in Cornwall, so often
spoken of by classical writers, is well known to all. That iron was also ex-
tracted from the ore by the ancient Britons is most probable, as it was largely

used for many purposes by them before the Boman conquest. The Romans
worked iron extensively in the Weald of Kent, as we assume from the large
heaps of slag containing Roman coins which still remain there. The Romans

always availed themselves of the mineral wealth of the coiintries which they
conquered, and their mining-operations were often carried out on the largest

scale, as in Spain, for instance, where as many as forty thousand miners were

regularly employed in the mines at New Carthage*.

   Coal, which was used for ordinary purposes in England as early as the ninth
century, does not appear to have been largely used for iron-smelting until the
eighteenth century, though a patent was granted for smelting iron with coal
in the year IGllf. The use of charcoal for that purpose was not given up
until the beginning of this century, since which period an enormous increase
in the mining and metallurgical industries has taken place ; the quantity of
coal raised in the United Kingdom in 1873 having amounted to 127 million
tons, and the quantity of pig iron to upwards of 6^ million tons.

   The early building energy of the world was chiefly spent on the erection of
tombs, temples, and palaces.

   While in Egypt, as we have seen, the art of building in stone had 5000

years ago reached the greatest perfection, so in Mesopotamia the art of build-
ing with brick, the only available material in that coimtry, was in an equally
advanced state some ten centuries later. That buildings of such a material have

lasted to this day shows how weU the work was done ; their ruinous condi-
tion even now is owing to their having served as quarries for the last three
or four thousand years, so that the name of Nebuchadnezzar, apparently one
of the greatest builders of ancient times, is as common on the bricks of many

modern towns in Persia as it was in old times in Babylon. The labour re-

quired to construct tlic brick temples aud palaces of Chaldtea and Assj'ria must
have been enormous. The mound of Koyunjik alone contained 14| million

tons, and represents the labour of 10,000 men for twelve years. The palace
of Sennacherib, which stood on this mound, was probably the largest ever
built by any one monarch, containing as it did more than two mUes of walls,

panelled with sculptured alabaster slabs, and twenty-seven portals, formed

by colossal bulls and sphinxes*.
   The pyramidal temples of ChaldEca are not less remarkable for the labour

bestowed on them, and far surpass the buildings of Assyria in the esccUenco

of their brickwork.

    The practice of building great pyramidal temples seems to have passed east-
wards to India and Birrmah, where it appears in buildings of a later date, in

--Buddhist topes and pagodas marvels of skiU in masonry, and far surpassing

the old brick mounds of Chahtea in richness of design and in workmanship.
Even so late as this century a king of Burmah began to build a brick temple
of the old type, the largest building, according to Fergusson, which has been

attem])ted since the Pyramids f.

   The mere magnitude of many of these works is not so wonderful when wo

take into account the abundance of labour which those rulers could com-
mand. Countries wcro depopulated and their inhabitants carried off and
made to labour for the conquerors. The inscriptions of Assyria describe

minutely the spoils of war and the number of captives ; and in Egypt wc
have frequent mention made of works being executed by the labour of captive
pcox)les. Herodotus tells us that as many as 360,000 men were employed in
biiilding one palace for SennacheribJ. At the same time, it must not be

forgotten that the very character of the multitude would dcmaiid fi-om some
one the skill and brain to organize and direct, to design and plan the work.

   It would be surprising if men who were capable of undertaking and suc-
cessfully completing unproductive works of such magnitude did not also em-

ploy their powers on works of a more useful class. Traces still remain of

such works ; enough to show, when compared with the scanty records of the
times which have come down to us, that the prosperity of such countries as
Egypt and Mesopotamia was not wholly dependent on war and conquest, but
that the reverse was more likely the case, and that the natural capabilities of

those countries were greatly enlarged by the construction of useful works of
such magnitude as to equal, if not in some cases surpass, those of modci n

times.

    Egypt was probably far better irrigated in the days of the Pharaohs than
it is now. To those unacquainted with the difficulties which must be met
 with and overcome before a successful system of irrigation can be carried

out, oven in countries in whicli tho phj'sical conditions arc favourable, it

may appear that nothing more is required than an adequate supply of un-

skilled labour. Far moro than this was required : tho Egyptians had some

knowledge of surveying, for Eustathius says they recorded their marches on

maps * ; but such knowledge was probably in those days very limited, and

it required no ordinary grasp of mind to see the utility of such extensive

works as were carried out in Egypt and Mesopotamia, and, having seen tho

utility, to successfully design and execute them. To cite one in Egypt

Lake Moeris, of which the remains have been explored by M. Linant, was

a reservoir made by one of tho Pharaohs, and supplied by tho flood-waters

of the Nile. It was 150 square miles in extent, and was retained by a bank

or dam 60 yards wide and 10 high, which can be traced for a distance of

thirteen miles. This reservoir was capable of irrigating 1200 square miles

of country t.' No work of this class has been undertaken on so vast a scale

since, even in these days of great works.

The prosperity of Egypt was in so great a measure dependent on its great

river, that we should expect that the Egyptians, a people so advanced in art

and science, would at an early period have made themselves acquainted with

Wcits regime.  know that they carefully registered tho height of the annual

rise of its waters ; such registers still remain inscribed on the rocks on the

banks of the Nile, with tho name of tho king in whose reign they were

made J. The people of Mesopotamia were equally observant of the regime of

their great rivers, and took advantage in designing their canals of the different

Aperiods in the rising of tho waters of the Tigris and Euphrates.          special

officer was appointed in Babylon, whose duty it was to measure the rise of the

river ; and he is mentioned in an inscription found in tho ruins of that city,
as recording the height of the water in the temple of Bel §. The Assyrians,

who had a far more difficult country to deal with, owing to its rocky and

uneven surface, showed even greater skiU than the Babylonians in forming

their canals, tunneUing through rock, and building dams of masonry across

the Euphrates. While the greater number of these canals in Egy^rt and

Mesopotamia were made for the purpose of irrigation, others seem to have

been made to serve at the same time for navigation. Such was the canal
which effected a junction between tho Mediterranean and the Red Sea, which

was a remarkable work, having regard to the requirements of the age in which
it was made. Its length was about 80 miles ; its width admitted of two

triremes passing one another ||. At least one of the navigable canals of

Babylonia, attributed to Nebuchadnezzar, can compare in extent with any

work of later times. I believe Sir H. Eawlinson has traced the canal to which

I allude throughout the greater part of its course, from Hit on the Euphrates

to the Persian Gulf, a distance of between four and five hundred miles*. It

is a proof of the estimation in which such works were held in Babylonia and
Assyria, that, among the titles of the god Vul were those of " Lord of Canals "
and " The Establisher of Irrigation Works "f.

    The springs of knowledge which had flowed so long in Babylonia and
Assyria were dried up at an early period. With the faU of Babylon and
destruction of Nineveh the settled population of the fertile plains around thera
disappeared ; and that which was desert before man led the waters over it
became desert again, affording a wide field for, and one well worthy of, the

labours of engineers to come.

    Such was not the case with Egypt. Long after the period of its greatest
prosperity was reached, it remained the fountain head from whence know-
ledge flowed to Greece and Eomc. The philosophers of Greece and those
who, like Archimedes, were possessed of the best mechanical knowledge of
the time, repaired to Egj^pt to study and there obtained much of their

knowledge.

   Greatly as Greece and Eome were indebted to Egypt, it will probably bo

found, as the inscribed tablets met with in the mounds of Assj-ria and Chaldaja
are deciphered, that the later civilizations owe, if not more, at least as much
to those countries as to Egj-pt. This is the opinion of Mr. Smith, who, in
his work describing his recent interesting discoveries in the East, says that
the classical nations " borrowed far more from the valley of the Euphrates
than that of the Nile "+.

    In the science of astronomy, which in these days is making such marvel-

lous discoveries, Chaldrea was undoubtedly preeminent. Among the many

relics of these ancient peoples which Mr. Smith has recently brought to this

country is a portion of a metal astrolabe from the palace of Sennacherib, and
a tablet on which is recorded the division of the heavens according- to the
four seasons, and the rule for regulating the intercalary month of the year.

Not only did the Chalda^ans map out the heavens and arrano-e the stars but

they traced the motion of the planets, and observed the appearance of comets-

they fixed the signs of the zodiac, and they studied the sun and moon and the

periods of eclipses §.

But to return to that branch of knowledge to which I wish more particu-

larly to draw your attention, as it grew and spread from East to West, from

Asia over Europe. Of aU nations of Europe, the Greeks were most inti-

Amately connected with the civilization of the East.                maritime people by

course on the tracks of their trading-vessels; and thus, more than any other
people, they helped to spread Eastern knowledge along the shores of the
Mediterranean and throughout the south of Europe.

    The early constructive works of Greece, till about the seventh century B.C.,
form a strong contrast to those of its moro prosperous days. Commonly
called Pelasgiau, they are more remarkable as engineering works than ad-
mirable as those which followed them were for architectural beauty. "WaUs
of huge unshapely stones (admirably fitted together, however), tunnels, and
bridges characterize this period. In Greece, during the few and glorious
centuries which followed, the one aim in all construction was to please the
eye, to gratify the sense of beauty ; and in no age was that aim more tho-
roughly and satisfactorily attained.

   In these days, when sanitary questions attract each year more attention,
we may call to mind that twenty-three centuries ago the city of Agrigcntum
possessed a system of sewers, which, on account of their large size, were

thought worthy of mention by Diodorus*. This is not, however, the first
record of towns being drained ; the well-known Cloaca Maxima, which
formed part of the drainage system of Eome, was built some two centuries
earlier, and great vaulted drains passed beneath the palace mounds of unburnt

brick at Nimroud and Babylon; and possibly wo owe the preservation of
many of the interesting remains found in the brick mounds of Chaldsea to
the very elaborate system of pipe drainage discovered in them and described

by Loftusf.

   Whilst Pelasgian art was being superseded in Greece, the city of Eomo

was founded in the eighth century before our era ; and Etrnscan art in Italy,
like the Pelasgian art in Greece, was slowly merged in that of an Aryan race.
The Etruscans, like the Pelasgians and the old Egyptians, were Turanians,
and remarkable for their purely constructive or engineering works. Their
city waUs far surpass those of any other ancient race, and their drainage
works and tunnels are most remarkable.

    The only age which can compare with the present one in the rapid oxten-i
sion of utilitarian works over the face of the civilized world is that durinff

which the Eomans, an Aryan race, as we are, were in power. As Fergusson

has said, the mission of the Aryan races appears to be to pervade the world
with useful and industrial arts. That the Eomans adorned their bridges,
their aqueducts, and their roads, that with a sound knowledge of construc-
tion they frequently made it subservient to decoration, was partly owing to
the mixture of Etruscan or Turanian blood in their veins, and partly to their
great wealth, which made them disregard cost in their construction, and to

their lovo of display.

remain to this day as monuments of the skill, the energy, and ability of the

great Eoman people. Fortunately their works are more accessible than
those of which I have hitherto spoken, and many of you are probably already

familiar with them.
    Conquerors of the greater part of the civilized world, the admirable orga-

nization of the Romans enabled them to make good use of the unbounded
resources which were at their disposal. Yet, while the capital was enriched,

the development of the resources of the most distant provinces of the empire
was never neglected.

    "War, with all its attendant evils, has often indirectly benefited mankind.
In the long sieges which took place during the old wars of Greece and Rome,

the inventive power of man was taxed to the utmost to provide machines for

attack and defence. The ablest mathematicians and philosophers were
pressed into the service, and helped to turn the scale in favour of their
employers. The world has to regret the loss of more than one, who, like
Archimedes, fell slain by the soldiery while applying the best scientific know-
ledge of the day to devising means of defence during the siege*. In these
days, too, science owes much to the labours of engineers and able men,
whose time is 8j>ent in making and improving guns, the materials composing
them, and armour plates to resist them, or in studying the motion of ships
of war in a seaway.

   The necessity for roads and bridges for military purposes has led to their
being made where the necessary stimiJus from other causes was wanting
and so means of communication, and the interchange of commodities, so
essential to the prosperity of any community, have thus been provided. Such

was the case under the Eoman Empire. So, too, in later times, the ambition

of Napoleon covered France and the countries subject to her with an admi-

rable system of military roads. At the same time, we must do Napoleon the

justice of saying that his genius and foresight gave a great impetus to the
construction of aU works favourable to commercial progress. So, again, in
this country it was the rebellion of 1745, and the want felt of roads for
military purposes, which first led to the construction of a system of roads in

it unequalled since the time of the Eoman occupation. And lastly, in India,

in Germany, and in Eussia, more than one example could be pointed out
where industry will benefit by railways which have originated in military
precautions rather than in commercial rcquixements.

    But to return to Eome. Eoads followed the tracks of her legions into the
most distant provinces of the empire. Three hundred and seventy-two great
roads are enumerated, together more than 48,000 miles in length, according

to the itinerary of Antoninus.

suflfico for a population of seven millions, supplied at the rate at which the

prejout population of London is supplied. This water was conveyed to Rome

hy nine aqueducts ; and iu later years tho supply was increased by the con-
sLriiction of five more aqueducts. Three of the old aqueducts have sufficed

to supply tho wants of the city in modern times. These aqueducts of Rome
are to be numbered among her grandest engineering works *. Time will not
admit of my saying any thing about her harbour works and bridges, her basi-

licas and baths, and numerous other works in Europe, in Asia, and in Africa.
Not only were these works executed in a substantial and perfect manner, but

they were maintained by an efficient staff of men divided into bodies, each
having their special duties to perform. The highest offi cers of state superin-

tended the construction of works, were proud to have their names associated
with them, and constructed extensive works at their own expense.

   Progress in Europe stopped with the fall of the Roman Empire. In the

fourth and succeeding centuries the barbarian hordes of Western Asia, people

who felt no want of roads and bridges, swept over Europe to plunder and

 destroy.

   With the seventh century began the rise of the Mohammedan power, and

a partial return to conditions apparently more favourable to the progress of
industrial art, when widespread lands were again united under the sway of

powerful rulerst. Science owes much to Arab scholars, who kept and handed
on to us the knowledge acquired so slowly in ancient times, and much of

which would have been lost but for them. Still, few useful works remain to

mark the supremacy of the Mohammedan power at all comparable to those

of the age which preceded its rise.

   A great building age began in Europe in the tenth century, and lasted

through the thirteenth. It was during this period that these great ecclesias-
tical buildings were erected, which are not more remarkable for artistic ex-
cellence than for boldness in design.

    While the building of cathedrals progressed on aU sides in Europe, works

of a utilitarian character, which concern the engineer, did not receive much

encouragement, excepting perhaps in Italy.

    From the twelfth to the thirteenth centuries, with the revival of the arts
and sciences in the Italian republics, many important works were undertaken

for the improvement of the rivers and harbours of Italy. In 1481 canal-locks

were first used ; and some of the earliest of which we have record were
erected by Leonardo da Vinci, who would be remembered as a skilful en-

gineer had he not left other greater and more attractive works to claim the
homage of posterity.

The great use that has since been made of this simple means of transferring

floating vessels from one water-level to another, in connexion not only with

inland navigation, but in all the great ports and harbours of the world, renders

it aU the more deserving of remark.

In India, under the Moguls, irrigation works, for which they had a natural

aptitude, were carried on during these centuries with vigour, and more than

one emperor is noted for the numerous great works of this nature which he
carried out. If the native records can be trusted, the number of hydraulic

works undertaken by some rulers is surprising. Tradition relates that one

king who reigned in Orissa in the twelfth century made one million tanks or

reservoirs, besides building sixty temples and erecting numerous other

works*.

In India, the frequent overflow of the great rivers, and the periodical

droughts, which rendered irrigation necessary, led to extensive protective

works being undertaken at an early period ; but as these works have been

maintained by successive rulers, Mogul and Mohammedan, until recent times,

and have not been left for our inspection, deserted and useless for 3,000 years

or more, as is often the case in Egypt and Mesopotamia, there is more diffi-

culty in ascertaining the date of such works in India.

Works of irrigation were among the earliest attempts at engineering under-

taken by the least civilized inhabitants in all parts of the world. Even in

Australia, where savages are found as low as any in the scale of civilization,

traces of irrigation works have been found ; these works, however, must be

taken to show that the natives were once somewhat more civilized than we

now find them. In Feejee, our new possession, the natives occasionally irrii

gate their land t, and have executed a work of a higher class, a canal some

two miles long and sixty feet wide, to shorten the distance passed over by

their canoes J. The natives of New Caledonia irrigate their fields with great

skill §. In Peru, the Incas excelled in irrigation as in other great and useful

works, and constructed most admirable underground conduits of masonry for

the purpose of increasing the fertility of the land ||.
   It is frequently easier to lead water where it is wanted than to check its

irruption into places where its presence is an evil, often a disaster. For

centuries the existence of a krge part of Holland has been dependent on the

Howskill of man.  soon he began in that country to contest with the sea

the possession of the land we do not know; but early in the twelfth century

dykes were constructed to keep back the ocean. As the prosperity of the

country increased with the great extension of its commerce, and land became

 more valuable and necessary for an increasing population, very extensive
 works were undertaken. Land was reclaimed from the sea, canals were cut,
 and machines were designed for lifting water. To the practical knowledge
 acquired by the Dutch, whose method of carrying out hydraulic works is

 original and of native growth, much of the knowledge of the present day in
 embanking, and draining, and canal-making is due. The North-Holland
 Canal* was the largest navigable canal in existence until the Suez Canal was
 completed ; and the Dutch have just now nearly finished making a sea-canal
 from Amsterdam to the North Sea, which, though not equal to the Suez Canal

 in length, will be as great in width and depth, and involves perhaps larger

and more important works of art. This country was for many years beholden

 to the Dutch for help in carrying out hydraulic works. In the seventcentli

century much fen land in the eastern counties was drained by Dutch labour^

directed by Dutch engineers, among whom Sir Cornelius Yermuyden, an old
campaigner of the Thirty Years' War and a colonel of horse under CromweU,

is the most noted,
    "While the Dutch were acquiring practical knowledge in dealing with

water, and we in Britain among others were benefiting by their experience,

the disastrous results which ensued from the inundations caused by the

Italian rivers of the Alps gave a new importance to the science of hydraulics.
Some of the greatest philosophers of the seventeenth century (among them

Torricelli, a pupil of Galileo f) were called upon to advise and to superintend
engineering works; nor did they confine themselves to the construction of
preventive works, but thoroughly investigated the conditions pertaining to fluida
at rest or in motion, and gave to the world a valuable series of works on
hydraulics and hydraulic engineering, which form the basis of our knowledge

of these subjects at the present day.

   Some of the best scientific works (prior to the nineteenth century) on
engineering subjects we owe to Italian and French writers. The writings
of Belidor, an officer of artillery in France in the seventeenth century, who
did not, however, confine himself to military subjects, drew attention to
engineering questions. Not long after their appearance, the Pouts et Chaus-
sees J were established, which has maintained ever since a body of able men
specially educated for and devoted to the prosecution of industrial works.

   The impulse given to road-making in the early part of the last century
soon extended to canals and means for facilitating locomotion and transport
generally. Tramways were used in connexion with mines at least as early

as the middle of the seventeenth century ; but the raUs were, in those days,

of wood. The first iron raUs are said to have been laid in this country as

early as 173S, after which time their use was gradually extended, until it

became general in mining-districts.

   By the beginning of this century the great ports of England were connected

by a system of canals ; and new harbour works became necessary and were

provided to accommodate the increase of commerce and trade, which improved

means of internal transport had rendered possible. It was in the construction

of these works that our Brindley and Smeaton, Telford and Rennie, and other

engineers of their time did so much.

But it was not until the steam-engine, improved and almost created by

the illustrious Watt, became such a potent instrument, that engineering works

to the extent they have since been carried out became possible or necessary.

It gave mankind no new faculty ; but it at once set his other faculties on an

eminence, from which the extent of his future operations became almost

unlimited.

Water-mills, wind-mills, and horse-machines were in most cases super-

seded. Deep mines, before only accessible by adits and water-levels, could at

once be reached with ease and economy. Lakes and fens which, but for the

steam-engine, would have been left untouched, Avere drained and culti-

vated.

The slow and laborious toil of hands and fingers, bone and sinew, was turned

to other employments, where, aided by ingenious mechanical contrivances,

the produce of one pair of hands was multiplied a thousandfold, and their

cunning extended until results maiTelloTis, if you consider them, were attained.

Since the time of Watt the steam-engine has exerted a power, made conquests,

and increased and multiplied the material interests of this globe to an extent

which it is scarcely possible to realize.

But while Watt has gained a world-wide, well-earned fame, the names of

those men who have provided the machines to utilize the energies of the steam-

engine are too often forgotten. Of their inventions the majority of mankind
know little. They worked silently at home, i)i the mill, or in the factory,

observed by few. Indeed, in most cases, these silent workers had no wish to

expose their work to public gaze. AVere it not so, the factory and the mill

aside some long-sought mechanical movement and seek another and a better

perseverance.

More ingenuity and creative mechanical genius is perhaps displayed in

machines used for the manufacture of textile fabrics than by those used in any

other industry. It was not until late in historical times that the manufacture

of such fabrics became established on a large scale in Europe. Although in

Cbina man was clothed in silk long ago, and although Confucius, in a -work

written 2,300 years ago, orders with the greatest minuteness the niles to be
observed in the jn-oduction and manufacture of silk, yet it was worth nearly
its weight in gold in Europe in the time of Aurehan, whose empress had to

forego the luxury of a silk gown on account of its cost*. Through Constan-
tinople and Italy the manufacture passed slowly westwards, and was not
established in France until the sixteenth century, and arrived at a stiU later

period in this country.

    So cotton, of which the manufacture in India dates from before historical
times, had scarcely by the Christian era reached Persia and Egypt. Spain

in the tenth and Italy in the fourteenth century inanufactured it, but Man-
chester, which is now the great metropolis of the trade, not until the latter

half of the seventeenth centurj\

   Linen was worn by the old Egyptians, and some of their linen mummy-

cloths surpass in fineness any linen fabrics made in later daysf. The
Babylonians wore linen also and wool, and obtained a widespread fame for
skill in workmanship and beauty in design.

    In this country wool long formed the staple for clothing. Silk was the first
rival, but its costliness placed it beyond the reach of the many. To introduce
a new material or improved machine into this or other countries a century or
more ago was no light undertaking. Inventors and would-be benefactors alike
ran the risk of loss of life. Loud was the outcry made in the early part of
the eighteenth century against the introduction of Indian cottons and Dutch

calicoes.

    Until 1738, in which year imj)rovements in spinning-machinery were begun,
 each thread of worsted or cotton wool had been spun between the fingers in
this and all other countries. Wyatt, in 1738, invented spinning- rollers
instead of fingers, and his invention was further improved hyArkwright. In
 1770 Hargreaves patented the spinning-jenny, and Crompton the mule in
 1775, a machine which combined the advantages of the frames of both Har-
 greaves and Arkwright. In less than a century after the first invention by
 Wyatt, double mules were working in Manchester with over 2,000 spindles.

    Improvements in machines for weaving were begun at an earlier date. In
 1579 a ribbon-locm is said to have been invented at Dantzic, by which from
four to six pieces could be woven at one time ; but the machine was destroyed
 and the inventor lost his lifet. In 1800 Jacquard's most ingenious invention
 was brought into use, which, by a simple mechanical operation, determines
 the movements of the threads which form the pattern in weaving. But the
 greatest discovery in the art of weaving was wrought by Cartwright's discovery

of the power-loom, which led eventually to the substitution of steam for manual
labour, and enabled a boy with a steam-loom to do fifteen times the work of

a* man with a hand-loom.

   Eor complex ingenuity few machines wiU compare with those used in the
manufacture of lace and bobbin net. Hammond, in 17G8, attempted to adapt
the stocking-frame to this manufacture, which had hitherto been conducted
by hand. It remained for John Heathcote to complete the adaptation in 1809,
and to revolutionize this branch of industry, reducing the cost of its produce
to one-fortieth of what the cost had been before Heathcote's improvements
were effected.
- Most of these ingenious machines were in use before Watt's genius gave the
world a new motive power in the steam-engine ; and, had the steam-engine
never been perfected, they would still have enormously increased the pro-
ductive power of mankind. Water-power was applied to many of them ; in
the first silk-thread mill erected at Derby in 1738, 318 million yards of silk
thread were spun daily with one water-wheel.

   These are happier times for inventors : keen competition among manufac-
turers does not let a good invention lie idle now. That which was rejected
by old machines as waste is now worked up into useful fabrics by new ones.

fail me if I were to attempt to enumerate one tithe of these rare combinations

of mechanical skill ; and, indeed, no one will ever appreciate the labour and

supreme mental efi'ort required for their construction who has not himself seen
them and their wondi'ous achievements.

    Steamboats, the electric telegraph, and railways are more within the cog-
nizance of the world at large ; and the progress that has been made in them in
little more than one generation is better known and appreciated.

    It is not more than forty years since one of our scientific men, and an able
one too, declared at a meeting of this Association that no steamboat would
ever cross the Atlantic, founding his statement on the impracticability, in his
view, of a steamboat carrying sufficient coal (profitably, I presume) for the
voyage. Yet soon after this statement was made, the ' Sirius ' steamed to

Few York in seventeen days*, and was soon followed from Bristol by the

' Great Western,' which made the homeward passage in thirteen days and a
half; and with these voyages the era of steamboats may be said to have
begun. Like most important inventions, that of the steamboat was a long
time in assuming a form capable of being profitably utilized ; and even when

it had assumed such a fonn, the objections of commercial and scientific men

had still to be overcome.

        * Fii'st steamer crossed the Atlantic by steam alone in 1838,
ADDRESS.  IxXXvii

   Among the many names connected with the early progress in the con-

struction of steamboats, perhaps none is more worthy of remembrance than
that of Patrick Miller, who, with the assistance of Symington, an engineer,

and Taylor, who was his children's tutor, constructed a small steamboat.
Shortly afterwards Lord Dundas, who saw the value of the application of

steam for the propulsion of boats, had the fii'st really practical steamboat
constructed with a view to using it on the Forth and Clyde Canal. The pro-
prietors, however, objected, and the boat lay idle. Again another attempt to
make practical use of the steamboat failed through the death of the Duke of
Bridgewater, who, with his characteristic foresight, had seen the value of
steam as a motive power for boats, and had determined to introduce steamboats

on the canal which bears his name.

   The increase in the number of steamboats since the time when the 'Sirius'
first crossed the Atlantic has been very great. Whereas in 1814 the United
Kingdom only possessed two steam-vessels, of together 456 tons burden, in
1872 there were on the register of the United Kingdom 3,662 steam-vessels,
of which the registered tonnage amounted to over a million and a half of tons*,

or to nearly half the whole steam tonnage of the world, which did not at that

time greatly exceed three million tons.

    As the number of steamboats has largely increased, so also gradually has
their size increased until it culminated, in the hands of Brunei, in the ' Great

Eastern.'

  A triumph of engineering skill in ship-building, the ' Great Eastern ' has

not been commercially so successful. In this, as in many other engineering
problems, the question is not how large a thing can be made, but how large,
having regard to other circumstances, it is proper at the time to make it.

   If, as regards the dimensions of steamboats, we have at present somewhat
overstepped the limits in the ' Great Eastern,' much still remains to be done
in perfecting the form of vessels, whether propelled by steam or driven by the

Aforce of the wind. distinguished member of this Association, Mr. Eroude, has

now for some years devoted himself to investigations carried on with the view

to ascertain the form of vessel which will offer the least resistance to the water

through which it must pass. So many of us in these days are caUed upon to
make journeys by sea as well as by land, that we can well appreciate the value
of Mr. Fronde's labours, so far as they tend to curtail the time which we must
spend on our ocean journeys ; and we should aU feel grateful to him if from

another branch of his investigations, which relates to the rolling of ships, it

Ashould result that the movement in passenger vessels could be reduced.

gallant attempt in this direction has lately been made by Mr. Bessemer
whether a successful one yet remains to be proved. In any event, he and
those who have acted with him deserve our praise for an experiment which

must add to our knowledge.

    It is a question of vital imj)ortance to the steamboat that the consumption
of fuel should be reduced to the smallest possible amount, inasmuch as each

ton of fuel excludes a ton of cargo.

   As improvements in the form of the huU arc effected, less power (that is,

less fuel) -will be required to propel the tcsscI through the water for a given
distance. Great as have been the improvements effected in marine eugines to

this end, much still remains to be done. Wolf's compound engine, so long
overlooked, is, with some improvements, being at last applied. Whereas the

consumption of fuel in such vessels as the ' Himalaj^a ' used to be from 5 to
6 lbs. of fuel per effective horse-power, it has been reduced, bj' working steam
more expansively in vessels of a later date, to 2 lbs. Yet, comparing this
with the total amount of energy of 2 lbs. of coal, it will be found that not a
tenth part of the power is obtained which that amount of coal would theo-

retically call into action*.

  Wo live in an age when great discoveries are made, and when they are

speedily taken advantage of if likely to be of service to mankind.
    In former times, man's inventions were frequently in advance of the age,

and they were laid aside to await a happier era. There were in those earlier

days too few persons who cared to, or who could, avail themselves of the prof-
ferred boon, and there was no sufficient accumulation of wealth to justify its

being ai)proj>riated to schemes which are always in their early stage more or

less speculative.

    There is no more remarkable instance of the rapid utilization of what was

in the first instance regarded by most men as a mere scientific idea, than the

adoption and extension of the electric telegraph.

   Those wlio read Odicr's letter written in 1773, in which he made known

his idea of a telegraph which would " enable the inhabitants of Europe to con-
verse with the Emperor of Mogiil," little thought that in less than a century a
conversation between persons at points so distant would be possible. Still

less did those who saw in the following year messages sent from one room to

another by Lesage, in the presence of Friedrich of Prussia, realize that they
had before them the germ of one of the most extraordinary inventions among

the many that will render this century famous.
   I should weary you were I to follow the slow steps by which the electric

telegraph of to-day was brought to its present state of efficiency. In the

present century few years have passed without new workers appearing in the

field ; some whose object was to utilize the new-found power for the benefit
of mankind, others (and theii* work was not the least important in the end)
whose object was to investigate magnetism and electrical phenomena as pre-
senting scientific problems still unsolved. Galvani, Yolta, Oersted, Arago,
Sturgeon, and Earaday, by their labours, helped to make known the elements
which rendered it possible to construct the electric telegraph. "With the
battery, the electric coil, and the electro-magnet, the elements were complete,
and it only remained for Sir Charles Wheatstone and others to combine them
in a useful and practically valuable form. The inventions of Alexander,
Steinheil, and those of similar nature to that of Sir Charles Wheatstone, were
made known at a later date in the same year, which will ever be memorable

in the annals of telegraphy*.

   The first useful telegraph was constructed upon the Blackwall Railway in

1838, Messrs. Cooke & Wheatstone's instruments being employed. Prom that

time the progress of the electric telegraph has been so rapid, that at the pre-
sent time, including land lines and submarine cables, there are in use in
dififerent parts of the world not less than 400,000 miles of telegraph.

   Among the numerous inventions of late years, the automatic telegraphs of

Mr. Alexander Bain, of Dr. Werner Siemens, and of Sir Charles "Wheatstone
are especially worthy of notice. Mr. Bain's machine is chiefly used in the
United States, that of Dr. Werner Siemens in Germany, In this country the

machine invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone, to whom telegraphy owes so

much, is chiefly employed. By his machine, after the message has been
piinched out in a paper ribbon by one machine, on a system analogous to the

 dot and dash of Morse, the sequence of the currents requisite to transmit the
 message along the wire is automatically determined in a second machine by
 this perforated ribbon. This second operation is analogous to that by which
 in Jacquard's loom the motions of the threads requisite to produce the patterii

 is determined by perforated cards. By Wheatstone's machine errors insepara-
 ble from manual labour are avoided ; and, what is of even more importance in

a commercial point of view, the time during which the wire is occupied in the
transmission of a message is considerably diminished.

   By the application of these automatic systems to telegraphy, the speed of

transmission has been wonderfully accelerated, being equal to 200 words a

--minute that is, faster than a shorthand writer can transcribe ; and, in fact,

words can now be passed along the wires of land lines with a velocity greater
than can be dealt with by the human agency at either end.

   Owiag partly to the retarding effects of induction and other causes, the speed
of transmission by long submarine cables is much smaller. With the cable
of 1858 only 2^ words per minute were got through. The average with the

Atlantic cable, Dr. C. W. Siemens informs me, is now 17 words ;.but24 words

per minute can be read.

   One of the most striking phenomena in telegraphy is that known as the
duplex system, which enables messages to be sent from each end of the same
wire at the same time. This simultaneous transmission from both ends of a
wire was proposed in the early days of telegraphy, but, owing to imperfect
insulation, was not then found to be practicable ; but since then telegraphic
wires have been better insulated, and the system is now becoming of great
utility, as it nearly doubles the capacity for work of every wire.

   And yet within how short a period of time has aU the wonderful progress

in telegraphy been achieved ! How incredulous the world a few years ago

would have been if then told of the marvels which in so short a space of time
were to be accomplished by its agency

   It is not long ago (1823) that Mi*, (afterwards Sir Francis) Eonald, one of the
early pioneers in this field of science, published a description of an electric

telegraph. He communicated his views to Lord Melville, and that nobleman

was obliging enough to reply that the subject should bo inquired into ; but
before the nature of Sir Francis Ronald's suggestions could be known, except to a
few, that gentleman received a reply from Mr. Barrow " that telegraphs of any
Idnd were then wholly unnecessary, and that no other than the one then in use
would be adopted," the one then in use being the old semaphore, which,
crowning the tops of hills between London and Portsmouth, seemed perfec-
tion to the Admiralty of that day.

   I am acquainted with some who, when the first Transatlantic cable was

proposed, contributed towards that undertaking with the consciousness that

it was only an experiment, and that subscribing to it was much the same
thing as throwing their money into the sea. Much of this cable was lost in
the first attempt to lay it ; but_ its j)romoters, nothing daunted, made 900
miles more cable, and finally laid it successfully in the following year, 1858.

    The telegraphic system of the world comprises almost a complete girdle
round the earth ; and it is probable that the missing link will be supplied by
a cable between San Francisco in California and Yokohama in Japan.

   How resolute and courageous those who engaged in submarine telegraphy
ADDRESS.  XGl

havo been will appear from the fact that, though wo have now 50,000 milca

of cable in use, to got at this result nearly 70,000 miles were constructed

and laid. This large percentage of failure, in the opinion of Dr. C. W.
Siemens (to whom I am much indebted for information on this subject), was

partly duo to the late introduction of testing a cable under water before it is
laid, and to the use of too light iron sheathing.

    Of immense importance in connexion with the subsequent extension of

submarine cables have been the discoveries of Ohm and Sir William Thom-

son, and the knowledge obtained that the resistance of wire in homogeneous

metal is directly proportional to the length, so that the place of a fault in a

cable of many thousand miles in length can be ascertained with so much pre-
cision as to enable you to go at once to repair it, although the damaged cable
may lie in some thousands of fathoms of water.

   Of railways the progress has been enormous ; but I do not know that in

a scientific point of view a railway is so marvellous in its character as the
electric telegraph. The results, however, of the construction and use of rail-
ways are more extensive and widespread, and their utility and convenience
brought home to a larger portion of mankind. It has come to pass, there-

fore, that the name of George Stephenson has been placed second only to that
of James Watt ; and as men are and will be estimated by the advantages

which their labours confer on mankind, he will remain in that niche, unless
indeed some greater luminary should arise to outshine him. The merit of
George Stephenson consisted, among other things, in this, that he saw more
clearly than any other engineer of his time the sort of thing that the world
wanted ; and that he persevered, in despite of learned objectors, with the
firm conviction that he was right and they were wrong, and that there was
within himself the power to demonstrate the accuracy of his convictions.

   Railways are a subject on which I may (I hope without tiring you) speak

somewhat more at length. The British Association is peripatetic, and with-

out railways its meetings, if held at all, would, I fear, be greatly reduced in

numbers. Moreover, you have all an interest in them : you all demand to be
carried safely, and you insist on being carried fast. Besides, everybody
understands, or thinks he understands, a railway ; and therefore I shall be
speaking on a subject common to all of us, and shall possibly only put before
you ideas which others as weU. as myself have already entertained.

  We who live in these days of roads and railways, and can move with a

fair degree of comfort, speed, and safety, almost where we will, can scarcely
realize the state of England two centuries ago, when the years of opposition

which preceded the era of coaches began ; when, as in 1662, there were but
six stages in all England, and John Crossdell, of the Charterhouse, thought

there were six too many ; when Sir Henry Herbcrti, a member of the House
of Commons, could say, " If a man were to propose to carry us regularly to
--xcii
REPORT 1875.

Ediiiburgli iu coaches in seven daj-s, and bring us back in seven more, sbonld
·we not vote him to Bedlam? "

   In spite of short-sighted opposition, coaches made their way ; but it was not
until a century later, in 1784 (and then, I believe, it was in this city of Bristol),
that coaches were first established for the conveyance of mails. Those here who
have experienced, as I have, what the discomforts were of long journeys in-
side the old coaches, will agree with me that they were very great ; and I

believe, if returns could be obtained of the accidents which happened to

coaches, it would be found that many more pcox^le were injured and killed
in proportion to the number that travelled by that mode, than by the rail-

ways of to-day.

   No sooner had our ancestors settled down with what comfort was possible
in their coaches, well satisfied that twelve miles an hour was the maximum

speed to be obtained, or was desirable, than they were told that steam con-
veyance on iron railways would supersede their " present pitiful " methods
of conveyance. Such was the opinion of Thomas Gray, the first promoter of
railways, who published his work on a general iron railway in 1819. Gray

was looked on as littlo better than a madman. " When Gray first proposed

his great scheme to the public," said Chevalier Wilson, in a letter to Sir
Bobert Peel in 1845, " people were disposed to treat it as an effusion of in-
sanity." I shall not enter on a history of the struggles which preceded the
opening of the first railway. They were brought to a successful issue by the
determination of a few able and far-seeing men. The names of Thomas

Gray and Joseph Sandars, of William James and Edward Pease, should
always be remembered in connexion with the early history of railways, for
it was ihej who first made the nation familiar with the idea. There is no
fear that the name of Stephenson will be forgotten, whoso practical genius
made the realization of the idea possible.

   The Stockton and Darlington Eailway was opened in 1825, the Liverpool
and Manchester Eailway in 1830 ; and in the short time which has since
elapsed, railways have been extended to every quarter of the globe. No
nation possessing wealth and population can aff'ord to be without them ; and
though at present in different countries there is in the aggregate about
160,000 miles of railway, it is certain that in the course of a very few years
this quantity, large as it is, wiU be very greatly exceeded.

    Kailwaj'S add enoimously to the national wealth. More than twenty-five
years ago it was proved to the satisfaction of a committee of the House of
Commons, from facts and figures which I then adduced, that the Lancashire
 and Yorkshii-e Eailway, of which I was the engineer, and which then formed
the principal railway connexion between the populous towns of Lancashire
and Yorkshire, effected a saving to the public using the railway of more than
the whole amount of the dividend which was received by the proprietors.
These calculations were based solely on the amount of trafiic carried by the
ADDRESS.  XCIU

railway, and on the difference between the railway rate of charge and the

charges by the modes of conveyance anterior to railways. No credit what-

ever was taken for the saving of time, though in England preeminently time
is money.

   Considering that railway charges on many items have been considerably re-
duced since that day, it may be safely assumed that the railways in the
British Islands now produce, or rather save the nation, a much larger sum

annually than the gross amount of all the dividends payable to the proprietors,
without at all taking into account the benefit arising from the saving in
time. The benefits under that head defy calculation, and cannot, with any
accuracy, be put into money ; but it would not be at all over-estimating this
question to say that in time and money the nation gains at least what is
equivalent to 10 per cent, on all the caj^ital expended on railways. I do
not urge this on the part of railway proprietors, for they did not embark in
these undertakings with a view to the national gain, but for the expected
 profit to themselves. Yet it is as well it should be noted ; for railway pro-
prietors appear sometimes by some people to be regarded in the light of

 public enemies.

    It follows from these facts that whenever a railway can be made at a cost
 to yield the ordinary interest of money, it is in the national interest that it

 should be made. Further, that thoiigh its cost might be such as to leave a
 smaller dividend than that to its proprietors, the loss of wealth to so small a
 section of the community will be more than supplemented by the national

 gain, and therefore there may be cases where a government may wisely con-

 tribute in some form to undertakings which, without such aid, would fail to

 obtain the necessary support.

    And so some countries, Russia for instance, to which improved means of
 transport are of vital importance, have wisely, in my opinion, caused lines to
 be made which, having regard to their own expenditure and receipts, would

 be unprofitable works, but in a national point of view are or speedily will bo

 highly advantageous.

     The empire of Brazil also, which I have lately visited, is arriving at the
  conclusion, which I think not an unwise one, that the State can afford and
  will be benefited in the end by guaranteeing 7 per cent, upon any railway that
 can of itself be shown to produce a net income of 4 per cent., on the assump-
 tion that the nation wiU be benefited at least to the extent of the difference.

  A --question more important probably in the eyes of many safety of railway
 --travelling may not be inappropriate. At all events, it is well that the

  elements on which it depends should be clearly understood. It will be thought
  that longer experience in the management of railways should go to ensure
  greater safety ; but there are other elements of the question which go to
  counteract this in some degree.

      Tlie safety of railway travelling depends on the perfection of the machine
Xciv  --HEPORT 1875.

 in all its parts, including the whole railway, with its movable plant, in that

 term ; it depends also on the nature and quantity of traffic, and, lastly, on

 human care and attention.
    With regard to what is human, it may he said that so many of these acci-

 dents as arise from the fallibility of men will never be eliminated until the race

 be improved.

    The liability to accident will also increase with the speed, and might be
 reduced by slackening that speed. It increases with the extent and variety
 of the traffic on the same line. The public, I fear, will rather run the risk
than consent to be carried at a slower rate. The increase in extent and
variety of traffic is not likely to receive any diminution ; on the contrary, it

 is certain to augment.

    I should be sorry to say that human care may not do something; and I am
not among those who object to appeals through the press, and otherwise, to
railway companies, though sometimes perhaps they may appear in an un-
reasonable form. T see no harm in men being urged in every way to do their

utmost in a matter so vital to many.

   A question may arise whether, if the railways were in the hands of the

Government, they could not be worked with greater safety. Government would
not pay their officers better, or perhaps so well as the companies do, and it is
doubtful whether they would succeed in attracting to the service abler men.

They might do the work with a smaller number of chief officers ; for much of
the time of the companies' managers is occupied in internecine disputes. They
might handle the traffic more despotically, diminishing the number of trains,
or the accommodation afforded by them, or in other ways, to insure more safety

but would the public bear any curtailment of convenienco ?
    One thing they could, and perhaps would do. In cases where the traffic

is varied, and could more safely be conducted with the aid of relief lines, which
hold out no sufficient inducement to the companies to make, the Government,
being content with a lower rate of interest, might undertake to make them,

though then comes the question whether, when the whole of this vast machine
came to depend for supplies on annual votes of Parliament, money would be

forthcoming in greater abundance than it is under the present system.
    But the consideration of this subject involves other and more difficult

questions.

   Where are the labours of Government to stop ? The cares of State which
cannot be avoided are already heavy, and will grow heavier every year. Dock-
yard establishments are trifling to what the railway establishments, which
already employ 250,000 men, would be. The assumption of all the railways
would bring Government into conflict with every passeuger, every trader, every
merchant, and every manufacturer. With the raUway companies there would
be no difficulty ; they would sell their undertakings to any one provided the

price was ample.
ADDRESS.  XCV

   Looking at the vast growth of railway traffic, one measure occurs to me as

conducive to the safety of railway passengers, and likely to be demanded
some day : it is to construct between important places railways which should
carry passengers only or coals only, or be set apart for some special separation
of traffic ; though there wiU be some difficulty in accomplishing this. Laud-
owners, through whose property such lines would pass, would probably wish

to use such lines for general purposes. Nevertheless it may have to be tried

some day.

    It would be instructive, were it practicable, to compare the relative propor-
tion of accidents by railway and by the old stage-coaches ; but no records that

I am aware of exist of the latter that would enable such a comparison to be
made. It is practicable to make some sort of comparison between the acci-
dents in the earlier days of our own railways and the accidents occurring at a

later date.

   The Board of Trade have unfortunately abandoned the custom, which they
adopted from 1852 to 1859, of returning the passenger mileage, which is given
in the German returns, and is the proper basis upon which to found the pro-
portion of accidents, and not on the number of passengers without any regard
to distance travelled, which has altered very much, the average journey per
passenger being nearly half in 1873 what it was in 1846.

   It would be erroneous to compare the proportions of accidents to passengers
carried in various years, even if the correct number of passengers travelling
were given. But a figure is always omitted from the Board of Trade return,
which makes the proportion of accidents to passengers appear larger than it is
this is the number of journeys performed by season-ticket holders. Some
estimate could be made of the journeys of season-ticket holders by dividing
the receipts by an estimated average fare, or the companies could make an
approximate estimate, and the passenger mileage could be readily obtained
by the railway companies from the tickets. These additions would greatly
add to the value of the railway returns as statistical documents, and render
the deductions made from them correct.

   Though it has been a work of labour, I have endeavoured to supply these
deficiencies, and I believe the results arrived at maybe taken as fairly accurate*.

   From the figures so arrived at, it appears the passenger mileage has doubled

between 1861 and 1873 ; and at the rate of increase between 1870 and 1873
it would become double what it was in 1873 in twelve years fi-om that time,
namely in 1885.

    The number of passengers has doubled between 1864 and 1873, and at the
rate of increase between 1870 and 1873 it would become double what it waa
in 1873 in eleven years and a half, or in 1885.

   It must, however, be remembered that the rate of increase since 1870, though
very regular for 1871, 1872, and 1873, is greater than in previous years,

                                                     * See Table in Appendixi
XCVl  KEPOKT 1875.

beiag probably due to tho rise of wages and the great development of third-
class traffic, and it woiild not be safe to assume this rate of increase will

 continue.

    Supposing no improvement had been effected in the working of railway
traffic by the interlocking of points, the block system, &c., the increase of
accidents should have borne some proportion to the passenger mileage, multi-
plied by the proportion between the train mileage and the length of line open,
as the number of trains passing over the same line of rails would tend to
multiply accidents in an increasing proportion, especially where the trains run

 at different speeds.

    The number of accidents varies considerably from year to year ; but taking
two averages of ten years each, it appears that the proportion of deaths of
passengers from causes beyond their control to passenger miles travelled in
the ten years ending December 31, 1873, was only two thirds of the same
proportion in the ten years ending December 31, 1861 ; the proportion of all
accidents to passengers from causes beyond their own control was one ninth
more in the last ten years than in the earlier, whereas the frequency of trains
had increased on the average one fourth.

    The limit, however, of considerable improvements in signalling, increased
brake-power, &c. may be reached before long; and if so, the increase of
accidents will then depend on the increase of traffic, together with the in-

creased frequency of trains.

   The large growth of railway traffic, which we may assume will double in
twenty years, wiU evidently greatly tax the resources of the railway com-
panies ; and unless the present companies increase the number of the lines of
way, as some have commenced to do, or new railways are made, the system
of expeditious and safe railway travelling will be imperilled. Up to the

present time, however, the improvements in regulating the traffic appear to
have kept pace with the increase of traffic and of speed, as the slight increase
in the proportion of railway accidents to passenger miles is probably chiefly

due to a larger number of trifling bruises being reported now than formerly.
   I believe it was a former President of the Board of Trade who said to an

alarmed deputation, who waited upon him on the subject of railway travelling,

that he thought he was safer in a railway carriage than anywhere else.
    If he gave any such opinion, he was not far wrong, as is sufficiently evident

when it can be said that there is only one passenger injured in every four
million miles travelled, or that, on an average, a person may travel 100,000

miles each year for forty years, and the chances be slightly in his favom' of
his not receiving the slightest injurj-.

  A pressing subject of the present time is the economy of fuel. Members of

the British Association have not neglected this momentous question.
   At the meeting held at Is'ewcastle-on-Tyne in 1863, Sir "William

Armstrong sonnded an alarm as to the proximate exhaustion of our coal-fields.
       AuuBiiss.                                                         xcvn

Mr. liramwell, when presiding over Iho Mechanical (Section at Brighton,

drew attention to the waste of fuel.
   Dr. Siemens, in an able lecture he delivered by request of the Association

to the operative classes at the meeting at Bradford, pointed out the waste of

fuel in special branches of the iron trade, to which he has devoted so much

attention.

   He showed on that occasion that, in the ordinary reheating furnace, the

coal consumed did not produce the twentieth part of its theoretical effect, and
in melting steel in pots in the ordinary way not more than one-seventieth

part, in melting one ton of steel in pots about 2| tons of coke being con-

sumed. Dr. Siemens further stated that, in his regenerative gas-furnace, one

ton of steel was melted with 12 cwt. of small coal.
   Mr. Lowthian Bell, who combines chemical knowledge with the practical

experience of an ironmaster, in his Presidential address to the Members of
the Iron and Steel Institute in 1873, stated that, with the perfect mode of
Avithdrawing and utilizing the gases and the improvement in the furnaces
adopted in the Cleveland district, the present make of pig iron in Cleveland

is produced with 3| million tons of coal less than would have been needed
fifteen years ago, this being equivalent to a saving of 45 per cent, of the

quantity formerly used. He shows by figures, with Avhich he has favoured

me, that the calorific power of the waste gases from the furnaces is sufficient

for raising all the steam and heating all the air the furnaces require.

It has already been stated that by working steam more expansively, either

in double or single engines, the consumption of fuel in improved modern

engines compared with the older forms may be reduced to one third.

    All these reductions still fall far short of the theoretical efiect of fuel,

which may be never reached. Mr. Lowthian Bell's figures go to show that

in the interior of the blast-furnace, as improved in Cleveland, there is not

much more to be done in reducing the consumption of fuel ; but much has
already been done; and could the reductions now attainable and all the

information already acquired be universally applied, the saving in fuel would
be enormous.

  How many open blast-furnaces still belch forth flame and gas and smoke

as uselessly, and with nearly as much mischief to the surrounding neighbour-

hood, as the fires of Etna or Vesuvius

  How many of the older and more extravagant forms of steam-engine still

exist!

    "What is to be done with the intractable householder, with the domestic

hearth, where, without going to German stoves, but by using Galton's grates
and other improvements, every thing necessary both for comfort and con-
venience could be as well attained with a much smaller consumption of

coal ?

If I have pointed out that we do not avail ourselves of more than a frac-

xcviii  --KEPOiix 1875.

tional part of the useful effects of fuel, it is cot that I expect we shall all at
once mend our ways in this respect.

   Many cases of waste arise from the existence of old and obsolete machines,

of had forms of furnaces, of wasteful grates, existing in most dwelling-
houses ; and these are not to be remedied at once; for not eveiy one can
afford, however desirable it might be, to cast away the old and adopt tho

new.
   In looking uneasily to the future supply and cost of fuel, it is, however,

something to know what may be done even with the application of our
present knowledge ; and could we apply it universally to-day, all that is
necessary for trade and comfort could probably be as well provided for by
one half the present consumption of fuel ; and it behoves those who ary
beginning to build new mills, new furnaces, new steamboats, or new houses

to act as though the price of coal which obtained two years ago had beea
the normal and not the abnormal price.

   There was in early years a battle of the gauges, and there is now a contest
about guns ; but your time wUl not permit me to say much on their manu-

facture.

   Here, again, the progress made in a few years has been enormous ; and in
contributing to it, two men, Sir William Ai-mstrong and Sir Joseph Whit-,

·worth, both civil engineers, in this country at all events, deservedly stand

foremost, The iron coil construction of Sir William Annstrong has already
produced remarkable and satisfactory results ; in discussing further possible
improvements, the question is embarrassed by attempting to draw sharp lines
between what is called steel and iron.

    There is nothing that I can see to limit the size of guns, except the

tenacity and endurance of the metal, whatever we may choose to caU it, of

which they are to be made.

   Sir Joseph Whitworth, who has already done more than any other man in

his department to secure good workmanship, and whose ideal of perfection is
ever expanding, has long been seeking, and not without success, by enormous
compression, to increase those qualities in what ho calls homogeneous metal.

Make the metal good enough, and caU it iron if you wiU, and the size of a
gun may be any thing : the mere construction and handling of a gun of 100

tons, or of greater weight, with suitable mechanical appliances, presents no

difficulty.

   Relying on the qualities of his compressed metal. Sir Joseph is now

seeking by a singular experiment to limit the travel of the recoil, as far as
practicable, to the elasticity of the metal. By attaching the muzzle of the
gun to an outer casing, through which the force of the recoil is carried back
to the trunnions, he proposes to avail himself of this elasticity to the extent
of once and a half the length of the gun; whether its elasticity alone
in so short a space will suffice without other aid is, perhaps, doubtful ; but
                               ADDRliSS.                                                                 XCIX

other aid may be applied, and the experimeut, whether successful or not,

will be interesting.

Docks and harbours I have no time to mention; for it is time this long and,

I fear, tedious address should close.

   " Wheuco and whither," is an aphorism which leads us away from present
and plainer objects to those which are more distant and obscure ; whether
we look backwards or forwards, our vision is speedily arrested by an impene-

trable veil.

   On the subjects I have chosen you will probably think I have travelled

backwards far enough. I have dealt to some extent with the present.

   The retrospect, however, may be useful to show what great works were

done in former ages.

   Some things have been better done than in those earlier times, but not all.
   In what we choose to call the ideal we do not surpass the ancients. Poets
and painters and sculptors were as great in former times as now ; so, pro-

bably, were the mathematicians.

   In what depends on the accumulation of experience, we ought to excel

our forerunners. Engineering depends largely on experience ; nevertheless,
in future times, whenever difficulties shall arise or works have to be accom-

plished for which there is no precedent, he who has to perform the duty
may step forth from any of the walks of life, as engineers have not unfre-

quently hitherto done.

   The marvellous progress of the last two generations should make every one
cautious of predicting the future. Of engineering works, however, it may
be said that their practicability or impracticability is often determined by

other elements than the inherent difficulty in the works themselves.

--Greater works than any yet achieved remain to be accomplished not,

perhaps, yet awhile. Society may not yet require them ; the world could

not at present afford to pay for them.

   The progress of engineering works, if we consider it, and the expenditure
upon them, has already in our time been prodigious. One hundred and sixty

thousand miles of railway alone, put into figures at ^20,000 a mile, amounts

to 3200 million pounds sterling ; add 400,000 miles of telegraph at =£100 a
mile, and 100 millions more for sea canals, docks, harbours, water and sani-

tary works constructed in the same period, and wo get the enormous sum of
3340 millions sterling expended in one generation and a half on what may

undoubtedly be called useful works.

The wealth of nations may be impaired by expenditure on luxuries and

war ; it cannot be diminished by expenditure on works like these.

As to the future, we know we cannot create a force; we can, and no

--Eleventh Report of the Committee for Exploring Kent's Cavern, Devon-
   shire the Committee consisting of Sir John Lubbock, Bart., F.R.S.,
   John Evans, F.R.S., Edward Vivian, M.A., George Busk,
   F.R.S., William Boyd Dav^kins, F.R.S., William Ayshford
   Sanford, F.G.S., John Edward Lee, F.G.S., and William Pen-

    GELLY, F.R.S. {Reporter).

The Committee have again the melancholy duty of reporting that death has

deprived them of one of their members. As long ago as 1851), as soon as ho

became aware of the importance of the discoveries made in the Windmill-

Hill Cavern at Brixham, Sir Charles Lyell expressed a strong desire that

Kent's Cavern should also be systematically and thoroughly explored ; and

it was with his full concurrence that the proposal to do so was laid before
the Committee of the Geological Section of the British Association at Bath

in 1864, the day after ho delivered his Presidential Address ; whilst his

ardent advocacy, together with that of the late Professor Phillips, secured its

ready acceptance by the Committee of Recommendations and the General

Committee. At the first meeting of the Cavern Committee, appointed in the

year just mentioned, he was unanimously elected Chairman, and ho con-

tinued to occupy that post until his lamented decease on 27th February,

1875. Though the state of his health prevented him from taking any active

part in the exploration, his interest in the work never abated ; he always

carefully studied the Monthly Reports of Progress sent him by the Super-

intendents, and he made careful arrangements for their preservation.

The Tenth Report, read to the Geological Section of the Association at the

Belfast Meeting, and printed in the annual volume for last year, brought up

the work to the end of July 1874. The exploration has been carried on
without interruption from that date to the present time, the mode of

excavation adopted at the beginning has been uniformly followed, the
Superintendents have visited the Cavern daily, the progress of the work

has been carefully recorded in the Cavern diary, the workmen have, as

heretofore, given complete satisfaction, and 3Ionthly Reports have been

1875.  B

regularly sent to Sir Charles LyeU until his decease, and subsequently to
Mr. John Evans.

    The Committee have the satisfaction of stating that they still retain the
services of George Smerdon, foreman of the work, who has been engaged on
it from the beginning. As John Clinnick, the second workman, believing
the employment prejudicial to his health, has sought more congenial labour,
they have engaged Nicholas Luscombe in his stead, and hope that he may
prove an equally satisfactory workman.

    The Cavern continues to be much visited by persons desirous of studying
on the spot its characters and phenomena; and during the last twelve

months the Superintendents have had the pleasure of taking the following
gentlemen through those branches which have been explored, and of

--explaining to them the mode of operation : Sir C. Wheatstone, General D.

Lysons, Colonel Brine, Major J. Virtue (Madras), the Revs. Dr. Stebbing,

J. L. Ball, W. E. Buckley, G. Henslow, J. Parker, T. E. E. Stebbing,

    Numerous visitors have also been conducted by the " Guide," who, though
under the control of the Committee, is not permitted to take parties to those
branches of the Cavern in which the exploration is in progress or has not

been begun.

   As in former years, rats have frequently been seen running about in
various parts of the Cavern, including those in which the men have been at
work, though hundreds of feet from any glimmering of daylight ; and they

have displayed their usual boldness as well as their skill in carrying off
candles. In other branches, almost as far from the entrances, where all
researches have ceased for some years, their footprints are to be seen in very
great numbers, especially on. the silt left, here and there, where the drip is
copious in wet weather. It is difficult to understand what draws them
thither, unless it be the small amount of tallow which drops from the candles

of visitors.

   On 29th January, 1875, a " buzzing fly" was heard by one of the Super-

intendents in " The Cave of Inscriptions," about 300 feet from daylight, and
was subsequently seen by the workmen in the same Cave.

    CKnnicl's Gallery.^-1\ig> Tenth Eeport (1874) stated that the Committee
had discovered that the " Long Arcade," aboiit 225 feet from its entrance,
threw off a narrow branch, which had been named " Clinnick's Gallery"

--after the workman who first entered it- that its exploration was in progress

--and had been completed for about 34 feet that below the least ancient, or
ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.  3

the " Granular, Stalagmitic Floor," for a distance of 18 feet from the entrance,
a small quantity of " Cave-earth " uniformly presented itself, beneath whicli
lay the "Breccia," occasionally separated from it by remnants of the more

--ancient, or the " Crystalline, Stalagmitic Floor " in situ but that from the

point just named, up to that reached when the Tenth Report was drawn,
there was no Cave-earth ; so that the two Stalagmites lay the one imme-

diately on the other, with the Breccia (that is, as far as is known), the

oldest of the Cavern deposits, beneath the whole.

   At the commencement of the exploration of this Gallery, the deposits so
very nearly reached the roof as to induce the belief that a very few feet at
most was aU that the workmen had before them. In short, no one suspected
the existence of this branch of the Cavern. As the work advanced, how-
ever, the unoccupied interspace between the roof and floor became gradually
larger, until on the 6th of August, 1875, John Clinnick, the workman

already mentioned, forced himself through, and, after proceeding about
50 feet, as he estimated, entered a large chamber, of which he brought back
such a glowing description as to induce one of the Superintendents to follow

him, when he found the workman's description by no means too^ highly
coloured. The Chamber, probably one of the largest in the Cavern, is beau-
tifully hung with stalactites, and has numerous stalagmitic " paps," some of
them four feet high and of almost cylindrical form, rising from a floor of

the same material.
    The work iu Cliunick's Gallery was very difficult, as the two stalagmites

were not only extremely hard and tough, but had an aggregate thickness
amounting frequently to fully four feet ; and the very contracted height

and breadth of the Gallery prevented the meu from working to the best

advantage.

    The state of the Floor was a puzzHng study. The older, or lower, or
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                _

Crystalline -Stalagmite was broken in places near the left wall along a line
parallel with it, and the fragments, occasionally considerable sheets, were
raised some inches above their original level at their margin most remote
from the wall and depressed at that nearest to it, whilst every thing remained
intact at and adjacent to the opposite wall of the narrow Gallery. The dis-
turbance occurred obviously before the commencement of the formation of

the upper or Granular Stalagmite ; for not only was this less ancient floor

undisturbed, but the fragmentary and tilted sheets of the older floor just
mentioned passed in some instances obliquely through it, rising above its
upper surface on one side and projecting below its base on the other.
Adjacent to the left wall, at a point where the Floor was unbroken, a pap
(which had evidently lost its top) reached the height of 16 inches and was

still standing erect. Though var5-ing somewhat in diameter, it may be said

 to be cylindrical in form, and at the top it measured 10 inches in circum-
ference. Almost in contact with it, but lying horizontally at its base, and
 completely enveloped in the Granular Stalagmite, was a fragment of, no

 doubt, the same pap, 10 inches long ; whilst on the opposite side of the

 standing portion was a third fragment, 5 inches long, terminating in a cone,
 and firmly held to the spot by stalagmitic matter. There can be no doubt
 that the three pieces are portions of one and the same pap, of which the
 shorter piece was the conical apex, the unbroken column having been at least
 31 inches long. Phenomena such as these are calculated to induce specu-
lations respecting the causes which produced them and the time they repre-

 sent. In the case just mentioned, we have, first, the deposition of the
 Breccia, or oldest of the Cavern-deposits, so far as is certainly known ; thia

                                                                          b2

was followed by the formation of the Crystalline Stalagmite as a continuons

sheet of somewhat variable thickness, which sometimes reached fully 3 feet

ill this Glallcry; next came that very slow drip and pi'ccipitation of car-

bonate of lime which alone seems compatible with the formation of paps,

and this continued until the pap just described had reached a height ex-

ceeding 30 inches and a girth of 10 ; this was succeeded by some cause of

disturbance, which broke the thick floor of Crystalline Stalagmite, depressed,

as if by subsidence, the deposit adjacent to one wall, but left every thing

intact on the opposite side of the narrow passage, broke the pap into three

pieces, leaving the lowest of them still erect, causing the middle segment to

fall at its foot on the outside, and that which formed the apex on the inside ;
finally, this was followed by another shect-lilco floor of btalagmite, of less

thickness than the former, granular in texture, and capable of preventing

Athe results of the disturbance from being themselves disturbed.        faint

earthquake-tremor would, no doubt, suffice to break some of the long com-

paratively slender paps ; for some of those which have been found detached
have been known to resolve themselves into fragments, even at a touch, the

planes of division being at right angles to the longest axis, whilst others of

even less thickness will stand a considerable blow. Most of those standing

intact emit a musical note when gently struck ; and the notes are such as to
show that the rates of vibration, and hence probably the molecular arrange-

ment, must differ considerably even in masses differing but little in di-

mensions.

CHnnick's Gallery on being excavated was found to be a somewhat tortuous

passage, varying from 4 to 8 feet in width, and from 7 to 10 feet in height *,

That it was once a watercourse there can be little or no doubt, as the roof

bears the marks of the long-continued action of a running stream. The

--walls vary considerably being in some places smooth, in others mucli fretted

or corroded, and in others more or less angular.

The objects of interest found in this branch of the Cavern daring the

last twelve mouths have been by no means numerous ; nevertheless they
are not without interest, as a few of them throw a new light on the palaj-

ontology of the Cavern.

Attached to the upper surface of the Granular Stalagmitic Floor, the least

ancient of the two deposits of that material, portions of three land-shells

(No. 6477) were found, 23rd October, 1874 ; and on the 31st of the same

month about 20 bones of Mammals (No. 6481) were met with, lying toge-

ther loose on the Floor, beneath a few smaU fragments of Stalagmite. Their

characters are such as to imply a recent introduction into the Cavern.

   Incorporated in the Granular Stalagmite itself were a few bones, including
a humerus (No. 6475), a tibia and ulna (No. 6476), all nearly entire, and

a portion of a large humerus (No. 6491), each of which had been gnawed.

   TJiough no Cave-eartli was met with beyond the point already specified,

there seems no doubt that to the era of that deposit may be referred a con-

siderable portion of a radius (No. 6484) and of an ulna (No. 6489), both
gnawed and found under loose pieces of stalagmite.

The Breccia in this Gallery was not much more productive. The total

remains of animals it has yielded since the last Report was presented arc

4 teeth of Bear, a few bones and fragments of bone, and 3 teeth of Lion in
three portions of, no doubt, one and the same lower jaw. The latter " find"

(No. 6482) is of considerable interest, as being the first known instance of

    * All heights mentioned in this Report have been measured from the bottom of the
excavations made by the Committee,
ON KENT S CAVERNj DKVOXSHIKE.                    5

remains of any animal besides Bear met with in the Breccia. It was found
witli thi'ee bits of bone on the 2nd November, 1874, in the third foot-level ; and
vertically beneath it, in the next foot-level, were 1 tooth of Bear, a fragment
of bone, and a flint chip (No. 6483). Though the Superintendents had no
doubt of the feline character of the teeth, they forwarded one of them (that
least surrounded with Breccia) to Mr. George Busk, E.R.S. Ac, a member of
the Committee, on 30th November, 1874, remarking that they believed it to
be the last lower left molar of Fclis spdcca, and requesting his opinion on it.
In his reply, dated " 32 Harley Street, December 8, 1874," he remarks :
" There is no doubt that the tooth is the left lower carnassial of Felts leo,
but it is of very unusual size, being, I should estimate, jK, bigger than the

average dimensions of that tooth in the Lion. It is usually longer, but not
so thick, in the Tiger than in the Lion ; but the thickness of the present one

is proportionate to its length, viz. 1-20 x '65 inch. Another peculiarity, as
it seems to me, is the great wear that the tooth has undergone. I fancy
existing Lions are not allowed to live long enough to wear their teeth so
much. At any rate, the Kent's Hole tooth appears to be more worn than
any other I have as yet met with. Can it belong to Machairodus ?

(Signed)                       " Geokge Bxtsk."

Having succeeded in removing some part of the matrix incrusting the

other portions of the jaw, they were also forwarded to Mr. Busk, with the

observation that the Superintendents had carefully considered the question

before submitting the iirst tooth, and had come to the conclusion that the
jaw was not that of Machairodus ; for, waiving the fact that none of the
teeth were serrated, the fang of the canine still remaining iii the jaw was

much too large for a lower canine of any known species of Machairodus ; and
it was siiggested that it might be worth considering whether the specimen

belonged to any of the species of Felis found in the Forest-bed of Cromer.

--Mr. Busk says in his reply, dated August 11, 1875: "The jaw does not

appear to present any thing unusual. It is, however, a good example to
show that the Cave-Li(m lived to a good old age.

(Signed)                       " Geoege Busk."

    Clinnick's Gallery also vielded 7 specimens of flint and chert belonging to

^the Breccia (Nos. 0466," 6467«, 6470, 6474, 6478, 6483, and 6485), of

which the first and fourth alone require fui'ther notice.
   No. 6466 is an irregular tongue-shaped tool, of gamboge-colour exter-

nally, about 3 inches long, ] -7 inch in greatest breadth, and w inch in

greatest thickness. It has been reduced to an edge all round the circum-
ference except at the but -end, is slightlj^ concave on the inner face, on
which the " bulb of percussion " is well developed near the but-end, and very
convex on the outer face, whence several flakes and chips have been dis-

lodged. It was broken into three pieces by the workmen in extracting it,
and was found, without any other object of interest near it, on 8th August,
1874, in the third foot-level of Breccia, over which the two Stalagmitic .
Floors, Avithout any Cave-earth between them, had an aggregate thickness of
48 inches.

   No. 6474, a flint pebble, pretty well rolled, and 2-1 inches long, was
found aloue, in the second foot-level of Breccia, on 24th September, 1874.

   The comparative paucity of specimens in Clinnick's Gallery irduccd the
Superintendents, en 1st December, 1874, to suspend operations in that
direction for at least a time. The labour of seven months had been ex-
6 REFOllT 1875.

pended on it, during whiclL the exploration had reached 75 feet from the

entrance, where the Great Chamber discovered by John Chnnick may be said

to begin.

   The following is a list of the objects of interest found in Clinnick's Gallery
from first to last :

    Lying on the surface, and apparently recent : 3 shells of Helix and about
20 bones of Mammals.

    Incorporated in the Granular Stalagmite : a few gnawed bones.
    In the Cave-earth : 8 teeth of Hytena, 2 of Fox, a tolerable number of
bones and fragments of bone, 1 large Chert implement (No, 6401), and 1

 small flint flake (No. 6426).

    In the Breccia : 90 teeth of Bear, 3 of Lion in portions of a left lower jaw
 (No. 6482), numerous bones and portions of bone, including a large part of
 a skull, a flint pebble, and 1 1 specimens of flint and chert implements, flakes,

and chips, including the very fine tool No. ^yy.

 --The Cave of Inseriptioiis. The chamber in which " The Long Arcade "

terminates was called by Mr. MacEnery " The Cave of Inscriptions," on
account of the number of names, initials, and dates graved on the Stalagmite
in various parts of it. Besides those on the " The Inscribed Boss of Stalag-
mite," at the entrance of the " Cave," described in the Tenth Report (1874),
inscriptions occur on what is known as " The Hedges Boss " and on the walls
of the Chamber. There are also numerous names &c. smoked on various

parts of the Roof, as there are, indeed, in almost every branch of the Cavern,

some of which appear to be of considerable antiquity.
   The left wall, about 35 feet from the entrance, is covered with Stalagmitic

matter, having usually a rough surface, and to which there does not seem to

have been recently any addition. On this surface the following inscriptions

have been noticed :

            *1. L 0.   2. AW   3. A E
                         1792
                 1609          4. 1769

    No. 1 is in large badly cut characters.
   No. 2 is in characters about 3 inches high, well cut, bold, and very legible.

NThe letters are, of course, an economical form of W.

   No. 3 is badly cut, and immediately under No. 2.
   No. 4 is in smaU characters.
    There are several other inscriptions, but not sufficiently legible to be
copied with certainty.
   At the south-western corner of the Chamber the following inscriptions
occur on the wall :

1. A^ . R.  2. G. B.   3.

5. LB.

6. William Mather

Teignmouth

8. R.B      9. 16.53

     1661

No. 1 is badly cut.
No. 4 is within a sqiiare 5-5 inches in the side and looped at each angle.

        * The mimorals prefixed to the inscriptions tie not belong to the originals.

Nos. 6 and 10 are in ordinary written cliaracters.

No. 7 is within a rectilineal figure which has not been completed, or has

been obliterated, towards the right. There has been a considerable recent

accretion of stalagmite, which has probably obliterated a portion of the
MARTYenclosing figure and some of the letters there; thus
                                                               has perhaps

lost a terminal N.

Not far from the centre of the Chamber a considerable boss of stalagmite

rises from the fioor of the same material, having on its sides several badly

scratched letters, and the following very well cut inscription in characters

about an inch high :

                     ROBERT HEDGES
                        OF IRELAND

                    FEB. 2 0. 16 88.

   On account of the attention which this inscription has attracted and the
name in it, the mass of Stalagmite has been named " The Hedges Boss."

It can scarcely be necessary to say that the Committee have left it so far
intact as they found it. The earlier explorers had broken the Stalagmitic
Floor all around it, and they, or probably some earlier visitors, seem to have
contemplated its removal or destruction ; for its apex is broken off, and a hole

7 inches deep has been bored into it, no doubt with the intention of blasting
it. In basal circumference it measures about 30 feet ; its present mutilated
top is about 4 feet high, and the Floor of Granular Stalagmite from which
it rises is about a foot thick. It is not possible to believe that Mr. MacEnery

countenanced the attempt to destroy the Boss, as he attached much import-

ance to the inscription on it, mentioning it at least four times in his ' Cavern
Researches.' The effort may, no doubt, be ascribed to an earlier period,

when it is stated by a writer in the ' Monthly Magazine ' for June 1805,
twenty years prior to Mr. MacEnery's first visit, when the Cavern was open
to all comers without let or hindrance, that " attempts have been made to

work the stones and spars [in Kent's Hole], but they do not prove orna-

mental" *.

   It is not a little strange that though the name " Robert Hedges " is per-
fectly legible, Mr. MacEnery not only never so renders it, but actually gives
it in three distinct forms; twice he speaks of it as " Robert Hodges "f,
once as John Hodgson J, and once as " J. Hodges "§. Nevertheless, his
description of it is of great value. " The letters," he says, " are glazed
over and partly effaced "||. Again, " The letters in the inscription are over-

laid "·[[. In short, the terms he applied to it are still perfectly apposite, and
justify the belief that the inscription is as old as it professes to be. The di-ip
on it at present is somewhat plentiful iu wet weather, and there is no doubt
that calcareous matter is still in course of deposition. Of all the cha-

racters, the terminal 8 in the date is probably most in danger of obliteration.
    It was stated in the Tenth Report (1874) that the exploration of the Cave

of Inscriptions had been completed up to 16 feet from its entrance, when, the
moutb of Clinnick's Gallery being completely exposed, the investigation of
the deposits in the latter branch of the Cavern was undertaken. This, as
already mentioned, was carried on until December 1st, 1874, when the work

in the Cave of Inscriptions was resumed.
    In that portion of this Cave explored in 1 874, the Committee found that there

were no traces of the presence of their predecessors ; that the Granular, or less

ancient, Stalagmitic Floor was everywhere intact and continuous, and the Crys-

tal line, or more ancient, Stalagmite lay beneath it ; that the latter had been

broken by some natural agency, and though in some cases the severed portions

remained in situ, in others they had been removed and Tvere not alwaj^s

traceable ; and that adjacent to the left wall of the Cave a wedge-hke layer of
Cave-earth lay in its proper place between the Stalagmites, and was 6 inches

thick at the wall, but thinned out at about a yard from it, beyond which the

one Floor lay immediately on the other. This continued to be the case to a

large extent for the next 18 feet (that is, up to 34 feet from the entrance), the

only exception being that the broken blocks of Crystalline Stalagmite were

never dislodged beyond being occasionally " faulted " to the extent of 2 or

3 inches. At and beyond 34 feet from the entrance, traces of the earlier

explorers were again met with in almost every part of the Cave, but

were found to be limited to the breaking up of the Stalagmites and of the

Asubjacent deposit to the depth of 12 inches at most.  thin layer of typical

Cave-earth extended throughout the entire Chamber; and it was obvious that

at the time when its deposition commenced the Crystalline Stalagmite did

not exist as a continuous sheet, for in considerable spaces the Cave-earth

lay immediately on the Breccia without any Stalagmite between them.

Though it was not always easy in these cases to determine the exact junction

of the two deposits, there was no doubt that the upper surface of the Breccia

was very uneven when the Cave-earth began to be lodged on it. On the

discovery of objects of interest at or near this doubtful junction, care was

taken to record them as belonging to the " Cave-earth and Breccia," even

though, from their own characters, it was usually easy to refer them to their

proper deposits and eras respectively. Large blocks of limestone, some of

them requiring to be blasted, were numerous in this Cave, both in the Stalag-

mites and below them.

On its excavation being completed, the Cave of Inscriptions was found to

extend upwards of 60 feet from north-east to south-west, 45 feet from south-

east to north-west, and to be upwards of 20 feet high. In the right Avail,

immediately before reaching the Hedges Boss, there is a recess to which the
name of " The Alcove " has been given : another, in the north-western corner,

probably  leads  to  an  external  entrance  to  the  Cavern                                                 in  the  south-west
                                                                                                          :

corner is the mouth of tie long tunnel known as the "Great Oven;" and

adjacent to it is a Gully about 3 feet wide at the entrance, and extending

to an unknown distance but too narrow for exploration beyond a length of

7 feet.

   Two " finds " only were met with in the Granular Stalagmitic Floor : one

(No. 6491) consisted of a few 'bones, including a portion of a large humcras ;
the other (No. 6495) was a very small bone, probably of Bat, with bits of

charcoal and of coprolitc, all lodged in the same hand specimen of Stalagmite,

and found 3rd December, 1875.

The Cave-earth yielded 4 teeth of Hyasna, a few gnawed bones, coprolitcs

on several occasions, and 1 flint flake (No. 6520).

At and near the junction of the Cave-earth and Breccia, where they were

not separated by Stalagmite, 2 right lower jaws and 4 loose teeth of IIya?n;i,

38 teeth of Bear, part of a jaw of Fox, 1 incisor tooth of a small rodent,

numerous bones and fragments of bone, a somewhat large number of copro-

htes, and 1 flint flake were met with. At least, most of the ursine remnius
may be safely referred to the Breccia, whilst all those of the Hj^ajna un-

doubtedly belong to the Cave-earth. One of the Hyoena-jaws just mentioned
                        ON Kent's cavern, DJivoNsmuE.

(No. 6570) contains all its teeth except the inner incisor ; but, as is com-

monly the case with lower jaws of the era of the Cave-earth, it has lost its
lower border and condyles, and is much gnawed. It was found 14th May,

1875, Avith 1 loose canine tooth of the same species, 4 teeth of Bear, and a
few fragments of bone. The other jaw of Hyaena (No. 6577) has lost the

two inner incisor teeth and the condyles, and is slightly gnawed, but is
otherwise entire. It -was found on 24th of the same month, with 1 loose

tooth of Hyajua, 1 of Bear, and a fragment of bone. The flint flake (No.

6582), found 1st June, 1875, probably belonged to the Breccia, but was of

but little importance.

There were found in the Breccia 82 teeth of Bear, some of them in jaws

or parts of jaws ; 2 of Lion, in a portion of right upper jaw ; numerous bones

and pieces of bone, including part of a skull and several other good specimens
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

and 13 implements, flakes, and chips of flint and chert (Nos. 6525, 6532,

6540,  6547,  6550,  6552,  6561,    jioy  « Ay-  6565,  6573,  6581,  and 6590).

                                   «

The Lion's teeth (No. 6518) are the last two molars. The sockets of the

canine tooth and of the small tooth immediately behind it still exist, and

every thing betokens an animal of great size. The specimen, to which a

considerable quantity of the Breccia adheres, is peculiarly interesting as being-

found in a deposit in which careful methodical research, continued for years,

had failed to detect any other osseous remains than those of Bear, with but one

--exception that, as already stated, being also the lower jaw of a Lion,

found less than two months before. This interesting relic was met with on

31st December, 1874, with 2 teeth of Bear, bones and fragments of bone, in

the second foot-level of Breccia. No feline remains have been detected

since that date.

  A few only of the Flint and Chert specimens require detailed description.

No. 6550 js an implement made out of a well-rolled chert nodule. It is

somewhat semilunar in form, but broader at one end than the other, and

measures about 4-4 inches in length, 2-3 inches in greatest width, and

25 inches in greatest thickness, Avhich it attains near the broader or but-end.

It has undergone a considerable amount of chipping, has been reduced to an

irregular edge along the greater part of its perimeter, and is comparatively

thin at the more pointed end. It is very, but \mequally, convex on both

faces, each of which has a central ridge, and retains the original surface of the

nodule over the whole of the but-eud, whence a trace of it extends along the

central ridge of the less convex face to about an inch from the point. The

portion of the surface which has been chipped is of a yellowish hue, derived,

no doubt, from the matrix in which the specimen lay. This, however, is

but a superficial stain, as there are indications of an almost white colour

within. This fine implement was found 15th February, 1875, between the

Hedges Boss and the left wall of the Cave, 36 feet from its entrance, in

the second foot-level below the surface (that is, in the uppermost foot-level

of the Breccia), having no other object of interest near it.

No. 6565 is a chert implement 3-7 inches long, 2-7 inches in greatest

breadth, and 1-7 inch in greatest thickness, which it attains not far from

its centre. It has tmfortunately lost one of its extremities, apparently

broken off whilst the tool was being made. It is very, perhaps equally,

convex on each face, but the centres of convexity are not opposite one

another ; and though obviously made from a nodule, not a flake, no j^art of

Athe original surface remains.     considerable amount of work has been

expended on it, and it has been reduced to an edge all round the perimeter

except at the broken end. The marginal edge is neither keen, nor regular,
--10 REPORT 1875.

nor in the same continuous plane. There can be little doubt that it was
intended to be a somewhat pointed ovoid tool, and that had it been perfected it
would have been more symmetrical in form than the Breccia tools are usually.
Its colour is whiter than that of most of the implements found in the same
deposit, in which respect, as well as in its shape and the absence of any trace
of the original surface, it closely resembles the implement No. 6103, found
in the " Long Arcade," 7th May, 1873, and described in the Ninth Report
(1873). This specimen was met with on 13th Api'il, 1875, in the second
foot-level of the Breccia, without any other object of interest near it, 47 feet
from the entrance of the Cave of Inscriptions.

    No. 6581 is a flint flake, struck from a rolled nodule, round at one end,
abruptly truncated at the other, and reduced to an edge along both lateral
margins. It is 2-2 inches in greatest length, 1-6 inch in greatest width, and
·6 inch in greatest thickness. The inner surface is very irregular ; the outer
has three longitudinal facets ; the lateral margins are somewhat sharp but
slightly jagged as if from use ; both ends are blunt, and the " but " retains the

original surface of the nodule. Its colour is the warm yellow so characteristic

of most of the specimens found in the Breccia ; but there are indications
that the interior is white. It was met with on 29tli Maj-, 1875, in the
second foot-level of the Breccia, 57 feet from the entrance of the Chamber.

   The Gully in the south-west corner of the Cave of Inscriptions, already
mentioned, was so narrow as to render it impossible to excavate the deposits
occupying it in " parallels," " levels," or " yards." The specimens found
in' it, however, were only 2 teeth of Bear, a few pieces of bone, and a

coprolite.

   The earlier explorers had, as usual with them, imperfectly examined the
material they dug up in this branch of the Cavern, and then thrown it on one
side. On taking it to the daylight the Committee found in it 19 teeth of Bear,
12 of Fox (of which 10 occupied portions of three lower jaws), 9 of Hyaena
(two of them being in part of a lower jaw), 2 of Horse, andl'of Rhinoceros, and
a large number of bones (some entire but most of them fragmentary), numerous
coprolites, a fragment of a marine shell, and 6 flakes and chips of flint.

    The exjiloration of the Cave of Inscriptions was completed on 14th June,
1875, having occupied the labour of between 8 and 9 months.

    The following is a list of the specimens found in it in undisturbed ground,
inclusive of those mentioned in the Tenth Report (1874) :

    In the Granular, or least ancient, Stalagmitic Floor : 1 bone of Bat (?), a
few bones, a few patches of coprolite, and a bit of charcoal.

    In the Cave-earth : 27 teeth of Hyaena, several of them in jaws or parts of
jaws ; 11 of Bear ; 1 of a small rodent ; 1 jaw of Fox ; numerous bones and
fragments of bones, of which 6 had been charred and still more had been
gnawed ; a large number of " finds " of coprolites ; and 7 tools, flakes, and
chips of flint and chert.

    In the Breccia : 321 teeth of Bear, some of them in jaws and parts of
jaws ; 2 of Lion, in parts of an upper jaw ; and 20 implements and flakes of
flint and chert.

  --The JRecess. On completing the exploration of the Cave of Inscriptions,

operations were at once commenced in the Recess occupying its north-
western corner, which, as already stated, was expected to lead to a new

--external entrance to the Cavern. The following are the grounds on which

this expectation was founded : At the entrances at present known, on the
 eastern face of the Cavern hill, and termed the " Triangular " and the
ON Kent's cavkkn, uevonshxre.  11

" Arched " entrances, the Cave-earth, or least ancient of the two great
mechanical acciimulations, is at a high level and of great depth. Thence it
slopes rapitUy downwards in all directions open to it, and at the same time
decreases in depth, until reaching the remote end of the " Lecture Hall
towards the south and the bottom of the " Sloping Chamber " towards the

west. From these facts it has been concluded that the Cave-earth entered
the Cavern through the existing and known entrances. Beyond the foot of

the slopes just mentioned, the levels are found to be no longer governed by
the Cave-earth but by the Breccia (that is, the underlying or more ancient
deposit) ; and there is in each case an acclivity, instead of a declivity, on pro-

--ceeding farther and further into the Cavern comparatively sliort and abrupt

from the Lecture Hall to the Water Gallery on the east, but long and gentle
from the Sloping Chamber to the Recess, now under notice, on the west.
These acclivities apparently indicate that the Breccia entered the Cavern
not, like the Cave-earth, through the apertures on the eastern side of the
hill, but through an opening or openings on the western side ; and the same
line of argument points out the Recess in the north-western corner of the
Cave of Inscriptions as more likely than any other part of the Cavern to
lead to such an external entrance. So far as they can be studied, moreover,
its own characters support this hypothesis. The Recess extends in a north-

westerly direction for fully 60 feet, and is of sufficient width for a man to pass

easily ; beyond this its extent is considerable, but at present is too narrow
for any one to examine it. Its Floor, a thick sheet of the Crystalline, or
more ancient. Stalagmite, is abruptly truncated at the junction of the Recess
with the Cave of Inscriptions. Finally, this Floor covered and rested on a
thick mechanical accumulation, which is unmistakable Breccia and reached

a higher level than elsewhere in the Cavern, so far as is known at present.
    The exploration of the Recess was begun on 15th June, 1875; and as it

was decided to leave intact the Stalagmite Floor just mentioned, in fact to
burrow under it, it was necessary to cut the successive " parallels " 5 feet

deep instead of the usual 4, in order to give the men height enough for
working. During the progress of the work a hole was bored through the
Floor overhead, when it was found to be pure Stalagmite, 18 inches thick.

AVhen the excavation had reached a distance of 10 feet, the two walls were
found to be so very nearly together as to render it necessary to abandon the
work, or to break up the Floor and proceed at a higher level. The former
course being, though reluctantly, decided on, the work was suspended on

Gth July, 1875.

    The only objects of interest found here were 2 teeth of Bear, 3 " finds " of
bones, and 1 piece of flint (No. 6590) of no importance.

  --The Alcove. The exploration of the Alcove or recess near the Hedges

Boss, already mentioned, was begun on 7th July, 1875, and finished on 26th

of the same month, or at the end of about 3 Aveeks. When emptied, it proved

to be scarcely lofty enoiigh, from limestone floor to limestone roof, for an

ordii^ary man to stand erect, to measure about 10 feet both from north to

 south and from east to west, to be divided into two compartments, a northern
 and a southern, by a limestone partition extending almost completely across
 it, and to have two entrances from the Cave of Inscriptions. The earlier
 explorers had partially ransacked the northern compartment, but had not
 entered the southern, in which a Floor of Stalagmite almost reached the roof.
 Beneath this Floor, and without any trace of Cave-earth, lay the Breccia,
 never exceeding 3 feet in depth, and resting on the limestone floor.
--12 itEPOii'f 1875.

   39 " finds " of remains of Mammals were met with in the Alcove, iueludirg
59 teeth of Bear (several of the rain portions of jaws), 16 of Fox (all of them

in portions of three lower jaws), 4 of Hytena, numerous bones (including
several good specimens, though all of them were more or less fragmentary),
and 1 coprolite. The teeth of Hyoena, 2 of the jaws of Fox, and the coprolile
were met with at the junction of the northern compartment and the Cave of
Inscriptions, amongst fallen masses of limestone, where neither the character
of the deposits nor the exact position of the spccmiens could he determined.
The remaining jaw of Fox, however (No. GG19), was found in the Breccia
it was broken into two pieces, which lay together and contained 5 teeth.
This specimen, the only known relic of the genus in this old deposit, was
found at the iinicr or eastern end of the southern compartment, in the

second foot-level of Breccia, with remains of Bear, 17th July, 1875. It may
not be out of place to remark that remains of the Common Fox (Canis vulpes)
have been identified among the Mammalian relics from the Forest-bed under-

lying the Boulder-clay on the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk *.
    In proportion to the volume of the deposit it contained, the Alcove was far

richer in osseous remains than any part of the Cave of Inscriptions, of which
it is an adjunct. It is worthy of mention, perhaps, that it contained no

trace of flint or chert.

  --Tlie Great Oven.- The passage or tunnel opening out of the south-west

corner of the Cave of Inscriptions is very long and narrow, and so low that
a considerable portion of it can only be traversed on all-fours or in a crouching
posture. It connects the Cave of Inscriptions with the "Bear's Den," which
the Committee have not yet explored, and has been termed the " Oven,"
partly from its very contracted breadth and height, but mainly because a
 vertical section of a considerable part of it at right angles to its length

closely resembles the small earthenware ovens much used formerly in the

two sotith-western counties. It has received the epithet Great to distinguish
it from a similar but still more contracted tunnel in another part of the
Cavern, and known as the " Little Oven."

    The excavation of the Great Oven was begun 27th July, 1875, and at the.
 end of that month, beyond which this Eeport does not extend, it had been
 completed to 4 ftct from the entrance. Like the Cave of Inscriptions, it
 contains a thin layer of Cave-earth, with Breccia beneath it of unknown

 depth. Two " finds " have been met with in the former, containing 1 tooth

 of Hysena and a few bones ; and 9 in the latter, including 6 teeth of Bear
 and several pieces of bone.

    On studying the osseous remains found by the Committee in the Breccia

 in the various branches of the Cavern they have explored during the last

--twelve months, the following prominent facts arrest attention : Some of the

 teeth of Bear are those of very old animals, and worn almost to the fang,
 such as No. 6597 from the second foot-level, No. 6608 from the second foot-
 level. No. Gull from the fourth foot-level, and No. 6618 from the second
 foot-level, all found in the southern compartment of the Alcove during July
 1875. The jaws, though frequently broken, have never lost their lower

 borders, as is almost uniformly the case with the Cave-earth specimens
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

 and none of the bones appear to have been gnawed. In no instance were
 the bones foitnd lying in their anatomical relations, but different parts of

the skeleton \rere often huddled confusedly together; thus in No. 601,3,
found in the second foot-level in the southern compartment of the Alcove,

loth July, 1875, a canine tooth adheres to one side of the proximal end of a

tibia, and a piece of jaw to another side. Some of the specimens have

fretted surfaces, and appear to have been rolled by running water ; this is
notably the case with Nos. 6608 and 6615, found in the second and first foot- /SJh

levels, in the southern compartment of the Alcove, on 12th and 16th Jul)',

1875, respectively. Many of the bones were broken where they were finally

lodged, and the parts, with little or no displacement, reunited with Stalag-

mitic infiltration ;  as, for example,  Nos.  -g-^Y-g-  and            found  in  the  first

                                                             u-gy-jr,

foot-level in the branch of the Cavern just named, 17th July, 1875. Others

appear to have been flattened and more or less crushed where they lay, of
which there is a striking example in the distal end of a left femur, No. 6530, -.?·??

found in the first foot-level in the Cave of Inscriptions, 34 feet from its

entrance, 12th January, 1875. Occasionally the same rock-like mass of

Breccia contains bones of very different colours ; thus No. 6603 is such a

mass, containing portions of two bones not half an inch apart, each acci-

dentally broken across ; and whilst one is of a creamy whiteness throughout,
the other is a very dark brown, approaching to black. It was found in the

second foot-level in the Alcove, 9th July, 1875. This specimen, by no means

unique, shows that contemporary bones lying side by side may be of very

different colours.

   Nor arc the remains met with in the Cave-earth void of instruction. Up to

the present time, wherever the Cave-earth has been met with, there also have
traces of the Hyaena been found, either in the form of parts of his skeleton,

or his coprolites, or bones scored with his teeth-marks, or jaws divested of
their lower borders, or long bones broken after his well-known and recog-
nizable fashion. But though everywhere preseut in greater or lesser
numbers, these traces became less and less plentiful with increased distance
from the external entrances to the Cavern, and were very " few and far

--between " in the Cave of Inscriptions the Chamber most remote from the

entrances. Whilst the remains of the IIya;na were thus met with wherever
the Cave-earth occurred, they were in the interior accompanied by those of
very few of his contemporaries. Thus, whilst the Chambers adjacent to the
entrances contained teeth and bones of Horse, Bhinoceros, Deer (several
species), Bear, Fox, Elephant, Ox, Lion, Wolf, and Hare, as well as Hyfena
(the latter being far the most prevalent), there have been found during the
last twelve months in the Cave-earth remains of the Hya;na alone. Nor is
it without interest to note the branches of the Cavern in which remains of
the different forms just enumerated were last detected, so far as is at present
known, on the way to the Cave of Inscriptions. The Hare has not been

--found anywhere in the Western Division of the Cavern that of which the

Cave of Inscriptions is the innermost Chamber ; the Badger, Wolf, and Ox

were represented in the " Charcoal Cave," but not beyond it ; and relics of
Horse, Bhinoceros, Deer, Bear, Fox, Elephant, and Lion have not appeared
beyond the Long Arcade.

   Finally, no traces of Muclimroilus have been met with since the incisor
tooth found 29th July, 1872, and described in the Eighth Beport (1872),

presented at Brighton.

    the purpose of investigating the Rate of Increase of Underground

    Temperature downwards in various localities of Dry Land and
   under IVater^-. By Professor Everett, D.C.L., Secretary.

A FEW weeks after the reading of last year's Eeport, another set of observa-

tions was received from ilcssrs. Mauget and Lippmann, the engineers of the
great artesian well now sinking at La Chapelle, Paris. The water had been
undisturbed for a year, this time having been occupied in preparations for
tubing the well through its entire depth.

    The exceptionally rapid increase of temperature in the lower part of the
well, as indicated in the previous observations, had given reason to suspect
that the heat generated by the action of the boring-tool was an important

disturbing element. It is now manifest that this suspicion was correct ; for

the bottom temperature (660 metres deep), which was 83°-25 Fahr. in the
observations of June 1S62, is only 76° Fahr. in the observations of October
1863, or 7j° colder than before. At the depth of 600 metres the tem-
perature was 75°- 8 and 7o°-4 in the two observations of June 1862, and
75° in the observation of October 1863, or about half a degree colder than

before.

   At the depths of 500 metres and 400 metres there was no change ; and
at the depths of 300 metres, 200 metres, and 100 metres there was an
increase amounting to 0°-5 at 300 metres, 0°-8 at 200 metres, and l°-5 at
100 metres.

  --In explanation of the increase at these smaller depths, Messrs. Mauget and

Lippmann remark: "When last year's observations were made the well

had been tubed to the depth of 139-15 metres, but had not been cemented.
Consequently the springs which were met with in the tertiary strata com-
municated at the base of the tubes with the water of the well. Cement has
this year been poured in between all the tubes some days before taking the
temperature of the water. This operation has excluded the tertiary springs
and permitted the water of the well to resume its normal temperature."

   The new temperatui'e 59°-5 at lOO metres, combined with the new
temperature 70° at 660 metres, gives 1° Fahr. for 34 metres, or for 111 feet.

   The old temperature, 58 at 100 metres, combined with the new temperature

76° at 060 metres, gives 1° Fahr. for 31 metres, or for 102 feet.
   The temperature 53°-l in the caves of the Paris Observatory, at tlic

depth of 28 metres, combined with the temperature 76° at 660 metres, gives

1° Fahr. in 27-6 metres, or in 905 feet.
   AU these results differ largely from previous determinations of the rate of

increase in the neighbourhood of Paris, which were very harmonious among
themselves, and gave a rate of 1° Fahr. in 56 feet (see 1871 Eeport).

   The only source of error that appears possible in the La Chapelle observa-
tions is convection by vertical currents in the well. Such action is certainly

favoured by the large dicametcr of the well (1-35 metre at the smallest), and

--may have been further jjromoted by the same cause vehich stopped the works

and rendered tubing necessary namely, caving in.
   Herr Johann Grimm, Director of the School of Mines at Przibram in

Bohemia, has furnished some valuable results from observations made by
himself in the year 1830, and again in 1854-55, in the deepest mines of

that district.

   The observations in 1830 showed a temperature 11°- 9 E. at a depth of
1127-4 Austrian feet, as against a temperature 7°-34 at 66 feet. The dif-
ference here is 4°-56 R. in 1061-4 Austrian feet, or 10°-26 Eahr. in 1100
English feet, which is at the rate of 1° Pahr. in 107 English feet.

   The observations in 1854-55 showed a temperature of 13°-08 R. at a
depth of 1832-3 Austrian feet, as against 7°-05 R. at 66 feet. The dif-
ference here is 6°-03 R. in 1766-3 Austrian feet--that is, 13°-57 Eahr. in
1832 English feet, which is at the rate of 1° Eahr. in 135 English feet.

   The following is a tabular statement of the results obtained at different

depths in the observations of 1854-55 :

levels and places were selected as were far Irom the workings and from all
circumstances which could cause a change of the temperature of the rock.
The temperature was observed on thermometers put in bore-holes of 2 feet
depth, which were bored in idle rock free of any particles of iron pyrites
and far from all lodes. Through the whole time of the experiment, in
summer and winter, the temperature of the rock on each level remained,

excepting only some very small variations, nearly without change.

   " From the Table it will be seen that the increment of heat by descending
in the mines is much smaller than in the mines of other localities. The
reason of it may be looked for in the quality of the rock, which, belonging
to the beds of the Lower Silurian formation, is very quartzose and free of

any particles of iron pyrites.
   " The temperature in the bore-hole remained, by the observations made

throughout the whole year 1830, without a change, as the bore-hole (which

was closed up with a piece of clay) kept always the equal temperature of the
rock. Even in the year 1854-55, when the observations in the higher levels

were repeated and the same bore-holes used, the temperature remained the

same.

   " The shaft-braces of the different shafts differ very little in height, as you

have seen from the sketch sent to you, and all of them are situated on lofty

Myhills.  observations of the increase of heat have aU been made near the

Adalbert shaft, on the different levels ; and tlie difference from the tempera-

ture on the same levels in the other mines can only be trifling."

   These observations appear to be thoroughly reliable, and to prove con-
clusively that the rate of increase in this locality is remarkably slow. Even

after applying a large conjectural correction for tlie convexity of the ground,
as connected with the fact above stated that all the shaft-braces " are situated

on lofty hills," the rate of increase will still remain slower than any that we
have hitherto discussed. From the description of tliis rock, considered in

connexion with the description given of the rocks iu the Mont-Cenis Tunnel

--(1871 Report), it would appear that highly quartzose rock is characteiized

by a slow rate of increase an index probably of high conductivity*.
   Further observations will be taken by Herr Grimm with two thermometers

which have been supplied to him by the Committee. One of them is a

maximum protected Negretti, the other a simple mercurial thermometer

with a large bulb.

   Several insti'umcnts of this latter kind have been constructed for the Com-

mittee during the past year, with a view to observations similar to those

above described by Herr Gi'imm. The objects aimed at in the construction

are, slowness of action, combined with facilitj'^ for reading with quickness

and certainty in a bad light.

It was stated in last year's Eeport that M. E. Sadoine, Director-General of

the mines of the Societe Cocqueril at Seraing, near Liege, had consented to

Ahave observations taken in the mines of that company. Negretti maximum

thermometer was accordingly sent in September 1873, and at a later date

(March 1874) a non-registering unprotected thermometer. The following-

results, obtained with the maximum thermometer, have been communicated

by the chief engineer of the collieries. The observations were made in
December 1873.

   * Added September 1875. This inference as to the high conductivity of quartz, pub-
lished a year ago, is verified by the direct experiments of Professor Herschel (see Eeport
on Conductivity of Rocks in the present volume). Quartz was found to be the best

conductor of all the rocks experimented on.

The site of the two coUieries in question is on the banks of the Mouse. The

observations were made at the bottom of holes 5 centimetres in diameter and

5 metres deep, bored at the ends of galleries 6 feet high and G feet wide,

the material of the rock being coal-schist (des schistes houillers). The ther-

mometer remained in each hole twenty hours. The holes at the depths of

232 metres and 310 metres are almost vertically beneath the bed of the

river. The hole at the depth of 505 metres is about 900 metres from the

river. The coal-bearing strata are covered with 8 or 10 metres of gravel, in

which the bed of the river is contained.

Comparing the first and last of the above observations, we have an

increase of 10° Fahi-. in 273 metres, which is at the rate of 1° Fahr. in

27-3 metres, or in 90 feet.

The temperature of the ground near the surface can be approximately

inferred from Quetelet's observations at Brussels, which is about 50 miles

distant from Seraing, and about 10 miles further north. Quetelet found the

ground, both at the depth of 12 feet and of 24 feet, to have a mean annual

temperature of 12° Cent., or 53°-6 Fahr. If we accordingly assume at

Seraing a temperature 54° Fahr. at the depth of 5 metres, we have, by com-

parison with the temperature 87° at 505 metres, an increase of 33° in 500

metres, which is at the rate of 1° Fahr. in 15-2 metres, or in 50 feet.

It was mentioned in the 1872 Report that four thermometers had been

Asent to the School of Mines at BaUarat, Australia.         communication has

recently been received from the Vice-President (his Honour Judge llogers),

enclosing a report of observations taken at Clunes, in the mine of the IS^ew

North Clunes Company, by Mr. John Lewis (the Company's general manager),

and promising a report of observations from the Stawell Mine by an early

mail. Both mines are about 1000 feet deep.

Mr. Lewis's observations were taken in twelve bore-holes, each 3 feet

deep, which were fiUed with water four or five hours previousl)'^, aud the

thermometer (a large non-registering mercury thermometer) was allowed to

remain in the hole for thirty minutes before reading. The depths from the

surface of the ground vary from 160 feet to 1015 feet. It appears that

sufficient precautions were not taken to exclude atmospheric influences, by

plugging the holes aud avoiding places where the currents of ventilation were

strong. The temperatures recorded in all the bores, except one, aj^pcar to

be thus vitiated, and are very variable from time to time.

The one bore to which these remarks do not apply is designated " bore

No. 10," is at a depth of 790 feet from the surface, and is described as

" being in a cross cut without any circulation of air." The temperatures

observed in it, in the four observations recorded, were 72°-6, 72°-5, 72°-5,

and 72°-5, the temperature of the air in its vicinity being 73°- 6, 73°, 73°,
and 73°.

Mr. Symons has furnished additional observations made at the depth of

1000 feet in the Kentish-Town well, but recommends that their publication

be deferred for the present, as better observations are expected during the

ensuing year. The hut which covers the well has been repaired, and the

in order.

In answer to an application addressed to the director of the School of

Mines at Schemuitz, in Hungary, a letter was received, under date Novem-

ber 1873, from Herr E. Poschl,  Counsellor    of Mines,  and Professor of
                                                                                                                                            _

Mining Mechanics and DraAvings (the director being absent), requesting

Athat thermometers might be sent.  second letter was received from the

same gentleman, dated December 26, 1873, acknowledging the safe arrival

of the thermometers (one a Negretti maximum protected, the other non-

registering and unprotected), and stating that the observations would at

once be commenced, under the direction of a joint committee of professors of

the Mining Academy and members of the Directory of Mines.

 --Professor Henry, of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, wrote,

under date February 3, 1874 : " You wiU oblige us by sending us three

sets of guarded registering thermometers, suitable for observations of tem-

Weperature of artesian wells of a diameter of 3 inches.  learn that there

are in the vicinity of Chicago sixty wells varying from 500 feet to 1500

feet in depth, included within an area of six miles square. Their elevation

above the level of Lake Michigan, as well as the quahty of the water they

Wefurnish, are very nearly alike.  shall send a set of these instruments to

a trustworthy engineer of Chicago." . . .

   In accordance with this request, three protected maximum thermometers

have been sent.

   No successful observation has yet been made in the Sub-Wealden bore
nor in the well at Witham. No report has been received fi-om Harwich,

from Anziu, from the Hoosac Tunnel, nor from the Mont-Cenis Tunnel.
   As regards the St.-Gothard Tunnel, the absence of Professor Ansted has

hitherto delayed the caiTying out of the resolution adopted by the General

Committee last year (see Report for 1873, p. Iviii, last paragraph) ; but

action will probably be taken very speedily.

At the Bradford Meeting of the Association the Committee on Zoological
Stations was able to report (see Association Reports, 1873, page 408) that

tlie buHding of the Zoological Station at Naples had been completed ; but it was
naturally obliged rather to describe the arrangements made for carrying out
the objects of the Station than to dwell on the work which had been actually

done.

   The present Committee, however, can now congratulate the Association

that, during the two years which have elapsed since the Bradford Meeting, a
scientific undertaking of cosmopolitan character, hi which the Association

has taken a lively interest, and which it has in so many ways assisted, has
proved an undeniable, indeed it might be said a brilliant success. The actual

difficulties and obstacles have, no less through the great energy of Dr. Dohrn
than through the help afforded him from time to time, been overcome ; and
the future of the Station seems in every way bright and iiromising.

   The facts which form the subject of the present lleport will best be con-
sidered under distinct heads :

    1. Tlie Nature and Extent of the ivorhing accommodation at the Station.

   At the present time there are in the Station twenty-one working-tables,
the number of which will by the end of the year be increased to twenty-four

of these no less than seventeen are already occupied or bespoken.

   Each table is in itself a condensed laboratory ; and the nature of the ac-
commodation offered by the Station to any investigator will perhaps best be
shown by the following extract from the form of contract between Dr. Dohrn
and the hirer of the table.

inquirer nominated to occupy it after the interval of a week from the an-
nouncement of his coming.

   The Station also possesses :

  Aa. number of special instruments and pieces of apparatus which arc not

in general use, but only required occasionally. These accordingly are not
supplied to each table, but are regarded as belonging to all the tables in
common.

    Microscopes are not provided, it being supposed that each investigator
will possess an instrument of his own, to the use of which he is accustomed.

   h. Each working-table is provided with a number of working experi-
mental aquaria, and with a constant stream of sea- water ; these are entirely

at the disposal of the occupant of the table for his investigations.

   c. The animals serving as materials for study are provided by the Station,
and as constant a supply as circumstances will admit is kept up during the
investigation. Not only so, but the occupant of the table can, if he pleases,
take home with him, on his departure from Naples, a number of scientifically
preserved specimens, to enable him to comjjlete or continue his research.

   The extent of this supply of animals is of course dependent on the variety
(or abundance) of the specimens and the concurrent demands of otlier

investigators.

   d. The large aquarium of the Station can be used freely by the occupants

of tables for suitable purposes; for instance, for the study of the habits of
animals.

of tables. There is also a separate room for making extracts and pre-
paring MSS.

   /. The laboratory is open at 7 a.m. in summer and 8 a.m. in winter.
In particular cases special arrangements can be made for access at unusual

hours ; but the staff cannot undertake to have the Laboratory cleaned before
the above-mentioned times.

   g. Any occupant of a table is free to accompany and take part in tlio
fishing- and dredging-expeditions of the Station. He may thus learn the use

of the dredge and the towing-net and the other means employed for pro-

curing specimens.

   h. The cost of the ordinary wear and tear of the instruments and appa-
ratus is borne by the Station to the extent of 20 francs. Damages to a greater
extent than this must "be paid for by the occupant of the table.

   The working-tables thus equipped and disposed in several rooms constitvite
the Laboratory of the Station ; and of these, of course, the interest and im-
portance are purely and exclusively scientific.

   The large aquarium on the ground-floor has, on the other hand, a double
function. It is partly a popular exhibition, and the payments of visitors consti-

tute a not inconsiderable and, it is to be hoped, an increasing item in the in-
come of the Station. It serves also as a large field of observation for scientific
investigators desirous of learning something about the habits of animals.

   When our great ignorance on this subject is considered, in relation to the

morphological importance with which the theory of natural selection and
descent has invested even apparently small details of the working of animal
economies, the large aquarium may, after all, seem no less a laboratory than

the working-table.

   It will of course be understood that the general public, who are admitted
on payment to view the large aquarium, are carefully excluded from the

laboratories proper, though the occupants of tables in the latter have free
access to the former.

   The staff of the Station consists of :
    a. Dr. Dohrn, the general director.
   h. Dr. Eisig, who has direct command of the laboratory, and whose duty

it is to superintend all the arrangements of the tables, to arrange for the
providing of the material, and to preside over the distribution of instruments
and reagents. In Dr. Dohrn's absence Dr. Eisig acts as his substitute.

    There are also two other scientific assistants, one to superintend the large
aquarium and the fishing, the other to arrange for the collection and pre-
servation of animals for the use of the Station or for distribution abroad.

    c. Three engineers, four house servants, and four fishermen.
    Such are the general arrangements of the Station for scientific work ; and
your Committee can report (from the personal experience of two of their
number during the past winter) that these arrangements are carried out in
a thoroughly satisfactory manner.

                                                                          facilities,

 --a. Investigations into the morphology and emhryology of Marine Animals.

It is needless to say much on this poiat. The advantages, first, of an

organization to secure the animals which it is desired to study, and, secondly,
of a laboratory in which to work on the animals thus obtained, are too

obvious to require pointing out.
--32 REPORT 1875.

   We might, however, remark, as a caution, that the Station cannot provide

marine animals which do not visit the neighbourhood of Naples ; and more-
over, seeing the strange coming and going of particular forms at various
times, cannot undertake to provide certain animals at all times.

   For instance, the investigator who desires to study Pijrosoma must visit

Naples at the same time as does the object of his study, otherwise it will be
impossible for the Station to procure him living examples.

  --b. Physiological investigation of Marhie Animals. This branch of study,

little worked at present, will probably afford rich results in the future.

  --c. Study of the liahits of Marine Animals. Of the importance of this wo

have already spoken,

  --d. Systematic investigation of the Marine Fauna and Flora of the Medi-

terranean in tJie vicinity of Naples.. In spite of all that has been done in

this direction much yet remains to be done. Possibly few tasks seem more

promising than a thorough systematic and long-continued dredging of the
Bay of Naples and the sea around. The results of such an inquiry would be
valuable not only to the systematic zoologist and to the student of the
distribution of animal life, but also indirectly to the morphologist and to the

Station, as affording certain information as to where and when particular
animals may be obtained, and an exact knowledge of the geneiic and specific

nomenclature of the forms studied.

    On this head we might call attention to the interesting problems connected

with the periodic appearance and disappearance of certain animals in shoals

--or large numbers problems which have already attracted the notice of the

residents at the Station, and which can only be successfully attempted by
long-continued observations at the same place.

    Animal forms naturally occupy the chief attention at the Station, but no less
facilities are offered for the study of marine vegetable forms. This is suffi-
ciently indicated by the fact that Prof. Cohn, of Breslau, and Dr. Reineke are
about to visit the Station next session to carry on algological researches.

   e. The Station offers also no mean opportunities for the physical inves-

tigation of the sea in the neighbourhood of Naples.

 --/. Experiments on breeding and preserving delicate Marine Organisms

in a healthy vigorous condition. This subject has already, since the Brad-
ford meeting, especially engaged the attention of Dr. Dohrn ; his results,
however, are not as yet sufficiently definite to enable him to draw up his

promised report, though we hope that it will be ready at the next Meeting of

the Association.

  --g. Transmission of specimens to investigators at home. Already this work

has been carried on, though at present on a small scale. Various inves-
tigators have received supplies of animals carefully preserved for the purposes
of research. It is proposed, as soon as the fishing arrangements have become
more complete, to develop largely this special activity of the Station, so that

investigators at home and the authorities of museums may be able to obtain
such animals as they may desire in a perfect condition with great ease and at

a low price ; in fact, at what is to the Station cost price,

   Since the opening of the Station in the early part of 1874 no less than
33 investigators have made use of the Station, the stay of each varying from
a few weeks to several months, and some of them having visited the Station

during both years.

Naturally many of the researches undertaken by these gentlemen, espe-

cially those made during the past winter, have not        yet  been                                                         published                                     it is
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

therefore impossible to give any thing like a fair statement of the scientific

results of the Station. It would be useless to give a list of those memoirs
which have up to the present moment been published, and it would be

invidious to pick out any for special comment ; but we may say that among

the researches, both published and unpublished, are some of very high bio-
logical importance, such as would alone justify the application of the word

success to the Station.

   Next winter Dr. Dohrn proposes to begin a series of annual accounts of
the work done at the Station ; in fact a sort of scientific almanack of the

place, so that the actual research achieved may be made known to all.

                       4, TJie present ivants of the Station.

The large aquarium pays fairly well as a popular exhibition. Since the

guide-books have admitted it into their list of things worth seeiug at Naples,
the number of foreign visitors, English, German, and Russian, has been
steadily increasing. Nevertheless the receipts from this source can never be
Alooked upon as a main or a stable source of income.                European war or
man epidemic of cholera would in such a case at once put the Station

jeopardy.      money  paid  by  Governments,  Universities,    and   other i· nsti-i.tut·ions
    It is the

for the command of the laboratory tables which is to be regarded as the

real income.                                     and      Dr.  Dohrn                                                               , ,,                                   -. .

   Of the total 24 tables, 17 are already let ;                                                                             calculates                                    that

scientific work, and is offering unusual advantages for research to Bntish no

less than to German investigators, we may perhaps conclude our Report by

suggesting to the consideration of the Association whether it would not be
fairly within the scope of its action to undertake the hire of one of these
tables. ] t must be remembered that in this country the University of Cam-
bridge is the only body which is in direct relation with the Station. That
University occupies two tables, which it has placed, and naturally will continue
to place, at the disposal of its o^rn alumni. Hence any British naturalist not
belonging to the University of Cambridge, and not able to bear of himself the
expense of a taKe, cannot enjoy the opportunities offered by the Station.

An equivalent to a grant of .£75 per annum would remove the great dis-

advantage ; and we venture to suggest the funds of the Association could not

be more profitably sferii as far as biological research is concerned.

Re2)orf of a Committee, consisting o/E. C. C. Stanford^ James Dewar^
   Alfred E. Fletcher, awcf Alfred H. Allen {Secretary) , appointed
    to inquire into the Methods employed in the estimation of Potash and
   Phosphoric Acid in Commercial Products and on the mode of stating
   the results. Drawn up by Alfred H. Allen.

The Committee was of opinion that the objects for which it was appointed

would be best attained by ascertaining as fully as possible the details of the
methods of examining phosphates and potash salts in general use, and
learning the opinions of the chemists employing them as to their special
advantages and limits of error, at the same time collecting information on

other closely related matters.

    With the view of carrying out these intentions to the fullest possible
extent, the Committee issued a circular letter setting forth its aims and
objects, and sent it to every member of the Chemical Society, to all gentlemen
known to be interested in the subject, and to such chemists as your Com-
mittee learnt would be likely to aflbrd assistance.

    The following is the letter referred to :

                                                                                               " No. 1 Surrey Street,

      -- May 10, 1875.

    " Sir, At the last Meeting of the British Association, a Committee, con-
sisting of Messrs. J. Dewar, A. Fletcher, E. C. Stanford, and myself as
Secretary, was appointed, 'for the purpose of examining and reporting upon
the Methods employed in the estimation of Potash and Phosphoric Acid in
commercial j^roducts, and on the mode of stating the results.'

    " The Committee proposes to ascertain, by inquiry, what methods are in
general use, and to learn the opinions of the Chemists employing them as to
their special advantages and limits of error, and also to collect information
on other closely related matters.

    '· The Committee hopes to be enabled to recommend one or two accurate and
practical processes for the estimation of Phosphoric Acid and Potash in
commercial products which would meet with very general adoption by
Chemists, and would be welcomed by both buyers and sellers as a perfectly
neutral standard of reference. Such a plan, we believe, would do much to
secure uniformity in such estimations and in the methods of stating the results.

    " If you have experience in this description of analysis, you will much aid

the Committee by filling up the accompanying paper, and returning it to mo

at your earliest convenience.

   "A similar paper has been sent to all the Fellows of the Chemical Society ;
but if you know any other Chemists, whose advice and opinion would be of
service to the Committee, we shall esteem it a favour if yoa will kindly
send me their names.

                                               " I have the honour to be,

    Together with the above circular letter, the Committee forwarded the
following series of very carefully arranged questions, with the view of indi-
cating the exact nature of the information they were in need of.

of the process you habitually employ
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I

      would be likely to be of service ?

16. Write here your name and address, and

       please state quahfications or nature of
       any appointment.

   Ko effort has been spared to make the objects of the Committee widely-

known, and nearly a thousand circulars hare been distributed.
   In the case of chemists kno'n'n to have special knowledge of the subjects

on which information was desired, the circulars were accompanied by
manuscript letters from the Secretary requesting careful consideration of

and full replies to the queries.
    In answer to their request for information, the Committee has received

contributions from a considerable number of chemists, both in England and
on the Continent, the answers in many cases containing much original
information, and being generally of the utmost value in enabling the Com-
mittee to form an opinion on the present state of the questions which it was
appointed to consider and report on.

   On receipt of the replies, a firrther correspondence was in many cases

entered into by the Secretary, with the view of obtaining explanation of or
further information upon doubtful points, and every means has been taken

to elicit the views of correspondents.

   The following is an alphabetically arranged list of chemists to whom the

Committee is indebted for information:

G. Beeeand, Ph.D. Manager of TJnited Chemical Works of Leopoldshall.

   It will be observed that in almost every case the replies have been from
chemists having special experience in the analysis of commercial phosphates or
potash salts ; and their communications contain, in the aggregate, an amount
of information on the subject probably far in excess of any previously collected.

   With a few notable exceptions the Committee has received assistance from
all the best known authorities on the subject ; a few of the leading chemists
known to have special experience of the kind required have not responded
to the Committee's request for information, though their assistance was most
courteously sought by a special letter in each case.

   The cause of the silence observed in the above mentioned cases is probably
similar to that which prompted the following reply from a well-known firm
of chemists, whoso results were in some degree the cause of the appointment

of the Committee.

" Dear Sir, "We are in receijDt of your favour relating to the examination of

phosphates and potash salts; but we must decline to give you the information

required, as we do not think ourselves called upon to publiah our methods of

  A French chemist of very high standing says he belongs to that class of

chemists who cannot afford to work " pour la gloire," but must keep their

methods, their only capital, secret.
   It is evident that the interests of science would materially suffer if a

similar system were adopted by many chemists ; but happily the above

answers stand in striking contrast to the generous and elaborate replies that

have in very many instances been sent to the Committee.
   The answers received to the various specific questions put have shown in

a very striking manner how very various and even irreconcilable are the
opinions held by chemists on many of the points submitted for their con-
sideration. On this account the Committee refrains for the present from

expressing any definite opinions on the points in question ; but feeling that

the communications received contain much information which should be at

once in the possession of those interested, it begs here to submit to the
Association the following digest of the replies received up to the present

time.

    The Committee has avoided as far as possible any specific mention of the
sources of the various items of information, but has departed from this rule
in cases in which the value of the information would have been seriously
diminished if the authority on which it was quoted had not been given.

                                              Phosphoeic Acid.

                    Solution of tJie Manure and separation of Silica,

   In the case of soluble phosphates treatment with cold water, with (in
some cases) subsequent washing with hot water, seems universal. Most
chemists prefer to lake a considerable quantity of the manure, and grind it

with small successive quantities of cold water in a mortar. An aliquot part

of the filtered solution is taken for analysis.

   With but one or two exceptions, h3rdrochloric acid is universally employed

for effecting the solution of insoluble phosphates *.

   In the great majority of cases they then recommend evaporation to com-
plete dryness. Some operators omit this step as a rule, but classify it among
the precautions necessary when great accuracy is required. The effect of

evaporation to dryness is considered to bo twofold ; silica is rendered
insoluble and fluorides are decomposed with volatilization of hydrofluoric

acid or of fluoride of silicon. The residue is next treated with hydrochloric
acid in the ordinary manner, and the insoluble silica filtered offf.

   * It is evident that the addition of a few drops of nitric acid is desirable here to insure

the complete peroxidation of any ferrous compounds which may be present.
   t It is evident that iu presence of fluorides the silica here found will not strictly

represent the quantity originally present in the sample.

                                                 Oxalic-Acid Metliod.

    Of the chemists whose processes of analyzing phosphates have been com-
municated to the Committee, a decided majority precipitate the phosphoric
acid as the double phosphate of magnesium and ammonium, after previously

separating the calcium as oxalate.

    Although there is no great diiference in the general outline of the method
followed, the most extraordinary variations occur in the details of the
instructions, and in the precautious recommended to insure accuracy.

    By far the greater number of chemists precipitate the calcium as oxalate"
after neutralization of the excess of acid. Some add citric acid prc-siously to
employing oxalate of ammonium. According to Mr. K. Wariugton this

modification " occasions a deficiency of lime, oxalate of calcium being soluble

in citrate of ammonium." Those chemists who add citric acid before pre-

cipitating the calcium usually employ an acetate to get rid of free mineral

acid. Of course, the addition of citric acid then becomes a necessity when

iron and aluminium are present, unless the precipitated phosphates of these
metals are filtered ofl;' and estimated separately. This plan appears to have
several advantages, and is recommended by some chemists of wide experience.

By employing it, the phosphates of iron and aluminium (by most chemists

believed to have a very limited manurial value) are separately estimated, and
the subsequent addition of citric acid is rendered unnecessary and the iron
introduced by its use avoided.

    If the phosphates of iron and aluminium are not previousl}? separated, the
general plan is to neutralize the solution with ammonia till a slight turbidity
ensues, to clarify the liquid by the addition of a few drops of oxalic acid, to

add a moderate excess of ammonium oxalate, to heat the liquid nearly to
boiling, and to filter off the precipitated oxalate of calcium. Some chemists

filter again after cooling.
   After careful washing of the precipitate, the filtrate is usually concentrated,

Aa moderate quantity of citric acid added and then excess of ammonia.

precipitate may here occur of silica, fluoride of calcium, or oxalate of calcium.
The more careful analysts leave the solution for a time to make sure that

the liquid remains clear, or to filter from any precipitate.

                         Precipitation hy Magnesia.

The clear solution is next precipitated by " magnesia mixture," which is

universally admitted to be better made with chloride than with sulphate of

magnesium. It is also clearly proved and generally recognized that a large

excess of the precipitant should be avoided, some chemists recommending a

preliminary analysis of the sample with the view of adding the approximately

theoretical quantity of solution. On the other hand, it has been proved that

complete precipitation is very slow except in presence of a considerable excess

of " magnesia mixture."

Very great variation occurs with respect to the concentration and tem-

Aperature of the solution at the time of precipitation.  few chemists recom-

mend precipitation in a hot solution, but the majority direct precipitation in

the cold ; one or two recommend the use of a dilute solution, while others

concentrate, if necessary, to a certain bulk ; and some make a correction for

the solubility of the double phosjjhate in the liqiiid.

The amount of free ammonia present during the precipitation varies

from a moderate excess to one fifth of its bulk of the strongest ammoniat

(·880).
--30 REPORT 1875.

The time allowed for precipitation varies from ten minutes (with vigorous

stirring) to twenty-four hours ; but most chemists are of opinion that six or

eight hours are sufficient.

Very few chemists recommend re-solution and re-precipitation of the

double phosj)hate.

Eut few precautions appear to be taken in the ignition of the precipitiitc.

The more careful analysts thoroughly dry the precipitate and remove it from

the filter, igniting it first gently, then intensely.

Very different opinions are held as to the accuracy of the results obtained

by precipitation with magnesia. In many cases the obseiTers are merely

able to say that the process gives fairly constant results on repetition ; in

other cases they state that very concordant results have been obtained when

the same sample has also been analyzed by some chemist of repute.

In some cases the observers consider that the process is liable to give

results somewhat below the truth, owing to the slight solubility of the

double phosphate in the mother-liquid and the loss of phosphate in the

oxalate-of-calciura precipitate. lu other cases the process is said to give

results in excess of the real amount, owing to the presence of other magne-

sium salts or of iron or aluminium in the double phosphate precipitate.

  A most elaborate series of experiments has been made by Mr. T. E.

Ogilvie on the magnesia process and the variations to which it is liable *.

His resiilts have been to a great extent confirmed by the researches of Mr,

MyE. M. Dixon. On the other hand, Professor Church writes, "  confidence

in this plan when carried out successfully, giving time for any oxalate to

fall after addition of citric acid and excess of ammonia, is not shaken by

Ogilvie's results reported recently in the ' Chemical News.' His experiments

seem to me to exaggerate the errors of the method greatly. Several times

have I got nearly identical results by the use of the molybdic method for

separating the P^ 0^ from the soluble part of a superphosphate, and by the

use of the oxalic method. I always use a measured quantity of the am-

moniacal magnesium chloride ; but considerable excess of this reagent often

--produces but little influence on the result sometimes none."

                                         Direct Citnc-Ackl Method.

   The method of Joulie is employed by some chemists of wide experience.
In this i^rocess the iron, aluminium, and calcium are all retained in solution
by citrate of ammonium, and no attempt is mado to separate the calcium as
oxalate ; but the phosphate is at once precipitated from the ammoniacal
solution by " magnesia mixture," the precipitate being cither ignited and
weighed or dissolved in acetic or nitric acid and the solution titrated with
uranium. This method is in 'many respects similar to that recommended by
rreseuius, Neubaucr, and Luck f.

                                                 Iron-Acetate Ilethod.

  A few chemists employ a process of which the following is an outline :

   The neutralized hydrochloric solution of an insoluble phosphate (freed
from silica), or the aqueous solution of a soluble phosphate, is treated with
acetate of ammonium (filtered from the precipitated phosphates of iron and
aluminium if their separate estimation is required) and sufficient ferric

chloride added to cause the precipitate to appear distinctly reddish. The
liquid is boiled, well filtered, and the precipitate washed slightly. It is
redissolvcd on the filter in hydrochloric acid, tartaric or citi'ic acid added
judiciously to the solution, and then a tolerable excess of ammonia. The
alkaline sohftion should be greenish, not reddish. " Magnesia mixture " is
then added in moderate excess, the liquid stirred and left over night. The
precipitated double phosphate is then filtered off and treated in the ordinary

manner. The method gives results agreeing well with the average of

chemists of repute. On repetition, the results of the two estimations agree

4within to -2 per cent.

        Phosjpiates of Iron and Aluminium.

The precipitate of iron and aluminium phosphates, produced by treating

the cold solution of a sample containing the above metals with an alkaline

acetate (or with ammonia and excess of acetic acid), can be very con-

--veniently analyzed by the following method, contributed by Mr. H. Waring-

ton : " The precipitated phosphates of iron and aluminium are washed,

ignited, and weighed, redissolved in strong hydrochloric acid, and the iron

determined volumetrically with stannous chloride and iodine (see Fresenius).

Erom the iron the quantity of ferric phosphate in the precipitate is cal-

culated, the phosxihate of aluminium found by difi'erence, and thus the iron,

Aaluminium, and phosphoric acid in the precipitate are obtained.  little

phosphoric acid is liable to be removed from the precipitate during washing,

and basic salts are thus reckoned in the calculation as of normal composi-

tion."

        Estimation hy Uranium.

   The removal of iron and aluminium by addition of an alkaline acetate in
the cold, with determination of the phosphoric acid in the filtrate by means
of uranium *, is a method which appears to deserve more extended employ-
ment. The use of an acetate in a slightly acid solution brings the liquid
into just the condition required for the use of the uranium process. The
volumetric estimation by uranium is very highly spoken of by some chemists
as convenient and fairly accurate, while others consider it very unsatisfactory.
The conflict of opinion is very great, and special experiments on this process
appear desirable ; but the following seem to be the precautions necessary for

successful working.

    The proportions of acetic acid and alkaline acetate employed and the
volume of the solution should be approximately constant. The uraniimi
nitrate should be standardized with an acetic-acid solution of pm-e precipi-
tated ammonio-magnesium phosphate or tricalcic phosphate, instead of with
phosj)hate of sodium as is commonly done.

    The titration should be converse, the solution of the phosphate being added
to that of the uranium. The latter should be mixed with a constant
proportion of acetic acid and heated on a bath of boiling water. The
indicator should be powdered potassium ferrocyanide on a white plate.
Owing to the reversal of the usual process, the brown colour of the ferro-
 cyanide of uranium becomes gradually fainter till the end of the titration.

    This method, which is recommended and employed by some authorities of

 great experience, is said to be capable of giving results of every desirable

 accuracy.

   * It is universally admitted that the estimation by uranium is untrustworthy unless
any iron or aluminium present in the original solution is first removed.
32 REPORT-- 1875.

    The gravimetric method of precipitation by nitrate of uranium is employed
by a few chemists, and is very well spoken of.

                                            Molyhdic-Acid Method.

    Of all methods, Sonnenschein's process of precipitation with molybdic acid
appears to be I'egarded as the most accurate. All the chemists who refer to
it speak of it as extremely accurate, and consider that it is preferable to any
other in presence of much iron or aluminium ; but comparatively few use it
habitually. The causes of this unpopularity are the time required and the

expensive nature of the reagent.

    As a very large excess of molybdic acid is required above that which is
actually precipitated as " phospho-molybdate of ammonium," it becomes
an important matter to recover the molybdic acid from the solution. Unfor-
tunately no very simple process of effecting this appears to have been

devised.

   The yeUow precipitate obtained, containing as it does less than four per
cent, of anhydrous phosphoric acid, becomes very bulky and unmanageable
when the weight of phosphoric acid present exceeds -1 or -2 gramme. This
fact necessitates the employment of very small quantities of the phosphate
and as the yellow precipitate has to be subsequently redissolved and

precipitated with magnesia mixture in the ordinary way, the error liable to
occur from the use of an unusually small weight of the sample, together
with the loss of time and expense incident to the use of the process, seem to
have combined to render the method unijopular for every-day work *, while

its value is generally admitted when the above considerations are of secondary

importance.

   J. Macagno has veiy recently proposed to reduce the yellow precipitate
with zinc and acid, and titrate the solution so obtained with standard

permanganate. The test experiments show a maximum error of '5 per cent.

of the phosphoric acid present.

                                   Eggertz^s Molyhdic-Acid Metliod.

   Metallurgial chemists are well aware that M. Eggcrtz has proposed to
weigh the yellow precipitate of phospho-molybdate of ammonium instead of
redissolving it and converting it into ammouio-phosphate of magnesium in

the ordinary manner.
   The modified plan has the advantage of speed ; and the fact that the

precipitate contains less than four per cent, of phosphoric anhydride would
render the results extremely accurate.

    Unfortunately it seems improbable that the precipitate has a constant
composition ; and any sensible variation in the proportion of phosphoric acid
contained in it would render it worthless as a method of estimation, at least
as far as manures arc concerned.

   M. Eggcrtz estimates the anhydrous phosphoric acid contained in the yel-
low precipitate, obtained under the conditions prescribed by him, at 3-72 per

cent.

  --* Mr. A. Sibson writes : " The molybdlc-acid process is, in my opinion, not suitable

for pbospbatic minerals, altbougli invaluable for soils, limestones, &c. containing small

proportions only of pbosplioric acid. The large excess of molybdic acid necessarily
employed in the former case is itself a source of error with no adequate advantage,
inasmuch as the magnesia precipitate has still to be employed ; and it is in the manipula-

tion of this precipitate that the differences in analyses chiefly arise."

                                                       Other Methods.

   Besides the above-described processes, and trifling modifications of them,
descriptions have been received of no other method. The lead, bismuth, and
tin processes appear to have fallen into complete disuse. K^o chemist has
reported that he precipitates phosphoric acid as tricalcic phosphate by direct
addition of ammonia to the original solution.

                   '^Reduced" Phosphates.

Of all the chemists who have communicated with the Committee, only two

consider that the so-called "reduced" phosphates can be estimated even

approximately by any known method.

One of these writes as follows :

" I employ a process based on the read)' decomposition of gelatinous phos-

phate of lime by oxalate of ammonia *, and the almost complete inaction on

the mineral phosphate by the same salt. Although not an exact process, it

gives good approximate results within g per cent. ; and seeing the urgent
need for some such means of estimation, more especially in the case of bone-

manures, in which a large proportion of decomposed phosphate may exist

imrecognizable by the ordinary soluble phosphate determination, I think it

better to employ even an imperfect process than to classify such decomposed

phosphate with undecomposed mineral phosphate."

Professor A. H. Church, referring to the bicarbonate-of-sodium method

described in his 'Laboratory Guide 'f, writes, " It is the only method giving

approximate results."

  A series of highly instructive experiments on the estimation of " reduced "

phosphates has been contributed by Mr. M. J. Lansdell.

   With the oxalate-of-ammonium method of Mr. Alfred Sibson J, and with
the bicarbonate method (which was first described by Mr. Chesshire §), Mr.

Lansdell obtained the following results, the samples being all passed

through the same sieve and the proportions employed being the same as

those recommended by the authors.

   The above results show that neither method is at all satisfactory ; and Sir,
John Hughes* has made experiments leading to the same conclusion.

   Another correspondent writes, " There is no reliable process known for the
estimation of ' reduced phosphates ' under all circumstances. Even the
citrate-of-ammonium method (which seems to be the one generally preferred)

utterly fails to distinguish between 'reduced phosphate' and the native

phosphate of aluminium known as 'Redonda phosphate,' the latter being

largely soluble in the citrate-of-ammonium solution ; so that the latter, which is
a comparatively cheap material, if introduced into a superphosphate, would,
according to the results obtained by the methods usually employed for esti-

mating reduced phosphates, be quoted as the latter."
    Mr. T. L. Patterson has criticised the citrate-of-ammonium method in a

paper contributed to the ' Chemical News' f.

   Mr. W. Galbraith makes the following remarks on the estimation of

" reduced phosphate " :

  --" It seems to me that an arbitrary method of determining these phosphates

would serve every purpose that is, provided there is a necessity for deter-

mining them (from a commercial point of view), which I am inclined to

dispute ; because any other phosphate in as fine a state of division as these
'reduced phosphates ' is of equal value ; and if (as some chemists maintain)
these ' reduced phosphates ' consist principally of phosphates of iron and
aluminium, they cannot and should not be reported as, or assumed to be,

phosphate of calcium.

    " It is well known that the presence of oxide of iron and aluminium is
the cause of the manure ' going back.' Superphosphates containing no iron
and aluminium do not ' go back ; ' so that the manufacturer has the remedy

--in his own hands to avoid using mineral phosphate containing iron and

 aluminium.

    " At present a manufacturer who makes his manure from a phosphate
containing iron and aluminium, and who sells it immediately after maniifac-
ture, has a decided advantage over another manufacturer who has made his
manure from a phosphate containing no iron and aluminium, because a
mineral phosphate containing iron and aluminium is much cheaper than

 one free from those substances. Besides, the iron and aluminium are
 almost invariably stated in the analysis of a mineral phosphate, while

 those substances are seldom if ever mentioned in the analysis of a super-

 phosphate.
     " I do not think it advisable (even if possible) to determine the actunl

 amount of ' reduced phosphates ; ' but an arbitrary method, or a method of
 determining phosphates of a given fineness, which would include ' precipi-
 tated phosphates,' would, I think, be very serviceable ; and such a process

 could be easily devised."

Statement of the Commercial and Afirieultural Value of Manures.

   "Without exception, all the chemists who reply to this question are of

opinion that it is highly undesirable that analysts should express any opinion

on the commercial value of a manure. Many of them believe that tricalcic

phosphate (for instance) has a very different value according to its origin
and state of division, and that any valuation of a manure not taking this
and similar facts into account must be worse than useless. Most of the

chemists who have replied consider that phosphates of iron and aluminium

have an exceedingly limited raanurial value. The relative maiiurial values

     Mode of occurrence of the Constituents of Manufactured Manures, and

                                    statement of the Hesults of Analysis.

   On this subject the Committee has received a large amount of valuable but

somewhat discordant evidence.
    Very strong opinions are expressed to the effect that the quantity of iron

and aluminium present in a manufactured manure (superphosphate) should
always be stated. Such a plan would enable the manufacturer or purchaser
to judge of the probability of a newly made manure " going back " on
keeping, and would enable a more accurate opinion to be formed of its true
value than is possible while the presence of iron and aluminium is ignored.
At the same time the estimation of the " reduced phosphates " would often
be rendered superfluous.

   With respect to the mode of occurrence of the constituents of manufac-
tured manures, the Committee considers the evidence before it too vague and
conflicting to justify any expression of opinion at present.

                                                                                                  Potash Salts.

The Committee has received comparatively few replies on the estimation of

potash in commercial salts containing it, on account of the limited number

of chemists having special experience in its detennination. The answers

received are, however, from chemists of the first rank as authorities on the

subject, and appear to be almost exhaustive of the question.

   The method of estimation by piatinic chloride is employed by all the chemisfa
who have communicated their processes to the Committee, the only differences

being in the manipulation and details of the method.

Some chemists recommend the removal of any sulphates by addition of a

sHght excess of chloride of barium, and some also remove any calcium or mag-

nesium which may be present.

   The Committee is in possession of some correspondence respecting a sami)lo
of " muriate " which was analyzed independently by Professor Fresenius and

Mr. R. E. Tatlock                                                                       and as it throws much light on the origin of the discrepancies

often observed in the estimation of potassium, the Committee quotes it almost

in extenso, together with a descriijtion of the methods employed by the two

authorities above i-eferred to.

"About 500 grains of platinic-chloride solution (containing at least 25

grains of platinum) are added, and the fluid evaporated nearly to dryness on

Athe water-bath.  few drops of water are then added to the residue, and

the evaporation repeated to expel the excess of hydrochloric acid. About

50 grains more of the^strong platinic solution are mixed with the precipitate,

and the whole stirred well and set aside in a cold place for at least an hour

with occasional stirring. The precipitate is then thrown on a very small

filter (unweighed), the basin rinsed out with about 10 drops more of the

platinic solution, and the precipitate on the filter washed with 10 or 15 drops

more. The basin with the filter and contents are then washed with the small-

est possible quantity of alcohol of 95 per cent, strength, and dried at 100° C.

The dried precipitate is transferred as completely as possible to a small cap-
sule, in which it is further dried until it assumes a distinct orange-colour, and
weighed. The filter and trace of adhering precipitate is ignited on a cruci-

ble lid, and the residual metal with its corresponding chloride of potassium

calculated to potassio-platinic chloride, and the weight added to that of the

--precipitate. The following factors are employed : To bring the precipitate to

potassium -1603, to potash -1930, and to chloride of potassium -3056. The

figures are based on Stas's numbers for potassium and chlorine, and Berzelius's

equivalent for potassium."

    Professor Fresenius writes :

   " I am quite ready to go once more closely into the question regarding the

estimation of potassium in commercial potash salts. However, I can only do

so occasionally when I am at leisure, for there are a great many experiments
still to be made before being able to give a satisfactory answer. As far as I am
concerned myself, as well as the analyses in my laboratory, these questions are

of no great importance. The great object I have in view is to be accurate ;
saving time is only a secondary consideration. I begin by entirely separating
from the solution the sulphuric acid, lime, and magnesia ; then I weigh the

pure chloride of the alliali-metals, estimate the potassium as platino-chloride
of potassium according to the method given in ray manual of quantitative

analysis, make sure that it is quite pure, and generally also estimate the
chloride of sodium in the washings by evaporating and heating the residue in
a current of hydrogen*, partly to have a check, principally, however, to make
sure that it contains no more potassium. This method, however, is not practi-

cable in works because it is too elaborate."

   In reference to the estimation of potash, Messrs. Wallace, Tatlock, and
Clark also write :

   " It is a notorious fact that while the results obtained by the process we
follow, as compared with those got by what we may term the alcohol method,

agree verjf closely in the case oi potassium compounds free from sodium, wide
differences have jjeen observed when the potassium salts were of low strength
from the presence of sodium compounds. To this fact it would not be difii-
cult to get manufacturers and merchants to testify. This remark applies
specially to the case of potassium products from kelp, of which many thousand
tons are made in Glasgow every year, some of which contain a large propor-

tion of sodium sulphate, which is not readily conveitible into sodio-platinic
chloride, but must be converted into chloride by double decomposition with

--barium chloride a tedious and unnecessary process, and one liable to lead to

error in any than very skilled hands.

"Sulphate of potash made from kelp is an excellent example of the kind

of salt, as it usuaEy contains about 20 per cent, of sodium sulphate in the

+form of the double salt 3K^ SO^ Na, SO^.

" It was with the view of obtaining a process for the estimation of potas-

sium by platiuic chloride, directly, in these compounds, that the process we

employ was originated, and it has stood the test of practice for 15 years. It

has been objected to our process that the potassio-platinic chloride is soluble

to an appreciable extent in platinic-chloride solution ; but our experience goes

to show that in the circumstances of a potassium determination, as above

described, the results obtained are accurate. As an instance of this, we may

mention that a German firm, supposing that we must necessarily get too high

results, handed to us for analysis, in the usual commercial way, a sample of

Wemuriate of potash.   found and reported, as the result of the only trial made,

of which we had made previously a complete analysis as usual by this method,

that he would spare no pains to arrive at the truth regarding the relative

proportion of potassium and sodium salts which it contained. The following

   With reference to Mr. Tatlock's method and the above analyses, Dr.

Fresenius writes :

   "I must object to his washing the precipitate with chloride of platinum.

He dissolves by doing so a small quantity of chloride of platinum and potassium

and you see that he makes the chloride of potassium 0-21 per cent, lower than I.
This discrepancy, however, will scarcely ever be greater. To make sure
not to keep any chloride of sodium along with the chloride of platinum
and potassium, I first extract the chloride of platinum and sodium with
spirits of wine of 80 degrees, and then wash the chloride of platinum and
potassium with a few cubic centimetres of water drop by drop; then I evapo-
rate this solution, adding a little chloride of platinum, treat the small preci-

pitate again with spiribs of wine, and add the small quantity of chloride of

platinum and potassium to the bulk."

 --In reply to the above criticism the Glasgow chemists say : "In his analy-

sis of this sample Dr. Fresenius followed the method described in the sixth

edition of his ' Quantitative Analysis ; ' but, evidently fearing that the digestion
of the precipitate with alcohol of even 80 per cent, might not free it from
sodium compounds, he used a little water, wherewith to ensure the separa-
tion of the latter, and afterwards estimated the potassium in the washings

--obtained, adding this to the main result a plan which of course can be

equally adopted with our process if considered necessary " *.

Messrs. "Wallace, Tatlock, and Clark further write :

" Our method obviates the necessity of converting sulphates into chlorides

before applying the platinum process. All that is necessaiy in the case of

these salts, or where they are present, is to add an equivalent qiiantity or

rather more of pure sodium chloride, which takes up the liberated sulphuric

Weacid.  believe that the general tendency is to report potassium results too

high, not only on account of incomplete removal of sodium compounds from

the potassium precipitate, but by reason of impure platinic solutions, which,

however pure when originally made from the metal, are liable to contamina-

tion through the spent liquors and precipitates being recovered by question-

able means.
    " There is almost no limit to the accuracy of this process ; with care and in

good hands, the potash may be estimated easily to within -05 per cent."

   Mr. W. Galbraith, who has had great experience in the analysis of potash

salts by Mr. Tatlock's method, writes of it as follows :

   "The method requires a few precautions, the principal of which are that

the pipette be accurate and that the platinic chloride be pure. Care also
should be taken that the evaporation should not go to dryness, especially in

presence of a large quantity of soda salts, or the result will be too high. By
diluting the solution previous to the evaporation, the precipitate comes down
in largex crystals, is more easUy filtered and taken off the filter, and is also
more likely to be pure.

   "With these precautions, which are easily attended to, the method gives

rigidly accurate results even in the hands of inexperienced manipulators."

   Dr. G. L. Ulex, of Hamburg, separates any sulphates by very cautious ad-

dition of chloride of barium. He washes the chloroplatinate of potassium
with alcohol of SO per cent. He obtains results reliable within -2 per cent.

The process, "although simple, requires to be worked carefully, otherwise

serious mistakes will be made."

   Mr. M. J. Lausdell says, "I consider the great secret is to use plenty of
platinum, which facihtates the washing out of the sodium salts, and renders
the indication by colour (as to when to arrest washing) distinct."

   M. Joulie separates sulphates, and then the barium introduced, together

with any calcium or magnesium present. He washes the chloroplatinate

with a mixture of alcohol and ether. Absolutely exact results are obtained
in .5 or 6 hours, whatever the nature of the original sample.

    Dr. G. Berrand uses a large excess of platinic chloride, and washes the

precipitate with alcohol of 98 per cent. Us removes any sulphates with a
slight excess of chloride of barium. He remarks that "the most essential

point of the whole method is the purity of the chloride of platinum, which
can be well proved by testing it with chemically pure muriate of potash.
This, of course, must yield 100 per cent. If more or less, the platimim solu-
tion has not been pure. If the platinum solution is correct, even less practised

hands will obtain exact results by the above method, which is now universally

applied in the manufactories of our place."

   The above replies and correspondence show conclusively the necessity for
independent experiments on mixtures containing known amounts of real

potash.

                        Statement of Results of Analyses of Potash Salts.

   The information the Committee has received on this subject is limited to
the opinions of a few chemists. Without endorsing the whole of the fol-
lowing observations, the Committee beHeve that the subjoined remarks will
be read with interest and advantage.

    "It is quite likely that the sulphuric acid exists in these (kelp) muriates
not as sulphate of potash, but as the double salt 3K^ SO^ -t-J^a., SO^
(discovered in kelp potash salts by Penny of Glasgow) ; and if so, the large
proportion of sulphates present in kelp muriates (usually from 4 to G per

cent.) would involve a shght alteration in the mode of stating the results, and
would introduce sodium sulphates to a small extent. This view, however,
even if proceeded upon in practice, would not interfere practically with the

commercial value of the sulphates.
    " There cannot be a doubt that the alkali present is carbonate of soda, both

from the fact of these muriates not being deliquescent, and the impossibilitj' of
the existence of carbonate of potash and chloride of sodium together without
mutual decomposition ; otherwise carbonate of potash could be made by the
simple process of mixing solutions of carbonate of soda and chloride of

potassium."

   Dr. Ulex, of Hamburg, writes :

    "Potash, carbonate of potash, and pearlash generally contain sulphates
(which require to be removed carefully by a chloride-of-barium solution be-
fore estimating the potassium). The whole of the potassium is estimated as
chloride of platinum and potassium, and calculated to oxide of potassium.
The sulphuric acid present is precipitated with chloride of barium as sulphate
of baryta, the chlorine with a solution of silver as chloride of silver ; the former

is calculated to sulphate of potash, the chloiine to chloride of potassium.

The oxide of potassium equivalent to these two salts is subtracted from the
total oxide of potassium, and the remainder calculated to carbonate of potash.
Part of the sample is titrated with sulphuric acid and noted as carbonate of
potassium. Subtract from this the carbonate of potash previously found and

calculate the difference to carbonate of soda."

  Mr. W. Galbraith writes as follows :
   " Muriates, which may be alkaline and contain sodium carbonate, and there-

fore will not contain calcium or magnesium soluble in water, I should state
thus, putting the stronger bases and salt-radicals first :

Potassium.  Sulphate,
c ,.        Chloride.

" When they coutain calcium and magnesium soluble in water, they should

                  Magnesium.  Chloride.

                  Sodium.

   " In the case of ' artificial sulphates,' which coutain iron, calcium, and
magnesium, in addition to potassium and sodium, and are usually acid, the

results may be stated thus :

                  Hydrogen.   Sulphate.
                  Calcium.    Chloride.
                  Potassium.

   " The free acid I should state as sulphuric acid, as I cannot believe that it

exists as hydrochloric acid, considering the heat of the furnace during tlie

manufacture.

   " Of course it is evident that the acidity wUl not be really due to free sul-
phuric acid, but to an acid sulphate, probably acid sulphate of potassium

(KHSOJ. Lumps of chlorides are often to be found in salt cakes and potas-

sium sulphates of decided acid reaction.

   "Of course carbonates should follow the same rules as the above."

Mr. M. J. Lansdell holds the following opinions :

"I think in this, as in all other instances, it is a mistake to give detailed

analyses showing any particular arrangement of acids and bases combined.

I advocate a simple statement of the elements (or acids and bases) separately,

and any combining of them I am inclined to look upon as padding only

(to use an expressive word), and as having weight onlj-^ with the uninitiated.

I do not object to a statement of any one substance (say a base) as being

equal to a salt, not in the sense that that amount of that salt is present in

that sample, but as a trade valuation of the base (present) according to a well-

known or usual standard for its valuation. I find the practice of latter years

among our clients is to ask only for certain determinations (in potash salts,

generally of potash only, or for potash and its equivalent amount of sulphate of

potash or chloride of potassium), and not for detailed analyses, so getting them

done at a less fee. However, I should see no objection if the Committee

thought fit to prescribe a mode of statement for detailed analyses which they

found suited to the requirements of the trade, it being understood that such

analysis, quoted perhaps as the 'B. A. statement' or ' B. A. analj-sis,' Avas

only a statement in a conventional form. Yet a statement of the elements

--(or acids and bases) determined with at most their amounts in equivalent pro-
--portions (each equivalent proportion =1 of hydrogen) would give to each

manufacturer an easy means of making all calculations useful to him as to

value or the capabilities of the articles for separation or manufacture thereof

of any compound, and would not parade a lot of fictitious or supposititious in-

formation to impose upon or awe the ignorant. I incline to the belief that

every analyst should have respect to the ends sought and need not go beyond

perly for them, and should not be led to require as ' the thing ' a lot of other
information involving greater trouble and higher fees to the limitation of
general reference to the chemist. The sooner the public learns that chemists
do not want to take advantage of them, but only to do what is of use to them,
and that fees are not to be regulated by the number of items given (any more

than an amount of money by the number of coins of various values it may be

paid in, but also by the intrinsic value of each), the better I think it will be."

   In the foregoing Eeport the Committee has attempted to give an epitome of
the very voluminous replies which have been received.

   It will be perceived that there are many points on which the evidence is
very conflicting ; and the Committee feels it impossible to recommend with

confidence any particular process or processes unless the special conditions of

accuracy are very clearly defined.

   The large amount of infoi-mation amassed during the past year has indi-
cated very distinctly the directions in which further research is desirable ; and

the Committee, if reappointed, will be able to complete the proposed experi-

ments and inqviiries before the next Meeting of the Association, and make a
full report on the whole subject it was appointed to investigate.

--Report on the Present State of onr Knowledge of the Crustacea.

   Part I. On the Homologies of the Dermal Skeleton. By C. Spence

Bate, F.R.S. ^c.

                  [Plates I. & II.]

In presenting a Report on the present state of our knowledge of the Crustacea,
I do not think that I should fulfil the object in view without drawing atten-
tion to what must be one of the greatest hindrances to the progress of any
study in an exact or scientific manner. I allude to the want of a uniformity
in scientific nomenclature.

   The names of the several groups and families, as well as those of the struc-
ture of the animals, given by the earHest carcinologists, having been based on
a limited knowledge both of the forms and the variation to which this great
subkingdom is liable, make them inapplicable to the knowledge of the period.
Leach named one great group of Crustacea Decapoda, from the number of
legs that it possesses ; and Dana more recently named another group Tetra-
decapoda, from the fourteen legs that belongs to its most normal forms.

    Observation has demonstrated that in this latter group some genera, as
Anceus, have but eight legs ; while in the Decapoda it is only a conventional
rule that prevents the genus Palmnon and its allies from having the appendages
of the percion anterior to the last five pairs counted as legs.

    But a greater difiiculty still exists where the names given to any parts of
the animal carry any significance with them that precludes their being ac-
cepted in their universally correct sense. Thus the third pair of maxUlipedcs
in the Brachyurous Crustacea are identical with the first pair of walking-legs
in the Stomapoda, Amphipoda, and most of the Isopoda.

    It is now exactly twenty years (1855) since I presented to the Association a
Report on the British Edriophthalmia, in which the same difficulty was pointed
--43 REPOKT ]875.

out and a nomouclaturc suggested which, it was hoped, would to a largo extent
overcome the great difficulty in the study of this branch of natural history.

   But although many of the terms there given have become very general in

use, yet the custom of some writers of applying different ones at separate
times for the same parts is significant of a confusion of ideas that precludes
the student from a just appreciation of the labours of others.

    I do not think that this difficulty will be overcome for some long period
unless a committee is appointed by this Association, consisting of all the best

known authors of carcinological works, who shall determine upon a syste-

matic nomenclature for the structure and classification of the Crustacea to
which all future writers shall conform.

   In this Eeport I purpose provisionally, except when quoting from others, to
make use of the same terminology as that adopted in the previous Ileport, and
confine each term to that which has homologically the same signification.

   In the classification of Crustacea iu his great work*, Dana states

that " in the crustacean type there are normally twenty-one segments,

and correspondingly twenty-one pairs of members, as laid down by Slilne-
Edwards, the last seven of which pertain to the abdomen (ijleon) and the first

fourteen to the cephalothoras (cephalon and pereion). Now we may gather

from an examination of the crab, or macrural decapod, acknowledged to bo
first in rank, what condition of the system is connected with the highest

centralization in Crustacea.

" In these highest species, nine segments and nine pairs of appendages out

of the fourteen ce2}JinIothorcede helong to the senses and mouth, and five pairs

are for locomotion. Of these nine, three are organs of senses, six are mandibles

and maxillaj."

M. Milne-Edwards, in his standard work ' Histoire Naturelle des Crustaccs,'

Wesays, "  can generallj^ distinguish among these animals a head, a thorax,

and an abdomen ; but the limit of these regions is not always naturally well
defined ; and it is not well to attach too much importance to these distinctions,

for they do not correspond vrith the same parts among mammals, birds, &c.

. . . ." And in a note to the above he says, " Guided by the principal viscera

some authors have given the name of abdomen to the thorax, and that of

postabdomen to that which we call abdomen ; but after this principle we

must consider the head to be a preabdomen, because it contains the same

viscera as the thorax and abdomen."

   The twenty-one somites of the t3rpical Crustacea M. Milne-Edwards has

--thvis divided the anterior seven to the head, the next seven to the thorax,

and the posterior seven to the abdomen. Eut in his nomenclature of the

appendages the terms used are suggestive of the anterior two pairs of the

thorax being attached to the head. In his " Observations sur le Squelette

tegumentaire des Crustaces decapodes," Ann. des Sciences, 1854, the same

author statesthat "he has often been convinced thatin many branches of zoology

the difficulties of the study are considerably augmented by the imj^erfeetion

of the language by which we attempt to formulate the results of our observa-

tions. The employment of expressions that are vague in the determination of

zoological characters and the description of the parts that constitute an

organism convey naturally the superficial observation with which the observer

was content, leaving in the mind of the reader an amount of doubt which

retards his desire for distinct information  The terms," he con-

tinues, " of zoology are far, at present, from that degree of precision

These considerations have determined me to make a general revision of the

                * United States' Exploring Expedition, p. 1397.
ON OUR PRESKNT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  43

' carcinological terminology ' before presenting to zoologists the work that has

engaged me for some time on the natural distribution of Crustacea from the

collection in the natural-history museum."
   Even after this M. Milne-Edwards uses the terms head, thorax, and

abdomen, which he had previously stated to be "regions not naturally defined,"
and gives the api)ellation of pemptorinatlie and hectO(/nathe to the first and
second pair of appendages attached to the thorax (or pereion). Dana made
his researches on the highest form in crustacean life ; so also has M. Milne-
Edwards in his later observations. Buttho two appendages which this latter
author determines as the seventh and eighth pairs of gnathes are invariably,
according to his own showing, the anterior two pairs of the thorax. It is

only in the highest and most consolidated form of crustacean life that we
find them variated from their typical character so as to make them appear
organs attached to the mouth ; whereas in a very considerable proportion of

the various forms of Crustacea they never act as attendants on the mouth,
but are simply prehensile in their character or locomotive in their power :
 but almost universally throughout Crustacea they are connected with a pair
of branchial appendages ; and in this they fulfil most efficient work, so that in
the highest types their connexion with the mouth is one of secondary impor-

 tance only.

    The first two pairs of appendages belonging to the pereion (or thorax),
 through nearly all the orders, of the typical crustacean exhibit a variation

 that distinguishes them from those posterior to them ; and it may be convenient

 to define them, but certainly not by a term that confuses them with appen-
 dages that are only connected with secondary duties.

    Taking into consideration the many and various forms of Crustacea, the

 great and numerous changes they undergo, it is desirable not only to be sure
 that the nomenclature shall be scientifically correct in its determination and
 homological signification, but that it is convenient and applicable to a very
 considerable proportion of the animals it has to define.

    A typical crustacean in any of the well-defined orders can readily be

 divided into three parts, each part to consist of seven somites.
     Thejirst division -we call the cephalon*. It consists of the anterior seven

 somites, and supports the organs of sense and appendages adapted to bo

 attendants on the mouth.

    The second division we call the pereiok. The seven somites that form

 this division support appendages that are more or less adapted for walking in

 their most normal condition.

     The third division we name the pleon. This consists of the posterior
 seven somites ; these support the appendages which, when developed, are always
  more or less perfectly adapted for swimming.

     The last somite of the pleon is almost universally variated from the others,
  and is developed much to resemble an appendage itself. It is, however, the

 posterior somite, and as such we designate it by the name of the telson.
     The appendages that are attached to these several divisions are known by

 --their relation to them. Those that are connected with the senses are deter-

  mined by their character such as the eyes, antennae, and oral appendages.

     The antennae may be distinguished as the anterior and posterior pair, or as

  the auditory or olfactory respectively, in preference to that of the inner and
  outer or upper and lower, which is liable to vary. So the fourth pair of

  appendages, or the first belonging to the oral group, may be known (from their
  mandibular power) as the mandibles, while the three following may be detcr-

      * For the derivation of these terms see Beport of the British Ednophthahnia, 1855.
--44 REPORT 1875.

mined by their relationship as the first, second, and third pair of maxill(e,ov,
as Professor Westwood has suggested, siagnopoda.

    The appendages of the second division, or seven pairs of legs attached to
the pereion, may be readily denominated the pereiopoda ; but the anterior
two pairs are commonly variated for different purposes. In Brachyura they
fulfil the purposes of opercula to the mouth ; in the Squillidae and Edrioph-
thalmic Crustacea they are adapted for prehensile and ambulatory purposes ; so
that it may be found convenient to recognize them by a distinctive name, as

gnatliopoda.

   The appendages of the third division, or pleon, are never developed for
walking of prehension, but almost universally are formed for swimming ; and
even in the Isopoda, where these are utilized as branchial organs, they oc-
casionally fulfil the office of swimming-appendages. Not unfrequently the
last two, as in the Macrura, and the last three, as in Amphipoda, are variated
in form so as to enable the animal to spring when on land or dart a con-
siderable distance in the water ; and the term uropoda has been applied to
them ; but their variation is so inconstant that the advantage of defining
them by any special name will be less than the convenience arising from

the distinction.

   The integumentary structure is one of the most important in the Crustacea,
and a knowledge of the variations of its several parts is of much assistance,

not only to the student of the history of these animals, but also for elucidating

the knowledge of those forms that have passed away and can be studied only
through the impressions left imbedded in the rocks.

   The external skeleton of a crustaceous animal consists of series of rings,

that appear to repeat each other, differing only in modification according to
the necessity of the various portions of the animal. These rings represent
and protect externally various segments of the body, each division supporting
one pair of ai^pcndages only and the internal structure that relates to them.

Each of these several divisions we call a " somite," a term suggested, I
believe, by Professor Huxley in his lectures at the Royal College of Surgeons.
Of these there are never more than twenty-one ; and this may be considered
as being the normal number in all Crustacea above those known as the Ento-
mostraca, in some few of which, as in the genera Apv^ and Stegocepilialns, the
number of somites appear to be much more numerous ; but there the somites

appear to be repeated without having any function to fulfil or appendage to

--support a numeiical repetition only, the result of an enfeebled force.

   The first somite supports and carries the organs of vision. In some of
the most condensed forms the eyes are implanted on the outer side of the two
pairs of antennae ; but the internal structure invariably shows that the most
anterior pair of nerves are those that are connected with these organs. The
progress of development which we purpose alluding to in its proper place
clearly demonstrates the eyes to be the most anterior of aU the organs.

    The second somite bears the first pair of antennte, which, from its position
in the higher Crustacea, is generally called the inner pair, and from its posi-
tion in the lower forms is called the upper pair of antennae.

   The third somite supports the second or posterior pair of antennae ; this,
from its relative position to the other antennae in the higher and lower forms
of Crustacea, has been called respectively the outer and lower antennae. This

somite is so closely associated M'ith the fourth that it is not certain that they
exist distinct in any species of Crustacea.

   The three anterior somites are generally closely blended together. In the
earlier forms of development they are invariably so ; but in Squilla and its
ON OUtt PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  45

congeners the two anterior somites are distinctly separated from each other and
the third. In Palinurus the first is distinct from the second; but in the
greater portion of Brachynrous and Macrurous Crustacea the three first
somites, and perhaps the fourth, are strongly soldered into one piece.

   This piece in most Crustacea, but more conspicuously so in the more con-
densed forms, is developed to a greater or less extent, and is recognized under
the name of the carapace or shield.

   In the lower forms, such as the Amphipoda and Isopoda, it is developed

sufficiently to cover only the four succeeding somites ; while in the higher
forms, such as the Brachyura, it is developed so as to protect the whole of the

animal.

   The carapace varies very much in shape, both in width and length, and

generally covers the whole of the somites of the pereion ; but not universally

so. In the Anomura several genera have the posterior somite of the pereion

exposed ; in the Diastylidse there are three or four somites not covered, and
in the Edriophthalmic Crustacea all seven are unprotected and developed into

perfect somites.

    It is one of the earliest features present in the development of the embryo,

and is distinctly defined in the Nauplins form. Even in this early stage
of development, as in later existence, the form of the carapace varies
considerably, and is an easy mark of distinction between genera. It is
desirable as well as important, in an anatomical point of view, that a clear
idea should be obtained of the homological relation of this large and con-

spicuous portion of the highly developed cnistacean. This can be done only

after an examination and comparison of a large number of various forms
and types of animals, as well as a close investigation and study of the parts

during their progressive development.
    Milne-Edwards, as far back as 1834, arrived at the conclusion that the

carapace in the higher types of Crustacea is " the result of an excessive
development of the superior arch of the cephalic antenno-maxillary seg-

ment. . . . But (Hist, des Crust, vol. i. p. 2Q) among certain Stomapods,
such as Squilla, the head is divided into many distinct segments ; the first
two, the ophthalmic and antennular rings, are movable and little developed.
The third and fourth rings are, on the contrary, very large and compose
between them a single segment that we call the antenno-maxillary. The
carapace occupies the dorsal portion of the tron^on formed by this union,

and is prolonged above the six following rings."
    " In studying (I. c. p. 28) the carapace as a whole as well as in its parts,

we must examine into the rules of the normal organization of Crustacea, not

only in the later, more or less, remarkable modification, but also the very
curious structure of certain Eutomostraca, where all the animal is enclosed in

a kind of bivalve shell."
    These views receive general support from Mr. Dana, who, however, takes

exception to the assertion that the ventral piece of the carapace is formed

out of what M. Milne-Edwards calls the epimera {J. c. p. 32), but contends

that they " are in fact the posterior extension of the mandibular segment ;

and he continues, " excepting that we consider what is here called epimeral,
the mandibular segment, we agree with Milne-Edwards, for the most part, in

the above-mentioned deduction ; so that while the mandibular segment is
confined to the ventral pieces of the Brachyural carapax, it constitutes its

posterior half in Macrura."
    In 18.55 the author of this Report communicated to the 'Annals of Natural

History ' a memoir on this subject, supporting the opinion of Jtlilue-Edwards
--46 REPORT 1875.

as to the homology of the carapace, but denying the existence of epimera in the
theory of the somite, and corroborating the assertion of Dana that the antennal
segment constitutes the anterior and upper portion, and the mandibular seg-
ment the posterior and lower portion of the carapace in the Macrura and Era-
chyura ; and affirmed that the suture which traverses the lower surface forms
a line of demarcation between the third and fourth somites ; it homologizes
with the cervical suture in the Macrura, as also with that which traverses the
dorsal surface of the cephalon in several genera of Trilobites (PL I. fig. 5).

   If we wish to judge of the relation of these parts in the several forms of
Crustacea, we must make a careful investigation during the immatiu'e stages

of the animal.

   In the Megalopa stage the inferior antennae are attached to the anterior

external horns of the carapace ; these horns are folded beneath the animal,
and it is this inflection that forms the orbit in which the eye is lodged.
Through this inversion, consequent upon the monstrous development of the

hepatic region, this suture lies upon the inferior surface of the carapace in

Erachyurous Crustacea, extending posteriorly to the extreme limits of the

carapace.

   The author concluded his paper by saying, " But we have seen in the de-

scending scale of nervous force the rings which carrj' the organs of conscious-
ness degenerate in importance, and yield to a corresponding development of
the mandibular ring : this law appears to be in force in the Amphipoda, the

lowest type of the Macrura form, in which I am inclined to believe that the

mandibular ring represents the whole of the upper portion of the cephalic ar-

--ticulation the anterior three being so diminished in importance, that they are

to be found only in the perpendicular wall of the head, or perhaps represented
by their appendages only" (Ann. Nat. Hist., July 1855).

   It would scarcely perhaps be necessary to enter further into the evidence
that supports the homological relations of the carapace, had not Professor
Huxley, in his Hunterian Lectures at the Eoyal College of Surgeons, expressed

an opinion opposed to the above statements.

 --In his twelfth lecture Prof. Huxley says : " In aU the Brachyura and

ordinary Macrura it appears to me to be obvious that the carapace is con-

--tinuoiis with, and part of, all the somites of the cephalothorax- that it is

composed, in fact, of their connate terga, the branchiostegite being nothing

more than their connate and highly developed pleura ; the cervical suture,
placed immediately behind the attachment of the mandibular muscles and in
front of the heart, corresponds in these respects precisely with the posterior
boundary of the head of a SquiUa and of a Branchiopod, or of an Edrioph-
thalmian. The cephalic arc roofs over the stomach, as does the tergal region

of the head in these last-named Crustacea. Anatomically, then, it seems to
be demonstrable that the scapular arc of the carapace in the ordinary Podoph-

thalmia is the equivalent of the terga of the thorax, that the cephalic arc
is the homologue of the terga of the head, and that the carapace is formed
by aU the cephalothoracic somites."

   Before the Reporter can proceed with any fresh evidence to support the

argument demonstrative of the homological character of the carapace, it is

desirable that a clear idea should be given of the theory of a somite or

segment as it exists in Crustacea.

  --Prof. Milne-Edwards, in his ' Histoire des Crustaces,' vol. i. p. 16, says :

" Each of the rings of the skeleton appears to be composed of two lateral

Wemoieties, resembling each other.  can distinguish moreover two arcs,

the one superior, the other inferior, as shown in the accompanying diagram
                                              ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  47

[pi. 1. fig. 3 of his work]. The former results from the assemblage of four

pieces more or less intimately connected together, and arranged in pairs on
each side of the median line. The central pieces are called by the name of
the tergum, and the lateral are called the Jiancs or epimeral pieces. The
inferior arc is composed of the same number of pieces. The two median
pieces unite to form the sternum ; and the latter are known by the name of
tlao episternum, by reason of their analogy with those that M. Audouin has

designated by the same name among insects. They are united always at the

sternum                                       but there generally exists, between the inferior arc and the epimera
                                           ;

situated above, a wide space destined for the articulation of the corresponding

member."

   " "We know of no example," he continues, " of a ring where we are able
to distinguish at the same time all the pieces that we desire to enumerate.

Sometimes there is an absence of some of the pieces from the place they

should occupy, and sometimes they are very intimately soldered together, so

that we cannot see even a trace of separation ; but in studying each of them
separately, where it is most distinct, we shall be able to form a clear idea, and

recognize its character in spite of its union with its neighbouring pieces.

Moreover, although this analysis of the ring may not be always practicable,

it is not the least true that it facilitates much the study of the exterior ske-

leton of articulated animals, and that it wlU permit us often to establish

analogies where there would first appear to exist the greatest difference."

" To terminate the enumeration of the constituent parts of the tegumentary

rings of the Crustacea, there only remains for us to speak of the plates that

we often see elevated from the internal siu'face aiid arrange themselves into

cells and canals. These processes are always developed at the points of union

of two rings or of two neighbouring pieces of the same segment ; and this

disposition has obtained for them the name of apodemes (from M. Audouin).

They are the result of a fold of the integumentary membrane which penetrates

more or less deeply between the oi'gans, and which is strengthened with cal-

careous matter like the rest of the structure, and "are always formed of two

thin plates soldered together."

These views have long been accepted as the acknowledged theory. Isor

am I aware that any one (except the authors above quoted) has attempted

upon original investigation to analyze the evidence upon which M. Milne-

Edwai'ds has formed his theory.

That the author of this lieport has long held views not consistent with

M. MUne-Edwards's theory, is known to those carcinologists who have read

his Eeport on the British Edriophthalmia, which was communicated to this

Association and piiblished in its Transactions for 1855, wherein he trusts

that he clearly demonstrated that the pieces to which M. Milne-Edwards

gave the name of epimera, and selected by him as typical of his theory,

were parts attached to the legs, and not pieces of the dorsal arc of the

crustacean somite.

  --He is moreover desirous in this Report to show : that the epimera, as sec-

tional pieces in a theoretical construction of a somite, cannot exist ; that

the so-called epimera are portions only of the integumentary structure of

the appendages of the animal, and that the apodema are formed out of

this structure, more or less thinned out by lateral pressure and internal

arrangement ; and that the head of the lower ty^jes and carapace of the

higher are homologically the same, the carapace being a monstrous deve-

lopment intended for the covering and protection of the more complicated

branchial appendages of the higlier types.
--48 REPORT 1875.

   But this portion will be discussed more fully when the structure of the

appendages is treated of.

   The earliest stage in the life of a crustaceous animal, in which the dorsal
shield known as the carapace is observable, is that of the young as it exists
fresh from the ovum of a cirriped (Pl.jl. fig. 1) . This, which has been named the
Nauplius form of the Crustacea by Pritz Miiller, exists as a small animal with
three pairs of appendages only. The eyes are not developed, the ocular spot
not being homologous with the permanent organs ; but since we see that mate-
rial does enter into the stomach, we can have no great effort in accepting the
proposition that this incipient animal has a mouth ; and such being the case,

we must assume that the anterior four somites are present in the construc-

tion of the head of the Nauplius stage of Crustacea. The oral apparatus is
still in an embryonic condition.

   The next stage of living types in which we can observe the carapace to exist
in the progressive condition is in that known as the Zoea form of Crustacea
(PI. I. fig. 2). This is the early life of the young of the higher Podophthalmous
Crustacea. That of the Brachyura is most known and most instructive. Some
of the appendages are begiuniug to assume a permanent form. The eyes are
developed, the antennae (though in an immature coudition) are in existence,
and so are all the appendages of the head except the last. The first two
pairs of appendages connected with the pereion are present in an immature

condition, and the posterior pairs are represented by small bud-like appen-
dages. Dissection readily demonstrates that the carapace in this stage only
covers, but has no associated connexion with, the appendages of the pereion

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

and a closer study shows that the heart is connected with and partly exists
in the great dorsal spine. The relative position of this process, therefore,
enables us to determine that the future growth of the carapace takes place
and is connected with the anterior portion of this structure, and not with the

posterior. In the young of Palinurus, as well as in the larger forms known

as Phyllosoma, which appears to be the young of Palinurus older in age and
larger in size, the carapace is developed largely in advance of the oral ap-
paratus ; it is produced posteriorly so far as to project over the anterior two
somites of the pereion, but is not attached to any portion beyond the posterior

oral appendages. An examination of the Zoea of the various types of Podoph-

thalmous Crustacea supports this observation; and we can trace the same

facts from the Zoea, through the Megalopa, to the adult Brachyurous Crustacea

(PL I. fig. 3). It is therefore desirable that we should see how far the study

of an adult crustacean will assist lis in demonstrating the true relation of the
carapace to the general structure of the animal.

    In Squilla and allied forms of the same type the two anterior somites (the
first of which supports the eyes, the second the anterior pair of antennee) exist
as distinct and perfect, though small somites ; whereas the two succeeding are
closely associated together, and appear as a large dorsal plate supporting the
posterior pair of antennae and mandibles. The posterior three somites belong-
ing to the cephalon and the first two belonging to the pereion are represented
by the sternal plates only. In the young forms the anterior two somites be-
longing to the pereion are in a membranous condition dorsally complete.

    According to the theory of Professor Huxley, the carapace represents the
 dorsal arc of all the somites that it protects and have not a distinct roof of
 their own.

    It is therefore desirable that we should learn what may be the distinct
useful value of the carapace, and why each somite would not serve the same
purpose by being perfect in its own arc.
       ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.                       49

The branchial organs, that are so essential to the aeration of the blood in

all aquatic animals, are iu the Crustacea appendages attached to the mcmbcr.s

belonging either to the pereion or pleon or both. In the lower and terrestrial

types, such as the Isopoda, they are connected with the pleon only. In some

Stomapods, as Squilla and its allies, we find them attached to the pleopoda

as well as the pereiopoda; but in the higher groups they are invariably

attached to the pereiopoda only. In the most simple form the branchite

exist as mere saccular attachments, whereas in the higher types they become

more complicated and voluminous. In the saccular condition they arc held

by a small neck pendent from the joint, and are exposed iu the water without

protection ; but in the higher Podophthalmous types they are formed of
very numerous plates folded close together upon a central stalk, aud would

be very liable to injury if not protected by some means.

The branchiae, therefore, being in their very nature external organs, and

attached to the first joints of the several appendages of the pereion, it is

self-evident that they could not be covered or protected by their own somite,

inasmuch as if it had passed over them the branchial appendages would be-

come internal. Their character and constitution would therefore be changed ;
they would cease to be external ; in fact they would cease to be branchiae.

   But since the appendages exist as branchia) and are covered and protected,

it must follow that if the protection cannot be evolved from the somites to

which they are secondarily attached, the covering must be the result of the

development of some other somite.

The somites in their simx^lo conditions have a tendency to overlap one

another to an extent that precludes them from permitting any portion of the

intermediate structure being exposed.

Tliat the somites have a tendency to extend in every direction, is very evi-

dent from the different proportions and forms they severally undergo iu various

genera, and those which compose the carapace exist in all proportions.

   In the Isopoda the cophalon is reduced to the smallest extent in a typical

form of Crustacea. In the Amphipoda the cephalon is much larger than

in the Isopoda ; but in neither of these is the integumentary covering pro-
duced to cover or protect any somite that is not included within its ana-

tomical bounds. In the Diastylidas, one of the lowest forms of the Schizopod

type (where the branchiffi consist of but one or two pairs of a multicellular

form), the tergal projection of the cephalon extends posteriorly over half the

pereion ; whereas the lateral walls are anteriorly produced, so as to protect
and cover the anterior cephalic appendages. These animals burrow and

live in the mud and sand ; and no doubt this development of the carapace
forms a good protection to the eyes and antennal organs. Thus we can

readily interpret the origin and homologue of the shell-covering in Limnadia,

Cj/pris, &c., by supposing a monstrous development of the carapace iu every

direction, induced as a protection to a feeble animal that but for this pro-

tection must perish in its destructive habitat.
   In Squilla and its allies (the typical form on which Milne-Edwards has

based his researches) the carapace does not extend posteriorly beyond its
anatomical bounds ; laterally it projects interiorly more so ; but the great
size of this plate arises from the large amount of space that exists between
the mandibles and the antennae ; and as a carapace it is scarcely more impor-
tant than the tergal surface of the cephalon in the Amphipoda. The
branchial organs in tlris type of animals are saccular, or more rudimentary iu
their condition than the same organs attached to the pleon. The carapace

as a covering is not required to protect these branchial organs, wliich are

not more important than the same in the Amphipoda. Gradually, as the
branchise assume a more complicated or multicellular condition, the carapace

increases in dimensions both laterally and dorsally, until we perceive it
reaches the important feature we find in the Brachyurous Crustacea.

    In Squilla the eyes are borne on a distinct somite ; in Palmurus the same
is distinctly visible ; in Cancer the ophthalmic somite is likewise distinct and
separated from the next succeeding, but it is wrapt over and enclosed by the
next or anterior antennal somite. In Squilla also the first pair of antenna)
are borne on a somite distinct from the succeeding. In the Macrura and
Brachyura this and the succeeding somites are closely blended together ; but
in SquiJla the fifth, sixth, and seventh somites are capable of being deter-

mined by their sternal pieces only. As we perceive the tergal pieces of the
somites of the pereion are wanting in the Brachyura, so we may assume that

they are not developed in the posterior somites of the head in Squilla under
 similar conditions. There therefore is every reason to believe in the theory,
that the monstrous development of the mandibidar and posterior antennal

somites, incorporated together, unite to form the perfect carapace that is so

 characteristic of the typical Crustacea.

    But whatever may bo correct in a theoretical or transcendental point of

view, for all anatomical and practical requirements the carapace represents
the tergal surface of the cephalon, so largely developed as to cover and pro-

 tect not only the pereion, but, as in Cryptolitliodes, the entire animal.
    In the development of the Crustacea the gradual progress of the carapace

may be traced through all its stages.
    In the ovum the members are first represented by small gemmiparous

 sacs, and precede the foi-mation of the dorsal or ventral arcs in the small
Nauplius. The carapace covers and protects all the animal except the pleon
but this represents only the four anterior somites and their appendages. In
the Zoea stage the carapace is perfect and folded downwards laterally, and is
 capable of covering and protecting all the appendages of the cephalon and

 the anterior two of the pereion. At this period no branchial organs exist,

but saccular appendages in an embryonic condition are budding in their places :
 in a short time the pereiopoda are seen to form, and the branchial organs
 assume a definite character ; and with their appearance a change takes place
in the form of the carapace.

    In a largo number of Brachyiural ZoUoi a more or less conspicuous spine or
tooth-like process may be seen to occupy a position on the lateral walls. This
 spine, from observation during the progressive growth of the animal, is seen

 to correspond with the angle in the adult that defines the demarcation
 between the branchial and hepatic regions. The deflection of the carapace
 anteriorly bends over the hepatic lobes, the line of the greatest curvature
 being frequently surmounted by a series of well-defined tooth-like cusps ; and
 posteriorly bends over the branchial organs, the curvature here being less
 abrupt and seldom surmounted by any cusp or process.

    Externally the carapace covers and protects both the hepatic and branchial
 organs ; but internally a calcareous wall of demarcation exists.

     This wall, which Milne-Edwards terms the apodema, is continued into a
 thin membranous tissue that makes a distinct and weU-defined separation be-
 tween the branchial appendages and the internal system ; so that the aqueous
 element, so necessary for the aeration of the blood as it passes through the

branchife, may have fuU power to play upon the gills without having any

passage that would admit it to the internal viscera and derange the general
economy of the animal.

    Not only does the carapace vary in external form, but also in the configu-
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  51

ration of its surface. The relation that it holds to the internal viscera is to
afford protection and means of siipport.

   When the former only is required, the structure is generally smooth and

even ; where the tissues are internally thicker and irregular, it gives to the
external surface an indented and irregular aspect, which is common, parti-
cularly in the flat and short-tailed Crustacea, where the markings are so per-

sistent as to afford a very valuable assistance for the determination of species.
    These markings are generally induced by the attachments of the tissues

that secure certain viscera in theii" positions ; these form generally points of
depression ; but where any organ (such as the liver, stomach, or branchial
appendages) is protected, the corresponding points in the carapace are ele-
vations, sometimes crowned with a pointed spine or process. The branchial
appendages are external in relation to the body of the animal, but covered
over and protected by the lateral walls of the carapace. To complete this
so as effectually to protect those organs without pressing on or interfering with
their functions, a very considerable amount of lateral development has taken
place, and a peculiar reflection so as to bring the margin of the carapace
below the branchial appendages and to protect them from rude contact with
the limbs. The angle which is induced by this inflection of the carapace
over the hepatic lobes and enclosing the branchias is generally well defined
and ornamented with points or processes more or less numerous. These

processes define the dorsal limits of the carapace.

   Desmarest, half a century since, mapped out the dorsal surface of the
carapace into regions coinciding with the limits of the internal viscera.

   Milne-Edwards, in his 'Histoire des Crustaces,' published in 1839, adopted
the same views, supporting it by illustrations from several genera.

   Professor Dana more recently, in his great work on Crustacea, has divided
the dorsal siirface into many more regions, taking the numerous areolites that

are present in some genera (as Zozynms).

   He divides the carapace by a transverse line that extends from just ante-

rior to the last of the normal lateral teeth to the same on the opposite side,
and separates it into anterior and posterior portions.

   The anterior he again divides into three parts, defined by lines of depres-
sion, and names them the median region and two antero-lateral regions.

   The median region covers the stomach, and includes the gastric and genital

regions of Desmarest.

   The space anterior to the median region he calls the frontal, and on either
side the orbits form another, which may be called the orbital region.

   The posterior portion of the carapace he likewise divides into a posterior
and two postero-lateral regions.

   Professor Milne-Edwards in 1854 readdressed himself to this subject and
further elaborated it. In the ' Annales des Sciences NatureUes' ho communi-
cated his researches with illustrations from several genera, and divided the
dorsal surface of the carapace into regions corresponding with the names of

the internal viscera. I3ut it appears to me that the correspondence in many

parts exists in the name only ; as, for instance, in the gastric region, which he

subdivides into epigastric or anterior lobes of the gastric region, protogastric

or latero-autcrior lobes, mesogastric or median lobe, metagastric or latero-
posterior lobes, and urogastric or medio-posterior lobe of the gastric region.

   It is quite Avithin the power of demonstration to prove that it is more in
accordance with the correct anatomical details of the animal's structure if
the lobes that he named metagastric, or latere -posterior lobes, were called,

according to Desmarest, the genital regions after the viscera they protect.

And no advantage appears to me to be derived from dividing a region

                                                                          e2

into parts that are not constant, and when present do not represent any In-

ternal organization, as he has done in dividing the branchial region into :
epibranchial, or anterior division of the branchial region ; the mesobranchial
and metabranchial divisions, which consist of lobes variable in form, but
represented in most genera by a smooth surface.

    The cardiac region he divides into an anterior and posterior portion. The

anterior alone represents the position of the heart ; the posterior represents the
part that lies between the heart and the posterior margin of the carapace.

    The hepatic regions he does not subdivide, but circumscribes their limits

--within the extent of the internal organ an object of consideration, as it

appears that the extent of this organ is one of the most important features
in the moulding of generic forms. The other regions are those situated on
the ventral sui'face, and which will be considered in a future Report.

    The value of a clearly defined knowledge of the various markings that are
represented on the dorsal surface of the carapace of Crustacea is best appre-
ciated in the study of fossil specimens, where the remains of animals, how-
ever well preserved, can be read by their external features only.

    It is therefore with a view to accelerate this that I liave in this Report
endeavoured to lay down the several regions that are represented by the
markings exhibited on the surface of the carapace.

    Taking advantage of the information conveyed by studying the labours of
the previously mentioned eminent carcinologists, I have laid it down as a rule
for guidance, that the external markings must define the internal structure
and where this is not the case the lobe or projection exists as an excrescence.

   The most important and constant divisions are :--

    The anterior, which lies immediately above the antero-cesophageal gan-
glion. This may readily be subdivided into the orbital and antennal portions.
The entire region, from its relation to those organs from which alone intelli-
gence is derived, may be termed the cephalic region.

     Directly posterior to the cephalic region is the gastric ; this is generally
 very conspicuous, the intensity of the jjostero-lateral markings being rendered

 more distinguishable by the inner surface of the carapace being adapted for
 the attachment of the anterior tendon of the mandibles.

    The stomach consists, in the more perfectly developed types, of a large
 central chamber, the form of which not only varies in genera, but is capable
 of extension and of being collapsed in the same individual. It has also
 antero-lateral cavities and a posterior or pyloric extension ; but these are
 produced at a lower line, and therefore liable to be less conspicuously repre-
 sented on the dorsal surface.

     The lobe which M. Milne-Edwards has termed the mesogastric, corresponds
 with that portion of the stomach that is projected above the gizzard-like

 plates that stand at the entrance of the pyloric chamber.

    On each side of the pyloric or mesogastric lobe are two generally well-
 defined .lobes that correspond, and are probably induced by the presence
 beneath of the genital apparatus in the male and the commencement of the

  ovaries in the female. I think, therefore, that it is desirable to retain

 for these lobes the name that was first bestowed upon them by Desmarest,
 and call them the genital regions.

     Posterior to these comes the cardiac region, which corresponds very closely
 with that of the heart, which lies immediately beneath it.

     Posterior to the heart the carapace protects no distinct viscera ; but the
 posterior margin covers the anterior half of the first somite of the pleon.
 The muscular system which moves the pleon is attached to the apodema that
 divides tlic cardiac from the branchial cavities, which also affords attachment

to tlic extensive membrane that protects the internal viscera from the intro-
clTiction of the water. This membrane is continuous with and attached to
the inner surface of the posterior margin, and is represented generally by a lobe
that runs parallel with the posterior margin. This portion may conveniently

bo known as the postcardiac region.
   The hepatic regions extend on either side from the orbital region anteriorly

to the posterior tooth of the hepatic crest, and are bounded by the gastric and
branchial regions. This is a larger portion than is admitted by Milne-Ed-
wards, but it is one that corresponds with the extent of the hepatic viscera.

   The branchial region reaches from the posterior tooth of the hepatic crest
to the posterior margin, along which it traverses nearly to the median line
on either side, and is bounded on the inner side by the cardiac and genital
regions, and anteriorly by the hepatic regions, from which internally it is

separated by a thin membranous partition.

   These several divisions appear to me to be based upon strictly anatomical
grounds, and as such may be regarded as natural divisions, the variation
of which must depend upon that of structure, and therefore may be relied

upon as affording characteristic distinctions.
   The great consolidation of the anterior somites of the skeleton has led Prof.

Dana to pronounce the centralization to amount to a cephalization of the forces ;

but this opens a subject of considerable extent and interest, which, if permitted,
I hope to present in a continuation of this Eeport at the next Meeting of the

Association.

Second Report of a Committee, consisting of Prof. A. S. HerscheLj
   B.A., F.R.A.S., and G. A. Lebour^ F.G.S., on Experiments to
   determine the Thermal Conductivities of certain Rocks, shoioing

    especially the Geological Aspects of the Investigation,

The original object proposed to be effected by the Committee of devising a
simple and direct method of determining- approximately the absolute thermal
conductivities of solid bodies, and especially of the rocks of most common
occurrence in geological strata, has not yet been entirely carried out. But
the experiments described in the last Report were repeated under new con-

ditions, which enable the Committee to present, with more confidence than

in their last Report, a list of absolute conductivities of the rocks there spe-

cified, and to add to the list examples of some further important determina-

tions. Many uncertainties remained to be removed from the values given in

the former list, the most notable of which proceeded from the looseness of
the contact obtained between the points of the thermopile and the two faces
of the tested plate of rock. The real difference of temperature between the
two faces was not measured, but that between the air- currents round the
points of the thermopile in the two sheets of velvet which pressed them
agaixist the surface of the plate. Thus difference of temperature two or three
times as great as those intended to be measured (and as those which were

actually observed when in a few cases the points of the thermopile were
solidly cemented to the rocks) were constantly recorded. Assuming that the

indications were always too great in a certain fixed proportion (determined
approximately by the direct experiments made in a few certain cases), the
former list of estimated absolute conductivities was compiled from the use of
the velvet-covered apparatus. India-rubber faces about two millimetres (or

one twelfth of an inch) in thickness are now stretched tightly over the flat
faces of the cylindrical cooler and steam-boiler, and are bound down with
wire, air being carefully excluded from these junctions by disiilacing it with

a little oil. While the top of the boiler is formed of a thick, circular, brass
 plate a little convex (about one millimetre high in the centre) on the upper
side, a tripod wooden stand, with straight legs passing through the lid of the
cooler, rests upon the inner side of its base in the sockets of a flat, circular,
perforated brass plate with wide lattice openings, and somewhat less in
diameter than the cooler -base, between which and the base of the cooler,
 again, two thicknesses of coarse wire gauze are introduced, to permit free
 access of the water in the cooler to the inner surface of its tinned-iron base,
when the central rod of the agitator, which contains the indicating thermo-
meter, is raised and lowered frequently enough to keep the water in a con-

stant state of motion. Two twenty-eight-pound weights, suspended from an

iron link or cross bar carried by the tripod stand, communicated in this
series of experiments a pressure of abotit 3 lbs. per sqiiare inch to the rock-
plate placed for examination between the india-rubber-covered faces of the
boiler and the cooler ; and it was expected that the exclusion of air from
round the points of the thermopile and from the junctions between the faces
might be assumed under these conditions : but as india-rubber offers great
resistance to the passage of heat, it was found inconvenient to use it of suffi-
cient thickness to accomplish this directly by its elasticity* ; and recourse

     * Altliongli thickly jacketed with a close covering of felt and fur, the cooler, containing
 2^ lbs. of water, was found to lose heat to the atmosphere at the rate of 0°-0025 F. per
 minute for each degree of excess of its temperature above that of the surrounding air
and for an excess of 20° F., which was sometimes reached, the loss being 0°05 F., the

 was had, in consequence, to soft cements, to make the junctions between the

 surfaces air-tight. An experiment was also made with slate, by plastering

 the thermopile solidly to it with thin sheets of india-rubber moistened with a
 mixture of red-lead and oU, and testing the conductivity of the plate when,
 after remaining for two weeks under pressure, the cement appeared to have
 Bolidiiied to ijerfect hardness. The result in this case (391) * scarcely dif-
 fered either from the estimated number for the same rock-plate (392) given
 in our former list, or from two other determinations (414 and 425), when,
 instead of the solid junction, a thin paste of boiled starch and another of red-

lead and oil were used in succession to effect the junction. Two new

 specimens of slate, cut from one piece, and tested by the same process, with
moist lutings of starch and linseed- meal to secure the junctions, gave as

values of their conductivities in different experiments the rather lower num-

bers, apparently belonging to this different sample of the stone, 340, 346,
349. The i)late of white Sicilian marble described in the last Eeport as pre-

senting when tested, by attaching the thermopile to it solidly with plaster, a
resulting conductivity 559, now afforded, with moist linseed luting, the
number 497. Whinstone, which formerly exhibited in the same manner an
absolute conductivity 3] 2, now afforded, with linseed luting, the conduc-
tivity 333. The results obtained with moist lutings are sometimes in excess

and sometimes in defect of those observed with solid junctions, and nothing

nccessaiy to be preferred in soUd over liquid attachments of the surfaces to
each other was found to be indicated by these preliminary trials.

   The inconstancy of some determinations now attempted of new rock-

specimens with the iron and palladium' thermopile led to the discovery that
its roUed branches produce thermoelectric currents by alteration of the con-
dition of the pressed metal ; and no anneahng by heat was able to remove
this serious objection. While unequally pressed parts of the wire along its

branches were subjected to unknown temperatures, it was obvious that small

differences of temperature could not be measured satisfactorily with the
thermopile, and no reliance in respect of ultimate accuracy could be placed on
the values found up to this time with the instriiment in its first constructed

form. German-silver wire was, however, substituted successfully for palla-
dium in the thermopile, with which the present series of experiments were

made. It consists of three rolled wires of German silver and two of iron in
series, between two rolled iron -wire terminals of a Thomson's reflecting

galvanometer, three junctions of the flattened helix into which they are

wound upon two bracing-bars of wood being above, and three below the

rock-section, which slips easily between them. A stout india-rubber collar

(half an inch in thickness) surrounds the rock-section before it is placed be-
tween the wire grating of the thermopile ; and similar collars round the con-

fronting ends of the boiler and cooler make a continuous non-conducting

casing of the rock-plate and of adjoining parts of the apparatus, protecting

them entirely, when the pressure acts upon them and upon the lutings that
connect them, from heat-communication to the outer air. Although German-
silver wire (even if unflattened) produced, when slightly heated at certain

effects of undetected external influences might become sensible were the rate of heat-
transmission to be measured less than 0°'2 F. per minute. The rate actually observed
with the apparatus above described was between 0°'194 with cauuel-coal and 0°"400 with
quartz ; and in the following list of absolute conductivities the proper correction for the
external air-temperature round the cooler has in every instance been applied.

points of its length, sensible thermoelectrical effects of local disturbing cur-

rents, ·wbich (as vras also observed in the palladium wire and in some other
metals which -were tried) did not appear to be removed, like those of strained
iron wire, by annealing at a considerable heat, yet the high electromotive
force of the German-silver iron couple and the neutralizing eifect of the
several loops of German-silver wire, all exposed to the same temperature
variations, were found, in some suitable experiments made in the process of
determining the scale of the instrument's indications, to have almost entirely
eliminated the influence of these small disturbing actions ; and the smallest
differences of temperature, of only two or three degrees, occurring in the

rock-conductivity experiments could be accurately measured. Eesistances of

two, five, and ten ohms were included in the thermoelectric circuit succes-
sively in each experiment ; and the proportionality of the galvanometer read-
ings in these several conditions being constant, showed the constancy of the
resistance, and accordingly the unvarying scale-value of the indications of

the instrument for every observation ; while the zero of the scale-readings

could also be conveniently determined at any moment by unplugging, in the
rheostat connected in the circuit, a very large resistance of 1000 ohms.

Twelve, seven, and four divisions of the scale represented respectively l°r.,

when the several resistances above named were used * ; and three readings

being taken for every temperature- difference observation, the results reduced
in this proportion were accordant to one or two tenths of a degree, as long
as the total resistance of the circuit had undergone no variations from acci-
dental injuries of the connexions, and as long as the thermometric value of the

scale-divisions had accordingly been preserved. The electromotive force of
 a German-silver iron thermopile is shown, by Prof. Tait's representation of
the specific curves of these metals in his ' First approximation to a Thermo-

 electric Diagram,' to be at ordinary temperatures very exactly proportional
to the difference of temperature between the junctions ; and the temperature-
differences noted in these experiments may, it is presumed, be accordingly

regarded as affected by only very small errors of uncertainty. The thickness

of the flattened wire (about 0-5 millim.) of the thermopile occasioned,
 however, even with the considerable pressure used, a certain thickness of the
lutings ; and it is probable that, from this cause as well as from the partial
 fluidity, instead of perfectly solid nature, of the cement, the temperature-difter-

 cnccs observed somewhat exceeded those which actually existed between the

 faces of the tested plates. Besides the small corrections for escape of heat
from the cooler to the outer air, an addition of one tenth to all the observed

conductivities is made in the present list for the cooler's thermal capacity and
for that of the brass foot, wire gauze, and agitator, which it enclosed, the cor-
rection for which was not included in the conductivities assigned last year. The
 final results in the present list are, notwithstanding this correction, somewhat

 inferior to those formerly observed with the thin palladium-iron thermopile,
whether its attachments were solid or effected by moist cements ; but in re-
 peated experiments with that instrument on quartz and other rock-sections
 offering only small resistances, the results arrived at were in general so high,
 and at the same time so irregiilar, from the predominance, in measuring their
 small temperature-differences, of the local currents, that for this reason only

a partial dependence on its generally higher indications can be placed. The

    * An accidental iujui-y -nliieh haiDpened to one of the solclerings was thus immediately

 detected; and the fault having been found and repaired, when the instrument was re-
.gradnated, it was found to afford, with the above resistances in its circuit, exactly the
 same proportional values of the Bcale-iudications as before.

presence of the thin layer of moist luting of linseed-meal (mixed with between

three and four times its weight of water) in the new series of experiments

makes it probable, on the other hand, that the absolute conductivities pre-

sented in the following list are under rather than above, and may occasionally

be five, ten, or, in the better-conducting rock-specimens, possibly even twenty
per cent, below their real values ; but the present arrangement of the series

in a progressive scale of the observed values of the conductivities may bo

more certainly regarded as in the main correct.
   Some experiments to compare the resistances of different rock-sections

with that of the luting and india-rubber faces between which they were
placed, with a view of obtaining relative conducting-powers more expe-
ditiously without the use of a thermopile, were also made ; but although this

method of comparison appears to be the best adapted, by its directness and sim-

plicity, for determining relative resistances, the conditions of contact and of

communication of heat across the junctions appear to be subject to so much

variation that results of great discordance only have hitherto been obtained.

Before abandoning a process which recommends itself by its ease and sim-

plicity, further experiments, however, will be tried to remove if possible,

from a method which promises in the sequel to become so much more expe-

ditious, all the most influential sources of disturbance.

The unit in which the absolute conductivities are expressed is the same as

that adopted (employing the centimetre, gramme, and second as its basis) in

the Table of the last Report ; and the absolute resistances in the fourth column

of the Table are the simple reciprocals of these, or the quotient of unity

divided by the absolute conductivities. As it is in the form of this quotient

or of the absolute resistances that the capacities of rock-strata for conducting

heat are most conveniently employed in calculation, a graphical construction,

and at the same time a convenient symbolic scale of the various grades or

degrees of absolute resistance presented by different species of rocks, is

here annexed (p. 59), with a view of exhibiting to the eye the general extent

and character of their specific variations.

Among the rock-sections re-examined, three only (Kenton sandstone,

Calton trap, and English alabaster) are displaced, in the present list, from

iheir previous order of succession. The rough and porous surface of the

Kenton sandstone placing it more effectually in contact with the moist

cement than the smooth surfaces of other rocks, may be accepted as an

explanation of the high conductivity which it now presents ; but the rough

surface of the Calton trap and the smooth faces of the alabaster (although

these rocks are not, like the specimen of sandstone, extremely porous) would

give rise to the same or to an opposite variation ; while both are lower in

the list than the smooth-faced red serpentine, which has not altered its

position. The defective indications of the first constructed thermopile may

have introduced errors of the determinations in these latter cases, whUe it

may probably be to its porosity alone that the Kenton sandstone now owes

its somewhat superior position.

The question of the effect of porosity and of the saturation of rocks with

water in increasing their conducting-power was suggested by the late

Mr. W. J. Henwood as oije deserving of the Committee's accurate investi-

gation ; and several observations for this purpose were made, of which the
resiilts are included in the Table. It was found that of three porous rocks

examined, Kenton sandstone absorbed (when freed from air in vacuo) 5"7 per

cent, of its weight of water, while its conductivity rose in consequence from

A549 to 594, or 8 per cent.  plate of fine red buUding-brick, whose absorp-

tion of water was lo'6 per cent, of its weight, received by this treatment an

increase of conductivity from 147 to 247, or 68 per cent. ; whUe a plate of

plaster of Paris which absorbed 26 per cent, of its weight of water, rose in its

conductivity by the saturation from 120 to 160, or not more than about

33 per cent. There is no appearance of regularity in these increases, but to

a more copious saturation with water it is evident that a higher proportion

of increase of the conductivity is connected ; and again, comparing the highly

conducting sandstone and the badly conducting brick or plaster, it is also

evident that to every percentage weight or measure of water absorbed by

the badly conducting substances, there corresponds a considerably greater

percentage increase of the conductivity than for the absorption of the same

percentage quantity of water by the better conductor. That this may arise

from api^reciably good conductivity of -water itself may be inferred with

some degree of probability from the observations of Prof. Guthrie*, that
films of water offer from four to fifteen times less resistance to the passage of
heat through them than those of any other liquid (mercury excepted) of

whose relative thermal resistances he obtained determinations. Prom Dr.

Sterry Hunt's recent publication f the following Table of porosities and
densities of various rocks is extracted, showing to what extent the presence

of water among such strata may be expected, according to the general

conclusions, to affect their thermal conductivities and to diminish their

resistances.

ON THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES OF CERTAIN ROCKS.  61

    Another subject of important applications in questions relating to under-
ground temperature which has engaged the attention of the Committee,
is the different degrees of facility -with which some rocks conduct heat in
different directions, recent researches by M. E, Jannettaz haviiig shown

that this property is possessed not only (as was long since shown by De

Sdnarmont) by certain crystals, but also by other mineral substances, and in a
very high degree by rocks having schistose and laminated structures. To verify
this important fact, specimens of "Welsh slate were prepared by cutting
plates from the same piece across and parallel to the plane of cleavage ; and
the rate of conduction of heat through the plates cut in the former manner
was found to be nearly twice as rapid as that through plates cut parallel to
the cleavage-plane. Thus the resistance of slate (shown in the Table) to

transmission of heat along the cleavage-planes is only half as great as that

offered to its passage across them. The example of this slate is not an
exceptional one among laminated or schistose rocks ; and the extreme ratios
of the resistances in the parallel and transverse directions to the planes of
cleavage or foliation, which have been studied and measured by M. Jan-
nettaz * in a variety of cases, exhibit some much more remarkable pro-

portions.

 ·with only rare exceptions, between 1 and 1-3:1. The ratios of the con-

 ductivities in the directions of these diameters, being the squares of the ratios
of the measured axes, range in value, for the majority of crystals, between
1 and 1'7: 1, and rarely approach the values above given for some of the

talcose and schistose rocks. It is shown in his researches that the principal
axes of conductivity in crystals are more closely related to the planes of
cleavage thaia to either the optic or the crystallographic axes, and that in
rocks of schistose structure it is to the internal texture arising from pressure
in metamorphic actions rather than to crystalline admixtures, giving to some

rocks a regularly streaked or veined appearance, that the principal develop-

ment of the property of unequal thermal conductivity in different directions
presented by this numerous class of rocks should be ascribed. These new
considerations, and the further recognition of the important part which the
saturation of certain rocks with water must exercise in determining the
distribution of underground temperature in certain cases, together with the
observation, recorded in the Table of this Eeport, of the extremely high con-
ductivity of quartz forming compact masses in the neighbourhood of i;nder-
ground workings, in some situations of considerable extent, are points of
special interest connected with the progress of this inquiry, the applications
and extensions of which, should the Committee pursue this iuquii-y further,
will form the chief object of their immediate investigations.

Preliminary Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors Roscoe,

   Balfour Stewart, and Thorpe^ apj)ointed for the purpose of ex-
   tending the observations on the Specific Volumes of Liquids. Drawn
   up by T. E. Thorpe.

We are indebted to the experimental and critical labours of Hermann Kopp

for the greater part of what we know concerning the relations between the

specific gravities of liquids and their chemical composition. Kopp has pointed

out that when the specific volumes of liquids are compared at temperatures

at which their vapour-tensions are equal, as at their boiling-points, several

remarkable relations manifest themselves. In the first place, it is found that

the specific volume of a liquid formed by the union of two other liquids is

equal to the sum of the specific volumes of its components. Secondly, Kopp

finds that isomeric liquids of the same chemical type have identical specific

CHvolumes. Thirdly, that in a series of homologues each increment of  is

attended with a constant increment in specific volume. Hence Kopp was

able to assign certain fundamental values to a number of elementary bodies,

and thus to calculate with a considerable degree of accui-acy the specific

volume, and hence the specific gravity, of many liquid substances. It also

ajjpeared probable that members of the same family of elements have identi-

cal specific volumes, or, to use Schroder's expression, are " isosterous." Thus

the analogously constituted terchlorides of arsenic and phosjAorus appear to

possess the same specific volume ; whence it follows, since no change is ob-

servable in the volume occupied by chlorine in different compounds, that the

Aspecific volumes of arsenic and phosphorus are equal.  similar conclusion

was drawn with respect to tin and titanium, members of the tetratomic group,

from an examination of their tetrachlorides.
           ON THE SPECIFIC VOLUMES OF LIQUIDS.                       G3

It must be admitted, however, that certain of these deductions are drawn

from experimental evidence, which, in the light of our present knowledge, can

hardly be deemed sufficiently comprehensive to permit of such broad genera-

lizations. For example, the examination of only four liquids can scarcely

afford adequate proof of the universality of the statement that members of

the same chemical family have identical specific volumes. The conclusion

with regard to isomerides was necessarily based on limited proof, for the

reason that the number of cases admitting of examination was limited. The

number of isomerides has now increased a hundredfold, and we have become

more precise in defining their character. The validity of the law should be

tested by an examination of well-chosen and typical isomerides, especially

among the hydrocarbons. Such an examination would not only afford mate-

rial for solving the primary question, but would incidentally serve to show

whether the specific volumes of the component elements, carbon and hydrogen,

are respectively invariable, as stated by Kopp, no matter how these elements

may be arranged in a compound with respect to each other.

It has been shown by Professor Koscoe that vanadium is a member of the

phosphorus group of elements, and that the vanadium trichloride of Eerzelins

is in reality an oxychloride of the composition VOCI3, corresponding to the

phosphoryl trichloride (POCI3). As both these analogously constituted hquids

are readily obtained in a state of purity and boil at moderately high tempe-

ratures, it seemed desirable to determine their specific volumes with a view

of obtaining further evidence on the isosterism of members of the same che-

mical family. As the result of a series of carefully conducted observations

made on preparations of a high degree of purity, we find that the specific

volumes of phosphoryl trichloride and vanadyl trichloride are distinctly

difierent, the chloride with the higher molecidar weight having the greater

Wespecific volume.  have thus been led to reopen the whole subject. Start-

ing with the observations on the question of the specific volumes of members

of the same chemical family, we find that the result foreshadowed in the case

of phosphorus and vanadium is a general one, viz. that in a series of analo-

gously constituted compounds belonging to the same chemical family, as, for

example, the trichlorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony, and the tetra-

chloride of silicon, titanium, and tin, the specific volume increases with the

molecular weight.

  We have completed the experimental work connected with the determina-

tion of the rates of expansion, boiling-points, and specific gravities, which

data (together with the molecular weights) are required to fix the specific

volume, of the following liquids :

by the pressure of other duties. The Committee, if reappointed, propose not
only to complete the reduction of the present observations (which work is

already in progress), but to extend the investigation so as to include a well-

deiined series of sulphur compounds (a number of which have been already
prepared and some partially investigated), with the view of repeating the
observations on the relation of the specific volume of sulphur to the manner
in which it is held in union. These results will also afford material for
discussing Buff's hypothesis, that the specific volume of an element varies
with its atom-fixing power. The only hydrocarbons we have hitherto in-
vestigated are ethyl amyl and heptane, both C^ Hj,,, concerning which there

is proof that, contrary to Kopp's law, their specific volumes are not iden-
tical. Should this result be confirmed by the examination of similarly
related hydrocarbons, the statement concerning the invariability of the
specific volumes of carbon and hydrogen will need modification.

Sixth Report on Barthquakes in Scotland, draivn up by Dr. Bryce,

   F.O.S. The Committee consists of Dr. Bryce, F.R.S.E., Sir W.

    Thomson, F.R.S., J. Brough, G. Forbes, F.R.S.E., D. Milne-
    Holme/ F.JS./S.S., and J. Thomson.

Dttring the year that has elapsed since the last Meeting of the Association
the Comrie district has been in a state of entire quiescence, and no earth-
quake has been reported from any other part of Scotland. Your Committee
has thus nothing of general interest to lay before the Meeting this year.

    The plea put forward at the last Meeting for an increase of the grant was
founded on the necessity felt by the Committee of having additional appa-
ratus set up at Comrie. They desired to have a check of some kind on the
indications of the seismometer belonging to the Association, which is placed
in the tower of the parish church, as well as additional means of testing both
the direction and intensity of the shocks. Por this purpose it seemed neces-
sary to have apparatus of a different kind, and to find a locality somewhat
distant from the spot where the seismometer now stands. After experimental
trial had been made of contrivances of various kinds, the method of upright
cylinders (one of those recommended by Mr. Mallet in his paper in the
* Admiralty Manual ') was adopted. The difiiculty of finding a suitable site

and a competent observer, to whom it should be a matter of perfect conveni-
ence to visit that site, next presented itself. No suitable apartment in which

to set up the cylinders could be found in the village ; and the Committee
therefore resolved to erect a small building for the special purpose. Their

wish being made known to Peter Drummond, Esq., who resides on his own

property of Dunearn, about half a mile direct distance from the parish cliurch,
and nearer to the supposed earthquake-focus, he most kindly offered a site
on the grounds surrounding his house. Here, accordingly, on a spot care-
fully selected, the building has been erected. It is founded upon a rock,
the same slate-rock of which the valley westwards to Loch Earn and the
enclosing hills are composed, and in continuity with it ; while it is completely
sheltered from the agitating influences of all winds ; so strongly built, indeed,
is it, that, even if the situation were exposed, only a storm of extreme violence

could produce any disturbing effect. No one can have access to the building
       ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.     65

but by Mr. Drummond'a permission ; and he has most kindly promised that
the cylinders shall be his constant care. Your Committee is greatly indebted
to Mr. Drummoud, not only for this promise (which is all-important for their
purpose) and for his so readily oifering a site, but also for his liberality in
making all the necessary preparations for erecting the building, so that the
cost to the Committee has been considerably diminished.

   The building is of stone and lime, very substantial, about 10 feet square,

and 11 feet high to the top of the roof, ceiled and floored. On the perfectly
level floor two narrow smooth planks are placed, one directed N. & S. and
the other E. & W. On each of these are placed six cylinders of boxwood,

carefully turned on the lathe, at such distances apart on the planks that one

cannot strike against another in falling. The floor is levelled up to the
planks with dry fine sand, on whicli the cylinders must rest, without rolling,
if they fall. The cylinders are all of the same height, but of diff'erent dia-
meters, so that they are of very various degrees of stability. In this way
the exact direction of a shock is indicated, and a rough scale of intensity is
had. The narrowest cylinder is of so small diameter that it is hoped a very
feeble shock will be marked by its fall.

   The perfect accessibility of the building for frequent and regular observa-
tion, the certain and ready response of the cylinders to any movement of the
ground, and the impossibility of the existence of any disturbing cause,

will, it is the hope of the Committee, render the results highly satisfactory as

regards the intensity and horizontal direction of any earthquake-shocks which

may occur in future years. The comparison of these with the indications of
the seismometer may lead to more important conclusions than have as yet

been obtained from this inquiry.

During the past year, from March 25th, 1874 to March 24th, 1875, the ob-

servations at Breton's Farm, near Eomford, were carried on by the Com-

mittee, though, owing partly to the want of funds at the beginning of the

year, and partly to the fact that the notched board by means of which the

flow of sewage was gauged had been removed from the trough by order of

the Surveyor to the Local Board, the experiments could not be made as com-

plete as they would otherwise have been.

Instead of gauging the sewage applied to the land, as heretofore, by direct

observations in the distributing-trough, the quantities used on the farm have

been estimated solely by the method hitherto employed to verify the trough

gaugings i. e., the sewage entering the farm during the working hours of the

engine is calculated by ordinary gaugings in the main sewer, and may be
considered as the "day" sewage ; the remainder, or the " night" sewage, is
ascertained by the difi'erent heights of liquid in the tanks at the time when

the engine stops at night and starts next morning. The quantities thus cal-

culated are given in Table I., from which we sec that the amount of sewage

received on the farm from the town during the year was 482,335 tons, a con-

siderably larger amount than in previous years ; this is partly owing to the

fact that more houses have been connected with the sewers.

The amount of effluent water added to the sewage and repumped on to the

land was 27,295 tons, making 509,630 tons as the amount of diluted sewage

received into the tanks; 491 tons of this were run into the river during es-

cessive flows, &c., and thus the total amount applied to the land was 509,139

tons.

Tables IV., V., VI. and VII. correspond with similar tables in previous

Eeports ; but especial attention is dii-ected to the note at the foot of Table VI.,

or a wrong idea may be given of the amount of crop produced per acre, espe-

cially in the ease of the Italian rye-grass.

   The total produce of the farm for the year was less (by about 200 tons)
than that of the previous one, and less also than the average of the three

preceding years, and this notwithstanding that the crops of Italian rye-grass

were really better and those of Mangold much better than those of the pre-

vious year                                                        thus in 1873-74, 18-69 acres produced 1084-94 tons  of Italian
                                                               :

rye-grass, or 58 tons per acre ; while in 1874-75, 13-95 acres produced 869
tons, or 62-3 tons per acre ; while as to Mangold, the crops in 1873-74 were
18-3 tons per acre, while in 1874-75 they were no less than 42-8 tons per

acre.

The principal reasons for the decrease in the total weight of the crops

are:

I. The increase in the acreage of the cereal crops.
II. The large quantity of land allowed to lie fallow during the winter, and

consequently the small quantity of winter greens grown as compared with

previous years.

III. The fact that five crops (four of Eape and one of Turnips) were not

carried off the land but ploughed in, and that two others (of wheat) partially

failed.

   Prom the autumn of 1874 to the end of the cropping year (March 1875),
there were 38 J acres of land entirely fallow. In addition, four crops (=10|
acres) of Eape and one crop (=6| acres) of Turnips were ploughed in, and

the land, 17| acres in all, treated as fallow. Finally, 14 acres of grass were
ploughed in during March and April, having thus, so far as produce was

concerned, been practically fallow land ; making a total of 70 acres, ornearly

two thirds of the cultivated area of the farm, unproductive during the winter
months.

On reference to Table VI. it will be seen that the aggregate acreage of aU

the crops was 130-42 as against 170-66 of the previous year, which further

illustrates the above statement ; and this quantity is also less than that of

the two other years recorded by the Committee. This is owing to the fact

that the system of cropping has been changed, since the census of the town

given in the Committee's Eeport for 1872-73 (Fifth Eeport) showed that

many of the houses in the town were not connected and many only partially

connected with the town sewer, so that it became necessaiy to manure a
much smaller area with the sewage.

But an examination of the Tables given in the present and two previous

Eeports, whilst establishing the above facts, also shows that the weight per

acre of crops produced, and the amount of nitrogen estimated to be recovered

in them, was more in the year under review than in either of the two pre-

ceding   years                                                    and the improvement  in  these respects  has  been  progressive
                               ;

during the three years, thus ;

    It is to be remarked, in the first place, that the result thus obtained for the
total nitrogen of the sewage is very near to the average results already ob-
tained ; thus in the year 1871-72 the average was 5-529, and in 1872-73 it

was 5-151 per 100,000. And as regards the effluent waters, the total nitro-

gen is below the average in all cases, and the purification, as shown by the
smaller amount of nitrogen not as nitrates, is more perfect during the last two
quarters ; this may be due to the consolidation of the earth around the drain-
age pipes ; but the Committee would not now express a decided opinion on

this point, as they intend to institute a series of experiments to investigate

the changes which go on in sewage and effluent water when kept for some

time.

   As 509,139 tons of sewage were utilized on the farm, the total amount
of nitrogen supplied was (according to the analysis of the mixed sample)
28-38 tons. Last year, from the data obtained from the two previous years,
the total amount was taken at 27 tons ; but this year an increase was ex-
pected from the fact that more houses have been connected with the sewers.

    The total amount of nitrogen recovered in the crops is estimated at 20,166

pounds, or 31-8 per cent, of the nitrogen supplied; in former years the per-
centages estimated were as follows :

1871-72                                41-76 per cent.
1872-73                                26-00 ,,
1873-74                                37-60 ,,

   The amount this year is exactly the mean of the amounts for the last two

years.

   It should be understood that in these calculations no deduction is made
for the amount of nitrogen that there would be in the normal unsewaged
produce; in other words, the figures show the relation of the nitrogen in

the total produce (not in the increase only) to that estimated to be supplied
in the sewage.

   The Committee will be able to continue their investigations, owing to the
generous liberality of a Member of the Association, and more complete
observations arc now going on again systematically at Breton's Farm.

                            Fifth Note on the Dry Earth System.

    Dr. Gilbert has, in continuation of the series of results recorded in former
Reports, furnished the Committee with the determination of tlie nitrogen

(by the soda-limo process) in soil which has now passed through a Moule's
earth-closet six times. The results of the series are as follows :
8^ REPORT 1875.

the General Committee of the Association, as expressed in their Resolution,
might be carried out.

   No complete account of the work of the last twelve months has yet been

received from Lieut. Conder, E.E., the officer in charge of the Survej- ; but
from his monthly reports to the Committee of the Fund, it would appear that,

since the grant of £100 was made, the triangulation of Palestine has been

carried southwards as far as Beersheba, and that a large tract of interest-
ing country, including the plain of Philistia and the southern slopes of the
mountains of Judah, has been surveyed and plotted on a scale of one inch to

 a mile.

    Amongst other results have been the recovery of several ancient sites, and
the corrections of many errors in the topography of Southern Palestine,

    Lieuts. Conder and Kitchener, E..E., were recently engaged in running a
line of levels from the Mediterranean to the Sea of Galilee ; but this work
was unfortunately stopped by the attack made upon Lieut. Conder and his
party by the people of Safed.

    Lieut. Conder, who was badly wounded, has been unable to send a full

report on the levelling; but in a letter written shortly before the affray he
mentioned that more than ten miles, or about one third of the levelling, had
been completed, and gave some details of the manner in which the work was
being carried out. The line of levels was being run by two independent
 observers (non-commissioned officers from the Ordnance Survey) ; bench-
 marks were being cut at frequent intervals, and their position fixed by a line
 of traverse survey from the Mediterranean to the Sea of Galilee, which will

 be laid down on the one-inch survey.
    Lieut.-Gen. Sir Henry James, the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey,

 was kind enough to lend instrument? for the work, and he has taken much

 interest in its progress.

     In consequence of the attack on the Survey party and the spread of cholera,
 it has been decided to withdraw Lieut. Conder and his staff from Palestine for
 the present ; but as soon as the Survey is recommenced the levelhng will be

 completed.

  Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Harkness,

    Prof. Prestwich, Prof. Hughes, Rev. H. W. Crosskey, Prof. W.

     Boyd Dawkins, Messrs. C. J. Woodward, George Maw, L. C.
     MiALL, G. H. Morton, one? J. E. Lee, appointed for the purpose of

      recording the position, height above the sea, lithological characters,

     size, and origin of the more important of the Erratic Blocks of
     England and Wales, reporting other matters of interest connected

     with the same, and taking measures for their preservation. Drawn
    up hij the Rev. H. W. Crosskey, Secretary.

  The Committee have received many valuable contributions regarding the
  occurrence and distribution of Erratic Boulders, The inquiry is not yet

  sufficiently exhaustive in its details to permit of any generalization ; and the
  Committee find it necessary to continue their record without attempting as
  yet to connect the facts they report with theories of the history of the glacial

  epoch.

      It will be observed, however, (1) that our knowledge of the extent of
ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND AND WALES.  83

country over which erratic blocks are distributed is considerably increased
(2) that the erratic blocks arc connected together more clearly in definite

groujis, distinctly jiointing to special centres of distribution; (3) that the

grouping and distribution of the blocks are throwing light upon the periods
into which the glacial epoch must be divided.

                                                   Devonshire.

   Mr. W. Pengelly, F.R.S., F.G.S., reports the following particulars regard-

ing boulders and scratched stones in South Devonshire.

                 1. The New Bed Sandstone boulders of Waddeton.

    These occur on the left bank of the river Dart, from 3 to 4 miles north

of Dartmouth, on the estate of Mr. Studdy. Between the Dart and Wad-

deton Court, and within sight of the latter, three subangular masses are
imbedded in the soil. So far as it is visible, the largest measures 6 feet

by 3 feet, and the others are not much smaller.
    They occupy the augailar points of an isosceles triangle, of which the base,

having the direction N". 78° W. to S. 78° E. magnetic, is 30 paces long,

whilst the sides are about 50 paces each. In an orchard are numerous pits
whence boulders have been dug up from time to time, and one specimen in
situ measures 3 feet long and 2 broad. In the front garden of a neighbour-
ing farmhouse is an undisturbed boulder. That portion of it which is visible
is considerably rounded, and measures 9 feet in mean diameter ; its base is

also weU rounded, and it lodges on undisturbed Devonian slate. This spe-

cimen has the appearance of a transported block. Adjacent to the same
farmhouse is the site of a boulder which has been broken up and removed
by Mr. Studdy, and, from his description, must have been fully 10 feet in

mean diameter. On the surface of a boulder projecting from the base of a

hedge there are several parallel grooves, crossed by a second set also parallel
to one another. This is the only fact suggestive of glacial scratches ; but it
is not sufficiently pronounced to justify the opinion that the lines were due
to such an agency.

    These boulders consist of very hard, more or less micaceous red sandstone.
All that have been found were imbedded in the soil, and, when dislodged,
all that portion of their surfaces which had been protected from the air was
very soft and friable, but soon hardened on exposure. So far as has been
noted, they all occupy areas having a slate subsoil.

    Their heights above mean tide are estimated to be generally from about
 70 to nearly 200 feet ; but a large specimen has been found not more than
from 15 to 20 feet above low water, which appears undisturbed by man.

    The boulders being in much request by architects, on aecouut of the hard-
 ness and durability of the stone, are sent off to Dartmouth and elsewhere

 throughout a considerable district.

    Besides the sandstone boulders there are two of dolomitized limestone : one
 of them, between the Dart and "Waddeton Court, is rudely globular, and
 about 2'5 feet in mean diameter ; the other is in a field adjacent to that in
 which there is an old well covered with a red sandstone boulder.

  --The following questions present themselves respecting the red boulders

 just described: 1st. Are tlaey travelled masses? 2nd. If so, whence did

 they come ? 3rd. When were they lodged where they now lie ? 4th. What

 was the agent of transportation ?

    1st. The New Eed Sandstone system, as a continuous formation, reached
                                                                           g2

its southern terminatioa in the fine cliff forming the northern boundary of
(loodrington Sands, Torbay, about 2 miles in a straight line north-east
from Waddoton ; but several " outliers " exist to the south aud west of that

--point, aud some of them far removed from it namely, between Goodrington

Sands and Saltern Cove, between Saltern Cove and Broad Sands, two very
small masses near the top of the cliff between lierry Head aud Mudstono
Bay, at the village of Slaptou on the shore of Start Bay, at Thurlestone in
Bigbury Bay, and near Cawsand in Plymouth Sound. If these numerous
outliers on all sides of Waddeton be taken as evidence of the denudation of

a great volume of New Bed rocks in the south and west of Devon (and on this

there will probably be little hesitation), it is possible that the blocks vinder

notice may be, not travelled masses, but remnants in situ of New Bed beds
which once covered the older formations now exclusively occupying the

district. It is no doubt true that the form they now bear is not inconsistent

with transportation ; and it is equally true that the waves, which possibly

did the work of denudation, may have left them in situ and would have
reduced them to the shape they now have.

   2nd. Neither in the New Bed Sandstone cliffs forming almost the entire

coast of South-eastern Devon from Torbay to the confines of Dorsetshire, nor
in any of the outliers already mentioned, with the exception of the two small
masses near Berry Head, is there any sandstone having a hardness at all
approaching that of the Waddeton boulders. The blocks, therefore, if they
Jiave travelled, and if their parent beds must be pointed out, certainly connect
themselves with the Berry-Head outliers, upwards of 4 miles off as the crow

flies, to the exclusion of all other sources, rinless, indeed, they are fragments

of certain weU-knowu dykes to be briefly described immediate^. Boulders
similar to those at "Waddeton are by no means rare on the Berry-Head
plateau ; and a large subangular mass of the same material lies at the base of
the raised beach between Berry Head and Berry-Head House.

    The Devonian Limestone, forming the southern shore of Torbay, is tra-

versed by almost vertical dykes of New lied Sandstone, M'hich form two
systems, one having a direction which may be conveniently termed east and

west, whilst the other runs from north to south. The east and Avcst system
is well exposed at intervals from Berry Head to the railway-cutting at the
southern end of the viaduct crossing Broad Sands, about 1-5 mile east of
Waddeton. This body of limestone extends to Waddeton, where it termi-
 nates. It is extensively quarried at Galmpton Creek, on the right bank of
 the Dart ; but there are no traces there of such Eed Sandstone dykes as have
 been already described.

     3rd. Tlie fact that the boulders at the Churston station, on the tableland

 known as Galmpton Common, were completely buried in the soil, may be

 taken as evidence that a considerable time has elapsed since they were lodged
 there ; and this is borne out by the more or less corresponding condition of

 most of those at Waddeton. Nevertheless, if man has neither disturbed the
 specimen mentioned as occupying the very low position in the meadow nor

 those at higher levels, the general contour of the district can have undergone

 very little change since they were deposited where they now are, and the

 date of that event cannot be very remote geologically.
     4th. Assunung the boulder formerly adjacent to the farmhouse, and

 broken up by Mr. Studdy, to have been 10 feet in mean diameter, that its
 form was spherical or nearly so, and that its specific gravity Avas 2-5, or not
 above that of common stone, it must have measured upwards of 500 cubic
 feet and weighed fully 36 tons. It is no doubt possible for such Mavcs as
ON THE EKKATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND AND WALES.  85

occasionally break on the British coast to move a mass having this volume

and weight; but it maybe safely concluded that they could never have

transported it across a submarine valley having a depth at all approaching

that of the valleys which now separate "VVaddeton from any area at present

occupied by the New lied Sandstone formation. The very soft and friable

character of their surfaces when first dug out of the soil renders it eminently

improbable that if they had ever borne glacial scratches they could have
retained them, aud forbids the attempt to come to any conclusions from the
more absence of such marks.

    The difi<erent levels at which they are found, the present configuration of
the siirfacc of the district, and the great weight of some of them, gives pro-
bability to the opinion that the boulders have reached Waddeton from some
part of the district lying between Berry Head and Galmpton. Common, and
that they were transported by ice, although no certain decision can as yet be

reached.

                         2, The Scratched Stones of Englehourne.

    Mr. Pengelly reports that, under the guidance of Mr. Paige-Brown, he
examined these scratched stones.

   The stones in situ were eight in number, all in that part of Mr. Paige-
Brown's property known as " Wise's Englebourue." The first was in " The
Meadow," aud all the others in a field called " Great Yackland." They are
all of fine-grained trap, of close texture, and extremely tough ; one of them,

which has been broken, displays a schistose fracture, and may be a trap ash.
Their heights above mean tide do not differ vcrj' much, and are estimated at

about 100 feet. The lowest specimen is about 6 feet above the bottom of

the valley.

    No. 1, near the lower gateway of " The Meadow," measures 2-5 feet in

length, 1"5 in greatest breadth, and at least 1 foot in depth. No attempt

was made to ascertain to what depth it penetrated the soil. It is angular,
the upper surface smooth, with the edges and ridges ro\mded off, which is
not the case with the lateral faces. There are numerous grooves on it, quite
distinct but not sharp ; aud whilst most of them are sensibly parallel, and

have the direction S. 40° E. and N. 40° W, magnetic, a few cross them in

different directions.

   No. 2 (the first we inspected in " Great Yackland ") has had a portion

broken off recently, but its further destruction was stayed by the proprietor.
The remnant is larger than No. 1, and it is much more rounded than that
mass. It has on it two sets of parallel grooves, one having the direction of

E. 10° N. and W. 10° S. magnetic, whilst those of the second or less nu-

merous set cross them in the direction of the magnetic meridian.
    No. 3, not far from No. 2, is subangular, and has numerous grooves, all in

the direction N. 20° W. to S. 20° E. magnetic.

    No. 4, a short distance from Nos. 2 and 3, has probably been disturbed by
man. It has two systems of parallel grooves.

    No. 5, near No. 4, has also two systems of parallel grooves.
    No. 6, also near No. 4, does not appear to bear any grooves.
    No. 7 is some distance south of the group 4, 5, and 0. Its length and
breadth are nearly equal; some of its edges are partially rounded, and it has
 two systems of parallel grooves.
    No. 8, near No. 7, has an almost square upper face, and docs not appear
 to be scratched.
    Of all the specimens No. 2 is the largest and, undoubtedly, the most iu-
--86 REPORT 1875.

teresting ; and No. 1 ia probably the next in interest. They all rest on a
slate subsoil, ·which crops up in certain places.

   That the stones have travelled some distance there cannot be a doubt ; for
whilst they are detached and trappean, they occupy an area having slate as

its subsoil.

    That thoy have not travelled far is highly probable, from the fact that trap
occurs ill situ on almost every side of Englebom-ne, at distances varying from
3 miles to 2-2 miles, to say nothing of numerous remoter masses. Of those
in the immediate neighbourhood, one of the largest, about 1*6 mile north,
measures 1"7 mile in length by 3 miles in greatest breadth, and is separated

by the little river Harber from a much smaller mass on the west side of that

stream.

    Their size is so inconsiderable as to leave no room for doubt as to their
mobility imder the action of waves or violent floods ; but to this mode of
transport there is the grave objection that, with the exception of No. 2, they
are not suificiently rounded, even though due allowance is made for their
hard and tough character.

    It appears impossible to account for the grooves otherwise than by sup-
posing them to have been produced by ice-transportation. That the famous
granite boulder of Barnstaple Bay was ice-borne was shown in a previous
 licport. That Bovey Heathfield was, during a very recent geological period,
 cold enough to be the habitat of the arctic and alpine Betula nana is a well-
 established fact, and the thick accumulation known as the " Head " on Bovey
 Heathfield is explicable on the glacial rather than on any other hypothesis
 and were it not that glacial scratches have never been detected on the lofty
 tors of Dartmoor, where, if anywhere in Devonshire, they might have been
 expected, rather than on the low grounds about Engiebourne, more certainty
 would attach to the opinion that these scratched stones are proofs of glacial
 conditions in South Devon, aud that, as such, they contribute largely to the

 solution of the problem of the New Eed Sandstone boulders of Waddeton,

 from 5 to 6 miles further east.

                                                  Heetfokdshiee.

     Mr. E. P. Greg, F.G.S., reports a group of small boulders in the parish of
 Westmill, near Buntiugford, in the N.E. of Hertfordshire, and 30 miles due
 north of Greenwich.

     About 1 foot aud 2| feet. Several found in same field, some 50 yards or

  BO apart.

    Much rounded to subaugular, angular, and slightly oblong in general form.
    No groovings or striations visible.

      Nearest point certainly Derbyshii'o.
     90 to 100 miles distant exactly N.E.

     The boulders are composed of ordinary Mountain-limestone.
     320 feet above sea ; about 70 feet above river Rib.

    No others have been noticed in Hertfordshire, except three or four in tliis

  cue field, which lies in a slope, with east aspect, about 70 feet above the
  river Eib, which runs here to the south.

     The boulders in question were not exposed on the surface, but turned up
  in draining. Drains 3 feet deep. Soil a clayey loam overlying the chalk,
 which in these parts is more or less covered with clay and gravel to depths
  of 6 inches to 30 feet or more.

    The Committee has been favoured -with the following report from the Eev.
A. Irving, P.G.S., of the High School, Nottingham.

    1. The boulder and clay deposits herein referred to are scattered over higher

parts of the imdulating country of the parishes of Plumtreo, >Stanton-on-the-

"Wolds, Kegworth, and Widmerpool, in South Notts. The new line of rail-
way, along which they are exposed at present, may be traced on the map

running to the west of Plumtree, then converging towards the turnpike-road
from Plumtree to Over Broughton. The line runs for several miles near
and almost parallel to this road.

   2. The dimensions of the largest boulder measured are 4| x 2 x 1 feet. It

is of Lias limestone, and near the surface of the ground at the top of the hill
through which passes the cutting between Stanton and Plumtree.

    The smallest boulders are not bigger than a man's fist.
    Quartzite pebbles of all sizes (as if from the Banter) also abound in the

boulder-deposits.

    3. Those of the Lias limestone are generally angular or only slightly sub-

angular.

    Those of MiLLstono-grit or Carboniferous limestone are generally rounded
very much.

    4. The direction of the longest axis of the largest boulder mentioned,
and of several others observed in the same section, was very nearly duo N.
and S.

    5. (a) The strice are numerous on certain boulders, but not on any very
great proportion of them. They are generally several inches in length, and

seldom exceed a lino in depth.

    {b) The striae are very variable with respect to the parts of the boulders

striated.

    (c) The striae are generally in the direction of the longest axes.
    6. (1) The boulders of Lias limestone, which greatly preponderate, are
derived, in all probability, from the Liassic strata of the immediate neighbour-
hood, upon which (as shown in the works of the tunnel at Stanton) the
boulders partly lie. (2) The nearest Millstone-grit is found at Castle Ben-
nington and Stanton-by-Dale, in Derbyshire, on opposite sides of the Trent
valley ; the former place 12 miles south of west, the latter 12 mUes north

of west from the deposits in which they now occur. (3) The nearest Car-

boniferous limestone which corresponds precisely with that of the boulders
is at TicknaU, in Derbyshire, about 18 miles distant south of west.

   8, The height of the group above the sea is about 200 feet.
    9. The extent of boulder and clay deposits is at least several square mUes,

if we include the vast accumulation of drift which caps the tops of aU the hills

about the district, and is exposed in the road-cuttings as well as on the rail-
way. In the cutting between Plumtree and Stanton the boulders are largest
and most numerous, and are mingled with an immense number of quartzite
pebbles, the whole being in some places so completely bound together as to
be almost conglomeratic. In the tunnel (near Stanton) 70 feet of a true
boulder-clay are passed through ; but in this the large (Lias) boulders occur
less frequently, and the pebbles are more thinly scattered. This tunnel

penetrates the hiU between Stanton and Bank House (Ord. map). The same
kind of clay-deposit (or drift) is cut through by the cutting close to Kowhac

Cover and by that near "Widmerpool New Inn. This clay is extremely

tenacious.
88 REPORT-- 1875.

    10. Very few of the boulders are found at the surface.
    In that which is most characteristically a houlder-de'posit (between Plum-
tree and (Stanton) the boulders are covered entirely by a later drift-deposit,
composed mainly of red marl, as if from the Xeuper, mingled with a smaller
proportion of Lias clay, and containing a few specimens of rolled Gryplicea.
Here the boulder- deposit fills up a hollow in the Ehsetie beds, the erosion of
the strata having gone entirely through the Avicula-contorta beds into the
blue-grey marls below. At the tunnel and further south the boulder-clay
rests upon the Lias.

 --Bromsgrove district. Ninety-three boulders have been examined in this

district, many of them of considerable size. In addition to a few derived

from local rocks, they appear to consist of three varieties of fclspathic rock

(1) one variety compact, (2) one with small porphyritie crystals, and (3)
one a decided ash. The colour of the rock is dark grey to light grey, some-

times with a greenish tinge, but generally bluish. Evidences abound of a

very great destruction of boulders in this district from time immemorial.

Many have been buried to get them out of the way, and many broken up

for building-purposes. It is impossible, therefore, to generalize upon their
distribution ; but in the mean time it is very noticeable that no specimens

of granite boulders have yet been observed in the Bromsgrove district,
although they occur so abundantly around Wolverhampton. The following

is a list of the principal boulders in this locality. The Committee are
under great obligations to Mr. G. Dipple, of Pord House, for his invaluable

assistance.

   Mr. C. J. Watson has pointed out a group of boulders between Northfield

and King's Norton. They occur in an excavation immediately above the

letter d of Northfield on the Ordnance Map. Eleven large and some smaller
are found within a radius of 20 yards ; and many others are scattered through
the fields immediately arormd and extending towards the railway. They are

of felstone and felspathic ash. The specific gravity of one of them was 2-63.

    llev. J. M. L. Aston, Vicar of King's Norton, reports a group of boulders

of greenish felstone, some of which are worked into the masonry of the
fonndation of the church-tower and others imbedded in rubbish. They are

subangular, and the exposed surfaces are often rounded. The largest is

6'x4' 6"xr C".
  A boulder of compact felstone has been found in Cannon Hill Park, Bir-

mingham, G' X 4' 3" X 4', rounded in parts and subangular, and to some extent
smoothed and polished. It was dug out of valloy-drift in making a lake.

    These Worcestershire felspathic boulders are probably from AValcs. They

are in positions which indicate that they have dropped from floating ice rather

than been deposited by land-ice. Signs of land-ice in the Midlands must be

looked for in boulder-clays at considerable depths beneath the general drift.

Your Committee have taken all the steps in their power to complete the
reduction al work already in hand, and have succeeded with two exceptions,
each of which is only partial. The first, and one which is essential to the
completeness of our work and invaluable to all future inquirers, is a list of
all observations made in the British Isles from the earliest to the present
time. The second is an abstract of about 800 position returns, which wiU

indicate the value to be attached to the different current observations. Both
of these works are in a very forward state.

   With a view to facilitate reference to our reports, and of placing before
the Association an epitome of what we have done, our Secretary has em-
bodied in this Report a ^precis of the rainfall work done by your Committee.

development is a short note in the British Association Eeport, 1861, -Sections,
page 74, which is as follows ;

                      " On British Rainfall. By Gr. J. Symons.

    " The author directed attention to the very contraiy statements current on

--the question Is there any secular variation in the amount of British rain-

faU?
    " After quoting several of the most important opinions, he stated that, in

the hope of finally settling the question, he had commenced collecting all
known rain-registers, and had already tabulated [an aggregate of] more than
6000 years' observations.

   " He proceeded to invite criticism on the mode of discussion which he in-

--tended to adopt, and also on a proposed method of delineation, the rainfall

in 1860, at 241 stations in Great Britain, being laid down on a large map as

a specimen."

    In 1862, Mr. Symons submitted a paper giving the monthly fall during
1860-61 at 453 stations, preceded by remarks that unless all gauges were
accurate, well placed, and their heights above the ground and above sea-
level known, their results were not comparable.

    This could only be thoroughly ensured by gauges being visited and tested
in situ b)^ some competent person.

    This paper also contained Tables comparing the mean rainfall of the two
 years 1860-61 with that of the ten years 1850-59, and a short one com-

 paring that of the above-mentioned ten years with several very long series
 of years. "NYc reprint this short Table, as it remarkably supports the results
subsequently obtained by entirely different methods.

   111 1863 the only paper submitted was a short description of some ex-
perimental gauges erected by Colonel Ward at Calnc, Wilts ; but Mr. Symons
was requested to report upon the rainfall of the British Isles during the years
1862 and 1863, and the sum of =£20 was placed at his disposal for the purpose

--of constructing and transmitting rain-gauges to districts where observations

were not then made the gauges to be sent within the British Isles, and

the loan to be cancelled should the observations not be satisfactorily made.

In 1864 the Report dealt with the steps taken to secure additional sta-

tions, stated whither the gauges purchased out of the grant had been sent,

reported the establishment, at the cost and under the personal care of Major

Mathew, of an extensive series of stations in the Snowdonian district, as to

the rainfall of which hardly any thing was known, and the testing in situ

of a considerable number of rain-gauges. It concluded with the biannual

series of tables of rainfall, viz. those for 1862 and 1863, and remarks

Athereupon.                grant of =£30 for the same purposes as in the previous year

was passed.

In 1865 an important Report was drawn up by Mr. Symons; it was

divided into five principal                     sections :  (1) what had been                        done prior to 1860
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

(2) what has               been           done  since   1860                       (3) what remains  to  be  done                     (4)  a
                                                                                ;                                                  ;

few particulars respecting the rainfall of the last fifty j-ears and the fall in

1864                       (5) a list of  all stations  in  the                    British  Isles at which rainfall obser-
                        ;

vations were known to have been made, with details respecting them.

   Sections (1) and (5) jointly give a nearly complete history of the rainfall
obsei-vations made in this country from their commencement in 1677 to 1864,

and notes of publications upon the subject. Section (2) explains the steps
taken by Mr. Symons to collect and arrange these old observations, to pub-

lish current ones, to examine rain-gauges in situ and also, before despatch,

to secure uniformity in records of rainy days (by the adoption of O'Ol in. of

rain as the unit), and to secure tolerably equal geographical distribution for

the stations. It also briefly notices the necessity for accurate determinations

of the influence of elevation above the ground and of variations in the re-

ceiving area, and states that experimental determination of these values was

in progress. Also notifies the reestablishment of the mountain rain-gauges

in the Western Lake-district and the new series in North Wales.

   Section (3) was devoted to what remains to be clone, and need not be con-

sidered at length. Much of what was then (1865) described as necessary

has been accomplished, and will therefore be subsequently mentioned ; but

quite as much remains to be done ; e. g., the search for old records at the
British Museum has been entirely stopped for several years, and the exami-

nation of gauges in situ has by no means reached its proper development.

   Section (4) gave a few joarticulars respecting the rainfall of the last fifty
years and the fall in 1864. This was the first approximation to the deter-

mination of the fluctuation of the fall of rain over a large extent of country

but as it was followed by a far more elaborate and rather difi'erent investi-

gation, its interest is merely historical and confirmatory. At this (the

Birmingham) Meeting (in 1865) it was resolved that Mr. Symons should

--have the assistance and support of a Committee ; and the following were the

members originally appointed : J. Glaisher, F.R.S., Lord AVrottesIey,

F.R.S., Professor Phillips, F.R.S., Professor Tyndall, P.R.S., Dr. Lee,

F.R.S., J. ¥. Bateman, P.R.S., R. W. Mylne, F.R.S., C. Brooke, F.R.S.,

G. J. Symons, Secretary.
--94 REPORT 1875.

   In 1866 a very long Report was presented by your Committee ; the prin-
cipal subjects may be briefly mentioned. In November 1865 a circular

letter was sent to the Editor of nearly every newspaper published in the
British Isles, with a request for its insertion in the next iss|ie ; the letter
gave a brief outline of the necessity for rainfall observations) and invited
communications from any persons who possessed old records or were willing

to become observers. About 1400 of these circulars were issued, many

hundred newspapers reprinted them, so that upwards of a million copies
must have been circulated. This produced an enormous influx of letters and
material additions, both to the store of old observations and to the list of
current observers. The Eeport contained full details of aU the gauges ex-
amined in situ up to that date, viz. 166 ; also short notices of a series of
inclined and tipping-funnelled rain-gauges erected at Eotherham by Mr.'
Chrimes, and on river-mists in the Thames valley. But the special feature
of the Report, and one which is at present unequalled in this or any other
country, is the determination of the fluctuation of the rainfall of England
during 140 consecutive years, viz. from 1726 to 186.5. As all the original
data are given in the Report, it is open to any one to verify the conclusions
arrived at. Lastly, the Report contained the usual biannual tables of monthly

rainfall.

   In the 1867 Report the principal fresh subjects are notes respecting the

desirability of establishing fresh stations in the vicinity of the Peak of Derby-
shire and in the Eastern Lake-district, of the perccH^rtf/e of annual rain
tvhicJi falls monthly in different localities, and on an extensive system for ap-
proximately determining the height of rain-gauge stations above sea-level.
The Report also contains details respecting the examination of 75 stations

visited during the year.

The 1868 Report deals briefly with the results obtained by the inclined

experimental gauges at Rotherham, and shows the similarity of monthly

--cm-ves representing                                                (1) ratio  of rainfall  at  25 feet to that    at 1 foot                                  (2)
                                                                                                                                                            ;

velocity            of wind                                     (3)  mean  angle  from       vertical  of  falling  rain.   It then
                                                             ;

notices the removal of the Calne experimental gauges to Strathfield Turgiss.

The Report proceeds to embody the results of the discussion of about 40,000

monthly values in order to determine the laws which regulate the monthly

percentage of annual rainfall in different districts, and gives tabular state-

ments of the results, and factors for eliminating the disturbing element due

to the fact that the influence of elevation above ground varies with the time

of year. The usual biannual tables of monthly rainfall are given, also a

Table comparing the fall 186Q-67 with the average for 1850-59, raised by

A5 per cent, in accordance with the Table published in 1862.                                                                valuable

paper by Professor Phillips was printed as an Appendix, in which he dis-

cussed the quantity of rain falling in the Lake-district.

 --The 1869 Report contains (1) a code of rules for observers ; (2) a

sketch and description of Mr. Symons's first pattern of storm rain-gauge,

adapted for the accurate measurement of heavy falls of rain of short dura-

tion                (3) an abstract                                  and discussion  of  the     results   of  the  gauges  erected,
                 ;

first at Calne and then at Strathfield Tiirgiss, to determine the influence of

size and shape i;pon the amount of rain indicated by rain-gauges : there

were twelve gauges, of which the diameters ranged from 1 to 24 inches ; and

the final result was that, excluding the gauge 1 inch in diameter, which

everywhere collects less pro rata than any other, the gauges while at Calne

only difFerod 5-8 per ccut., the largest quantity being recorded by those

gauges which "were most easily managed, viz. those 5, 6, and 8 inches in

diameter, and that at Strathfield Turgiss they agreed still more closely, all

but  the  1-inch  and 24-inch  agreeing within  1'5  per cent.                              (4) the Report
                                                                                         ;

also contains the results of the visitation of 54 rain-gauge stations.

In the autumn of 1869 our Secretary visited aud examined every rain-

gauge station in Cornwall, and also those in the Scilly Isles, and thirty-two

of the Devonshire stations, besides personally starting several new ones on

Dartmoor.

   The 1870 Report deals first with the establishment of thirty new stations

provided with instruments by this Association, then proceeds to notice the
above-mentioned extensive examination tour, 97 stations being reported upon.
This is followed by a brief history of experimental determinations of the de-
crease of rainfall with height, and a detailed description and thorough ana-
lysis of the monthly results obtained at Calne. The Report also contains the
biannual tables for 1868-69.

   The 1871 Report calls prominent attention to the necessity which exists

for systematic inspection of stations. It then gives a specimen of forms
which were issued to all observers, requesting particulars of the position and
surrounding objects of their gauges. After brief notes upon the establish-

ment of some new stations in North Derbyshire, and upon the results of some

experiments with " Isolated level " or " pit " rain-gauges, the Report pro-
ceeds to notice the results of the discussion of aU British rainfall registers
which were absolutely continuous from January 1st, 1860 to December 31st,

--1869 (1) with reference to their bearing on the question of the existence

or otherwise of secular variation of rainfall in the British Isles, and (2) as

data indicative of the distribution of rain over the country.

   The 1872 Report explains the steps taken in consequence of the strong

representations made to your Committee at Edinburgh respecting tlie neces-

sity for additional stations in the Highlands, viz. the establishment of ten
stations principally on the west coast, through the cooperation of the Secre-
tary of the Scottish Meteorological Society, and of about thirty along the
Highland and Dingwall and Skye railways, through the kindness of the
Directors of those companies.

   It announces the presentation by this Committee to the Scottish Meteoro-
logical Society of a set of standard measures for the complete verification of
rain-gauges, together with the necessary note-books, the understanding being
that the Secretary of that Society shall from time to time communicate to this
Committee the results obtained by its employment. It concludes with a dis-
cussion of the rainfall of the years 1870-71, and the usual biannual tables.

   The 1873 Report calls attention to the existence of many districts where

additional stations are necessary, but suggests the postponement of any

special effort towards their supply until the revised edition of the list of
stations published in the Report of this Association for 1865 is completed.

The original list has, mainly in consequence of the development of the work
under the auspices of the Committee, become obsolete, as it does not contain
more than two thirds of the data now collected. The new list will contain
notes of all records known at the date of publication, and will be extremely
valuable to future inquirers. The Report proceeds to state the result of the
issue of the Position Inquiry forms mentioned in the 1S71 Report, upwards
--96 KEPORT 1875.

of 800 of which elaborate returns were received. Although these returns
would never remove the necessity for personal inspection, which all expe-
rience, both British and foreign, shows to be essential, yet they are ex-
tremely valuable as showing the districts in which that inspection is
most needed. The monthly percentage of total annual fall during the
decade 18G0-69, as based upon more than thirty-eight thousand monthly
amounts, is then thoroughly discussed, and the inquiry is supplemented
by an analysis of several long registers, viz. seventeen registers which indi-
vidually extend over 40 years, four which extend over 50 years, and one
which exceeds 60 years. Lastlj^ the Eeport gives the details of the inspec-
tion of 63 stations.

   The 1874 (and last) Report opens with some remarks upon the comple-

tion of the abstracts of the position returns and the difficulty respecting their
publication, which arises from their very voluminous nature ; it then proceeds
to the subject of the examination of gauges in situ, and dwells with satisfac-
tion on the number inspected. The progress of the list of stations, which has
been upwards of five years in hand, is stated ; reference is made to the
paiicity of stations in Ireland ; and then details are given of the inspection by
our Secretary of the East-Cumberland mountain gauges, which were pre-
sented to this Committee in 1869, and have since been kept in operation at
their expense. After mentioning a few minor matters, the Eeport proceeds

to discuss fully the exceptional rainfall of 1872 and its many unprecedented
features. The usual biannual tables for 1872-73 are then given, and the

Report ends with the results of the examination in situ of 77 gauges.

The foregoing outline of the contents of our Reports will give an idea of

the very important work which has been accomplished under the supervision

of }'our Committee ; but no one could fully realize its amount without going

carefully through the various branches of work and considering what eacli

Weimplies.  may be permitted to give one illustration. The last line of

the above narrative states that '·' the Report ends with the results of the ex-

amination in situ of 77 gauges.'' Now these stations range from Cumber-

laud to Southampton, from Kent  to  Devon                            they are scattered over thirteen
                                                                  ;

counties ; they include such difficultly accessible places as "VValshaw Dean,

Halifax, Dartmoor Prison, and Mardale Green, Haweswater, and have in-

volved at least 1500 miles of travel in order to inspect them.

  We proceed to report what occurred at Belfast in 1874 and the work

resulting therefrom. With reference to the engineering paper on the drain-

age of the Shannon &c., considerable attention was drawn to the small

number of raiu stations in Ireland, which deficiency we had mentioned in

our Report. Eventually, on our reappointment at Belfast, we were instructed

to obtain additional stations in Ireland, and a special grant was entrusted to

us for the purpose.

Without entering into details respecting the steps which wo took to obtain

additional stations, it will be sufficient to mention that they were so success-

ful that we received 190 offers of assistance. The acceptance of all these

offers would have involved an expenditure far beyond the funds at our dis-

posal ; and your Committee were therefore reluctantly compelled to make a
careful selection, resulting, however, in the establishment of 66 stations, many

of them in localities of extreme importance.

ON THE RAINFALL OF THE BRITISH ISLES.                            97

In explanation of the large number -wliich we have been enabled to erect

ont of our small grant, we are bound to state that several have been erected

at the expense of private individuals, that we are largely indebted to Mr.

Eason of Dublin, who not only gratuitously transmitted all the gauges from

London to Dublin, but also subsequently despatched them by various routes

to the destinations directed by our Secretary. "We are also indebted to him

for 100 copies of a map of Ireland, which has been very useful for working

purposes, and generally for much assistance. As to the localities, they will

bo best appreciated by reference to the map (Plate III.). In order to pre-

vent any dereliction of duty on the part of the observers, wc have instructed

them to report monthly ; and we are glad to say that they arc working very

Wesatisfactorily.  need hardly state that the organization of this large

series of stations involved considerable expense, and occupied much time, as

the organization of each station involved several letters. Subsequently all

our efforts have been concentrated on the compilation of the revised edition

of the list of stations and observations to which we have so often referred.

We hoped that it would be completed for the present meeting, and have used

every possible exertion to secure that object, so that we might not only show

the Association precisely what we have done, but also, if they wish it, ter-

minate with partial completeness our labours in connexion with the Associ-

ation. Conscious that without accuracy scientific work is useless, we have

had every entry extracted in duplicate and every difference rigorously ex-

amined ; the result, however, is that we are only able to present in its per-

fect form the list for the first six divisions, which include twenty-seven

counties.

   The Position returns have all been carefully reduced and analyzed, but the
final abstract of them for publication has not yet been prepared. The col-
lection of these returns having been suggested by their eminent member Mr.
J. F. Bateman, C.E., F.R.S., j'our Committee were desirous to consult him

respecting the manner in which they could best be utilized, and instructed

their Secretary to do so. Unfortunately, however, his severe illness has pre-

vented any stejjs being taken in the matter.
   As, in the opinion of your Committee, it is not desirable that these works

should be left in their present incomplete state, they are obliged to ask for

reappointment.

   In conclusion, looking back over the past fifteen years, wc find among the

--work accomplished the following items : the number of stations raised from

241 to nearly 2000 ; the influence of size and shape on the indications of
rain-gauges has been experimentally examined, and also the effect of height

above ground ; the laws which regulate the seasonal distribution of rainfall
have been ascertained ; the secular variation of annual fall has been approxi-
mately determined ; a code of rules has been drawn up for observers ; nearly
250 stations have been started at the cost of the Association, and 629 stations

have been visited and the gauges examined by our Secretary.

   AVe have obtained and supported observations on mouutain-tops and other in-

I

accessible places where no observations had been made, in Cumberland, West-

moreland, Wales, and Scotland, and also an extensive series in Ireland.

When the works actually in hand are completed, we shall also have furnished

an index to all observations hitherto made, and a guide to the value to be

attached to the returns from at least a thousand observers.

   Your Committee cannot conclude without expressing their hope that, as
the system of rain-gauges in Ireland has l)cen established with such remark-

able success, the labours of the Committee may be continued.  H

112     --REPORT 1875.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. H. E. Armstrong and
   Dr. T. E. Thorpe, appointed for the jJurpose of investigating Iso-
   meric Cresols and their Derivatives. Drawn up by Dr. Armstrong.

Since the last Meeting of the Association a number of derivatives of para-

cresol have been examined, and some attention has been given to the isomeric

cresols ; but the investigation has meanwhile assumed a much wider aspect

than originally intended, having become a study of the " law of substitution "

in the phenol series, for reasons which may be briefly stated as follows.
   The examination of the derivatives of phenol, C^ Hj OH, carried on during

the past four years by various chemists, has shown conclusively that substi-

tution takes place in that compound in a very definite and simple manner.

Kekule's theory, it is well known, admits of the existence of three isomeric

mono-derivatives of phenol ; and it has been found that the action of all

reagents which lead to the production of substitution derivatives always gives

rise to the simultaneous production of two of the three, the so-called ortho-

and prtrrt-derivative. The third isomeric (so-called meta-) mono-derivative

is seldom formed in any quantity, if at all ; thus there is no evidence to show

that it is produced in the ease of the action of nitric or sulphuric acid, and it

is formed only in very small quantity by the action of chlorine and bromine
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

the action of iodine, however, appears to give rise to a somewhat larger amount

of the meta-derivative. The further action of reagents on the ortho- and

para-mono-derivatives leads ultimately to the production of ^/'^-derivatives,

and under ordinarj' conditions iliere is no tendency to the formation of liigher

substituted derivatives. In all the di- and tri-derivatives thus directly formed

from phenol, it is found that the ortho- and para-positions alone are occupied ;
so that employing the usual hexagonal symbol to represent phenol, what,

in the absence of a better expression, may be termed the direction in which
substitution is effected in phenol may be graphically represented, somewhat

in the manner suggested by Huebner, by lines drawn within the hexagon,

thus :

                              (Para-position)

   It is evidently a pi'oblem of considerable importance to determine whether
this very simple " law of substitution " obtains in the case of the homologues
of phenol ; and our experiments have all been instituted in the hope of con-
tributing to its speedy solution. The behaviour of paracresol and of thymol
has, to a certain extent, already been studied, and experiments with the

--isomeric cresols, ethylxDhenol, xylenol, and carvacrol are in progress.
   Paracresol derivatives. Paracresol, C^ H^ (CH,) OH, being formed from

phenol by the displacement of the atom of hydrogen in the p«;-«-position by
methyl, it should yield c?i-derivatives only if the " law " above discussed is

capable of application, and would accordingly be represented by the symbol :

   So far as the action of nitric acid is concerned, it may be said that sucli is

really the case ; but the behaviour with bromine does not appear to be in har-

mony with the " law." Thus paracresol is readily converted into nitropara-

creso] ; and this compound evidently has the nitro-group in the ortho-position,
since it is identical with the orthonitroparacresol recently obtained by

"Wagner from orthonitroparatoluidin. By the further action of nitric acid,

orthonitroparacresol is converted into a dinitroparacresol, which, there is

every reason to believe, has both nitro-groups in the ortho-positions ; it is

not possible, however, to introduce a greater number of nitro-groups into
paracresol. Similarly, by the action of bromine and iodine on orthonitro-
paracresol, monobromo- and moniorfo-nitroparacresol only can be obtained. The

behaviour of paracresol with bromine has not yet been examined; but the action

OHof bromine on potassium paracresolorthosulphonate, C^ H^ (CH3) SO^ K, has

been studied. From this compound, in the first instance, the corresponding

OHbromoparacresolorthosulphonate, C,, H.^ Br (CH3)   S03K,is produced; but on

further treatment with bromine this is converted into ^nbromoparacresol, and

hitherto no intermediate product has been detected. The tribromoparacresol

thus formed has not yet been sufficiently examined to enable an opinion as to

its nature to be pronounced ; it is a remarkably unstable compound, being de-
composed and deprived of a portion of its bromine by mere dissolution in alco-

hol. This behaviour is certainly remarkable, and may serve on investigation

to throw light on the formation of a tri-derivative from paracresol, which at

present we are inclined to regard as abnormal. Potassium bromoparacresol-

orthosulphonate is readily converted by the action of nitric acid into a bromo-

nitrocresol identical with that obtained by treating orthonitroparacresol with

bromine.

 --Thymol derivatives. Thymol being formed from phenol by the displace-

ment of an atom of hydrogen in the ortho-position by the group propyl, and
a second atom in the meta-position by the group methyl, it should " theore-

114 REPORT 1875.

   The behaviour with bromine is in accordance with this view, inasmuch as
we find that thymolparasulphonic acid (formed by treating thymol with
SO3HCI) is converted by the action of bromine into bromothymolparasulphonic
acid, which, on further treatment with bromine, is entirely transformed into
dibromothymol. It must not be forgotten, however, that Lallemand has pre-
pared such compounds as trichlorothymol and trinitrothymol ; and these

bodies certainly deserve reinvestigation.
    Since meta-derivatives are under certain circumstances produced directly

from phenol, it is obvious that the " law " under discussion is not an absolute
but merely an approximate expression of experimental observations, the ap-
proximation to truth being, however, very close ; and the results thus far
obtained appear to indicate that in this sense the " law " is equally applicable
to the homologues of phenol.

   The following circular form of inquiry was drawn up and approved by the
whole of your Committee, and nearly a thousand copies have been disti'ibuted
by them. But your Committee regret to report that, owing to the action of
certain Corporations and Companies seeking additional Parliamentary powers,
information has been withheld from the Committee, as well as by individuals
and firms ; but your Committee venture to hope that, in the event of their

being reappointed, these difiiculties may be overcome, and that much addi-

tional promised information relating to areas at present reported on will be

received.

Btream, after flowing down the natural channel, is conveyed in a culvert
thi-ough the grounds of Myln Villa, after which it flows to the river Teign.
During the severe drought of 1870 nearly the entire supply of this stream
was taken by the reservoir, and only twenty gallons of water jDer minute
entered the high end of the culvert at Myln Villa ; but notwithstanding that,

no less than fifty gallons per minute were discharged. Wells were sank to
secure more of this excess supply, which was found.

  --Tiverton. At Tiverton Mr. H. S. GiU informs Mr. Pengelly that the

surface of the water in the wells at the Parish Church and of St. Peter Street

is 10 feet below the level of the ground, while at the other end of the street,

which is at a slightly lower level, the water has to be pumped up 35 to 40
feet, and of much harder quality than that derived from the shallow wells,
which are, however, affected by heavy rains, during which the deeper well-
water remains clear and sparkling, especially in a weU near the Town Hall,

--about 270 feet above the sea.
    Daivlish. Dr. Baker informs Mr. Pengelly that the springs are believed
to trend with the valley N.N.W. and S.S.E. ; breaking at right angles to this

line, the wells have to be sunk to a level a little below that of the sea.

  A well at Captain Lampen's on the North Hill, 171 feet above the sea-

level, was sunk 175 feet through sandstone, gravel, and sand rock, of which
100 feet had to be penetrated before water was found.

   In a well (Mr. Turner's) 50 feet lower down the hUl, 73 feet deep, the
water suddenly disappeared in March 1875 ; but some water was reached on

sinking an additional 5 feet.

    In Mr. Marshall's well, recently sunk close to the edge of the cliif, on the

opposite side of the valley, at a height of 70 feet above the sea-level, water

was reached at 75 feet, beneath a hard pan of red sandstone ; when pumped
dry, five minutes' rest yields sufficient for thirty minutes more pumping.

   At Oaklands, on the S.W. hill, a well is now being sunk at an elevation of
200 feet ; a surface-spring was met with at 42 feet, which has been cut off,
and the well is now in hard conglomerate at 65 feet.

    Near the Station, Hatchers Hotel, and along the railway, an abundant
supply of surface-water is found in the gravel at a depth of 14 feet, which

supply appears to be pounded back by the sea ; these surface-springs vary much
in quantity, and are lowest in July. The wells are bricked, and 3 feet 9 inches

diameter.

 --Bramford Speke. Mr. Gamlen, of Bramford Speke, near Exeter, informs

Mr. Pengelly that there are 16 wells in that village, of which 14 are from
45 to 52 feet in depth ; the top water of one of these is maintained to a level
only 14 feet below the surface of the ground, rising to within 6 feet
in winter. The wells are in fine orange- coloured sandstone, overlaid by clean
gravel ; the bottoms of the wells are below the level of the Exe, but the water
is derived from the high ground to the west.

                                                    Somersetshire.

   At Taunton Mr. Moore reports the deeper weUs 75 feet in depth, situated
100 feet above the sea ; Dr. Alford states these are with difficulty jjumped dry

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the water is derived from the New Eed Sandstone, and contains 6 grains per

gallon of sulphate and carbonate of Ume.

118 REPORT 1875.

   Wells at Wellington and Somerton yield constant supplies of hard water,
unaffected by local rain.

   At Wemhdon, 60 feet above the sea, a well in the Red Sandstone, 30 feet
deep, yields a plentiful supply of water, which is also the case at Wells, a well
33 feet deep, at a point 70 feet above the sea.

                                                     Leicestershire.

   The deep wells of Leicester red^tik a maximum depth of 90 feet, and derive

their water-supply from the Upper Keuper Sandstone, which dips S.E. at a
low angle from the outcrop, or Davies Hill, towards the town and river, which
Mr. Plant considers must drain off a large portion of the supply held by the
sandstone, which consists of from 20 to 50 feet of sandstone, "separated by
beds of stiff red clay varying in thickness from a few inches to six feet." The
water in these wells is free from organic impurity permanent water-level is

                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

about the mean height of the water in the river. These wells are tubbed
or bricked to keep out surface-springs in the Drift ; and one is reported capable

of yielding 250,000 to 300,000 gallons a day ; another, emptied in 10 hours,
was restored to its normal level during the night.

   Mr. Plant reports that a number of shallow wells in the town are being
gradually closed by the authorities, being under 30 feet in depth, and their
supply derived from drift deposits more or less charged with organic im-

purity.

   Mr. Plant states the supply from the New Red Sandstone to be very con-

stant, though limited in quantity, from the smallness of the collecting-area at
Davies Hill. The present supply given to the town is from " streams flowing
from the Hills of Charnwood Forest, stored in two large reservoirs at Thornton
and Cropston."

   Mr. Plant sums up the result obtained by him in Leicestershire by stating
that the supply of water from the Upper Keuper Sandstone (nowhere more
than 50 or 60 feet thick) is small but permanent. All the deep wells of the
town of Leicester being supplied from this source, the water is pure but hard
from sulphate and carbonate of lime.

    In both the eastern and western districts of the county the supply is from
the Lower Keuper Sandstone, which is in some places probably 600 feet in
thickness. The water is pure but not free from hardness, but the supply is
abundant and permanent.

   Where the Bunter and Permian beds are penetrated, the supply of water
appears to be enormous and entirely unaffected by dry seasons ; it is pure and

perfectly soft.

   These results may be tabulated thus :

Formation.                           Supply.                    Hardness.

1. Upper Keuper Sandstone.  Not abundant.     Sulph. and carb. of lime.
                            Abundant.         Not so hard as 1.
2. Lower ,,       ,,        More abundant.    Nearly soft.
3. Bunter beds.             Most abundant.
                                              Soft.
4. Permian beds.

   The SxAFi'OEDSHrRE returns not being complete, Mr.Molyneux defers sending
them until next year ; but as previous to this inquiry he had published much

information regarding the water-supply of Burton-on-Trent, your Reporter

has thought it well to briefly allude to his results.

   The large number of journals of borings placed at Mr. Molyneux's disposal
by Messrs. Allsopp and Sons and Messrs. Salt and Co. have enabled him to

11. Coal-measures,

    All the Burton wells previous to 1856 were sunk in the valley-gravels,
and were not more than 20 feet deep ; in that year Messrs. Ind, Coope, and Co.
sank a well 24 feet in depth in Station Street; and since then all the old brewery
wells have been deej^ened, and are now carried down to the underlying Keuper

beds.

   To obtain a supplementary supply to that afforded by the gravels and the
top of the Keuper deposits, Messrs. Bass and Co. bored through 194 feet of
gypsum marls with bands of hard sandstone ; but it only produced one gallon

of water per hour.
   In 1867-68 Messrs. AUsopp and Sons sank 28 feet through gravel and

bored 102 feet, with a similar unsuccess. The various borings carried out by
these firms and Messrs. Salt and Co. prove the existence of two faults in the
very centre of the valley, bringing up the Keuper Sandstone, with a vertical
downthrow towards the river of no less than 1100 feet, the whole of which
enormous mass of strata has been denuded away.

  --Mr. Molyneux gives the three following analyses (1) of water from an arte-

sian boring in Keuper marls 70 feet in depth, (2) of water from a well 30 feet
deep in vaUey-gravels, on the east side of High Street, in the time of the
old breweries, and (3) of a well on the Avest side of that street.
        --

120 REPORT--1875.

   With the exception of the wells in the Keuper Marls at Hornington, all
the borings prove these marls to be non-water bearing at Burton, the water
found coming from the sands beneath them. Mr. Molyneux is therefore of
opinion that the large amount of calcareous ingredients found in the artesian
wells is derived from the vast area of Keuper Marls with gypseous aggrega-
tions occurring in the old area of Ifeedwood Forest, to the west of the valley,
the gypsum-charged water flowing along lines of natural underground
drainage in a north-easterly direction, until its progress is checked by the
great north and south Trent-vaUey fault, and a portion of the water forced
up into the overlying gravels, where it becomes mixed with the ordinary sur-
face-water of the vallej', which it charges with the calcareous elements which

give it the materials necessary to the production of Burton beer.
    Mr. J. P. Griess, F.R.S., informs Mr. Molyneux that the gypsum derived from

the water used in brewing 1000 barrels of ale would be 250 pounds ; so that,
assuming Burton produces annually 1,400,000 barrels of ale, no less than
350,000 pounds of this mineral will be drank with the beer in the various
parts of the world. Of the water derived from the Burton valley -gravels, and
used in various operations of brewing, probably not less than 1,050,000 pounds
of gypsum will be disposed of, which Mr. Molyneux considers will not re-
present one tenth of the actual amount of gypsum being annually carried to

the sea. And it is believed that many local subsidences which have taken

place in various parts of Needwood Forest are due to the fracture and sink-
ing of gypsum-beds corroded by underground streams.

    The water recently obtained by several of the large brewing firms from
the Keuper Sandstone and Bunter beds rose 23 feet above the level of the
valley, proving the great height of the sources of supply. These waters were
softer than those from the marls or from the valley-gravels, the proportion
of sulphate of lime being much less.

                                                     Lancashire,

   At Manchester Mr. Binney has experienced great difficulty in obtaining
returns ; in fact out of twenty sent out only three have been returned.

    In one of these a well and boring at Ayecroft, 433 feet in depth, is stated
to produce about 180,000 to 200,000 gallons per day ; but the well is only
pumped for two or three weeks at a time, chiefly in dry weather.

   The well is 70 yards from the river Irwell ; and when that river rises, the

water in the well rises also.

   Prof. HuU states that in 1863 from 60 to 70 wells in the New Red and

Lower Permian Sandstones of Manchester and Salford yielded not less than
six million gallons per day, used for factories, breweries, bleaching and dye

works.

    As the collecting-area is only 7 square miles, covered with houses and
paved streets, a large part of this supply must be derived from infiltration
from the rivers Irk, Medlock, and Irwell.

    As the water thus derived is useful for commercial purposes, while that in
 the rivers is little better than sewage, the great natural filtering-properties of

the New Bed Sandstone are here remarkably shown.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       .

The following section of a well and boring at Seedly Print-Works, given

by Messrs. Binney and HuU, is of value, as showing that while the Upper

Permian series attain a thickness of 128 feet, the Lower Permian Sandstone

is but 12 feet 6 inches, though at CoUyhurst, 2| miles to the east, it has

expanded to a thickness of 250 feet.

   The whole of the Permian formation, as proved by various wells and
borings, is subject to great variation of thickness, due probably to uncon-

formability.

   In the borough of Salford Mr. Binney has recorded a large number of

borings for water at the factories and printing works ; one of these, at Messrs.

Dewhurst Dawson's Croft, Greengate, gave :

                                                         feet.

            reached.

In a boring at the brewery near Albert Bridge, the following sequence

occurred :

Upper Permian. Red marb with limestone

Lower Permian. Red sandstone and clay                    10

   These borings point to the Lower Permian Sandstone as the source of the

water in the deep wells of the Salford district.

  At Ordsull a boring 460 feet in depth failed to reach the base of the New

Red Sandstone, and the water at the bottom of the bore became so salt that
the work was given up : this is probably the only instance of salt water
being met with in the sandstones of the Trias, though it commonly occurs in

the marls.

   East of the Manchester coal-field is a tract of New Red Sandstone, 2

miles in width, in which is situated the Gorton Waterworks, where a well
210 feet is capable of yielding 600 gallons per minute, notwithstanding the
greater part of the drainage-area is covered with impermeable Boulder-

clay.
                              --

--122 REPORT 1875.

The New Red Sandstone in the Liverpool and Preston district consists of

the following subdivisions :

1. Lower Keuper Sandstone                                  feet.
2. The Upper Mottled Sandstone
                                                           400

3. Pebble-beds                                             800

4. Lower Mottled Sandstone                                 100

           Permian beds thin and unimportant.

In a section first described by your Reporter in the railway-cutting at

Orrcl, near Waterloo, the upper beds of the Keuper Sandstone consist of

beds of fine-grained sandstone, separated by seams of grey marl, throwing

out springs, maintaining the characteristic which gives to the Keuper Sand-
stone in the Midland counties the name of " waterstones ;" between these

water-bearing beds and a patch of overljdng Keuper Marls let in by a fault

a conglomerate bed occurs similar to that occurring at the base of the

AKeuper.   small well at a private house to the S.W. yields a good supply

of water from the water-bearing bed ; but it is probable that a large well

sank into these rocks would afford a valuable auxiliary supply for "Waterloo

and Seaforth.

The Upper Mottled Sandstone consists of rather hard j-ellow sandstone,

sometimes used for building, which yields a good supply of water in a well

at Scarisbrick, of the Southport Waterworks, 70 feet above the sea-level.

Nearer Ormskirk are two other shafts sank, by the direction of Mr. Hawksley,

in the lower beds of the Upper Mottled Sandstone ; in one of these, the Pilot

shaft, a good supply of water is obtained ; but in the other, a few yards

distant, no water was obtained, and the Company are now engaged in driving

a heading in hopes of finding some.

   At Ormskirk Brewery a powerful spring, known as the " Bath Spring,"

supplies not only the brewery but the town itself. The top of the well is

about 134 feet above the level of the sea, is 36 feet in depth, and yields 33

gallons per minute.

   The late Mr. Robert Stephenson, reporting on the supply of water to

Liverpool in 1851, considered the New Red Sandstone of that district, which

consists of hard Pebble-beds and Upper Mottled Sandstone, to be generally

very pervious, deep wells drawing their supplies from distances of more than

a mile ; and he appears to have considered the whole mass as nearly equally

permeable in every direction, except when fissures or faults filled with ar-

gillaceous matter divide the field into water-tight compartments; and he

showed that the yield of no well can be permanently increased by sinking,

tunnelling, or boring, except .so far as the contributing area is thereby

enlarged.

   The mass of the Liverpool wells draw their supplies from the sandstone at
a level between high- and low-water mark ; and when the uniform pressure
of the column of fresh water, which prevents any ingress of the fluctuating

tidal water, is interfered with by excessive pumping, the general top-water

level is lowered, and Mr. Stephenson pointed out that a reverse action ensues

and the brackish water obtains a slight advantage.

As larger and larger quantities of water are pumped, the current of

brackish water gains in head ; and it appears to be gradually reaching further

and further inland ; the wells at Bevington Bush, Soho Square, Hotham
Street, and other places have had to be abandoned ; but whether it will be

able to penetrate the faults which divide the Liverpool area into a series

of different water-bearing belts is exceedingly doubtful.
                            ----

ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.                123

   The high permeability of the New Red Sandstone is remarkably shown in

the Green-Lane well of the Liverpool Corporation waterworks, of which the
details were furnished to Prof. Hull by Mr. Duncan, the resident engineer.

   The well was sunk in 1845-46, at a point 144 feet above the sea-level, to a
depth of 185 feet, or 41 feet below the sea. The yield was then 1,500,000

gallons per day.

  A 6-inch bore, sunk 60 feet from the bottom of the weU, increased the

yield to 2,317,000 gallons.

   In June 1853, the supply having slightly fallen off, the bore-hole was
deepened a further 381 feet, when the yield increased to 2,689,000 gallons.

   In June 1856 the bore-hole was widened, and carried a further 101 feet,

when the supply rose to 3,321,000 gallons per day.
   In the first boring, as pointed out by Prof. Hull, the increase was at the

rate of 17,783 gallons per foot, in the second it was only 9789 gallons per
foot, and the third only yielded 6277 additional gallons per foot ; so that
increase of depth gives so rapidly a diminishing ratio of volume, that a zero-

point woiild be soon attained.

   The large volume of water in this well is believed to be due to the existence
of a large fault, which acts as a duct for the underground waters over a large

   Mr. Isaac Eoberts, who has given much attention to the wells of Liverpool,

found by experiment that one square foot of compact sandstone 10| inches
in thickness, of average coarseness, allowed the following quantities of water
to pass through it per hour :

At a pressure of 10 lbs. to the square inch 4^ gallons.

the increase being nearly directly as the pressure.
   Mr. Eoberts examined the Liverpool sandstone microscopically, and found

it to consist of roughly rounded grains of quartz attached at the points of

contact with a siliceous cement. When a block of this sandstone is immersed

in water, the grains do not absorb but attract the water into the spaces

--between the grains by capillary attraction sandstone of ordinaiy coarseness

taking up no less than J^ of its own weight of water, of which J^ runs away
by the influence of gravity, the remainder being held in the cavities of the

stone by capillary attraction.
    Mr. Roberts describes seven wells which he has sunk or deepened at

Liverpool, and gives information concerning them, which clearly proves the

gradually lessening amount of rainfall which can make its way into the

ground through the large extent of area in Liverpool covered with buUdings

or streets, which has caused the underground water to no longer flow from

the sandstone towards the sea, but to allow a current of tidal water to set in

towards the land, which gradually increasing in volume, the water in these

wells becomes yearly more and more charged with salts.

  A well at (1) Earl Street, 350 yards from the Mersey, was perceptibly

affected by the tide, the top water sinking to low-water level at low tide,

the bottom of this well being 32 feet below high water.

   In a well at (2) Kainford Square, 500 yards from the river, the bottom of
which is 76 feet below high-water mark, the supply is abundant ; and Mr. E.

Mr. Phillips, of London, found the following salts per gallon :

The analysis was made in 1850, up to which time the water was suitable for

brewing, but afterwards became so brackish that its use had to be discontinued.

  A well in (4) Wellington Street, about 1200 yards from the river, was
sunk in the Keuper Sandstone to a depth of 71 feet below high water. An

analysis of the water from a peighbouring well, made in 1865, gave 117-70

In South Lancashire Mr. MeUard Reade has collected valuable information,

and reports a well at Crouton near Prescot, yielding 800,000 gallons a day,

407 feet in depth ; a well at the Iron Works, Garston, yielding 240,000 gal-

lons  per day, 351  feet in  depth                                  a well  of  the  Widness Local Board, with
                                                                 ;

bore-hole 300 feet in depth, yielding 6| million gallons per week of 7 days.

   In Cheshire no returns have as yet been received by Mr. Morton, and he
therefore defers reporting on the Wirral wells until next year. For compa-

rison with other districts, it may be well to reproduce the following details.

   In sinking the well at Playbrick Hill in Cheshire, 3400 yards from the
Mersey, water began to weep into the well through cavities in the sandstone

at 10 feet above high- water mark ; above that level Mr. Roberts, who sank

the well, states the Keuper Sandstone was free from water ; as the depth
increased the yield of water became greater, until at 55 feet below high-
water mark 350,000 gallons were supplied in 24 hours, which quantity, by
a subsequent bore-hole and adit driven to cut a fault by the direction of
Mr. Bateman, C.E., was increased to 1,600,000 gallons in the same time.

    Professor Hiill states that this and the other wells belonging to the
Tranmere Local Board, the Birkenhead Commissioners, and the Wirral Water
Co., yield together not less than four million gallons.

   The water is hard (as if from Magnesian Limestone) ; 243,000 gallons are
pumped up every 24 hours, and the supply is constant. The water stands
highest at 12 at noon and 12 at night, only varying about 2 inches at these
hours, but 8 or 9 inches between these hours.

   1. Four wells in garden of Myln Villa, Coomb, West Teignmouth, sunk in
1874 by Teignmouth Local Board as an extra supply for town. These wells are in
the bottom of a valley not far from a culvert which was built to can-y the water of

the brook running in the valley; they are therefore independent of the brook, and
are supplied by springs breaking forth out of the rock in their sides and in those
of the adit connecting them. 2. The surface of ground about 100 ft. above mean

drainage through the lower bed of coarse gravel ; this not more than 1 or 2 feet below

brackish, but varies very much in adjoining wells. 9. Generally red sandstone imtil

with veins of fine sand, then large flinty stones and gravel, coarse and large ; should

got at 3-5 feet, but is generally believed to be branch springs and surface percolation

together, very pure, but not always permanent. It is believed that any well pumped

out would refill to 7 feet in from 10 to 12 hours. The various beds vary from 1 to

10 feet or more in thickness ; sandstone always predominates in the deep weUs.

The only well requiring blasting is at " Oaklands," now 65 feet deep and in very hard

conglomerate red rock : this well is 200 feet above the sea-level. 10. Yes, many

in various places. 11. Not generally near wells, but used as open springs and con-

sidered very pure. 12. No. 13. Never heard of any. 14. No. 15. Never heard

of any ; and the brackish water gets bitter as you get deeper, and is very variable in

mostplaces. It appears to me entirely dependent on the loose gi-avel-beds, which

vary in depth and thickness considerably, and no doubt allow the sea-water to per-«

colate through them in high tides, dry seasons, and such like.

detail can be given ; another well is to be sunk soon about a |- of a mile west of this,

and a note of the strata will be carefully taken by Mr. Thomas, of Somerton, under

whose direction it will be sunk. 10. There are siu-face-springs | of a mile west,
which supply a good deal of water after rain and various pumps ; but I do not appre-

hend that much goes into this well, and no particular precautions have been taken.

sea. 8. Water pure, particularly " hard." 9. Loose sandstone covered by about
2 feet of clay. (There is a saying common amongst the country people here, to
the efl'ect that the breaking of the springs in winter is in some manner influenced
by the winds of the previous March.) 10. There is no surface-spring within a J

On the Steering of Screio- Steamers. By Prof. Osborne Reynolds.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extensoJ]

Theee does not appear, as far as my observation goes, to be any particular

difficulty in steering screw-steamers so long as they are going ahead under

steam, but rather the other way ; they then seem to be better to steer than
almost any other class of ships. Great difficulty often occurs, however, when

they are stopping, starting, or otherwise manoeuvring. Their vagaries arc

then so numerous as to give the idea that there is a certain degree of capri-

ciousness and uncertainty about their behaviour. This is, of course, mere

fancy ; and did we but know them, it is certain that there are laws

which these steamers follow under aU circumstances. In the hope of

arriving at these laws, I have been investigating this subject now for twelve

years as opportnnity offered                                                                                                   and I had come, as I thought, to some  leadino-
                                                                                                                            ;

facts, when the failure of the ' Bessemer ' to enter Calais Harbour on the 8th
of May last seemed to establish them.

   It will be remembered that the ship entered between the piers at a speed
of 12 or 1-3 knots, the tide running strong right across the mouth of the
                                                                     --

harbour, that on her entering between the piers the. engines were reversed,
and that the ship turned, under the influence of the current, in spite of her

rudder ; so that Capt. Pittoch, in his letter to the ' Times,' attributed the

accident entii'ely to her failing to steer at the time.

   On reading of the accident I thought it would be a good opportunity .to

call attention to the subject of steering steamers ; and I wrote a paper, which
was published in the ' Engineer' of June 4th, 1875, in which I explained

why the act of stopping a ship must necessarily affect her power of steering
j»ointiag out that when a ship is stopping the water will be following her
stern relatively faster than when she is moving uniformly, and consequently

that the eifect of the rudder will be diminished ; · that the longer the ship

the greater will be the diiference; also that this effect is greatly increased

when a ship is stopping herself with her propellers, as was the ' Bessemer ' ; for
then not only is the retardation of the vessel much more rapid, but the
water hafe a forward motion imparted to it by the propellers, which motion,
if the propellers are near the rudder, may be greater than that of the ship,

under which circumstance the effect of the rudder's action will be reversed.
Since publishing this paper in the ' Engineer ' I have canned the investiga-
tion further ; and the object of the present paper is to give an account of
some experiments on model boats driven by screws, and the conclusions to
which these experiments have led me.

   Two models were used in making these experiments ; the one 2' 6" long,

driven by a spring, and the other 5' 6", driven by steam. In both models
the rudders were broad in i)roportion to the boats. In the clockwork model
the rudder was almost close to the screw, there being no stern-post. In
the steam model there was a wide stern-post, and the rudder was an inch
and a half behind the screw.

   Both boats went straight with their screws driving them ahead and with
their rudders straight, and they both answered their rudders easily with

their screws going, turning in circles of from four to six feet radius. When

the screws were stopped and the boats carried on by their own way, they
both answered theii- rudders, but much more slowly than when their screws

were going, the smallest circle being now, as near as I could estimate, from
twelve to fifteen feet radius.

   In order to try the effect of the screw when reversed on the steering of the
spring-model, the model was towed by a cord attached (as shown in the accom-
panying figure) to a point T amidship about one third of her length from her

stern, so that the towing had little or no tendency either to keep her straight

or turn her. The rudder was then set at an angle of 45° or thereabouts, so

as to turu her head to the right, towing was commenced, the boat turning in

a circle to the right.  The  screw was then  started in the reverse  direction
                                                                                                        ;

Avhereupon the boat ceased to turn to the right, and commenced turning to

the left to an extent depending on the slowness with which she was being

towed. When towed very quickly, at from two to three miles an hour, she

came nearly straight forward, but at the fastest speed showed no tendency to

turn to the right.

                 ON THE STEERING OF SCREW-STEAMEUS.                                                                 143

The mdder Tvas then set so as to turn the boat to the left, and the opera-

tion was repeated with very nearly corresponding results so long as the
screw did not race ; but the action of the reversed screw on the rudder when

set to the left was not so great as when set to the right. This ditference

led me to suppose that the screw itself might exert an influence to turn the
boat to the left when it was reversed, although it had been found to exert no
such influence when going ahead. This was at once shown to be the case

by setting  the  rudderj^straight  and  starting  the  screw  reversed the                                          boat
                                                                                                                 ;

immediately turned to the left, but not fast unless the screw raced, then she

turned very rapidly.

   These direct effects of the screw to turn the ship appear to me to account

for several of the anomalies which have hitherto beset the subject ; and further

on in the paper I shall discuss them at length.

The steam model was provided with paddles as weU as screw, and the

screw could be reversed without reversing the paddles, in which case the

l^addles overpowered the screw, and the boat moved forward somewhat
slowly. In this boat the screw was so deeply immersed that it would not

race, and it had no direct effect to turn the boat when reversed like that of

the spring model.

   When the screw was reversed and the boat drawn slowly forward by the

paddles, the effect on the rudder was almost to destroy its action, it having

only a slight power to turn the boat in the opposite direction to that in

which it would have turned the boat had the screw been going ahead.

Practically the boat had lost aU power of steering. Coupled in this way

with the paddles the screw turned but slowly, the engine being held up by

the opposing actions. On releasing the paddles and allowing them to turn

freely, and applying the whole power of the engine to the screw, the model

behaved almost exactly as the spring model had done, showing when towed

against the screw a strong tendency to turn in the opposite direction to that

in which the rudder was set.

The screw was then set full speed ahead ; and when the boat had acquired

way the rudder was set, so that she began to turn rapidly to the right ; the

screw was then reversed, and by the time the boat had lost all forward way

she had turned to the left through an angle of 30°, so great was the effect of

the screw on the rudder when stopping the boat.

This completed the list of the experiments, which, however, were repeated

over and over again with exactly the same results.

Conclusions to be drawn from tlie exjjeriments.^The general conclusion is

that in screw-steamers the effect of the riidder depends on the direction of

motion of the screw rather than on the direction of motion of the boat. Or

we have the three following laws :

1. That when the screw is going ahead the steamer wiU turn as if she

were going ahead, whether she have stern-way on or not.

2. That when the screw is reversed the rudder will act as if the vessel

wore going astern although she may be moving ahead.

3. That the more rapidly the boat is moving in the opposite direction to

that in which the screw is acting to drive it, the more nearly will the two

effects on the rudder neutralize each other, and the less powerful will be its

action. It would appear reasonable to suppose that a boat may move fast

enough to overcome the effect of the reversal of the screw ; but this was not

the case with the models.

 --Thd effect of the screw to turn the boat independently of the rudder.

It seems to be supposed by some that a screw necessarily tends to force
--141
                             REPORT 1875.

the stern of the boat in a direction opposite to that in which the tips of its

lower blades are moving. This is undoubtedly the case when the screw is

racing or acting in broken water (i. e. water mixed with air), also when the

screw is not completely covered with water. When, however, the screw is

properly immersed and is working in unbroken or continuous water, and is

not aifected by dead water, it has not the least tendency to move itself

laterally whatever it ma}- have on the ship. Under these circumstances the

screw-shaft can exert no lateral pressure on its bearings ; and in ships with

fine runs this is the case.

Owing to the effect of the dead water, however, it may happen that even

when the screw is properly immersed it will tend to move laterally. If the

water be following the ship faster above than below (which it often is), the

upper blades of the screw will have more work to do than the lower, and con-

sequently they will have to meet with greater lateral resistance and hence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

upper and lower resistances will not balance, but there wUl be a lateral

thrust transmitted to the bearings.

Besides the lateral pressure which may be transmitted through the bear-

ings, the screw may also tend to turn the ship by the lateral motion which

it imparts to the water, which is again communicated to the ship or the

rudder. If the form of the ship and the rudder were symmetrical above and

below the screw-shaft, then the effect of the lateral motion which the screw

imparts to the water below would exactly balance the effect above the screw-

shaft ; but owing to the fact that the surface both of the ship and the rudder

is in general much greater above than below, the water which is driven

laterally by the upper blades has much more surface to act upon than that

which is driven in the contrary direction by the lower blades, and therefore

drives the stern of the ship laterally or tends to turn the ship. This effect

is in the opposite direction to that which arises from the unequal rate at

which the water is following the ship as long as both the ship and the screw

are going ahead ; and consequently these two effects tend to counteract each
other. When, however, the screw is reversed, and the vessel is still moving

forwards,  the two  effects  are in '^conjunction                                                                                          and  conseqi;ently  they  are  more
                                                                                                                                        ;

likely to become apparent and important. This was the case in the experi-

ments with the spring model. When screwing ahead she went straight

enough, but when towed ahead with the screw reversed she turned to the

left. In this case the effect was smaU ; and I imagine that it must always be
so, particularly when the ship has a fine ruu. In the steam model, of which

the run is very fine, the screw-way very large, and the screw small (being

only three inches while the boat draws five), the effect of the screw to turn

the boat when not racing was altogether imperceptible. I conclude, there-

fore, that these effects may be left out of consideration with reference to

steering ; and in opposition to a popular notion I derive law 4.

   4. That when not breaking the surface the screw has no considerable

--tendency to turn the ship so long as the rudder is straight.
    The effect of racing. Although the direct effect of the screw is insig-
nificant when it is not racing or breaking the surface, this is not the case

when it is racing. It then exerts a very decided and important effect ; and it

is doubtless experience of this which has given rise to the popular notion

above referred to.

In the experiments with the spring model when the screw was drawing

air down, the stern always showed a tendency to move in the opposite

direction to that in which the tips of the lower blades were moving, even

when the boat was going ahead at full speed and the quantity of air very

small ; and -when the screw regularly raced, frothing the water, its effect to

turn the stern of the boat was very great.

The screw of the steam model was so deeply immersed that it would not

race ; but if the stern of the boat was raised by a string it then raced, and the
effect of the screw to turn the stem of the boat was the same as with the

spring model.

   The screw of the spring model showed a much greater tendency to draw
air when reversed (the boat being towed) than when it was driving the
boat ahead; but its greatest tendency to race was when the boat was

stationary, or nearly so. This latter tendency I have observed in large

steamers ; in fact I have never seen a large steamer start or reverse her

screw when moving but slowly without frothing the water. It appears,
therefore, that the effect of racing on the steering may be stated in the fol-

lowing laws :

5. That when the screw is frothing the water, or only partially immersed,

it will have a tendency to turn the stern in the opposite direction to that in

which the tips of the lower blades are moving.

6. That when the boat is going ahead its effect wiU be easily counter-

acted by the rudder ; but when starting suddenly, either forward or back-

ward, at first the effect of the screw will be greater than that of the rudder,

and the ship -^vill turn accordingly.

7. That if when the boat is going fast ahead the screw is reversed, at first

it almost destroys the action of the rudder, what little effect it has being in

the reverse direction to that in which it usually acts. If, then, the screw

draws air or breaks the surface, it will exert a powerful influence to turn

the ship.

In accounts of collisions it may be frequently noticed that there is con-

trary evidence given of the steering of one or both of the ships (if they both

happen to be steamers). In the instance of the collision between the
' ynie du Havre ' and the ' Loch Earn,' the captain of the ' Loch Earn

stated that the steamer altered her course almost at the last moment, thus

rendering the collision inevitable. The officers of the steamer asserted that

such was not the case; they state, however, that the screw was reversed just

before the collision. In this case, therefore, the evidence is to show that the
reversal of the screw caused the steamer to change her course, either by its
direct effect or by its action on the rudder. The latter effect would be

sufficient to explain the facts ; and my experiments leave no doubt but that

this must have taken place. "With regard to the former I have no evidence ;
although, considering that the ship was moving rapidly at the time, it seems

probable that the screw may have raced on being reversed, and added its

direct effect to turn the ship to its effect on her rudder. In this case,
therefore, the reports of what took place are strictly in accordance with what

was to be expected from my experiments ; and I think that fi.-om the light
these throw upon the subject in many cases, the accounts may be less con-
tradictory than they have hitherto appeared ; and I am in hopes that in the

future these experiments may assist not only in the discovery of the causes

of accidents, but, as these become recognized, in the prevention of the acci-

dents themselves.

   As an illustation of how important a clear conception of the whole cir-
cumstances of the effect of the screw on the rudder may be, I will read an
account with which I have been kindly furnished by Mr. Henry Deacon

from which account it appears that a ship was saved by a combination of

accidents,  which led to her being handled in  tlic vcrv                manner  in  which she
                                                                     '

would have been had the conduct of the officer in charge been governed by

the laws laid down in this paj^er.

Mr. Deacon says :

" I have been reading your communication to the ' Engineer ' of the 4th

inst. about the ' Bessemer's ' steering, and think the following narrative may

Ahave some interest for you.  friend of mine came from Philadelphia, U. S.,

early in May to Liverpool in the S.S. ' Ohio.' To avoid ice the vessel went

out of her coiu'se 160 or 170 miles, and encountered very bad weather. The

captain spent one or two days without taking off his clothes ; and whilst

laying down one day, leaving the chief officer in command of the deck,

amongst fogs and rain, an iceberg was sighted right ahead and quite close

when seen. The officer stopped and reversed the engines, and put the helm

hard round. The cessation of motioji awoke the captain, who rushed up

the bridge. The excitement had spread, the officer's orders had been strictly

obeyed. The captain took all in at a glance, put the engines on ahead at

fuU speed, and the ' Ohio,' breaking through the thin ice always skirting

the icebergs, passed so close to the solid mass, that my American friend, who

is fond of horses and was on deck, says he could have struck the ice from the

ship with a tandem whip. The captain afterwards explained the matter

--thus : the steering-gear was the now usual parallel screws, i. e. exerting

the least force when the rudder is most moved, but of course retaining the

rudder in any position with little or no effort. To put the rudder hard

round when the ship is under full way and the engines working is an almost

physical impossibility ; but to put it hard round when the engines are stopped,

and especially to put it round when they are reversed, is comparatively easy.

The chief officer's order, therefore, enabled the rudder to be put round to the

utmost ; he both stopped and reversed the engines. The captain's arrival

and comprehension completed the manoeuvre. The ' way ' was but slightly

interrupted, but the helm was put hard round and the ship turned from her

course in the shortest possible distance.

  " I have all this at second hand from my friend ; but this fact of the easy

movement of the helm whilst the ship was under way with the engines

reversed appeared to bo one well understood ; and of course if no power be
required to move the helm, no power can be exerted in steering the vessel

and the whole tale seems to me so illustrative of your remarks on the

' Bessemer,' that I venture to trouble you with it."

have thought fit to take in order to ascertain the exact views held by both
employers and employed on the subject in question. Although the general
objects of such combinations, -whether of capitalists or labourers, are well
known, both from the written rules which bind them together and from the
action taken from time to time, your Committee have deemed it desirable to

come into personal contact with some representative men from both classes,
with a view of finding whether they do now stand by the rules of their Unions
and how far they are prepared to defend them ; and for that purpose your

Committee resolved to hold a consultative jjrivate conference of employers and
employed in the presence of the members of the Committee, where they might

discuss the questions involved in the resolution of the British Association,

with a view of reporting thereon to the same. The points more especially

inquired into were the following :

   Ist. What determines the minimum rate of wages ?
   2nd. Can that minimum rate be uniform in any trade ? and can that uni-

formity be enforced ?
    3rd. Is combination capable of affecting the rate of wages, whether in

favour of employers or employed ?
    4th. Can an artificial restriction of labour or of capital be economically

right or beneficial under any circumstances ?
    Por the discussion of these questions your Committee had the advantage

of bringing together a deputation from the N"ational Federation of Associated
Employers of Labour, consisting of Messrs. K. E,. Jackson, M. A. Brown, H. E.

--Greg, Joseph Simpson, J. A. Marshall, E. Hannen, and Henry WhitAVorth

as representing labour Messrs. Henry Broadhurst, Daniel Guile, George
Howell, Lloyd Jones, George Potter, and Eobert Newton (Mr. Macdonald,
M.P., and Mr. Burt, M.P., having been prevented from attending) ; and on
the part of your Committee, Lord Houghton, Professor Eogers, Mr. Samuel
Brown, Mr. AV. A. Hamilton, Mr. Frank Fellows, and Professor Leone Levi
were present.

   Many are the works and documents bearing on the questions at issue.
Of an official character we have the Eeport of tho Eoyal Commission ap-

pointed " to inquire into and report upon the organization and rules of trade-
unions and other associations, whether of workmen and employers, and to
inquire into and report on the effects produced by such trade-unions and
associations on the workmen and employers and on the relations between
workmen and employers and on the trade and industry of the country." Of
an unofficial character we have the Eeport of the Committee of the Social
Science Association " on the objects and constitution of trade-societies, with
their effects upon wages and upon the industry and commerce of the country."

Of special works we have the late lamented Professor Cairnes's ' Leading-
Principles of Political Economy,' Mr. Thomas Brassey's ' Work and Wages,'
and Professor Leone Levi's ' Wages and Earnings of the Working Classes.'

   The chief functions of combinations, whether of capital or labour, being to
operate on wages, your Committee were anxious to ascertain by what

criterion the parties interested ordinarily judge of the sufficiency or insuf-
ficiency of existing wages. The first test of the sufficiency of wages is the

relation they bear to the cost of the necessaries of life. " The minimum of

wages," said Prof. Eogers, " is the barest possible amount upon which a
workman can be maintained ; that which, under the most unfavourable cir-

cumstances, a man is able to obtain." But the minimum thus estimated can

only be, and is, submitted to under circumstances of extreme necessity.

" I believe the minimum rate of wages," said one of tho representatives of

                                                                                                               1,2

labour, " is that which, under the worst circumstances, the worst workman

Wegets from the worst master."  cannot, therefore, take the minimum rates so

Howconsidered as a proper basis for the sufficiency of wages.  far insufficient

wages in relation to the cost of living in the United Kingdom is a cause of the

large emigration which is taking place from year to year it is not possible to
establish * ; but doubtless the prospect held out in the distant colonies and

in the United States of America of considerable improvement has been for

some time past, and still is, a strong inducement to those in receipt of insuf-

ficient wages in this country to emigrate to other lands. Your Committee

are desirous to point out in connexion with this question that not only has

the cost of some of the principal necessaries of life greatly risen within the

last twenty years f, but that, in consequence of the general increase of

comfort and luxury, many articles of food, drink, and dress J must now be

counted as necessaries which some years ago were far beyond the reach of

the labouring classes ; whilst house-rent, especially adapted for tho labouring

classes, is considerably dearer. If, therefore, the cost of living be taken as a

guide to the rate of wages, it would not be enough to take into account the

Acost of the mere necessaries of life.  higher standard of living having been

established, it is indispensable to compare the wages of labour with such

higher standard. Yoiir Committee are not satisfied, however, that it is pos-

sible to regulate wages according to the scale of comfort or luxury which may

be introduced among the people, and are compelled to assert that it is an

utter fallacy to imagine that wages wiU. rise or fall in relation to the cost

of such supposed necessaries or indulgences.

  A better test of the sufficiency of wages is the relation they bear to the

state of the labour-market; and tested by that standard the minimum rate

of wages which workmen are at any time prepared to accept is the least

which they think they are entitled to have under existing circumstances, the

   * The average number of emigrants in the last ten years from the United Kingdom,
from 1862 to 1873, -was 230,000 per annum. In 1873 the total umnber was 310,612, and
in 1874 241,014. The emigration to the United States decreased from 233,073 in 1873,

to 148,161 in 1874.

trade-imious guiding them as to the state of trade and the value of labour at

the time. Unfortunately, however, what workmen think themselves entitled

to have does not always correspond with what employers find themselves
able to grant. Trimarily the wages of labour are determined by the

amount of capital available for the purposes of wages in relation to the

number of labourers competing for the same. But the amount of capital

employed in any industry is itself governed by considerations of the relation

of the cost of production to the market-price of the produce (that is, to the

--price which the consumer is able or willing to give for the same) the cost

of production including the cost of materials, the value of capital, the cost

of superintendence, and the wages of labour.

Objection was taken at the Conference to this method for arriving at

the rate of wages ; and it was urged that instead of taking the price of the
article produced or the interest of the consumer as the basis of the calcula-

tion, the first ingredient in the cost of the article should be the price to be

paid to the workman in producing it. Eut a serious consideration will show
that the employer cannot ignore what the consumer can or will pay any

more than the share which the value of capital, the cost of superintendence,

and the cost of the materials have upon the cost of production ; for he must

cease producing altogether if he cannot both meet the ability of the con-

sumer to purchase his article and successfully compete with the producers of

other countries. Tour Committee think that it is not in the power of the

employer to control the proportion of the different elements in the cost of

production, each of them being governed by circumstances peculiar to itself.

The value of capital as well as the value of the raw materials are regulated

by the law of supply and demand, not only in this country but in the prin-

cipal markets of the world. The cost of superintendence and the wages of

labour are likewise governed by the relation of the amount of capital to the

number seeking to share in the different employments. The employed saj',

Weproperty.  set our value iipon it. If you will have our labour you must

pay what we ask for it ; and if such wages should require a rise in the

market-price let the consumer pay it." What, however, if the consumer will

not or cannot pay sufficient price to enable the employer to pay such wages ?

What if he can get the article cheaper elsewhere ? Must not production

cease if there bo no market ? And where will be the wages if there be no

production ? Nor should it be forgotten that a general rise of wages pro-

ducing an increase of the cost of all the commodities of life reacts on the

masses of the people, and thus far neutralizes the benefit of higher wages.

Disagreements between employers and employed are often produced on the

subject of wages by the fact that all the elements of the case are not within
the cognizance of both parties, experience showing that, in making a demand
for an advance of wages or for resisting a fall, workmen are of necessity
groping in the dark as to the real circumstances of the case. One of the

chief advantages supposed to result from the organization of trade-unions is

the competency of their leaders to give solid and practical advice to those

interested as to the condition of the labour-market ; and we have no doubt
that this duty is in the main honestly performed ; but it is very much to

expect that such leaders should universally possess large and liberal views

enough to vindicate the exercise of their enormous power, and such constant

and accurate knowledge of the various facts of the case as would enable

them to be an almost infallible authority. On the other hand, were it'
possible for employers, who are not in the dark in such matters, to make

known to their own workmen the groiinds of the action they propose taking

before the resolve is carried into execution, your Committee are convinced

that many disputes would be avoided, and much of the jealousy which now

exists between the parties would he removed. The recent lock-out in Soiath

Wales illustrated the need of such a course. Had the facts which Lord

Aberdare elicited from the principal colliery firms in Glamorganshire been

made known previous to or simultaneously with the notice of a fall, it is a

question whether such a widespread calamity would have occurred. It is,

perhaps, a natural but unfortunate circumstance that employers are seldom

found to take the initiative in allowing a rise in wages when the state of the

market permits it as they are in the case of a fall, and spontaneously to offer

Awhat they must sooner or later be compelled to grant.  more prompt and

politic course on their part in this matter would go far to neutralize the

hostile action of trade-unions.

   Your Committee were anxious to ascertain how far is it in the mind of

the employed that the employers obtain for themselves too large a share

of profits at their expense. Your Committee Avcro assured that no such

. doubts are entertained, though cases were produced supporting such sus-

picions by reference to the time of the great rise in the price of coals in 1873,

when workmen's wages did not, in the opinion of the representatives of
labour, rise to any thing like the proportion of the masters' profits *. Your

Committee admit that in cases of great oscillations in prices, the share par-

ticipated either by the employers in the shape of profits, or by the employed

in the shape of wages, may be for a time greater or less than their normal
distribution would justify. And it is possible that some portions of these
extra profits may be unproductively spent or so employed as not to benefit

the parties more immediately concerned, and even used in totally alien

speculations. Yet, in the main, the working classes must receive, in one

way or another, a considerable advantage from them, there being no doubt

that the largest portion of such extra profits will bo reinvested in the

ordinary industries of the country. In the end, however, wages and profits

will be divided among the producers in proper proportions ; and if at any
time profits or wages should be larger than they ought to be, we may be

quite sure that ere long the competition of capitalists will tend either to the

lowering of prices or the raising of wages, so as to make profits and wages

gravitate towards each other.

   Immediately allied to the question of the determination of a minimum of
wages is that of their uniformity. In the opinion of many trade-unions, all
workmen of average ability in any trade should earn the same wages, the
average ability of each man being understood to have been determined in

advance by the fact of his being admitted as a member of the union. But a
man is subject to no examination, and is generally admitted upon the tes-

timony of those who have worked with him, whose evidence must fre-

quently be fallacious and insufficient. Nor does it appear that the rejection

is absolutely certain even if the applicant should not be deemed a man of

average ability, the acceptance or rejection of the party being always

optional with the lodge to which he is introduced. Your Committee are
therefore not satisfied that any guarantees exist that every member of a

   * Mr. Halliday's evidence before the Committee of the House of Commons on coals was
that, though the custom was to give to workmen a portion of any rise of prices in the

shaje of increasing wages, the proportion being an additional 2d. a day for every lOd. a
ton, the rise in wages was often Id. per ton only, and sometimes nothing, whilst when thr
price rose 2s. Qd. to 5s. a ton, the wages were only increased dd. a day.

union is ablo to cam a fair clay's wages for a fair day's work ; and they
cannot, therefore, agree in the proposition that all workmen should be

entitled to uniform wages on the ground of uniform ability. But another
reason has been alleged for the uniformity of wages, which is still less
tenable than the former, viz. a supposed uniformity of production independent
of skill. The right of the workman to a iiniform standard of wages was
stated to be the production of an article which, though demanding less skill
to perform, is of equal utility, and is proportionally as profitable to the
employer. Tour Committee must, however, entirely demur to the principle
that, in the apportionment of wages, no account should be taken of the skill
brought to bear on the execution of the task, since a system of that nature
would act as a premiiim on inferiority of workmanship. Again, by another
test should the right of each individual to earn certain wages be determined,
and that is by his productive capacity. Professor Levi asked whether that
was taken into account when the workman was assumed to be of average
ability ; and the answer was that the amount of production depended largely

upon the skill. " The more skilful a man is the more he will produce."

But whilst in so far this answer was correct, it contradicted the principle
embodied iu the preceding test ; the answer itself did not take sufficiently

into account that skill is not the only element in effectiveness of labour.
There are qualities of mind, judgment, and even of heart, disposition, and of
moral character, which go far to increase or diminish the efficiency of labour
and of such qualities the employer is, of necessity, a far better judge than
any union can be. That under ordinary circumstances wages in any trade

should tend to uniformity is quite possible. The facUity of communication
and the extension of intercourse of necessity equalize prices and wages ; but

any attempt to compel uniformity of wages among any large number of men

of varied capacity must of necessity prove a source of disappointment.

Much, again, may be said in favour of a common standard of wages in any

industry, as avoiding the embarrassment necessarily encountered in any
attempt to adjust the rate to the exact worth of each individual. Yet it is
impossible to ignore the fact that whilst a uniform rate is sure to operate

unjustly in favour of persons who may be wanting in fairness of dealing or

capacity for workmanship, in the nature of things it is almost incapable to
exist over a wide area, having regard to the varieties in the prices of fuel,
carriage, house accommodation, or of the means of livelihood, as well as in
the cost of raw materials and in the processes employed as affecting the

rate of production of each individual. On the whole, your Committee find

that an absolute uniformity in the rate of wages in any trade, though to a
certain extent convenient, is neither just nor practicable, whilst any effort
to compel uniformity in the amount of earnings of any number of individuals
must prove fallacious and wrong as an illegitimate interference with the rights

of industry.

   A. still more important question in connexion with the subject is how far

combination of any kind can affect permanently or temporarily the rate of

wages. Upon this, as might be expected, the most divergent opinions are
held by the representatives of capital and labour. The employers of labour,

standing on the solid principles of political economy, deny that combinations
can, under any circumstances, affect the rates of wages, at least in any per-

--manent manner the argument adduced being that if workmen are entitled

to higher wages they are sure to get them, since, under the law of supply
and demand, whenever it is found that profits trench unduly upon wages
fresh capital is sure to be introduced which provides for the raising of wages.
--153 REPOHT 1875.

The employed, on the other haad, confidently appeal to past experience, and

point to the fact that almost every increase of wages has been due to the

action of trade-unions. They say that without combination workmen

cannot secure tlie market-price of their labour, but are to a certain extent at

the mercy of their employers ; that in trades where one establishment
employs a large number of workmen the employers can discharge a single
workman with comxjaratively slight inconvenience, while the workman loses
his whole means of subsistence ; that without the machinery of com-
bination the workmen, being dependent upon their daily work for their daily

bread, cannot hold on for a market.

Your Committee are not prepared to deny that combinations can render

iiscful service in matters of wages ; but they think that it is impossible for
them to frustrate or alter the operations of the laws of supply and demand,

and thereby to affect permanently the rates of wages. Combinations may

hasten the action of those laws which would undoubtedly, though perhaps

more slowly, operate their own results. The limited power of combinations

"Weis in effect admitted by the workmen themselves.  do not say," said

one of the workmen's representatives, " that trade-unions can absolutely

interfere with supply and demand, because when trade is very bad they

cannot obtain the standard ; when it is good they easily raise the standard.
"What they do is, they enable workmen sooner to strike at the right time for

a general advance. They get the advance sooner than if they were an
undisciplined mob, having no common understanding ; and when trade is
receding, the common understanding enables workmen to resist the pressure

put upon them by their employers. It helps them in both ways, and the

workmen find they can act together beneficially." The ground here taken
by the working men is not at variance with sound economic principles.
Eut there is yet another way in which trade-unions may prove useful, and

that is by rendering wages more sensitive to the faction of the state of the

market, and so preventing the influence of custom to stand in the way of

the operation of supply and demand ; for there are such occupations, as

agriculture, where custom often exercises imperious rule oven upon wages.
As it has been well said by M. Batbie, " Wages do not change unless the

causes for the change exercise a strong influence. If the conditions of supply

and demand do not undergo a groat change, wages continue the same by

the simple force of custom. The variations of wages are not like those of

a thermometer, where the least clouds are marked, where one can read the

smallest clianges of temperature. They may rather be compared to those

bodies which do not become heated except under the action of an elevated

temperature, and remain quite insensible to the slight modifications of the

atmosphere. Until a great perturbation takes place in the conditions of

supply and demand, no one would think of changing the rate of wages " *.
After making every allowance your Committee cannot admit that combinations

have any power cither to raise permanently the rate of wages or to prevent
their fall when the conditions of trade require the same, as recent experience

jibundantly shows ; and whilst admitting that combinations may be bene-

ficial in accelerating the action of economic laws, your Committee cannot be

blind to the fact that they produce a state of irritation and discontent which

often interferes with the progress of production.

   Limited as is the power of combinations to affect the rates of wages, still
more limited is their power to affect materially the progress of productive
industry. The Royal Commission on Trade-Unions reported that it was

* See M. Batbie's article on " Salaires " iu Block's ' Dictionnaire de la Politique.'
                                                                    ----

extremely difficult to determine how far unions have impeded the develop-

ment of trade, whether by simply raising prices or by diverting trade from
certain districts, or from this to foreign countries. The representatives of
capital at the Conference alluded to endeavoured to prove that certain
branches of trade have permanently been injured by the unions. "Whether
the fact can be established or not, it is imdoniablc that British trade has
enormously increased within the last twenty years, and that the exports of
manufactured goods are on a larger scale now than they were at any former

period *.

"What is perhaps most objectionable in combinations of labour is the

method they often pursue in order to operate on the rates of wages ; for they

are not content with making a collective demand on employers for a rise,

but endeavour to force it, or resist a fall, by restricting the supply of labour

and increasing the need of it. One such method, explained at the Con-

Aference, seems to your Committee peculiarly objectionable.  representative

of labour said, " That when depression of trade comes, by means of associated

funds, the men are liable to say to the surplus labourers ' stand on one side,

you are not wanted for the time being ; if you go on with your labour at

half price, it will not mend the trade : we will not let you become a drug on

the market, putting every other man down, but we will sustain you.' " In

three years, your Committee were informed, over =£100,000 was thus paid

for unemployed labour, in the hope that undue fall in wages would be pre-

vented by keeping labourers out of the market. Your Committee are of

opinion that the artificial prevention of a fall of wages, when such a fall is

necessary and inevitable, is economically wrong, and can only have the effect

of still more injuring the condition of workmen, since by so doing they only

throw hindrances in the way of production, which is the parent of all wages.

Equally objectionable in your Committee's opinion, as interfering with the

freedom of labour and with the general economy of production, is every regu-

lation of such trade-unions that excludes from employment in the trades all
who have not been regularly apprenticed, or any rule which should set a

limit to the number of apprentices. Professor Cairnes, commenting on the

monopoly thus advocated by trade-unions, said, " It is a monopoly, more-

over, founded on no principle either of moral desert or of industrial effi-

ciency, but simply on chance or arbitrary selection ; and which, therefore,

cannot but exert a demoralizing influence on all who come within its scope

in all its aspects presenting an ungracious contrast to all that is best and

most generous in the spirit of modem democracy."

The only other question on which your Committee will report is whether

an artificial restriction of labour or of capital can, under any circumstances,

be economically right or beneficial. It is, indeed, scarcely necessarj- to say

that any restriction of labour or of capital having the effect of limiting pro-

duction, must of necessity prove injurious. Yet it may bo a point for con-
sideration whether, under certain circumstances, it may not be better for

either labour or capital to submit to the evil of restriction, in order to avoid
 a still greater evil, of producing at a loss, or working at rates of wages not
sufficiently remunerative. The labourers justify their proceedings in this

--respect by reference to the practice of producers. One of the representatives

of labour, speaking on this subject, said : " No doubt there is not a working
man in Lancashire who would not say that limitation was an injury. Gene-

 rally that there should be the largest possible production in a given time is

no doubt a true law ; but every trade must regulate that according to its own
necessities. The ironmaster blows out his furnaces when an increased pro-

 duction would injure ; the cotton manufacturer runs his manufactory short
 time ; and the labourer limits the production." There is httle or no difference
 in the relative position of capital and labour as respects their need of con-
 tinuous production. Primarily both employer and employed aHke depend
upon production as the only source for profits and wages. Whilst the em-

ployers have the maximum interest ia producing as much as possible, from

the fact that the fixed capital, which they cannot withdraw, would lie dor-
mant and unproductive while the forge or mill is silent, the employed find it
their interest to aid in such production, inasmuch as they depend upon it for
their means of subsistence. The argument of the employed against a pro-

--posal for a reduction of wages is exin-essed in the words : " If you have too

much of an article in the market and you cannot sell, I would rather limit
the quantity in your hands than aggravate the evil and take less money for
it." But by refusing to work when the employer is able or willing to con-
tinue producing, or by not submitting himself to accept lower wages when
the inevitable law of supply and demand compels the same, the employed
only aggravates his own position, whilst he places the employer in a still

worse strait ; the certain consequence of the withdrawal of laboiir being to

--discourage production, to enhance the cost, and to increase the difficulty of

foreign competition injurious alike to the producer and to the whole com-
munity.

   A frequent source of contention between employers and employed is the

mode of paying wages, viz. by time, such as by the day or hour, or by
piecework. There appears to be no uniform practice on the subject. While

--in some branches of industry the rule is to pay wages by piecework, in other

branches the rule is to pay by time the reason probably being that whilst in
some branches it is easy to establish a scale of prices at which the work is to
be paid for, in other branches such a scale could not easily be framed. In so
far as the method of payment can be considered to affect production, it seems
to your Committe that whilst payment by piecework is likely to promote
quantity of production, payment by time is more likely to promote precision
of execution. Tour Committee cannot believe, what has often been alleged,
that payment by piecework is often offered to conceal any reduction of wages.
If honestly acted upon on either side, payment by piecework has, in the
opinion of your Committee, all the elements of fair justice. But the ques-
tion in any case is not of sufficient importance to justify a breach of the

friendly relation which should exist between capital and labour. When

either party has any decided preference for one system, it seems advisable

that the other party should accept the same.

   The economic effects of strikes and lock-oucs are well known, and it matters
but little which party in the contest in the end may prove successful. In
recent years strikes and lock-outs have occurred among coal- and iro n-miaers

tho building-trade, engineers, the cotton-trade, ship-biiilders, and most of the
trades and industries of the country, each and all of which have caused
serious losses on tho community at large. In tho opinion of your Committee
a wcU-devised system of conciliation is the only proper and legitimate

method of solving labour-disputes. And your Committee cannot too strongly

express their sense of the grave responsibility which rests on either employers
or employed when, regardless of consequences, they resort to a step so vexa-
tious and destructive as a strike or lock-out.

   Your Committee are of opinion that tho British Association will confer a
lasting benefit if, on its pilgrimage in the principal industrial towns in the
United Kingdom, it will seize every opportunity for the enunciation of sound
lessons of Political Economy on the questions in agitation between employers
and employed. It was suggested to your Committee that workmen should

be admitted to the meetings of Section F at a reduced rate. Your Committee

desire to point out the importance of promoting, as far as possible, the study of
political economy, and especially of those branches of industrial economy which
most intimately concern the industry, manufactures, and commerce of the
country. Y'our Committee have learned with pleasure that the Cobden Club are
prepared to ofler some encouragement for the teaching of political economy to
the labouring classes ; and your Committee would suggest that the Chambers

of Commerce might advantageously take similar means in the great centres
of commerce and manufacture. In the opinion of your Committee, a proper
sense of the necessity and utility of continuous labour, an earnest desire for
the achievement of excellence in workmanship in every branch of industry,
and a keen and lively interest on the part of one and aU to promote national

prosperity, are the best safeguards against the continuance of those dis-
turbances between capital and labour which have of late become of such
hindrance to successful production. In the great contest which Britain has

to wage with other industrial nations, it is the interest of both masters and
men to be very careful lest, by raising the prices of British produce and
manufacture too high, they should no longer be able to carry the palm in the

arena of international competition.

   Your Committee regret the death of their much esteemed member Mr.
Samuel Brown, who took an active part in the proceedings. Professor

Fawcett, M.P., was unable to act. But your Committee have pleasure in
reporting that tho Eight Hon. Lord O'Hagan, Mr. Thomas Brassey, M.P.,
and Mr. A. J. Mundella, M.P., were added to the Committee.

WSecond Report of the Committee, consisting of . Chandler Roberts,

   appointed for the purpose of inquiring into the Method of making

   Gold-assays, and of stating the Results thereof. Drawn up by W.

   Chandler Egberts, F.R.S., Secretary.

In their last Eeport the Committee stated that portions of the gold plate,
which had been so long in course of preparation, had been sent to various
distinguished chemists on the continent and in America.

    Several Pioports have been received, all of which confirm the favourable
opinion the Committee expressed as to the purity of the plate. Towards the
--156 REPORT 1875.

close of the year the Secretary visited M. Stas in Brussels, aud received
from hina details of the experiments which he liad made in testing the metal,

tlie results proving that the plate contained 999'95 parts of pure gold in

1000. The minute trace of foreign matter which is admixed with the gold
was probably derived from the clay crucible in which the finely divided metal
was melted. Mr. J. Norman Lockyer, F.E.S., has photographed the violet
and ultra-violet parts of the spectrum produced by the electric arc when
pieces of this gold are employed as terminals, side by side with the solar
spectrum ; and the result proves that neither silver, copper, nor iron, the
metals which might have jjeen expected to be present, exists in sufficient
quantity to be detected by the spectroscope.

   With the completion of this standard plate an important step has been
made in that a common ::tandard for reference has been secured. With
regard to the discrepancies between the results of different assayers, the
Committee propose to collect evidence in the hope of being able to ascertain
whether the causes of difference are introduced at the second or foi;rth

stages of the operation, or, in other words, in the furnace or while parting
with acid.

   ties of Dry Land and under Water. Draivn up by Prof. Everett,

    Secretary.

The supposed difficulties in the way of obtaining observations of temperature
in the St.-Gothard tunnel have vanished of themselves. On a recent visit to
the tunnel, your Secretary had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Stapff, who lias

for two years filled the post of official geologist to the " Direction "' of tlio
Gothard Eailway, and has in that capacity made the temperature of the tunnel

a special object of investigation. Dr. Stapff's observations are contained in

successive numbers of the Monthly and Quarterly Eeports of the Chief
Engineer to the " Direction," and of the Swiss Government Engineer to the
subventing States, on the progress of the Gothard Eailway. A^paper on the
subject was read by Dr. Stapff at a recent meeting of the Swiss Society of
Naturalists held at Andermatt in the immediate neighbourhood of the tunnel;
and an abstract of it has been kindly communicated by him to the Secretary,
accompanied with tables and diagrams.

 --Dr. Stapffs observations were of three kinds :

   I. Observations of rock-temperature, made with very long thermometers,

inserted in horizontal bore-holes, of depth not exceeding one metre, in the sides

of the tunnel. The air was excluded by a firm plugging of taUow aU along
the stem, which was of such length that the scale projected into the air and
could be read without disturbing the instrument. They were graduated to
                                                                                    ;

                       ON UNDER6R0UND TEMPERATURE.                                  157

0-2 of a degree Centigrade, and read by estimation to 0-05, all necessary cor-
rections being applied, including a correction for temperature of stem. The

index-errors were known from compai'ison with standards, attention being

paid to the difference between the reading in a vertical and in a horizontal
position, which, on account of the great length of the column of mercury
and consequent pressure on the interior of the bulb, amounted to about half
a degree. As the thermometers were costly, and- were very liable to be
broken in the process of extraction, these rock- observations Avere compara-

tively few.

   One of the Committee's protected Negretti maximum thermometers was
left by the Secretary with Dr. Stapff, and has been used by him for verifying

some of his previous observations, the thermometer being pushed to the

bottom of the hole, with a cord attached, and the hole being then tightly

" plugged with rags and tallow.

   A minimum thermometer would have been more appropriate, as the rock

 was colder than the air ; but the Eutherford's minimum which the Secretary

 had provided was too large for the holes. Besides, it is doubtful whether
 the index could be trusted to retain its place during the extraction of the

 thermometer. The extreme slowness of action of the protected Negretti

 maximum was the one quality which rendered its use possible, and a non-

 registering thermometer possessing the same characteristic would be more

appropriate. It was accordingly agreed between Dr. Stapff and the Secretary

that a new pattern of non-registering thermometer should be constructed

with a special view to slowness of action. This end is to be attained by sur-
rounding the bulb with tallow or some other non-conducting solid, the whole
being inclosed in a sealed glass tube. [Six thermometers on this plan have
since been constructed by Negretti and Zambra, and two of them, after satis-
factory trials, were forwarded by the Secretary to Dr. Stapff on the 1st of

November.]
   II. Observations of air-temperature in the tunnel. The air is artificially

warmed by the presence of the workmen, by their lamps, and by blasting
and, on the other hand, is cooled by the escape of the compressed air from

the boring-engines. Dr. Stapff states that, notwithstanding these disturbing
influences, he " gradually fell into a uniform system of observing air-tempe-

rature, so that the mean results obtained were useful." He further found

that the mean air-temperature thus determined at any point wlien first laid
open by the driving forward of the narrow gallery (to be afterwards widened)

was identical (to a fraction of a degree) with the rock-temperature afterwards
observed at the same point at the depth of a metre in the walls. For ex-

ample, at the distance of 800 metres from the Swiss portal the rock-tempera-
ture, 1 metre deep, was 17°"85, the mean air-temperature when first observed

having been 17°-80. Again, at the distance of 1443 metres from the Swiss
portal the rock-temperature, 1 metre deep, was 18°-16 ; the mean air-tem-
perature when the heading had just advanced to this point was 17°'29, the
temperature at the same time from 20 to 40 metres further back being 18°"35.
The last observations made at the Italian end on the occasion of the verifica-
tion of the axis of the tunnel confirm this conclusion as to the approximate
identity of the air-temperature in the extreme end of the heading with the

temperature of the surrounding rock.

    III. Observations of the temperature of springs. In the Swiss portion,

up  to  the  date  of  the  Secretary's  visit,  there  were  no  springs  of  any  account
                                                                                                                   ;

but in the Italian portion they are mimerous. Wlicn water-filled crevices

(in the Italian portion) are first bored through, the water issues with the
158 REPORT 1875,

velocity due to a height of some 2 or 3 metres ; but as soon as such a cleft
is totally opened, the water runs down all around the perimeter of the gallery
without showing signs of pressure. Springs from the bottom (which are by
no means rare) have never shown signs of pressure.

   The temperature of springs is higher when they are first tapped than at any
subsequent period. The springs at the distance of from 780 to 820 metres
from the Italian portal fell, in the first fourteen days, from 10°*52 to 9°-75 C,
and those at the distance of from 1495 to 1500 metres from the Swiss portal,
which had a temperature of 17°'l when tapped in November 1874, have now

fallen to 16°"2, after the lapse of ten months.

   The temperature of springs, even when first tapped, is lower than that of
the surrounding rock. The average amount of this difference for the first
2200 metres from the Italian portal was 3°'14 C. In the first 1200 metres
it was generally greater, and in the remaining 1000 metres always less than
this average value. At 2180 metres it was reduced to -77 of a degree.
As these diflferences constitute one of the most noteworthy results of Dr.
StapfTs observations, they are here presented in tabular form. The degrees

are Centigrade.

      ON UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE.                                               159

   The tunnel has now been carried to a distance of 2500 metres at the Swiss

and 2200 metres at the Italian end ; and the temperature of the rock, as
deduced from air-observations, is

At 2400 metres from Swiss portal   21°-7 C.
                                   21°-3 C.

The distances from the surface (measured in the nearest direction) are 306
metres in the former case (the plain of Andermatt being overhead), and
1090 metres in the latter. The mean temperature at Gosclienen (the village

at the Swiss end) is 6°-82 C.
   Observations were taken (Aug. 17th, 1874) by Mr. John Donaldson, C.E.,

ill a pump-well 413 feet deep, at Mr. Sich's brewery, Chiswick, near London,
The pumps were kept idle all day to facilitate observation. The thermoincter
used was a protected Phillips's maximum. During the first series of obser-
vations, pumping was going on from a well in a neighboiiring brewery, an

operation which lowers the level of Mr. Sich's weU by about 3 inches. This
pumping was discontinued before the completion of the second series. The

surface of the water is 60 feet below the surface of the ground. The diameter
of the well is 5 feet to the depth of 200 feet, and is less than one foot (and
gradually diminishing) for the remainder of the depth. The following are

the observations :

The difference between the two obseiwed temperatures at 65 feet is attributed

to the disturbance of the water by passing the thermometer and suspending

wire through it. The difference of half a degree between the two observationg

at the bottom is attributed to the discontinuance of pumping in the next

brewery, as mentioned above. These temperatures (57°-5 and 58"-0 at the

depth of 395 feet) may be compared with the temperatures observed by

Mr. Symons in the Kentish-Town well at the depth of 400 feet, as given

in our Reports for 1869 and 1871, namely 58°-l and 57°*9. The agreement

is satisfactory, as indicating, on the one hand, that even where there is

strong convectivc action (as in this pump-weU) the temperature near the

bottom is but slightly affected; and, on the other, that where there are

no strong springs the temperature at intermediate depths (the Kentish-

Town well being 1100 feet deep) is likewise nearly free from couvective

disturbance.

  A boring in search of coal is being made at Swinderby, about eight miles

to the west of Lincoln, in which observations have been made by Mr. J. T.

Boot, the engineer of the works. The depth attained on July 19, 1875, was

At an earlier date. May 13th, the hole having been undisturbed for a few

days, the temperature 68|° was found at 1308 feet, which was the depth
then attained, and the temperatures GG°, 66°, 66°-2, 66°-G were found at the
respective depths of 0, 300, 490, 590 feet. The instrument employed on

both occasions was the protected Negretti maximum thermometer.

    These observations illustrate the difficulty of obtaining correct results in

the presence of strong springs of water. It is obvious that nearly all the

above temperatures are largely affected by convection. If we assume the

temperature at the bottom in each case to have been free from this source of
error, as well as from disturbance by the heat generated in boring (assump-

tions which are somewhat doubtful), and if we estimate the surface- tempe-
rature at 49°, we have the following mean rates of increase :

Between    feet and 1308 feet  1° T. for 68 feet.

  A bore-hole is being sunk to a depth of 2000 feet at Bohmisch-Brod, near

Prague ; and the Secretary has received two independent applications for

--thermometers for the purpose of making observations in it one of them from

the Academy of Sciences of Yienna, the other fi'om the Imperial Polytechnic
School at Prague. Two thermometers (one of the Negretti and one of the
Phillips pattern) were supplied in each case, the expense being defrayed by

the recipients. These applications are gratifying, as tokens of an increasing
interest in the subject of underground temperature.

   Two protected Negretti thermometers have been sent to Dr. Oldham,

Director of the Geological Survey of India, to be used in borings for coal in

that country. Arrangements are also being made by Mr. Blanford, Director

of Meteorological Observations for India, to establish regular observations of

earth-temperature at small depths at certain selected stations.

Tides in the River Mersey. Half-tide Level at Liverpool.

                By James N. Shoolbred, C.E.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in exiemo.']

       [Plate IV.]

In the year 1835, at the Meeting of the British Association in Dublin,
Captain (now Admiral) Henry Mangles Donham, R.N., Resident Marine
Surveyor of the Port of Liverpool, announced " that, from observations which
he had been enabled to take on the rise and fall of a number of tides in the

lliver Mersey, he had ascertained that there was an oscillating point or mean
centre which every six hours is common to all tides, whether spring or neap,
and called the half-tide mark or level."

   In 1837 Captain Denham further announced to the Association, at its

Meeting in Liverpool, " that the oscillation of each tide, whether spring or
neap, passed this line, viz. the half-tide level, at three hours before and three

hours after every high-water time, and not at the balf-elapsed time of high

and low water."

   Captain Denham considered this half-tide mark, though not a suitable

one to adjust soundings to, to be a most valuable datum for tide-gauge

operations, or as a point of departure for engineering levelling-operations

a remark which was subsequently fully confirmed by the selection of the
"level of mean tide at Liverpool" as the datum level for Great Britain for

the Ordnance maps.
    It will be seen, therefore, that tliis subject of the half-tide level is one that

has already received some attention, and has had a practical and important

ajiplication.

   It appears, therefore, not out of place to make a few remarks on this half-
tide level, and as to its real nature, especially as much information as to the

action of the tide in the Mersey has been obtained during the interval of

forty years that has elapsed since Capt. Denham first broached the subject.

   In the latter part of 1853 a self-recording tide-gauge was established at
Liverpool, near to the St. George's Pier-head, advantage being taken of one
of the bridges which connected the floating landing-stage to the shore, the
rising and falling of the bridge with the tide being communicated by a chain
arrangement to a self-recording drum driven by clockwork and there suit-

ably registered.

   These observations had been continued without interruption, save for short

repairs, since the above date until twelve months ago, when they were neces-

sarily suspended, owing to the burning of the landing-stage and the removal

of the connecting-bridge during its reconstruction.

As, however, the whole of the stage is expected to be again open for use

in the course of a short time, and as the connecting-bridges are now in posi-

tion, it may be confidently anticipated that the self-recording of the tides
may be again soon resumed.

    By the courtesy of the present Marine Surveyor to the Mersey Docks and
Harbour Board, Staff-Commander Graham H. Hills, E.N., the writer has
had an opportunity of inspecting a number of the resultant diagrams of the

tidal curves.

   After careful examination of many tides, the writer confesses himself quite
unable to agree with Capt. Denham in his definition that " the half-tide level
is an oscillating point or mean centre which every six hours is common to

aU tides, whether spring or neap," or with the assertion "that the oscilla-
tion of each tide, whether spring or neap, passed this line at three hours
before and three hours after every high- water time."

    Some difterence of opinion seems to exist as to the interpretation of the
term " mean or half-tide level." The method by which this level appears
commonly if not generally to be arrived at is by taking the meau of a
number of levels of high water for a mean high water, then of a nearly
similar number of low-water ones to form a mean low-water level, the
difference between these two means giving a mean tidal range, the half of
which amount, being reckoned upwards from the mean low-water level,

--gives an absolute level called the mean or half-tide level in fact the

mean half-range of the tide.
    "Whether this is exactly what Capt. Denham meant by his "oscillating

point or mean centre," is uncertain. But it is without doubt that this half-

 range varies considerably, not only with successive tides, but even over

lengthy periods, such as a year in duration, or even a duration of years.

    The writer has been enabled, by the courtesy of the Marine Surveyor, to
place upon the diagram hereto appended (Plate IV.) the annual means at

Liverpool for high water, for low water, for tidal range, and for the haK-tide

--level for the twenty years extending from 1854 to 1873 each year being

represented by a vertical line with its date upon it, and the position of its
mean of high water, low water, and half-tide level indicated upon it to a scale
 of a quarter of an inch to one foot. The irregular line at the top of the diagram
 is formed by the junction of the annual means of high water, the mean high
water for the twenty years being indicated by a horizontal line. The low-
water means are similarly treated at the bottom of the diagram ; while in

the middle of the sheet the half-tide levels are described in a like way.
    The datum to which they are reduced is the sUl of the Old Dock at Liver-

pool, a datum much in use in that neighbourhood.

   A very brief inspection of the diagram will show that there is considerable

variation in each of the means between different years, amounting, in more
than one case, to nearly twelve inches. And if so with annual means, how
much greater the irregularity in shorter periods !

    If, therefore, by " half-tide, level " Capt. Denham means the level of half-
tide range, his idea of " an oscillating point common to all tides " cannot

hold good, seeing that the result of the twenty years' observations shows
considerable differences to have existed in the "half-tide level" between the
several years, in some cases nearly nine inches.

    It may, however, be urged that some of the variations occurring in the

course of this lengthened period are caused by the altered form of the course
of the tidal channel of the River Mersey near to its mouth, to its being gra-
dually narrowed and made more direct by each successive prolongation of the
liver-wall of the Liverpool Docks.

   While admitting that something may be due to this cause (a matter not
                        ON TIDES IN THE KIVER MERSEY.         168

yet proved), tlierc still exists sufficient irregulaiity, shown sometimes in one
direction and sometimes in another, at times also when no new alterations

in the form of the channel were taking place, to disprove the accuracy of

Capt. Dcuham's theory of a permanent oscillating point as far as regards the

tides in the Mersey.

   As to his second assertion, " that this half-tide level line is passed hy the

oscillation of each tide at three hours before and three hours after high-water

time, and not at the half-elapsed time of high and low water," its value can

only be ascertained by a close inspection and analysis of the tidal diagrams

themselves.

The writer can, however, state the opinion of the present Marine Surveyor

of Liverpool (who has had charge of these tidal observations almost ever

since their commencement, and therefore is intimately acquainted -with

them), who considers that this assertion of Capt. Denham's is quite un-

tenable.

   The selection of the half-tide level at Liverpool as the datum for the
Ordnance Survey of Great Britain was made after a series of tidal observa-

tions carried on in 1859 at a number of ports round the coast of England*.

   In the Ordnance book, ' The abstract of Levelling in England and Wales,'

--1861, it is defined in the following terms: "The datum level for Great

Britain is the level of mean tide at Liverpool, as determined by our own
^obsei-vations ; it is
                        of an inch above the mean tidal level obtained from

the records of the self-recording tide-gauge on St. George's Pier, Liverpool."

These records, as will be seen by the annexed Table, give the mean half-

tide level for the five years preceding 1859 as 4-948 feet above the Old Dock

Sill. If to this be added the j\ of an inch (-066 foot) referred to in the
Ordnance book, a total of 5-014 feet above Old Dock Sill (the zero of the tide-

gauge at the St. George's Pier) is obtained as the level of the Ordnance

datum, a difference which is quite borne out by the actual levelling of

several engineers.

The Ordnance book of levels already referred to gives, in another portion

of the book, in the column of levels only 4-67 feet as the difference between

the Ordnance datum and the zero of the tide-gauge. While, to render the

discrepancy stUl more intelligible, no doubt, the printer has omitted the

minus sign before the last-named level, so placing the zero of the tide-

--gauge above the half-tide level thus introducing a possibility of error (to

strangers to the locality) of over nine feet in the comparison of these two
important systems of levels (the Ordnance and the Old Dock Sill).

   When it is considered of what importance to the country are those most

carefully prepared maps of the Ordnance Sui-vey, and the system of levels

which they introduce, it will be readily seen that it should be a matter of

paramount importance to dispel any discrepancy or uncertainty which may

exist as to the very fons et origo of that system of levels.

In conclusion, it must not be supposed from the above remarks that the

writer, while adducing the irregularity of the half-tide level at Liverpool, as

evidenced by the result of twenty years' observations, wishes to argue against

the practical uniformity of the mean level of the open sea all the world over

--a fact which is being each day more fully admitted. Liverpool is not on

   * Since writing the above, it appears, from ii commuiiieatiou received by the author
from the Ordnance Office at Southampton, that "the assumed mean water at Liverpool
depends upon tidal observations taken by this Department in March 1844, " and that
the 1859 observations published in the Ordnan ce book are those of the self-registering

tide-gauge.

ON THE STRUCTURE OF CARBONirEROUS CORALS.                        165

Sixth Report of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. Thomas Wilt-
   shire, M.A., F.G.S., Prof. Williamson, F.R.S., and James
   Thomson, F.G.S., Secretary, appointed to investigate the Structure

   of the Carboniferous Corals.

During the past year the Committee have conducted their investigations
and have made sections of upwards of 300 specimens. In order that they
might arrive at as clear a conception as possible of their specific value, the

Secretary went over to Paris, and examined the types of MM. Milne-Edwards

and J. Haimc, and also those of Prof, do Koninck in Belgium, and compared
them with the structural details as delineated in the Plates already prepared

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and the result of his investigation warrants them in saying that they are glad
they have not published more than brief abstracts of their investigations. The
delay has also enabled them to try several methods for delineating the intri-

cate and delicate structure of many of these corals, well knowing that their

structure could not be reproduced by the ordinary process of lithograph}-.

The system adopted is the result of many experiments, and the one most
suited for the purpose, as by it can be given facsimiles of the most delicate
stnicture, thus placing in the hands of students the means whereby they can
name either genera or sj^ecies even from small fragments.

    The results of the investigations and comparison of the type forms referred
to point to three new genera. The varieties, however, are so numerous,
that it was felt desirable to make other sections before determining distinct

varieties.

   The following have been determined, and arc engraved upon what they
l^rovisionally term Plate XII.

   AsindiophyUum, Thomson, gen. nov. The generic name is taken from
the form and position of the boss in the centre of the calice, it being helmet-
shaped. As the characters upon which the generic distinction is founded

have been described in detail in the Transactions of the Philosophical Society
of Glasgow for 1874, the descriptions need not be repeated. The generic
and specific names of those published are :

    In Aspidioplnjllum HuxJeyiannm one of the primary septa is shorter than
the others, with a clavate tube-like process lying in the plane of the open
interseptal spaces. Around the inner margin of the tube-like body are
grouped a number of ovule-like bodies, much resembling ova. Detailed

accounts of these are published in the Transactions of the Philosophicsi
Society of Glasgow for 1874.

differ from those described in essential specific characters, and will be described

hereafter.

with the former genus.

discovered at Brockley, near Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, many years ago. It
exhibits characteristics hitherto unnoticed. The Secretary proposes calling

it Kumatiojphiillum. It has at least ten good species, which will bo described

 as before stated.

ward to be described in this year's Report.

Reporter.

           [Plates V. & VI.]

WoEK was carried on almost uninterruptedly throughout the year, except
from March 20th to May 20th, when it was stopped for want of funds. An

appeal to the public by the Settle Committee was made, and at tho end of two
mouths they considered themselves justified in recommencing work.

   It is a matter of much interest to the Committee that the last subscription
received (on Jan. 10th, previous to stopping the work for want of funds) was

from the late Sir Charles Lyell, and imsolicited. Sir Charles had taken a
deep personal interest in the explorations from theii' commencement, had

--visited the Cave, and been a frequent subscriber to the fund.
    Tlie Glacial Beds. It wiU be remembered that in the last Eeporc at Bel-
fast we drew attention to the evidence respecting the pre- or interglacial

age of tho lower deposits in the Victoria Cave, which contain the early

Pleistocene fauna associated with a human fibula. Since that time further
evidence in this direction has been obtained. The great mass of boulders
which lies upon the edges of the Lower Cave-earth at the entrance and be-

neath all the screes or talus has been further followed ; aud the facts brought

to light are very interesting, and throw much light upon the origin and de-

position of the glacial beds.

    The boulders have now been uncovered over an area of about 30 x 40 feet,
or 1200 superficial feet (see Plates V. & VI. and descriptions), and probably
extend beneath the screes over a still greater area. As before, the boulders are

 of all sizes and of various origin. Of the limestone boulders a large proportion
are of blue or black limestone, and not of the white limestone in which the
cave is excavated. They probably come from the top of the Carboniferous
 Limestone, which is widely exposed in the country to the north around the
foot of Penyghent. One large boulder, on the other hand, an easily recog-
ON THE EXPLORATION OF- THE SETTLE CAVES.  167

 nizable rock, consists of a portion of the base of the Carboniferous Limestone,
which is a couglomerate of Silurian pebbles in a matrix of limestone, and
must have travelled at least two miles to its present position. Other bonlders
consist of Carboniferous Sandstone or Millstone-grit, but a very large propor-

tion are of Silurian rocks.

    In size they run from large blocks several tons in weight to mere sand-

grains, for the passage may be easUy observed. At one place you have

large boulders in a matrix of stony clay, then a clayey gravel, the component

stones wcU scratched and bruised as only glacial deposits are, then fine

gravel, still of the same character, shading off into sand. The sand again

gives place to laminated clay of the finest character.

   A very interesting section showing this has been lately uncovered ; it

lies at the back of the boulders, and contains several beds of laminated clay,

sand, and gravel intercalated with indisputable glacial deposits.

   This may be regarded as a positive proof that some at least of the lami-

nated clay is of glacial age and origin.
    In removing some of the boulders at the entrance, a step which the pro-

gress of the work necessitated, we appear at length to have come upon the

solid floor of the cave-mouth. "We found several long, wedge-like masses of

rock, with their apices upwards, sticking up from amongst the boulders. They
seem to run along definite lines, the spaces between which coincide with the
vertical joints traversing the roof and side of the cave.

   They stand up in pinnacles, and are not unlike in form similarly weathered

floors in other caves in Craven. "We may mention Browgill Cave near
Horton in Eibblesdale, which is now occupied by a stream. This peculiar
form seems to have arisen from the water working down along the joints

and slowly dissolving the limestone, leaving an edge projecting iipwards, in
some cases almost as shai-p as a knife. That the Victoria Cave was once a
stream-course there can be no doubt ; not only these limestone pinnacles,
but the peculiar weathering of the side of the cave at the entrance into a
succession of arched niches corresponding with the joints (another charac-

teristic of water caves) render this tolerably certain (see Plates Y. & VI.

and descriptions).

   And now, with the additional evidence of another year's diggings, we may

--again consider the question (the most interesting perhaps of all the problems

before us) Are the glacial deposits, which rest upon the older bone-beds

containing the extinct pleistocene mammals and man, in the position which

they occupied at the close of glacial conditions, or have they subsequently

fallen into their present site ?

   "We may again urge the reasons given last year, strengthened by enlarged

sections and a wider experience, which go to prove the first alternative.

   1. The cliff immediately above the cave is free from any boulder deposits

             for a considerable distance.

   2. The boulders lie at the base of all the talus, which must have been
           forming ever since glacial conditions declined, and no other falls of
           even isolated boulders have occurred throughout the whole thickness

             of talus.

   3. The boulders are so close beneath the cliif, that if aU the limestone
         which has fallen from it and is now lying on the boulders could be
          restored to the cliff, it would project so much further forward, that the
           fall of the boulders from the cliff to their present position would be

             impossible.
                                               ----

--1C8 REPORT 1875.

   To these arguments we may now add the following:

   4. That the extent of the glacial deposits now exposed is so great that

           it is impossible that they can be a mere chance accumulation of
           boulders which have been redeposited in their present position since

              glacial times.

    This being the case, it is clear from the position of the boulders beneath
all the screes that they form a portion of the general glacial covering of the
valleys and hillsides which was left by the ice-sheet at the time of its disap-

pearance.

    These are the main arguments to be derived from the cave itself; but
further strong presumptive evidence that the Pleistocene fauna lived in the
north of England before the ice-sheet exists as foUows :

    The older fauna once lived in that district, a point which admits of no
dispute from its existence iu the Victoria Cave, in Kirkdale Cave, Eaygill
Cave in Lothersdale, and perhaps in other caves ; but their bones are now
found nowhere in the open country. None of the river-gravels contain them

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and just that district which is conspicuous by their absence is also remark-
able for the strongest evidences of great glaciation. If these facts be taken
together, the probability is very strong that it was glaciation which destroyed
their remains in the o])en countrj'.

    To suppose that they have been destroyed by other subaerial agencies
would be to ignore the fact that in the south of England and other non-
glaciated areas such remains exist both in caves and iu river-gravels. This
view your Eeporter has held for some j'cars ; a somewhat similar view has been
well stated by Mr. James Geikie, and Prof. Boyd Dawkins also agrees in it.

               Bones heneaih tlie Talus and on tlie Boulders.

In removing the talus, certain bones were found lying beneath it upon

the boulders.

They have, so far as practicable, been determined by Prof. Busk ; and he

gives the following account of them.

   " They are nearly all fragments, but No. 1 is perfect.
    " 1. Eight calcaneum of Ursus arctos, 3-4 inches long, 2-2 wide, 1*75 high,
   " 2. Portion of a young, much worn left calcaneum of Ursus, with anterior

and posterior epiphyses detached.

" 3-67. Small chips and fragments, mostly apparently of the shafts of long

bones and ribs of ruminants. Doubtfully referred to Ox? Deer? Goat? or

Sheep ?
   " 68. Fragment, probably Elephant.

" 69. Fragment of a large Deer-bone.

" 70. Fragment of long bone of large bird, probably Swan.

" 72, Sesamoid bone of ·  ?

" 77. Fragment of vertebra, perhaps of Bear."

It is an interesting point, if we could make it out, what is the age of these

bones. Are they the remains of animals who died upon the moraine rub-

bish before the talus was of sufficient thickness to form a recognizable bed ?

or are they bones washed out of the edges of the older cave-earth then exposed

above the boulders ? The bone doubtfully referred to Wild Swan would seem

to point to a rigorous or temperate* climate. The bone doubtfully referred

   * I have heard of three instances of Wild Swans haling been shot in the immediate

neighbourhood. C. Leigh, in his 'Nat. Hist, of Lancashire' &c., published in 1700, says,

"Swans are commoD in the.se parts, but more particularly on the sea-coasts " (p. 141).

 to Elephant docs not give very strong indications. There seems a possibility

 of its having been washed out of the lower cave-earth, which contains

 Elephant-remains.

    Most probably both of these sources contributed to this deposit of bones ; but
 that the greater part of them are washed out of the lower cave-earth seems

--likely, for this reason that not any fragments of bone were found through

 the 19 feet of talus which lies between the Neolithic layer and the top of the

 boulders.

  --Work in CJiamber D. Neiu Galleries. Besides the work which has been

 done towards unfolding the glacial evidence at the mouth of the cave,
a considerable amount of work has been done in excavating chamber D, and

Dwe have the result in a magniiicent series of bones. Chamber will be re-

membered by those who made a thorough visit to the cave, and explored all

its narrowest recesses, as a very low chamber to the right of the principal
 entrance, filled nearly up to the roof with soft wet mud. It was so low over

 a greater part of its extent that progression could not be effected on hands

and knees, and a seq)ent-like movement through pools of water Ij'ing on soft

mud was the only way in which it could be visited. Chamber D now presents a

very different aspect. So extensive have been the workings there, that at

the entrance the ceiling is now 20 feet above one's head, and it gradually

declines towards the inner extremity to a height of 4 or 5 feet. It is about
20 feet wide and 110 feet long ; and two galleries have been discovered
leading off from it on the right. One is blocked at the entrance with thick
beds of stalagmite and fallen blocks of limestone, and has not been explored

hitherto. The other leads down at Parallel 44 into a chamber 44 feet long
with a N.E. direction, at a tolerably rapid gradient of about 1 in 4"5. At
the end of this isa narrow squeeze whicli admits your Eeporter for a short
distance only. The forbidden ground beyond has been visited by Mr. John
Birkbeck, Jun. ; and he reports that this pipe-like cavitj' proceeds a short dis-
tance further and crosses a narrow chasm abo\it 20 feet deep, down which he

descended ; but further progress proved imjiracticable.

   This gallery we propose to call the Birkbeck Gallery, in acknowledgment
of the energetic and valuable assistance of Messrs. John Birkbeck, Sen. and

--Jun., to the cave exploration from its commencement in 1870.
   The Bemains found in Chamber D. The Committee is much indebted to

Prof. Busk for his kindness in determining the bones found.
   Before being submitted to him they have been all marked with register

numbers* in the form of a fraction, the numerator (in this case 1) standing
for the year (1874), and the denominator for the no. of the " find " in the
year thus, -j-, |, g, &c. Eor 1875 the numerator is 2, and for 1876 it will be
3 if the exidorations continue, and so on. As records are kept of what

portion of the cave is explored in each year, this system will facilitate the
reference of any particular bone to its position in the cave. In the past

year the bones have also been marked with notes of their position. Thus

Dthe large skull of the Grisly Bear -^^ is marked " P 37, L 4-0, 4-0," which

means that it was found in the 2 feet Parallel 37, at a distance of 4 feet left
of the wall of the chamber, and at a depth of 4 feet from the surface.

   The note-book in which Prof. Busk's determination of the bones is written
win be preserved in the Giggleswick Museum for reference.

  His summary of the bones found in chamber D is as follows :

   * This and other valuable services have been carefully carried out for the Committee by
Mr. Jackson, the Superintendent.

To those we may add 1 of Pig, 2 of Elephant, and 1 of Hippopotamus.

The Elephant-remains consist of two small right and left lower antepenul-

timate milk-molars of Eleplias antiquus, determined by Prof. Leith Adams.

A fragment of the tusk of a Hippopotamus, about 2 inches long, is a discovery

of the year, being the first relic of Hippopotamus found throughout the ex-

plorations. It was in Parallel 32, at a depth of 7 feet. Close by it was the

carnassial tooth of a Hyaena, which perhaps may account for its having been

found at such a distance from the river, now flowing about 1000 feet below.

   It may be well here to correct an error as to the identification of remains
of which a list occurs in Mr. Denny's paper "On the Geological and Archaeo-

logical Contents of the Victoria and Dowkabottom Caves in Craven," Proe.

Geol. and Polytechnic Soc. of the West Eiding, 1859. At the head of the

list of animals found is the following entry :

A" Cave Tiger (Felis spelceci).  canine tooth recognized by the late Dr.
--Buckland, and now in the British Museum. Victoria Cave."

Inasmuch as in the course of six years' diggings no remains of Tiger or

Lion had been recognized by the Committee, Mr. William Davies, of the

British Museum, was communicated with ; and he kindly returned an answer
that he had examined the remains in the British Museum, that it was a case,

as surmised, of erroneous identification, and that the tooth in question was

the canine of a Bear.

The existence of the Cave-Lion in the Victoria Cave remains therefore to

be proved.

 --Prof. Busk remarks of the bones and teeth submitted to him: "They are

a remarkably interesting collection, especially in the Bears ; and I think the

larger of the two skulls is by far the finest specimen of the kind yet found in

this country."

   Many interesting facts come out from the systematic record of the position

of the bones. The aj)pended Table (p. 174) of instances of bones which appear
to belong to the same individual, but which have been found apart from one

another, is an interesting commentary upon the way in which bones become

scattered through a cave whether by the intentional transportation by beasts of

prey in the process of devouring, or by the shuffling tread of the same beasts

amongst the loose bones lying on the floor.

This leads us to the fact that many of the bones have a very fine polish

and it seems probable that the cause of this is that suggested by Dr. Buck-

land*, the treading of the beasts upon them ; the fine mud occurring in the
cave would make a very good pollshing-paste, and being of a very plastic

nature, would tend afterwards, when accumiilating in sufficient quantity, to

cover up the bones and preserve that polish. It occurs on the long bones of

both ruminants and Bears, and not only on one side as noticed by Dr. Buck-

land, but all round. The specimens noticed are all apparently in the upper

                           * Reliquiae DiluTianre, p. 31.

bed, to be hereafter mentioned. One of the polished long bones of an Ox

has a crust of stalagmite upon it, and the polish I'uns up to and under it.

   The greatest distance to which wc have traced separate bones of the same
individual is 44 feet in the case of the right calcaneum and right astragalus

of a Hyffina; they occurred at the depths of 10 and 6 feet respectively.
   Another interesting case is that of a magnificent pair of Reindeer-antlers,

which were in four portions scattered over a distance of 32 feet. Moreover,

and this is an instructive fact, the several portions were in different states of

preservation, yet could be fitted together without any difficulty. This we
should do well to remember when inclined to speculate on the relative age of

bones from their state of preservation.

   Again, the two fibulas of Bear, probably belonging to the same individual,

being a right and left, and having each a tumour of the bone in the same

position on the shaft, remind us that bears may have sources of discomfort
quite apart from the " res angusta domi." Two fearfuUy swollen and dis-
torted metatarsals of the same animal (^V* ^^^ s'V*) *^^ *^^ same tale. On
the other hand, two large tusks of the Grisly Bear (^^ and ^), worn down

almost to their sockets, would seem to indicate a healthy life extending to a
good old age.

   Your Reporter has carefully reduced from the data in the register a synop-
tical section, showing the occurrence of each animal in the different parallels
and the depth at which they occur. The result is a Table too bulky for pub-

lication, but its substance may be briefly given in words.

   The bones appear to group themselves chiefly along two horizons, which
are separated from one another by a greater or less thickness of cave-earth,
laminated clay, and stalagmite.

    The lower extends from the back of the boulder-beds before the cave
mouth, is continuous with that which contained the human fibula, and runs
almost continuously as far as P 42, and possibly further. The upper bed com-

mences only at P 1 5, and extends to about P 43. "^\Tiere the upper bed com-

mences, the two horizons are about 12 feet from one another ; but the lower

rises quickly towards P 23, then continues horizontally at a depth of about 5
feet below the upper bed as far as P 35. At this point it rises still more, and

the two beds not only touch each other, but seem to be somewhat intermingled.

  D --The following Table shows the species occurring in the two beds in

Chamber
--173 REPORT 1875.

    The upper bed probably coutains remains from the Ecindeer period to

the present, those of later date being mixed up with the older in the mud at

the surface. But as distinguished from the lower bed, the chief characteris-
tics of the upper appear to be the presence of Eeindeer, and the absence of
Elephant, Ilhinoceros, Hippopotamus, and Hj'cena. It is true that by the
register there appears to be one specimen (a molar tooth) of Reindeer in the

lower bed. It is marked P 35, and as at a depth of 8 feet, which would
place it in the lower bed. It seems that this may be possibly a clerical

error, and that 8 inches would be the proper reading. The mere placing
the stop before or after the numeral would make the difference ; moreover
there are Ecindeer- remains in the same parallel at a depth of 1 foot, and in
the next parallel at a depth of 8 inches. If it was reallj* found at a depth
of 8 feet, it is a solitary instance of Reindeer in the lower bed, whereas in
the upper it is common.

   Of Hyaena, very common in the lower bed, there appears at first sight to

be one specimen (a humerus) in the upper ; but on examination this is not
quite so certain. It occurs in Parallel 37 at a depth of 2 feet, where the
two beds run together. This alone ought to put us on our guard. Rut
strangely enough it is at 2 feet higher elevation in the same parallel than
the great skull of Grisly Rear, which is proved by the situation of its lower
jaw on the surface to belong to the upper bed. It did not lie, however,
immediately above the Rear's skull, but 2 feet east of it ; so that it seems

quite possible that the apparent superposition may be only due to the un-
evenness of the floor at the time when the Rear's skull came into position, 'i

    It is also highly improbable that had the Hyaena lived at the same time as
this great Bear, he would have left so fine a skuU intact for the Committee
to exhume.

    These facts are of great interest and importance, as warning us against
the danger of assuming from the juxtaposition of objects their contempo-

raneity in all cases. In this case we have a fauna which we may confi-

dently assign to a cold climate, separated in some parts by an accumulation
of deposits twelve feet in thiclness from an earlier one, which is equally
characteristic of high temperatures ; whereas in another part of the cave
not far off, where the material to separate them is wanting, we have animals
from icy and tropical countries intermingled in a confusion which would
be puzzling did wc not get the clue hard by. It is evident that here the
separation is natural and regular ; the mixture is abnormal and accidental.

   It is probable that Rrown Bear occurs in both the beds ; there are many

Bear-remains in both ; but they do not, in most cases, admit of specific deter-

mination. Brown Bear has been found before in the higher beds in other

parts of the cave.

    Rhinoceros leptorhinus has not been found before in the cave, but its pre-

sence is well established now by teeth and bones*. It is interesting to note

that it is as usual accompanied by Elephas antlqims. Hippopotamus, as
already stated, has been found this year for the first time.

    In the upper bed, the only sign of man's presence consists of the spinous
process of a bear's vertebra, which has been hacked, apparently by some cutting-
instrument with a tolerably regular edge. It might have been done

Dwith a bronze celt or a polished flint axe. It is probable that chamber

was never the resort of man within the historic period. The soft wet mud of

the floor and the lowness of the roof render it most unlikely that any one would
take to it, except under the direst necessity or in the pursuit of science.

   * P.S. It would appear that the remains occurring iu the Care, formerly attributed to
R, tichorhinus, really belong to this species.

In the lower bed, again, cvklcuce of man's presence is but scanty. At the

mouth, and close to where the human fibula was found, we have this year

met with a piece of rib (jf .-) apparently nicked by human agency. It is

about 2| inches of the dorsal end, but the articulating surfaces are broken

off. There are nine transverse nicks not reaching quite across, some not

halfway, and also a longitudinal nick. They appear to have been made by

some clumsy instrument drawn backwards and forwards. In character they

are totally unlike the square troughed hollows made by the gnawing of

rodents ; and they are equally unlike the furrows heavily ploughed by the

teeth of Carnivores. This specimen was at a depth of 25 feet from the roof

Weof the cave, which at this point was filled to the ceiling.   cannot at

present say of what animal it is a rib. Some light may perhaps be thrown

on it by a careful comparison. This is immaterial compared to the main

fact, which is, that there is much difficulty in supposing it to have been

--nicked by any agency other than human.
   Conclmion. And now, having restricted ourselves almost entirely to the

hard road of fact, in conclusion we may perhaps be permitted to indulge in a short

flight of fancy. Let us endeavour to realize how great is the distance in time

We\vliich separates the savage of Craven from our own day.      have the

history of much of it in the Victoria Cave itself, and we may restore some of

the missing pages from the surrounding district. At the Cave, Eoman times

are separated from our own by sometimes less than one, but not by more

than two feet of talus, the chips which time detaches from the cliffs above.

The Neolithic age, which antiquaries know was a considerable time before

the Homan occupation, is represented by a layer in some places 4 or 5 feet

beneath the Roman, in others running into it. Then comes a thickness of

19 feel of talus without a record of any living thing. Judging by the shal-

lowness of the Roman layer, this must represent an enormous interval of

time. And this takes ns down to the boulders, the inscribed records of the

Glacial Period. They must represent a long scries of climatal changes,

during which the ice was waxing and waning, advancing and melting back

over the mouth of the Victoria Cave. This period saw the Reindeer and the

Grisly Bear occasionally in possession. Then we have an unconformity, a break

--in the continuity of tlie deposits, the boulders lying on the edges of the older

beds Time again ! And that time was long enough for changes to take

place which allowed the district to cool down from a warmth suitable to tlie

Hippopotamus and become a fitting pasture-ground for the Reindeer. It

was in that warm period that the Craven savage lived and died.

But these are not all the changes which occurred in the north of England

since that time. The age of the great submergence represented by the sea-

beaches of Mod Tryfaen and Macclesfield, and by the Middle- Sands-and-

Gravels of Lancashire, has left no record up at the cave. Your Reporter is of

opinion that the submergence did not attain in that district a greater depth

than six or seven hundred feet ; and this would still leave the cave 700 feet

above the sea, though it would cut up the land into a group of islands. The

fact is sufficient for us, the depth is immaterial. Upon no fact arc geologists

better agreed than i;pon the existence of a widespread submergence and

emergence of land towards the close of the Glacial Period. No tradition is
common to more races or religions than that of a great deluge. Where back

in the past is the common point whence those two far-travelled, almost paral-

lel rays of truth had their origin ? In the opinion of your Reporter the

Craven savage, who lived before the Great Ice-sheet and before the Great Sub-
mergence, may form another of the many strong ties which bind together the

sciences of Geology and Anthropology.

Victoria Cave, No. 1. Tliis gives a general view of the Cave and the cliffs above. Above
         the workmen is a cavo boarded up and used as a tool-house. To the right of that
          is a niche in the Cliff, the old entrance to tho'^Cave first discovered by Mr. Jackson.
         The present entrance, before the excavations, was completely covered up with screes.
          Mr. Jackson, the figure on the right, is sitting close to the arched niches mentioned at
         p. 167. The flat in the fore ground is not a natural feature, but produced by the

       Alevelling of the tip and talus. The bottom of the valley is at a far lower level.

         level cutting through the flat is seen going from the left-hand lower corner up to

           the boulders.

Victoria Cave, No. 2, gives a nearer view of the boulders near the entrance, of the rock-
         pinnacies forming the floor, and of the arched niches described at p. 167. The

         human relics were found near the crowbar, which is seen in the background be-
          yond the workmen, but at a lower level. Mr. Jackson is standing between the
          boulders and the talus, and the marked dilTerence between the two deposits is well

        seen. The boulders before being photographed were marked S for Silurian, L for

         Carboniferous Limestone, and Gr for Carboniferous Gritstone. The marks C°" and
         S'* should have been C" and S'« for Conglomerate and Stalactite, and denote respec-
           tively a piece of the conglomerate from the base of the Carboniferous Limestone,
          and two large pieces of Stalactite, which have apparently fallen on the boulders
         from the roof of the Cave before it had been worn as far back as it now is.

 On the River Avon {Bristol) : its Drainage-Area, Tidal Phenomena,
         and Dock Works. By Thomas Howard, M.Inst. C.E.

       [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.]

                                                           [Plate VII.]

The heacT-waters of the Bristol Avon may be considered to take their rise

in the eastern slopes of the lower CotsM'olds, to the north of Tetbury in
Gloucestershire, the stream gathering in from the west, in its course south-
ward through Malmesbury, the drainage of the oolitic district about Bad-
minton ; while the watershed on the east is only parted by a shght ridge
from the coiintry draining into the r;ppermost branches of the Thames.

Below this the Avon drains the Wootton-Bassett district, together with the
country bounded by the western outcrop of the chalk hills of Marlborough,
Avebury, and Beckhampton Downs, and the north-western part of Salisbiuy
Plain, including the towns of Calne, Devizes, Melksham, Westbury, Trow-

bridge, and Bradford-on-Avon. An important tributary, the Frome (Somer-

setshire), which brings the most southerly part of the drainage of the Avon,
jises near Brutou, and, embracing the watershed of the easternmost part of
the Mendip Hills, drains the town of Frome and several important manu-
facturing villages, joining the Avon at about three miles below Bradford.
Below this the Avon receives on the left the Midford Brook, and on the
right the Box and other streams ; and flowing on through Bath, receives
several small affluents, and at Keynsham the Chew, which springs from the
northern slope of the Mendips. In this district the springs from which
Bristol is supplied with water take their rise, at Chewton Mendip. Con-
tinuing its course towards Bristol, the river falls into the tideway over a weir
at Netham, a point about 3| miles above the entrance to the docks at
   --1

176 REPORT 1875.

Bristol. The tidal portion of the river continues its course by a new cliaunel,

cut about seventy years ago south of the city, to its junction -with the

Severn estuary at Kingroad. The fresh water of the river, impounded by
the dam at Netham, is diverted by a canal into the heart of the city, passing
under Bristol Bridge through what -was formerly the old course of the river,
but now converted into the Bristol floating harbour. Into the harbour
enters also another affluent, the Prome (Gloucestershire), taking its rise in
the hills above Wickwar and Chipping Sodbuiy. The docks at Bristol have
therefore the advantage, in short-water seasons, of the combined volume of
these streams, -which, after passing through the harbour, is discharged at the
various outlets of the locks and basins.

   The entire drainage-area of the Avon and its tributaries above Netham is
about 795 square miles, and that of the Gloucestershii-e Frome about 68
square miles, making the total area draining in through Bristol Harbour
about 863 square miles. Between Bristol and the mouth of the river the
area draining into the Avon is very limited, amounting only to about 31

square miles, the chief drainage of this jjart of the district being direct into
the Severn.

   The longest branch of the Avon, from its rise above Tctbury to Bath city
bridge, is, taking its winding course, about 46 miles. The navigable part
of the river from Bath to Netham is about 14| miles, and the tidal portion
from Netham to the junction with the Severn about 11 miles. Total length
about 72 miles.

   The fall in the bed of the Avon from Bath to the Severn is as follows,

viz. :
                                                                      ;;

        ON THE DRAINAGE-AREA ETC. OF THE RIVKR AVON.                  177

elevation will, however, be found in the Frome (Wiltshire) district, -s^liere

the Old Red Sandstone, at Downliead Common (Mendips), reaches 1078 feet

the Inferior Oolite, at East Cranmore, 814 feet ; the Mountain Limestone,

at Leigh-upon-Mendip, 800 feet ; and the Coal-measures above Mells

about 770 feet. The Inferior Oolite at Lansdown, near Bath, also rises to

about 7i30 feet, and at Dundry, south of Bristol, to about 750 feet.

The hilly and non-absorbent character of the soils of a great portion of tlie

district causes the rain which falls to be carried off rapidly ; and heavy floods

are sometimes experienced in Bristol, especially when the discharge of flood-

waters, through tlie floating harbour, is impeded for a time by the rise of high

spring-tides. The mean average annual rainfall in Bristol is about 32^ inches.

This amount is increased on the slopes of the Cotswold and Mendip Hills, on

the latter of which it averages about 47 inches ; but the mean of the whole

district would perhaps not be greatly different from that at Bristol, when the

lessened quantity, faUing on the eastern part of the drainage-area, is taken

into calculation.

In considering the tides of the Avon, it may be desirable for a moment to

refer to the special tidal phenomena of the Bristol Channel and Severn estuary.
The crest of the free tidal wave of the ocean, which in the deep waters of the

Atlantic roUs forward the high-water line at a rate of probably not less than

about 500 miles an liour, enters the English and Irish t!hannels with a gra-

dually decreasing velocity, owing to the resistance from the seas becoming
more shoal ; and this retardation is further increased in the Bristol Channel

by the converging lines of its shores. The whole of the appreciable tide in

the estuary of tlie Severn is due to the momentum of the wave originated in

the deep waters of the open ocean. One important result of these conditions

is, that as increased resistance is met, so the wave is forced higher and the

tidal range magnified ; and while the rate of progress of the crest of the wave
is much diminished, the actual movement of the particles of water to and

fro, in flood and ebb, becomes more rapid owing to the greater rise and fall.

"We have thus a great range of tide in the Severn and the Avon with a con-

siderable velocity, especially in the narrow and deep parts of the former

river.

As evidence of the retarded advance of the crest of the tide-wave and the

increased range of tide spoken of in the Bristol Channel, we may take the

case of an ordinary spring-tide, which, advancing in fi'om the Atlantic, brings

higli water off the Scilly Islands at 4'' 30'» o'clock, with a rise of tide of

IG feet above mean low-water springs at that point. This crest of high water

will reach Lundy, a distance of 140 miles, at 5'' 15'", where the rise will be
27 feet ; Nash Point, 49 miles from Lundy, at 6" 25'", with a rise of 33 feet
Cardiff, 24 miles from jSTash Point, at 6'' 56", with a rise of 37| feet ; King-
road (mouth of the Avon), 16 miles from Cardiff, at 7'' 13'", with a rise of
40 feet ; and Sharpness, 18^ miles above Kingroad, at 7'' 58'", with a rise of
25 feet, this latter above Ordnance datum, or an absolute height of about 2 feet

4 inches above high water at Kingroad, the total range at Sharpness being less

than at Kingroad, on account of the great slope of the bed of the river. At

Eramilode, about 13 miles above Sharpness, the effect of the gorging up of the

tide has attained its maximum, and the tide flowing up the remaining distance

to Gloucester is due entirely to the acquired momentum. At Gloucester the

between neaps and springs, are sliown on a diagram plotted from observations
made continuously for a fortnight. In this diagram (Plate VII. fig. 1) the actual
heights of high and low water of each tide are plotted above or below Ordnance

datum, and then two equalizing lines, drawn as a mean of the observations,
serve to show what would be the higli or low water for any given range of
tide from 15 up to 46 feet.

   The same diagram shows also how far the mean half-tide level at the
mouth of the Avon agrees with the theoretical mean sea-level, as adopted for

the Ordnance datum. The half height of each range of tide, taken in the
above-mentioned observations, is plotted, and a mean equalizing line drawn
between them. The result shows that at lowest neaps the half-tide level is

  bout 3| inches below, and at highest springs rises to about 1 foot 8 inches
above Ordnance datum. Other observations made at the moiith of the Avon
tend to confii-m the conclusion that, so far as regards our local tides, the

mean half-tide is not a fixed level, and that it is above the Ordnance datum.
This may point to the probability that the mouth of the Avon is somewhat

within the influence of the surface fall of the lowest part of the Severn, and
above the true level of ocean low water.

   In connexion with the subject of meau sea-level, it may not be uninter-

esting to notice that, at the time of the last Meeting of the British Association

at Bristol, in 1836, the question was much under general disciTssion, and it
was resolved that a series of levels should be taken between the Severn at
Portishead and Axmouth on the English Channel. These were undertaken
and carried out by the late Mr. T. G. Bunt in 1837, and were conducted
with an amount of care and skiU to secure accuracy which has seldom been

exceeded. In connexion with the stations levelled to at either end of this
line, a series of simultaneous tidal observations were made, by which it was
found that the sea at Portishead rose at high water 13 feet 7 inches higher,
and fell at low water 12 feet 2 inches lower than at Axmouth, the total

difference in the ranges of the same tide at the two places being as much as
25 feet 9 inches. This is a very striking illustration of the effect of the
momentum of the incoming tide-wave heaping up the water in this funnel-

shaped estuary.

   On looking at the map it will be seen that the course of the Avon lies at
about right angles to that of the Severn ; and its tide may be considered to

be generated, as it were, by the passing tide of the Severn, rather than directly

due to the momentum of the original tide-wave. As the flood-tide rises in

Kingroad it pours into the Avon, and a current is established in the latter

river which soon obtains a momentum of its own. The effect of this is very

plainly seen, and serves to illustrate the same phenomena of engorgement
·which takes place on a larger scale in the Bristol Channel, for the tide rises

to a higher level in the Avon the further we go up the river. Taking the
flood of an equinoctial spring-tide, we find that at the mouth of the Avon

high water rises to 24 feet 10 inches, at Sea Mills to 25 feet 3 inches, at

Cumberland Basin to 25 feet 5 inches, at Netham Dam to 25 feet 9 inches,

and finds its summit at a point about six miles above Cumberland Basin,
where it rises to 26 feet 4 inches, all above Ordnance datum. Here the

momentum, as we have seen in the case of the Severn, becomes spent, and
the rest of the tide has a reversed slope up the freshwater river to Hanham,

where its level is only 26 feet above datum.

   On the longitudinal section of the Avon exhibited, the points above men-

tioned are shown, as also some cross sections of the river, the slope of the

bed, lines of the ordinary run of low water, and lines of spring and neap

tides. The crest of the dam at Netham is 19-78 feet above Ordnance datum,

and is the level at which the floating harbour of liristol is maintained. All

tides above this level flow over the dam up towards Hanham and Kej-nsham.

Another diagram of tidal observations, taken simultaneously for a fort-

night at the mouth of the Avon and at Cumberland Basin, shows the relative

heights and times of the tides at these stations through a complete range of

springs and neaps. It will be seen that the level of high water at Cumber-

land Basin is, on an average, about 7 inches higher than at the mouth of the

Weriver.  also find that, as regards time, high water at Cumberland Basin

is about the same as at Kingroad. High-water equinoctial springs is, how-

ever, at Netham about a quarter of an hour, and at Hanham half an hour

later than at Cumberland Basin.

Connected with this part of the subject is the duration of flood and ebb,

and the rate of rise and fall of tide at Kingroad. The general result of our

observations shows that, at extreme low neaps, the flood is longer than the

ebb by about one hour ; but that, as the tides increase in range, the duration

of ebb becomes progressively longer than flood, till at the highest equinoctial

springs the tide rises from low to high water in 4 hours 45 minutes, and takes

Aabout 7 hours 30 minutes to ebb.  reference to the diagram (Plate VII.

fig. 2) will show the rate, hour by hour, of rise and fall at the mouth of the
Avon for a low neap and a high equinoctial spring-tide. The rapid rate of

rise of the spring-tide is remarkable, being 11 feet 11 inches in the second

hour, and 12 feet 4 inches in the third hour of flood.

The velocity of run of tide is not great in the Avon, the highest rate, from

observations taken at spring-tides in the river 1| mile below Cumberland

Basin, hardly reaching 3 miles an hour. In the Severn at Kingroad the velo-

city on half-flood at high spring-tides comes up to about 6 miles, and at half-

ebb to about 4| miles an hour.

Amongst other diagrams connected with the tides will be found some which

show simultaneous observations of a low neap, and the highest spring this

year at Cardiff, Portishead, Avonmouth, Bristol, and Sharpness, kindly taken

by the engineers of the docks at these several places (fig. 3).

One important though unwelcome feature connected with the tides of the

Avon is the enormous quantity of mud held in suspension in the water.

With the exception of the Humber, there is probably no river in England

that in this respect will compare with it. This part of the subject is one not

merely of scientific interest, but of practical economical importance ; for it is

necessary that its efifect should be taken into consideration in all questions

of dock construction or maintenance in this district. From many obsei-va-

tions made to ascertain the average amount of mud held in suspension in the

water in the river, it is found that, from any given volume of the tide-water,

there will be a deposit of about g^th part of mud, which becomes, under super-

imposed layers, soon converted into stifii" silt. In the Severn the quantity,

though very considerable, is less than in the Avon.

The general character of this mud is somewhat different from that of the

alluvial deposit which forms the banks of the river Avon and the adjacent

flat lands bordering on the Severn. This alluvium is generally found to con-

sist of several feet of stift' brown clay, or brick-earth, underneath the top soil,

below which is a thick bed of bluish silt, containing much very fine quick-

sand and with but little clay. Below this again is almost invariably found a

bed of coarse gravel, with frequent fossil remains of red deer, horse, and

                                                                    n2

ox (Bos longifrons and Bos prhnigenivs). The level of the surface is very
uniform over the whole district, aud is below high water of equinoctial
spring-tides, the country, where exposed to the overflow of the tides, lacing
jirotected by an ordinary sea-bank of from 3 to 5 feet high. The flat margin of
grass land between the sea-bank and the edge of the water still continues to
be raised above the level of the enclosed land by the deposit from very high

tides.

   The mud spoken of is of an exceedingly light character, borne up and
down in suspension in the water as long as the mean velocity of ebb or
flow does not fall much below about 2^ feet per second. Whenever from
any cause the velocity is much reduced, the mud begins to form a deposit.
An analysis of this silt, and also of the upper and lower strata of the alluvial
bed through which the lower part of the Avon runs, has been kindly made
by Mr. \Y. W. Stoddart, P.G.S., and is as follows :--

  liblo conditions, deposit and form accretions, has been shown in the last few
  years at the mouth of the Avon. In the year 1852 the author assisted in
  making a very accurate survey of the depths of water at the junction of the

  Severn and Avon, and of the entrance-channels leading into the latter river.
 At that date, and indeed from time immemorial, the only available channel

 for shipping was tlie " North Channel," and there was then a depth of water
 of from 6 to 10 feet at low water spring-tides. The other channel, the
 " Swashway," was gradually becoming used by sraaU craft when the tide
 was in, but there was no low-water channel through it. The depth of the
 " North Channel " was good up to 1865, when the Irish and other steamers

 used to land their passengers there. Even in October 1867, Capt. Bedford,
 R.N., who was surveying the roadstead, says he " found 42 feet of water in

 this channel, but that in 1871 he only found 8 feet, showing an accumulation

 of 34 feet, or at the rate of 9| inches a month."
    On a plan accompanying this paper (Plate VII.) is shown a survey made

 of the entrances to the Avon in 1852, and another made in 1875, together

 Avith sections taken across the " North Channel " at these dates. In these

 sections the extent of silting up is shown; and calculations made there-

 from give a quantity of over a million cube yards of mud deposited here

 within the last ten years. The top of spring-tide still flows over the surface
 and adds to tlie deposit, but at neap-tides the new ground can be safely walked
 across. The greatest depth of the silting up is about 41 feet above the bed

 of the river in 1852.

    The foregoing remarks on the watershed and on the recorded observations
 of the tides of the Avon will, it is hoped, have served to give a general
knowledge of the natural conditions and capabilities of the river. It remains
only necessary to show briefly what has been, from time to time, done in the
way of providing for or improving the accommodation for vessels frequenting

the port.

   Up to about the middle of the last century tlie shipowners of Bristol seem

to have been content with the accommodation the tide (then flowing and
ebbing through the centre of the city) gave them. Vessels were then'^com-

paratively small, and of a build adapted to lay aground at low water. From

the year 1765 to 1800, however, various schemes, including amongst others
designs from Smeaton, Ralph Walker, Josias and William Jcssop, were brought
forward for providing floating dock accommodation, ending ultimately in the
carrying out of a plan by William Jessop. This design took possession of
those portions of the rivers Avon and Frome which ran through the city,

converting them into the present floating harbour, and substituting a new
channel for the tidal water of the Avon to the south of the city. This scheme
was projected, carried out, and the docks held by a private company.

    Looking at the character of the public works at that day, the construction
of Jessop's works was a very spirited undertaking, and they afforded for a
long time accommodation in advance of most other ports. But about the

year 1830, when steam -vessels were beginning to take an important place

and ships were growing in size, the inadequacy of the old lock entrances, and
the difRculties of the navigation of the river, "began to be seriously felt, and
various schemes were brought forward to provide accommodation at King-
road. Amongst other designs for this purpose was one for a stone pier by
Mr. Mylne in 1832, and another by Sir J. MacNeill in 1839, and also one
for a floating pier by the late Mr. I. K. Brunei in 1839. None of these,
however, were carried out ; and to the discontent felt at the want of adequate
182 REPORT-- 1875.

accommodation for the port soon began to be added the opinion that the high

charges of the Dock Company tended still further to restrict the trade. Much

local agitatiou ensued, ending in the transfer of the docks (in 1848) from the

Company to the Corporation of Eristol. They at once resolved to make an

alteration in one of their entrance-locks, so as to accommodate steamers of

Athe ' Great Western ' and ' Great Britain ' class, built in Bristol.  new lock

sufficiently wide to admit these was constructed, on the site of a smaller lock

at Cumberland Basin, by the late Mr. Brunei. In this lock may be seen the

earliest examples of lock-gates made in the form of caissons.

The first act of the Corporation, on taking over the docks, was to reduce

the dues ; and from this cause, as well as also partly from the port sharing

in the general increase of trade thi'oughout the country, the dock revenues

began to amend. Just about the same time the dimensions of steamers were

vastly increasing, and an increased desire was felt here that the port of Bristol

should have accommodation for them. It was not so much a want of dock-

space in the floating harbour that was felt, as the difficulties arising fi-om the

tortuous course of and want of depth in the river, and also the limits placed

on the breadth of vessels by the lock entering the harbour. Some improve-

ments were made in the river, and several schemes for more extensive

alterations considered. Various designs for independent docks at Portis-

head and on the Gloucestershii-e side of the Avon were also brought forth,

the one on the most extensive scale being by the late Mr. J. M. llendel in

1852.

Amongst other modes proposed for providing for the largest class of ocean-

going steamers was that of placing a dam, with suitable entrance-locks and

works, at the mouth of the Avon, so as to form the channel of the river into

an extension of the present floating harbour, entirely supplied with land-

water, and having facilities for admitting ordinary vessels at almost all states

of the tide. After long consideration of the subject, and maldng tidal and

other observations bearing upon the question of its feasibility, the author

laid before the Corporation, in 1859, the particulars of a design which he con-

sidered could be practically and safelj' carried out, and which, while it would

have given to Bristol all she could need for any extension of trade, would

not, in his opinion, have been detrimental to the navigation of the Severn

estuaiy or to any national interest. Further, it was obvious that by keeping

tlie whole of the trade of the port under one jurisdiction, with due responsi-

bilities, means would have been available for affording that artificial aid to

the maintenance of the roadstead, and for the regulation of a good channel

through it, which successive surveys show to be increasingly desirable. These

opinions have not been altered by more recent observations of the local con-

ditions of the case, nor by an unprejudiced consideration of the various argu-

ments which have been advanced against the idea.

In venturing to propose such a plan, full recognition was given to the

general axiom, that the abstraction or suppression of the tidal water of an

estuary or harbour is undesirable. But every case must be judged on its

own merits ; and investigation of this led to the conviction that it would
not, as regards the Severn, bo so much a case of abstraction as of partial

restoration. It is probable that the momentum of the tidal wave, which we

have in a former part of this paper seen coming up to Kingroad, would not

be reduced nor the rise of tide there lessened, whether the consequent flow

of the water were drawn off up the Avon, or left to flow on chi'cctly up the

Severn. Moreover, it was held likely that this diversion, ijistead of bene-

 fiting the anchorage, tends to lesson the power of the tide to keep open a
 good deep channel in the Severn. Examination of the soundings tends to
 conhrm this opinion ; there is an evident shoaUug of the water in the Severn
 immediatelj- above the mouth of the Avon.

     The limits of this paper will not, however, permit the bringing forward all
 that might be said on this subject, or the opportunity of showing the natural
 as well as commercial requirements and facilities which the district afforded
 for carrying out such a work. The scheme received, for various reasons,
 considerable local opposition, and was ultimately left in abeyance. The
 great outlay (about £1,000,000) which has been recently, or will very shortly
 have been, made on dock-works connected with the Avon, and the separate
 vested interests which have consequently arisen, have placed serious financial
 difficulties in the way of its speedy revival.

     Within the last few years the Corporation have, through the author, as

 their engineer, made many improvements in their existing dock-works. The

 old lock entrances, which were not adapted to the trade of the present day,

 have been supplemented by two new locks, of larger dimensions, laid at a
 deeper level than the old ones, and provided with all modern appliances of

'hydraulic and other machinery for quick work. It would be out of place to
 attempt to give here all the details of construction of these works. The
 ordinary and some special diificulties were met with and overcome. These
 chiefly arose from unsatisfactory foundations, and from having to work in
 confined spaces surrounded by water, portions of the wall of the approach to
 the outer entrance-lock requiring to be built in trenches on the river-bank,
 within the line of high water, at a depth of 53 feet. In the bottom of the
 lock excavations much trouble was experienced from springs of water from
 the gravel bursting up through the foundation level of the lock. These were
 overcome by building in at intervals along the lock inverts pipes reaching
 down into the gravel, each fitted at the top with a very light gun-metal
valve, which, lifting easily with pressure from beneath when the tide is low,
permits the water to escape, and closes again when the pressure becomes
greater from above. These relief-valves have acted very satisfactorily. The
lock-gates are mostly of wrought iron, made on the arch principle, and partly
buoyant. In their design some special features have been adopted, which

may be seen in the working drawings laid before the Section for inspection
by any Members feeling interest in the subject. The gates work remarkably

well and keep practically water-tight, a somewhat unusual success in double
skin lock-gates. Other drawings and details of the dock-works are also open

for inspection.

    Improvements are also being carried on by the Corporation in the removal
of some of the projecting points of rock, and the deepening of the bed of the
river. The general line of slope to which it is proposed ultimately to re-
duce the bed is shown on the longitudinal section of the river (Plate YII.).

    Another important work being carried out inside of the harbour is the
formation of a new quay, about half a milo long, the construction of the

retaining- wall of which may be a matter of some interest. It is being built

in a trench, without a coff'er-dam, partly within and partly along the edge
of the water of the harbour. "With the exception of the face, which is of
dressed stone, and the coping, which is of granite, the whole of the wall is
of concrete, laid in steps and beds alternately of blue lias lime and of Portland
cement concrete, the object being to gain the advantage of the comparative
cheapness of the lime, and the more quick and certain setting of the cement.

A drawing of this work is shown with the others. The two separate portions

of the work are found to bond well together, and the system is one which
admits of rapiditj' of construction, and without much skilled laboiir.

    In addition to the dock whicli has hccn alluded to as under construction
on the Gloucestershire side of the Avon, there is also another dock on the
Homcrsetshirc side at Portishead. As details of each of these docks have
already been laid before the Section, it is not necessary again to give the
particulars which the author had pre])ared respecting them.

Aassiduous labours much of the success of the reports must be attributed.

considerable number of chemists divide among themselves the labour of
preparing abstracts of the chemical papers which have been published in the

course of each month.
   In spite of the smallness of the remuneration offered to these gentlemen,

the expense of publishing the abstracts is verj- considerable, and has

become a serious strain upon the resources of the Society, more especially

now that the aids from the Association and from private sources have already
been continued for the period which had been assigned to them.

    The Committee have reason to believe that these abstracts supply an
important need for the advancement of our science, and that they are highly
valued by the members of the Society and other chemists.

    They confidently trust that the Society may be able to carry on the im-
portant work which has been thus auspiciously commenced ; and they con-

gratulate the Association on the service which it has rendered to science
by supplj'ing to that enterprise the aid which was absolutely needed in its

infancy.

Report on Dredging off the Coast of Durham and North Yorkshire in
   1874. By George Stewardson Brady^ C.M.Z.S., and David

    Robertson, F.G.S.

A BELEP account of the dredging undertaken by us on the coast was presented

to the British Association last year, but no attempt was then made to give
lists or detailed observations. The following Report embraces lists of all
that came under our notice in the groups of MoUusca, Entomostraca (Ostra-
coda and Copepoda), Polyzoa, Hydrozoa, Spongozoa, and Foraminifera.
Amongst Echinodermata our captures did not include any species reqiriring
special notice, whilst among the larger Crustacea (Decapoda) the only species
of unusual occurrence in the district were /StenorJu/ncJius Jonc/irostris, Fabr.,
Portunits dej]uratof, Linn., and Ebcdia twnefacta, Mont. Several species
belonging to an interesting group of minute Crustaceans not hitherto noticed
in the British seas (Isopoda llemigantia of G. 0. Sars) were taken, but we
arc not yet able to name more than one or two of them with certainty.
Special attention was given to the Acarides, a large number of which were
obtained, and amongst them some previously nndescribed species which have
been figured and described by one of us in the ' Proceedings of the Zoological
Society' for the present year. But the greatest number of novelties occurred
amongst the Copepoda, 28 species of this group being new to science, and 11
new to British records.

   The MoUusca, Ostracoda, and Foraminifera of the N'orthumberland and
Durham coasts had been so fully investigated by the Dredging-Expeditions
of the Tyneside Naturalists' Field-Club, undertaken with the help of the
British Association in the years 1862, 1863, 1864, that little was left to be
done in those branches. But, as might be expected, notwithstanding that
much of the ground had already beeu well searched, we are now able to add

to the niunber of species noted in the previous Ecports, while, on the other
hand, some species contained in the earlier lists arc absent from ours *.

   To the list of Testaceous Mollusca prepared by the late Mr. Alder from the

   * It must be noticed, however, that tlie area embraced in our dredgings of last year
(1874), though of nearly similar extent, is not quite identical with that investigated by the
Tyneside Field-Club in the years 18(i2-6Jr. The present Report refers to the coast of

Durham and the northern part of Yorkshire as far as Scarborough, while those of the earlier
expeditious embraced the seaboard of tlie two comities of Durham and Northumberland,

thus reaching nearly sixty miles fm-tber north, while, on the other hand, our last year's
csplorationa went about thirty-five miles further south than those of ten years ago.

--193 REPORT 1875.

throe years' dredgiugs of the Tyueside Naturalists' Pield-CIub, we are how

able to add 21 species.

   From the same dredgiugs 19 species of Ostracoda were catalogued by
Mr. Norman, but five years later the number was increased to 47 by
Mr. G. S. 13rady. Our present list includes 71 species, oue of which,
Ct/therideis Hilda, is new to science.

The Eev. A. M. Norman, who accompanied us during part of the dredging-

oxpedition, has kindly examined and reported on the Polyzoa, Hydrozoa, and

iSpongozoa. Among the Polyzoa is one interesting form new to the British

seas, Bugida fruticosa, Packard ; one Hydrozoon new to the east coast, Lafoea

jiocillum, Hincks                                                        and two undescribed sponges, Uipneniaddon virgulatvs
                                                                      ;

and Hcdiclwndria virgea, both of which arc here described by Dr. Bowerbank.

The Foraminifera from the earlier dredgings were ably worked out by

Mr. H. B. Brady, and numbered 70 species, a total subsequently increased to

74, or perhaps rather more. The list will now, with the additions wc have

made, comprise 94 species, or rather more than 60 per cent, of the recorded

British Poraminifera.

   But apart from the number of species obtained there is much of interest in
their distribution, as may conveniently bo seen in tlie annexed Tables. It
was shown by Mr. Alder* that the Testaceous Mollusca of tlie Northumber-

land coast present a distinctly boreal character, which is shared more or less

by the whole invertebrate fauna                                                                                                                                                                 but it may be rcmariced with regard to the
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

Ostracoda that this character is by no means so apparent. It will be seen
from the Table that Cythere httea, C. viridis, C. aiujiduia, Cyfheridea pnnc-

tlUata, and Ci/theru7-a nigrescens are absent or rare. All these species arc

characteristically boreal, and strongly represented in the Posttertiary (" Gla-

cial") clays of Scotland. At the same time it is interesting to note that

although CgtJiere latca and Cgtherura nigrescens are absent or rare in the

dredgings from this coast, they are extremely common between tide-marks,

where they must be subject to- much greater variation of temperature. But

if a low temperature were specially congenial to these species, we should

expect to find them further out at sea, where they certainly lived in great

abundance during the deposition of our Posttertiary clays. It is a curious

fact that these two species are confined almost entirely to the littoral and

Laminarian zones of the east coast, but are abundant in deep Avater on the

west, as, for instance, in the Frith of Clyde. On the whole, then, we must

conclude that the Ostracoda and Forarainifera of the north-east coast of

England do not present that marked arctic character which has been noticed

in a considerable group of the Northumbrian Mollusca ; but that there is, on

the contrary, a marked absence of some typically northern forms which are

abundant in the M'armer seas of the western coast. Nor can we suppose that

a cold arctic current is the only or even perhaps the chief agent in the con-

tinued existence of this peculiar Northumbrian moUuscan fauna, else we

could scarcely fail to have had an equally well-marked development of arctic

types amongst other groups of invertebrata whoso organization renders them

Weeven more easy of distribution.                                                                                                                                                               must therefore, in the absence of more

accurate information, look to some strictly local circumstances as having been

the chief causes of the retention of the species in question over particular

circumscribed areas.

/ The number of Copepoda noted in this list is 63, of -which 28 are new to

science, and 11 (marked here with an asterisk) are hitherto unrecorded as

British species. It is but right, however, to add that several of these, though

undescribed, were previously known to us. Still the result of the dredging in

this department is extremely interesting, more especially in the considerable
number of new species which it has brought to light belonging to the curious

groups called by Thorell Poecilostoma and Siphonostoma. The list of marine

Copepoda published by Mr. Brady in 1872, in the ' JS'atural-History Trans-

actions of JSTorthumberland and Durham,' and including all then known as

inhabiting the shores of those two counties, both littoral and pelagic, comprised

only  49 species                                             so  that  our present Hst of  63 species taken over an  area of

similar extent, and from dredged material only, must, we think, be looked

upon as highly satisfactory.

   The dissection and delineation of these minute' creatures is extremely
tedious, and we have not as yet been able to complete the work so far as to
warrant us in giving descriptions of the various new species.

   Among the Polyzoa is Bitgula fnitieosa of Packard*, first described by

Packard from Labrador, and subsequently by Smitt from Spitsbergen and
Finmark, but not previously found in our seas. I entirely agree with Smitt
in considering it to be a form, though a very interesting one, of Bugula
Murrayana, It differs from the ordinary state of that species in being more

delicate in structure, the branches and branchlets much narrower, commonly

with only one or two rows of cells, and the cells armed with only few spines,
typically one only at the superior and outer angle.

   The Hydrozoon Lafoea jjociUum, Hincks (Hist. Brit. Hydr. Zooph. p. 204,
pi. xi. fig. 2), is a recently described species, which has not previously been
found on the cast coast. Its known habitats were Labrador and Oban.

   Two Sponges are pronounced by Dr. Bowerbank to be undescribed, and

subjoined will be found descriptions which have been drawn up by that

gentleman. He has named the species Hymeniacidon virguJatus and HaU-

Report on Obsewations of Luminous Meteors during the year 1874-75,
   bi/ a Committee, consisting of Jahes Glmshek, F.R.S., of the Royal
    Observatory, Greemo'ich, R. P. Gkeg, F.G.S., F.JR.A.S., C. Brooke,

   F.R.S., Prof. G. Forbes, F.R.S.E., Walter Flight, D.Sc, F.G.S.,

   and Prof. A. S. Herschel, F.R.A.S.

The operations of the Committee during the past year were restricted to col-

lecting and recording occasional observations of meteors, without renewing

periodical requests to observers to watch for the meteor- showers of best

knowia dates and characters of annual recurrence. The list of collected

accounts of luminous meteors is therefore less ample, but not less remarkable

and important, than in former years. The falls of aerolites (as will be seen

in the concluding Appendix) which have been placed on record since the last
AEeport are more than ordinarily numerous and interesting.
                                                                                                   mass of

meteoric iron fell on the 24th of August, 1873, at Marysville, California, and

is one of the very few metallic irons the actual descent of which has been

witnessed. In the following montJi, on the 23rd of September, 1873, -a

number  of meteorites  fell near  Khairpur,  in  the  Punjab                              and  it  is  also
                                                                                       ;

related that in the month of December in the .same year, while the British

army halted on the banks of the Prah, an aerolite fell in the market-place o(

Coomassie, and was regarded by the native population as a portent of evil.

On the 14th and 20th of May, 1874, aerolites fell at Castalia, in North

Carolina (U.S.A.), and at Virba, in Turkey, the last of which was noted in

the last Report ; and examinations of both of these meteorites have now been

made. The last stone-fall of the past year took place near Iowa (U.S.A.) on

the 12th of February, 1875 ; and of this meteorite also special analyses were
made in the United States, of which some unforeseen results were lately

announced by their author, Mr. A. W. Wright, as will be described in the last

part of this Ileport. In comparison with meteoric irons, it was found that this

meteorite gave off, by gentle heating in a vacuum, carbon oxides as occluded

gases in greater abundance than hydrogen, which is the principal gaseous

constituent of meteoric irons ; and it was observed that the electric spectrum pf

the gaseous products resembled very closely that found most frequently in

comets, and even in one condition to exhibit most distinctly the green

Anitrogen line coinciding with a conspicuous line in the sun's coron?..

meteor of unusual size appeared over Victoria, in Australia, on the 14th of
                                                                           ;;

April last, which if not aerolitic'was yet of the largest class, and detonated

with a violent explosion. Further remarks in the same Appendix describe

recent researches on meteorites, and some new links which they establish

between aerolites and terrestrial rocks.

In England no detonating meteor has been recorded since the last Report

and the brightest meteor that was observed occurred on the 1st of Sep-

tember last, taking its course over the north of England or Scotland, where

clouded skies must have prevailed, as its flash was like that of lightning even

in Cornwall, where, as in Lancashire, its bright luminous streak remained

visible, at no great apparent altitude, among the northern stars of the Great

Bear. Other bright meteors occurred also on the 2nd and 16th of September,

on the 11th of October, on the 17th of December, and subsequently on the

9th of March, 12th of April, and 2nd and 4th of May in this year, of several

of which duplicate observations are recorded in the lists of the first two

AAppendices of this Rejiort.  meteor burst with a loud detonation over Paris

and its neighbourhood on the 10th of February last, which was of great size

and brilliancy, and left a cloud-like streak of light on its track for more than

half an hour. No duplicate observation of it was obtained in England ; but

from the numerous French descriptions of its appearance, its real path and

height may be expected to have formed at the present meeting in Nantes of

the French Scientific Association a subject of examination and discussion.

Another fireball, according to French scientific journals, fell at Orleans on

the 9th of March, and of this two good observations appear to have been

obtained in England (in London and in Essex), which may assist to determine

its real height.

    During the annual meteor-showers of the past year very unfavourable
weather generally prevailed for recording meteor-tracks, and few meteors

were seen on those nights when the usual expectations of their appearance
were entertained. On the 19th of October and 12th of December, 1874, and

on the 19th-21st of April, 1875, the annual star-showers of those dates
were scarcely perceptible, or were represented by so few conformable meteors

as to make the scarcity of the October, December, and April star-showers
during the past year a marked feature of their periodical disjilay, and no

appearance of the January meteors could be observed on account of obstinately
cloudy skies. The August star-showers of 1874 and 1875 were, however, of
great brilliancy, and afi'orded a great number of excellent observations.
Duplicate descriptions of some of the meteors were obtained, and the radiant-
point was noted, its position appearing to have been this year more con-
fined to the normal place near r/ Persei than it had been recently observed.
Descriptions of these meteor-showers are added in the third Appendix of

this Keport.

  A thorough examination of all the observations collected by the Committee

since the publication of the Meteor Atlas in 1867, with the \'iew of extending

and correcting the list of general and occasional meteor-showers which it

embraced, from the best data furnished by recent observations, has been con-

tinued with satisfactory results under the care and direction of Mr. Greg

and the projection of all these useful materials is now nearly completed and

Aexhibited on maps.  supplementary Table of radiant-points contained in the

pages of this Report represents the results of his examination ; and a number

of interesting consequences are drawn from them of the position and identity

of some star-showers, which had been a subject hitherto of questions and

discussions.

siopeia and Perseus appears to be accounted for by a distinct radiant-point
in Cassiopeia, of which the principal date coincides only partially with the
10th of August, and whose shower again presents a prominent and distinct
appearance on the 23rd of that month. Most of the general meteor systems
described in the former Atlas are found to be confirmed, and some very
distinct radiant-points not previously recorded have at the same time been

added to its list.

                                      APPENDIX.

                                   I. Meteobs doubly Observed.

   On September 1st, October 11th, and December 17th, 1874, and on
April 12th and May 2nd, 1875, accounts of the appearance of large meteors

were received, which had been pretty generally observed, and of which from

their magnitude it may be hoped that more abundant particulars will be
obtained. The following descriptions of the first two of these large meteors
were collected from published sources by Mr. Wood, together with some other

ajjpearances of large meteors and meteor-showers of interest during the past
year. Mr. Wood's observation of the fireball of April 12th, 1875, and those
relating to the other doubly observed meteors above mentioned, wiU be found
in the firebaU list of the next Appendix, together with some examples of
doubly observed shooting-stars during the bright shower of the August
meteors in 1874. It has not been attempted to submit these comparative
observations to regular reduction and calculation, partly as those of the
large meteors are too uncertain to afi'ord useful determinations of their real
heights, and (in the case of the shooting-stars) in the expectation that a
closer examination of the descriptions received of the August meteor-shower
in 1874 will continue to furnish further examples of them of which the present

may be regarded as instances of only the most conspicuous occurrence.
Among the few records of the periodical meteor-showers that have been

received (without solicitations from the Committee), during the past year,
no other cases have presented themselves in which determinations of a
meteor's real height might be obtained by the combination of distant ob-

servations.

course, visible 6 minutes." Daily Post.

  A meteor similar to the one described above was observed at almost the

same time at Leeds, near Maidstone, Kent. " At the end of its flight it ex-

ploded with a loud noise, so loud that the informant described it as louder

than the loudest thunder he ever heard."- Birmingham Daily Post.

    " The inhabitants of Valparaiso were in a terrible state of alarm on the

14th ultimo [November 1874]. A bright star and full moon appeared at

middle day, notwithstanding the fact that the sun was shining brightly at
the time. The ignorant amongst the populace thought that an earthquake
was about to take place. Nothing of the sort, however, occurred." Bir-
mingham Local Newspaper, Dec. 1874.

  --" Large meteors were seen during the recent clear nights in diflPerent

    To the above list of newspaper accounts of large meteors collected by Mr.

 Wood may be added the following two accounts in ' Nature ' of Oct. 15th,

 1874 (vol. X. p. 482), of the remarkable fireball of October 11th, last year.

A singularity in the meteor's motion, with slow speed on a deflected course

 at last, appears to have been observed both at Tipton (as above) and at
 Eainhill ; but it is doubtful if motions of the persistent streak, left for some

minutes in a bright patch at the point where the meteor disappeared, may not

account for the very singular change of motion there, which the nucleus
itself, in two of these observations, is described to have presented.

    " At 8.55 this evening a party of six observed a meteor in the constella-

.course extending about 20°. It then seemed to explode suddenly, and its
track was luminous for a short time. The granular debris of the meteor con-

tinued to pursue, with very much retarded velocity, a path slightly deflected

from its former course : it continued to do so for several degrees ; and it was,
I think, fully a minute after the explosion that several of us almost simul-
taneouslj' exclaimed ' It is falling.' It resembled the expiring light of one
globe of a rocket charged with golden rain. The falling motion was very
elow. I think it was visible for two minutes after the explosion ; but though

we tried more than once to consult our watches, the light was insufiicient."

" An exceedingly brilliant meteor was seen here about 8.50 on Sunday

evening, which was so bright that it attracted general attention, the light

from it being as strong as an iinusually bright flash of lightning, but more

white. On looking up I saw, near the zenith, a long, almost straight and

uninterrupted ribbon of light, somewhat pointed at the end towards the

north-east. After watching it for some time, and uoticing that it retained its

brilliancy, I began slowly counting, and counted up to twenty befoi-e there

was any noticeable diminution of luminosity. The last portion visible was

the end opposite the pointed end, which appeared as a faintly luminous patch

as large as the apparent disk of the moon. I consider that, from its first ap-

pearance, it was visible from 80 to 100 seconds.    " A. Balding."

  A bright fireball was also seen in Hampshire on the 16th of September,

1874, of which the journal ' Nature' contained the following descriptiou ;

   " The following is an account of a brilliant meteor which appeared at

8.53 r.M. on Wednesday, Sept. 16 :--

" Size : about four times that of Jupiter.

" Colour : blue, with a red tail.

" Brightness : throwing a shadow deeper than that of a full moon.

" Angular measurement of tail : from 12° to 15°.

" Duration : about 15".

" Direction of course : N.W.

" Zenith distance of point of disappearance : 75°.

" The brilliancy of the tail threw a red light on the surrounding land-

   The largest fireball seen in England during the past year appears to have
been that of September 1st, 1874. Some descriptions of this fireball are
given in the last, and in the list at the end of this Appendix. Of the remain-
ing fireballs in the list but little general notice appears to have been taken
but it is assumed, with considerable probability, that the two seen in England
on the 9th of March and 12th of April, 1875, coincide with large fireballs
seen in Erance on those dates, of which sufficient particulars for comparison
with these accounts have not yet been received. Of the unusually large
meteor of February 10th, 1875, generally observed in Erance, numberless
accounts, it is reported ('Nature,' vol. xi. p. 413), were received at the Ob-
204 REPORT 1875.

servatory in Paris ; and although it is not described as detonating, and no
aerolitic fall is ascribed to it in any of the published narratives of its appear-
ance, some determination of its real course, which appears to have been over

the western departments of France, must, it may he expected, be derivable

from the abundant materials which have thus been collected. In the follow-

ing communication on a large fireball of the 2nd of May last supplied to the

Committee by Mr. Symons, attention is directed to other accounts of the same
meteor as seen in Kent and elsewhere ; but of these contemporary descrip-
tions of its appearance the Committee has not received any additional par-

ticulars.

   " The meteor noticed in Kent and elsewhere at 8'' 45TM p.m. on the evening
of the 2nd inst. was seen to advantage by myself and two friends. It passed
from S. by E. to E.S.E., from an altitude of about 35° to about 22°. It
appeared brighter and larger than Yenus, was of a very red tint, broke into
fragments just before disappearing, and occupied, as seen here, not seven
seconds, as mentioned in the papers, but between three and four,"

" To G. J. Symons, Esq."

    Some meteors of unusual brightness observed in Essex duriDg the early

part of this year are thus described by Mr. H, Corder in the ' Astronomical
Eegister' of June 1875 (vol. xiii. p. 145):--" On March 16, at &" 23"", I
was startled by a bright light from behind me, and on turning round was
just in time to see the disappearance of what must have been a fine meteor.

When I saw it it was about the size of Sirius, but had been far brighter. It

rose perpendicularly over either /3 or o Leonis. I think the former.

   " On the 17th, about Q*" p.m., another bright meteor was seen here, but I

have received no details of it.

   " On April 22nd, at 11*" 19TM, I saw a very beautiful one in the extreme east

of Virgo, faUing about 4° on each side of the equator from Corona ; and

though the new moon was shining a few degrees from it, the meteor formed

a distinct orange ring or co'rona in the highest cloud in front of it. It was

of a lovely pale-green hue, with a train of sparks ; and though of no appa-
rent size, was considerably more brilliant than Venus.

   " Another meteor, of a red colour and of short duration, brighter than

Jupiter, was seen in the south-west about 25° from the horizon on May 6th
at 7" 55TM."--IT. Corder, Writtle, near Chelmsford, May 8t7i, 1875,

The following is the note in ' Nature ' (vol. xi. p, 153) on the meteor of

--the 17th of December last year, referred to in the present list under the

observation of the corresponding date : " On Thursday, December 17th, at

10 p,M,, a magnificent faUing star was observed in Paris, Its track was to

Abe seen for more than a minute,  correspondent, Mr. J. H. A. Jenner,

writing from Lewes [Sussex], states that ' on Thursday eveniog, the 17th

inst., at 10,30, a very fine meteor was seen here. It travelled from north

to south at a seemingly very low elevation ; and though the moon was

shining brightly it was a very brilliant object, being several times the bright-

ness of Sirius, Its colour was yellowish, and it left a long, but not very

persistent, bluish- white train. Had the night been dark, it must have been

a very splendid object. The point of disappearance was hidden from my

sight by houses, but there was no noise attending it.' "

   Iowa, United States, America, 1875, Feb. 12th, 10" 30TM p.m. (Chicago

many contemporary descriptions of this meteor and of the stonefall that

accompanied it, from American local journa,ls, of which the accompanying

outline map roughly represents the geographical positions, together with the
probable line over which the meteor was vertical in its course. The accounts
contain descriptions of its appearance at Iowa city, where it was observed
by Prof. N. R. Leonard (Iowa St. Univ.), who afterwards examined and

described the sites of the meteor's faU at GrineU, Oskaloosa, Vinton, Des
Moines, &c., and additional observations of it at Brooklyn and "West Liberty

are supplied by Mr. Marsh. The apparent size of the meteor as seen at
Iowa city was half that of the full moon, and its light appeared at West
Liberty as strong as that of fuU daylight. It presented three separate
explosions (attended apparently by as many distinct reports), and a streak
of bright light marked its course, described at GrineU as intensely bluish
white and at Iowa city as slightly tinged with green ; the apparent colour
of the nucleus itself at the latter place was that of molten iron, and the
whole duration of its visible flight was estimated at about one second. The
sound of the report followed the appearance there in two or three minutes,
like three blasts of a quarry, accompanied by a rolling or rumbling noise.
The explosion at Brooklyn and westward from Iowa city was stiU more
violent. It followed 3TM after the appearance of the meteor (by watch) at
GrineU, and at an interval of about 5° at Searsborough (10 miles south of
GrineU). Its description at Washington is as of a rumbling earthquake
sound lasting a minute, and shaking houses plainly. At Vinton it consisted
of three or four cannon-Uke reports, foUowed by a sound resembUng that of
a raUway-train crossing a bridge. The meteor and its report were seen and
heard over a space 125 mUes in extent from E. to W., and over half as
wide a space from N. to S. Fragments, varying in size from a few lbs. to
150 lbs., were found at Homestead and other places in the neighbourhood
of Brooklyn and Iowa city, having excavated to a great depth both earth
and snow upon which they fell. The point marked x in the map is the

Three of these meteors were as bright as Jupiter, the brightest appearing

at 10'' 3.5" P.M. in Cassiopeia ; 82 left streaks, including aU of the 1st,

nearly all of the 2nd, and a great proportion of the 3rd mag. shooting-stars.

Twelve meteors were unconformable, or obviously not directed from the
radiant-point in Perseus, and the length of path varied from g° to 30° (in
the case of a large one overhead at ll'' 5" p.m.). The prevailing colour of

the meteors from Perseus was orange. Their general centre of divergence

was near the cluster ^ in Perseus, extending also to Cassiopeia. On

August 2nd most of the meteors diverged from e Pegasi ; and on the 6th the

points of radiation were very various, belonging chiefly, however, to the

shower from Perseus.

   Mr. J. E. Clark obtained a view of the shower at York on the night of
the 10th, mapping 40 meteor-tracks between lO** 7TM and ll'' 55TM p.m., and

together with Mr. E. Grubb counting the following numbers in the successive

haK-hours of the watch ending at

stations where the annual showers of October, November, and December, and

of January, April, and August, hare hitherto been observed.

 --November, December, and Jamtar)/ Meteor-showers, 1874--75. In con-

sequence of the accumulating number of meteor observations on the annual

dates of the periodic shower, observations of the November, December, and

other annual meteor-showers of the past year have not been especially

solicited ; and the condition of the sky on the returning dates of the above

three showers was such that only a widely organized watch could have ob-

tained useful particulars of their appearance. The November and January

showers were looked for without success from the prevalence of clouds ; and

that of the 12th of December, when the circumstances were favourable for

its observation, disappointed expectation by an unusual scarcity of the Ge-

minids on the periodic night. With a perfectly clear sky, in the absence of

moonlight, one meteor only was visible at Newcastle-on-Tj-ne in an interval

of 45"" from 11" 30"" to 12" lo"" on the night of the 12th ; and although this

small shooting-star was a Geminid, the loss of intensity of the shower since its

last periodic return on the 12th of December, 1 873, is very conspicuous and

Astriking.                                          careful record of the meteors of November and December last

was kept, however, by the astronomers of the Toulouse observatory in France,

where M. Gruey (' Comptes Eendus,' vol. Ixxs. p. 56) mapped the tracks of a
considerable number of meteors in both months. But few meteors, and those

generally unconformable to Leo, were seen on the partially cloudy nights of

November 12, 13, and during a fine interval of the following night, from 3"

to 4" 30"°                                          and on the morning of the 15th a greater scarcity even of sporadic
                                                 ;

meteors prevailed, and not a single shooting-star was visible during a very
attentive watch. On the nights of the 10th, 11th, and 12th of December,

1874, watch was again kept, and on the first two nights a somewhat plentiful

display of meteors was observed. Three observers, watching a quarter of the
sky, saw on the night of the 10th 34 meteors in 1" 20"" (average rate of

frequency 25 per hour) ; on the night of the 11th, 17 meteors in 35 minutes

(or at the rate of 30 per hour) ; while on the night of the 12th 4 meteors

only were seen in the first and none in two subsequent watches of 10" each,

in which the clouds cleared away sufficiently to leave the sky unobscured.
The majority of these meteors were conformable to a radiant-point near

which (at K. A. 130°, Decl. -f- 4G=) one of great brightness on the 10th
appeared stationary ; and although this place differs considerably from the

usual direction of divergence of the Geminids of this shower, and from the

place of its centre observed by M. Tisserand in December 1873 (' Comptes

Eendus,' 1873, December 15), yet the general emanation of the meteor-tracks

recorded from about this point was very apparent ; and as an average

radiant-centre of the 11 meteors mapped on the 10th, 7 on the 11th, and

2 on the night of the 12th (or 20 shooting-stars in all), it was very di-

stinctly marked. Several radiant-positions by other observers, closely adjacent
to it, wiU be found in Greg's general list (1874), No. 175. As regards their

brightness, the following numbers represent the total of each description
which were visible throughout the watch :

   M. Gruey suggests (and the conjecture weU deserves further trial and

corroboration) that the radiant-point of the December shower is multiple, and
that his new position of it is a special one, which was very perceptible on

this occasion.

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  215

    Mr. Clark watched at Heidelberg for the return of the November meteor-

shower, during a partially overcast state (clouds concealing about one half

or two thirds) of the sky, on the mornings of the 14th and loth of November
last (1S74), for about 25 minutes on each date, and observed a small Leonid
and two Taurids on the former, and three brighter Leonids (two of which
left enduring streaks) and one unconformable meteor on the latter date.
The shower does not appear to have entirely disappeared, and its tendency

to reach a maximum on the morning of the 15th rather than on that of the
14th appears still to be sensible in its decreasing phase. At Heidelberg and

at Sunderland in England, Mr. Clark and Mr. Backhouse reported the state
of the weather at the principal periods of the December and January showers

as unfavourable for observations. No observations of the January star-

shower in ] 875 could, from the general prevalence elsewhere of similarly

--unfavourable conditions, be obtained.
    The April Jleteor-sJiower in 1875. All the accounts which the Committee
has received of observations on this star-shower during the bright moon-

light and hazy state of the sky on the nights of the 19th-21st of April last
are corroborative of the almost total cessation or disappearance of the shower
at the usual time of its annual retui-n. During a watch of l*" 30" on the
19th, and of 1" on the 20th, Mr. M'Clure, with one assistant at Glasgow,
observed only a single meteor (apparently not a Lyraid) on the former
night. At Newcastle-on-Tyne the sky was very clear from lO*" 50" p.ir.
until midnight on the night of April 20th, and five meteors, one of which

was a small Lyraid, were observed. Two of these were of remarkable

length of course and brightness, directed apparently from radiant-points

near Aquila, Arcturus, or in the southern hemisphere : but from the bright-

ness of the full moon meteors of smaller brightness than 3rd- or 4th-magnitude
stars would not have been visible on the occasion of this periodic watch
and with regard to the disappearance of the shower on the night of April
20th, some evidence of its occurrence may have been visible in foreign
countries, of which, on account of the maximum being reached during day-

time in England, the observation at English stations could only be very

partial, and may in this manner have been quite prevented.
   At Birmingham the sky was clear on the 21st, and in the fuU moonlight,

which stiU prevailed, Mr. Wood observed at Birmingham, at 10** 52", one

meteor only (a bright Lyraid) as the result of an attentive watch of 1" 5"

--for the expected April shower.
   Meteor-showers of August 1875. The stormy and unsettled weather of
the early days of this month interfered at almost every station with regular
observations^ the day and evening of the 10th of August itself being one of

most violent thunderstorms throughout the country, and but scattered
records of the Perseus shooting-stars were in consequence I'eceived. Noticing
meteors to be frequent on the night of July 28th, Mr. Crumplen mapped
some of their apparent courses in London between lO*" and 10'' 30" p.m. ; and

those of seven proved to be Perseids, with a radiant-point between ^ Persei

Aand Cassiopeia. communication concerning observations of meteors on the

2nd of August was also received by the Committee from Mr. Hind, who
relates that between 9'' 30" and ll"" p.m. on that evening a number of

meteors were remarked, one of thom of a Lyroe brightness, the radiant-
point of which was " most decided," and its position was found to be at
omicron AndromedjB (R.A. 344°, Decl.-f-41°). The existence of this radiant-

point in August was pointed out in the first of Mr. Greg's general lists of

EGradiant-points (Report, 1864, p. 100, No. xxx.), attaching to it the sign
                                                                           1

Eafter its neighbourhood to Heis's radiaut-point in October in the constel-

lation Lacerta (German Eidechse), which was found by Mr. Greg to be a very-
persistent and much earlier occurring shower. Although its position was
afterwards confirmed (as will be seen in the subjoined Table) and extended
to include radiants with more northern declinations in Schiaparelli's and
Tupman's lists, yet it appears that the new radiant-point observed by Mr.
Hind allies itself more closely to an earlier group, close to the same place,
well marked in Schiaparelli's list, and together with some closely adjoining
radiant-points forming the only representatives in that list of the well-known
meteor-shower of the " Pegasids," diverging about the time of the 10th of
August star-shower of the Perseids from near the star a Pegasi. The con-
firmation which this observation affords of the early occurrences in July and
August of " Lacertid " meteor-showers noted in Schiaparelli's list, which were
unattested hitherto by other observers, is at the same time a corroboration of
special interest from the very sharply-defined and well-recorded date and

position of the radiation.

   Between lO*" p.ir. and midnight on August 9 th, 1875, Mr. Waller ob-
served 50 shooting-stars at Birmingham, showing that the shower of Perseids

had already reached a considerable intensity on that night. On the follow-
ing night Mr. Wood observed at the same place a somewhat larger number

(as will be seen by his report), and mapped the tracks of 40 meteors radi-
ating, with only one or two exceptions, from Perseus, and a few of them
from a branch radiant-point apparently at e Cassiopeiae. The principal

--radiant-point in Perseus was at the star jj of that constellation scarcely any

of the meteor-tracks prolonged backwards diverging far from this point, and

the radiant-point of the remainder, constituting a very small proportion of the

whole number, being in the neighbourhood of ^^ Persei. One of these meteors
(at 1 L** 39TM 30*) was as bright as Jupiter ; and eight others were as bright as

Sirius, or brighter than Ist-magnitude stars. Mr. Wood thus describes the

general characteristics of the shower during the period of his observations.
The sky was very clear and, from the absence of moonlight, very favourable

for obtaining meteor registrations.

mapped were described as leaving very persistent streaks, one of these (the
last on the regular list, at 12" 6TM) being a bright meteor from the direction

of the well-known concomitant radiant-point of the August shower in

Pegasus. On the nights of August 9th and 11th the sky was overcast.
   The sky was clear and the meteor-shower was weU seen at Sunderland by

Mr. T. W. Backhouse on the night of the 10th, from whom the particulars of

its appearance noted below have been received. The following is Mr. Back-

house's description of a Perseid of great brightness, which exceeded in magni-

--tude any other meteor of the shower which he observed : " It appeared at

13" 24" [1'^ 24" A.M., August 11th, 1875] i° to the right of a Auriga, and
was directed towards d, disappearing near v and r Aurigae. It increased

very rapidly in brightness just before disappearing, becoming brighter than
Venus at its brightest, making a bright glow round it. Its tail also increased

rapidlj^ in brightness and was of many colours, but its changes were too
rapid for me to foUow them purple, however, predominated at first, and

                                                                                                                                   ;

afterwards green. After the head disappeared, the tail remained some

--seconds quite straight (and vertical), and gradually became slightly serpen-

tine the brightest part (that near the head) lasting at least 4| minutes,
becoming a group of cloudy patches 3° or 4° in extent, and spreading out
N. and S. The stars y and r were at first at the S. end, and then in

the middle of this group. At 13" 27" or 28" I looked at it with my 4^-

inch refractor with a low power ; it was irresolvable, and like a group of a
few large iiudcflned nebulae, the brightest part at y and r Aurigae." In a
watch at intervals between 10'' 20" and 14'' 20", amounting together to 96
minutes, and equivalent to one of 82 minutes in a sky without clouds or
twilight, 70 meteors were seen, corresponding (as the number seen in a clear
sky by one observer) to an average rate of frequency of 51 meteors per
hour. The great majority of the meteors seen in these periods of observation
of the shower were Perseids.
--218 REPORT 1875.

    Between 12" and 12" 30" on the night of August 11th, Mr. Greg observed
10 meteors, chiefly Persei'ds, in an interval of clear sky, at Buntingford,
Herts ; and four of these were of considerable brightness. The radiant-
region was diffuse, extending apparently between a Persei and e or t Cas-

 siopeise.

    General Radiant-lists, and tJieir extension and corroboration by observations

--{chiefly collected by the Committee since the year 1870). The numerous

observations (principally of the periodical meteor-showers of January, April,
August, October, November, and December) communicated during the past
six or seven years, since the publication of the Committee's " Atlas of
Radiant-points " in the year 1867, which have remained' unpublished in
these Eeports since the year 1870, together with the printed meteor-cata-
logue of the " Eadcliffe Observations," Oxford, for the years 1869-1872,
aiford abundant materials for revising and correcting, and in some cases for
extending the list of Radiant-points included in that Atlas, of which ad-
vantage has only been partially taken by Mr. Greg in his most recently pub-
lished general lists of Radiant-points (see these Reports for 1868, p. 401,
the list of the ' Atlas ' of meteor-showers, 1872, Table facing p. 109, and
1874, pp. 324-339). The latter list contains all the combined radiant-lists of
various observers, and reproduces, with very little alteration, the earlier

meteor-shower list of the British Association ' Atlas ' in 1867, as the portion
of the Catalogue which depends directly upon observations collected by the

Committee. By comparison with the more recent observations, Mr. Greg is
now enabled to present the following modifications and instances of corro-

boration of his general list (p. 221) which the above-named continued series of
observations are found to afford, and which they suggest as desirable points for
verification in the case of a continued collection of occasional meteor-observa-

tions for such an object. Several new radiant-points are comprised among
these results ; and new positions and durations are assigned to several of the

formerly established showers, of which the particulars and the general
extent wiU most readily be gathered from the following notes of these com-
parisons supplied by Mr. Greg. The reference numbers in the first column
of the Table correspond to those of the general list in the volume of these
Reports for 1874 (p. 324), and to this list and to the older one of 1868 the
present Table supplies a five or six years' commentary and continuation. Some
radiant-points of the list deserve special notice as having received from the

new observations important illustrations. Showers formerly very conspicuous
are occasionally unnoticed, or were invisible in the newer observations. Of

these showers,B G (G. &H., No. 101) of the " Cygnids " in July and August

is an example, having been only very sparingly observed since the year 1870 :

BZwhile an eqiiaUy marked meteor-shower of July, near the head of Draco,

(No. 102), has presented itself with greatest intensity in August as a con-
comitant of the 10th of August- meteors, and during the periods of observa-
tion immediately connected with the systematic watches for that shower.

   Two well-defined meteor-showers in October and November, and a third

in December, the Orionids of October 16th-24th, Taurids of Nov. 2nd-12th,
and Geminids of December 10th-14th, appear to be connected together by
intermediate meteors, absorbing with the principal radiant-points themselves
a large proportion of the sporadic meteors visible in those months. The first
two of these showers are in great part contemporary, the sliower-radiant in
Orion comprising, according to Schmidt, six subradiants in October and

November, with an average position at about R.A 83°, Decl. -f 11°. The
place of its maximum appearance, about the middle of October, is in some-

what greater right ascension and declination (by four or five degrees) than

this position ; and a comparison of its elements might perhaps be attempted
successfully with those of the comet of 1821, 1, (radiant-point at 86°,4-19°-5),

if the nodal date (jN'ovember 11th) of this comet is capable of being recon-

ciled with the much earlier time of appearance of the Orion shower. In the
' Memorie della Soc. degli Spettroscopisti Italiani ' of May 1874, a memoir on

the meteors of the 17th-2Sth of October (1609 meteor-tracks observed by

Drs. Heis and Schmidt, Zezioli, and at the Vienna Observatory, between the

years 1843 and 1873), by Ludwig Gruber, of Vienna, is inserted, in which

the author discusses the ap]iareut radiant-points of this meteoric epoch by

projecting the meteor-tracks recorded successively on each single date. The

smallest number of tracks (65) occurred on the 20th, and the greatest (284

and 226) on the 22nd and 24tli of October ; 310 meteors were found to be

sporadic, or incapable of reduction to any distinguishable radiant-point.

Of the remaining meteors, Dr. Gruber regards 16 radiant-points as having

sufficiently well-defined positions to admit of further calculations as regards

their orbits. The accompanying list (p. 220) exhibits the dates and positions
together with the relative intensities of these several showers, as shown by

the percentage numbers of meteors belonging to them on the days when

they were most conspicuous. The Table also contains comparisons of their

positions with those of already noted meteor-showers in other radiant-lists.

These radiants may be grouped in great part under already recognized

displays, as those of the Orionids (II. & VIII.), Muscids (V., X., XIV.),

Taurids (VI.), Castorids, or OemelUds (between Castor and Pollux, IX.), a

shower from near /3 Geminorum (first recorded in that constellation by Herrick

from the 20th to the 26th of October, 1839, and observed at the above place,

in great intensity, by Zezioli from the 21st to the 25th, and especially on

the morning of the 23rd of October, 1868 *), Cassiopeids (XII.), anA.Pokirids

(XV.). But certain radiant-points of the list are new to the general Radiant

Catalogue of Mr. Greg in the last volume of these Eeports, and they are in-

cluded below (Xos. 194, 195) in the present Supplementary Table of that list.

Dr. Gruber's position of the radiant-point XIII. agrees distantly with that of

a new radiant-point for the end of October near o Piscium, noticed by Mr.

Backhouse in 1872, and established by Mr. Greg from several other meteor-

tracks in his examination of the recent observations. It may be added that

the older radiants RG^, T^^                                                              3' ^^<i '^^v E,  o, and N^j Ag, in August, and the
                                                                                      ^

October-December showers Ai5_i7 near Cassiopeia, have undergone revision

by means of the observations up to the j^ear 1873, and that reductions to

more definite positions that other showers admit of will perhaps be further

illustrated when the unusually large collection of observations in the year

1873-74 have aU been projected. The radiant IST^^ (G. & H., 1874, No. 83)

appears to have arisen out of a distinct meteor-shower in Cassiopeia (Aj^,

G. & H., ITos. 83, 98 in the Supplementary List), accompanying that of the
Persei'ds, reaching a maximum about the 10th and again on the 23rd of

August, which has been well marked among the recent observations at a

place (provisionally assigned to it) at y Cassiopeiae. The relation of this
new shower to the two formerly adopted radiant-points A^ and N^^, and its

final separation from the Perseus radiant-point, with which it has pro-

bably been identified by indiscriminate projections hitherto, will form an

important subject for investigation in future observations.

   * Herrick's shower at 99°, +26° (e Geminorum), Gruber's and Schiaparelli's position
from Zezioli's observatious, and one in Tupman's list (No. 90) are the only recorded

radiant-centres of the October period in the constellation Gemini.

 --Papers relating to Meteoric Astronomy. In the Sheffield Scientiiie School

of Yale College, in the United States, Prof. H. A. Newton delivered a lecture
on March 9th, 1874, " On the story of Biela's Comet," in which he details
with much completeness the circumstances of the positions of Biela's comet

in its orbit relative to the earth at the times of the occurrences of the

greatest meteor-showers known to have proceeded from the earth's approach
to this comet's orbit. The line of the nodes, or the place of the earth's nearest

approach to the comet's track, being at N, it appears that in the year 1798,
224 REPOKT 1875.
at the time when the earth encountered at that point the great meteor-
shower of the 6th of December in that year, observed by Brandes, Eiela's
comet was in the position marked C, somewhat nearer to the earth than at
the next occasion when a similar occurrence was observed in the year 1838.
The comet was in the latter year at a point marked A, about 300 millions of

miles distant, measured along its orbit, from the earth. At the last great reap-
pearance of this star-shower connected with Biela's comet, on the 27th of
 Kovember, 1872, the two bodies (which had last been observed in 1852 as
 forming the nucleus of the comet) must have occupied a place on the elliptic
 orbit marked B, at about 200 milhons of miles along the comet's path from
 the place of the earth's intersection with the meteor-stream at N. It thus
 appears that a long extended group of meteor-particles must accompany the
 comet in its periodical revolution, preceding it to a distance of 300 millions
 of miles in front, and following it to a length of 200 millions of miles in the
 rear of its actual position, or occupying, if there is no reason to suppose this
 elongated meteor-current discontinuous, fully 500 millions of miles in its

 observed length along the comet's path.

   A similar investigation has led Prof. Kirkwood, of the Indiana State Uni-

 versity, to a remarkable conclusion regarding the clusters of meteors included
 in the current of the Leonids of November, that at least one other such

 cluster besides that connected immediately with the comet exists to mark
 the ancient disintegrations which this cometary body must have undergone.
 The following letter in ' Nature ' of January 3rd, 1875, relates the results
 of Prof. Kirkwood's investigation, and describes some observations of his own
 by which they are supported.

   --" The Meteors of Novemher 14. The writer some time since called atten-

 tion to the fact that the dates of certain meteoric showers, given by Hum-

boldt and Quetelet as belouging to the Jfovember stream, indicated the

existence of two distinct and widely separated chisters moving in orbits very
nearly identical. The years thus designated were 17S7, 1818, 1820, 1822,
1823, 1841, and 1846. As the last two were subsequent to the great
display of 183.3, the meteors seen were noticed only in consequence of their
being specially looked for ; and as the number conformable to the radiant

of the Leonids is not given, there may be some doubt whether those observed
really belonged to the November stream. The former displays occurred

before the periodicity of such phenomena had been suspected, and the
number of meteors would seem to have been considerable. As the shower
of 1787 preceded by twelve years the great meteoric fall witnessed in South
America by Humboldt, the group from which it was derived had passed
beyond the orbit of Saturn at the time of the latter display. The pheno-
mena of 1818, 1820, 1822, and 1823 indicate that, as in the case of the
major group, which passed its descending node between 1865 and 1870, the
meteoroids are extended over a considerable arc of their orbit. From No-

--vember 1787 to the middle of the nodal passage of 1818-1823 is about 33^

years a period nearly the same as that of the principal cluster. These

facts alone were regarded by the present writer as giving reasonable pro-

bability to the h3'pothesis of an approximate identity of orbits. In ' Nature,'
vol. xi. p. 407, it was shown that the meteor-showers of October 855 and
856 were probably derived from the stream of Leonids* ; and it is certainly
remarkable that the interval from 855 to 1787 is equal to twenty-eight
periods of 33-293 years. Again, the shower observed in China, Sept. 28,
A.D. 288, making proper allowance for the nodal motion, corresponds to the
same epoch, the interval between 288 and 855 containing seventeen periods
of 33-35 years. In view of the fact that the shower from this cluster was
due between 1851 and 1855, the following extract from the writer's note-
book is not without interest :

   " ' Newark, Delaware, Nov. 13, 1852. ... On the evening of the 11th,

from 7 to 10 o'clock, an aurora borealis of ordinary brilliancy was constantly
observed. About midnight the sky became overcast with clouds, thus pre-

venting our watch for meteors which we were about to commence. On the

12th, from about 3 to 9 o'clock a.m., rain fell almost incessantly. About
noon the clouds broke away, and the night between the 12th and 13th was
quite clear. During six hours (from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.) constant watch was
maintained at four windows, facing north, south, east, and west. From
10 to 1 o'clock the observations were conducted by Prof. Ferris and myself
with assistants. At 1 the place of Prof. Ferris was taken by Prof. Porter,
who remained, with myself and assistants, till 4. "We observed

 --* The first of these showers is recorded by an Arabian chronicler, and also as follows hi

the 'Aiuiales Fuldenses': "Per totam noctem igniculi instar spiciilorum occidentem

versus per aerem densissime ferebantur." That of the foUowing year (856) is cited from

similar but somewhat less authentic sources in Quetelet 's Catalogue, and is suspected to be

identical with it. By comparing the dates of these two showers with that of the famous

one which took place in 1306 (a year, as well as the year 868, in which the comet accom-

panying this star-shower was also seen : vide these Eeports for 1873, p. 401), Boguslawski

first suspected an advance in the node of the meteor-orbit before its real form and period

had yet been detected. But the showers of 855-56 preceded by 12years the regular periodic

shower of 868                                                             and  it  is  remarked  by Professor  Kirkwood that this divergence  of  their

dates agrees exactly with the interval by which the weU-marked November showers of 1820
and 1822 antieiiiated the appearance of the celebrated star-shower of November 13th, 1833.

" ' When the meteors Trere most numerous, near 3 o'clock, the common

point of divergence in Leo was distinctly observed.'

" I may here add, although the fact is not stated in my memoranda, that

the conformable meteors, or a majority of them, were seen near the radiant,

and that they were generally smaller and had shorter tracks than the No-

vember meteors observed between 1865 and 1870. The number seen was

too small to be called a shower; at the maximum, however, the fall per hour

was nearly double that of ordinary nights. In short, I have no doubt that

they were Leonids, and think it highly probable that they were derived from

Wea distinct cluster which passed its perihelion in 1787 and 1820.                                                                                                                                                            have

therefore nine recorded meteor-faUs which indicate the existence of a second

cluster of Leonids, viz. those of a.d, 288, 855, 856, 1787, 1818, 1820, 1822,

1823, and 1852. The showers of 855 and 856 may be somewhat doubtful.

If derived from the same meteor-cloud as the others, the dates would indicate

considerable perturbations either by Uranus or the earth. The displays

have been much less conspicuous than those of the major group, and hence

the phenomena have been less frequently observed. The period is about

33-33 years, while that of the other swarm, according to Newton, is 33-25

years. Since their separation, therefore, the latter has gained nearly two-

thirds of a revolution in their relative motion. The estimates which have

been made in regard to the recent entrance of the cluster into the planetary

system must consequently be rejected. Daniel Kirkwoob."

  --Lists of Meteor and Meteor-shower observations and of Cometary Radiant-

points. In the above-quoted publication (of May 1874) of the Italian Spec-

troscopic Society, Prof. Schiaparelli reviews at some length the catalogue of

observations and of meteor radiant-points by Capt. Tupman, deriving from

them chiefly average results relating to the apparent length and to the time

of flight of the recorded meteor-tracks. The annexed diagram shows ap-

proximately the numbers of meteors in the list of different lengths and

durations of flight proceeding by intervals of 1° up to 30° in length of path,

and of one tenth of a second up to two seconds in the time of flight. The

curve of relative frequency in length of path is drawn from the actual

numbers of the observations, including 1951 recorded tracks ; and the most

frequent leugths of path recorded  among them are between 7° and 10°                                                                                                                                                          the

average length of path derived from the whole series of observations in the

list is ll°-0, falling a little short of the mean apparent length of course of

meteor-tracks (13°-9) assigned by Coulvier Gravier.

The curve of frequency of the different times of flight is a reduced one

from the total number of 1613 observations, allowing for the rough estima-

tions at 0^-5, 1'-O, 1^-5, and 2^-0 preponderating greatly among the other more

common time of flight assigned to about one third of all the observations ; but

a tendency to record longer times of flight in the later years (187l'-71) of

the Catalogue than in the first year (1869), in which many durations of
only 0^-1 were recorded, indicates that these exceedingly momentary times
of flight may very probably have been a little underrated. Above 1*5

second there are actually noted in the list meteors of great durations in
the following numbers :

Numbers of meteors recorded

total 59, or only 3f per cent, of all the appearances recorded. Only 47 meteors
with times of flight varying from I'-l to 1^-5 (or 2-9 per cent, of the whole)
are noted in the list, the remaining 1506 meteors all having durations not
exceeding one second. The longest time of flight observed was 16 seconds,
and the average duration of all the recorded times of flight M-as 0^-44. If

durations exceeding 1 second are excluded as anomalous and exceptional
from the general result, the average time of flight of the remaining 1506
meteors was 0*-32.

   The following agreements of radiant-points in Capt. Tupman's list with
showers apparently corresponding to them obtained from Zezioli's observa-
tions are pointed out by Schiaparelli. The sign and number of the shower
in Mr. Greg's last general list to which they correspond is added for refer-
ence to that Table ; and although these separate correspondences exhibit

very excellent agreements, they afford little confirmation of the distinctness

selected Table of cometary coincidences, where, for greater clearness of de-

scription, such points of close approach (or of " appulse " of comet-orbits to

the earth's) are simply denoted in the first columns of this Table as being
" near " the comet's ascending or descending node. For the general pur-

poses of comparison between the probable orbits of observed meteor-streams

whose dates and radiant-positions may be hereafter or have already been

sufficiently well determined, and those of certain comets whose computed
orbits are found to pass, at the points of approach to the earth's orbit, either
very near to or at no very remote distance from it, and for convenience of
reference in identifying such examples of supposed agreement between
meteor-showers and cometary radiant-points as have already been pointed
out, the dates and positions of the radiant-points of all the computed comet-

orbits intersecting the ecliptic plane within a quarter of the sun's distance
inside or outside of the earth's orbit are collected together in two Tables

(pp. 232, 234) in the order of dates and of position of the cometary radiant-
points above or below the equator, the two lists being arranged for the
northern and southern hemispheres respectively, according to the north or
south declinations of the computed radiant-points. As these radiant-points
were computed by the approximate graphical method devised by Schiaparelli
(Entwurf einer astronomischen Theorie der Sternschnuppen, p. 78, §49), the

tests which the elaborate calculations of many of the radiant-points bj''

Dr. Weiss supply are employed to check the graphical constructions ; and all

the radiant-points originally calculated by Professor Weiss, who takes into
account what has elsewhere been omitted throughout in the graphical pre-

paration of these Tables (the ellipticity of the orbits of those comets which
are known to be periodic, and whose orbits accordingly differ sensibly from

parabolas), are included as standards of correct determinations in the present

lists.

In the column of reference numbers at the beginning of the Table the names

of discoverers and particulars of meteoric connexion of some periodic comets

are added, together with references to other numbers where comets are known

or conjectured to be more or less probably identifiable with comets of an

older date, although no elliptic figure may haA'c been observed or calculated

Ain the dimensions of their oi'bits.                                                                               question sign is added after that of the

node or appulse if the elements are uncertain, and the date in the following

column is corrected for precessional alteration to the year 1875 from that of

the comet's aijparition. The fourth column contains the comet's radius vector

or distance from the sun in terms of the semidiameter of the earth's orbit

as unit, at the node or point of intersection of the orbit with the ecliptic,

unless the appulse replaces the node in the Table, when the comet's distance

--above (-f-) or below ( ) the earth's orbit at the point where its radius vector

is unify is substituted in brackets (in terms of the same unit as the scale of

Ameasurement) for the value of the radius vector.                                                                           similar estimate to that

afforded by the radius vector in other cases can thus be formed of the degree

of proximity in Avhich the path of the comet and the earth's orbit approach

each other in such instances at their points of close conjunctions at equal
distances from the sun. Thus the comet 18G2 II crossed the ecliptic plane
(with retrograde motion, at an ascending node corresponding to the shower-
date on Aug. 19th) about 0*03 (or twelve moon's distances) without the earth's
orbit ; but, owing to its small inclination, iu approaching nearer to the sun
it slightly neared the earth's orbit ; and at a point corresponding in the earth's
annual motion to about the 7th of August, it passed only 0-025 earth's solar
OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.                                   231

distance (or about ten times the moon's distance) above the earth's orbit.

Thus the observation of a star-shower not far from the latter date, between

the 7th and 19th of August (or on August 10th, S. & Z. 140, in the above

comparative list), with a radiant-point corresponding closely to that of meteor

joourstiivants of the comet at this point, is in satisfactory correspondence with

the earth's conjunction with this comet's orbit, although the date of the

shower and of the nearest conjunction of the orbits is not exactly that of the

earth's passage across the line of the comet's nodes. In several other cases

(as in that of Lexell's comet) of comets moving nearly in the ecliptic, the
point of nearest conjunction and the time of the year when the earth passes

through it are very far removed from the place and from the corresponding
time of the earth's passage through the node ; and the approach of the two

orbits is yet often closer at the former than at the latter place.

The particulars of each comet's approach to the earth, whether occurring at

the node or appulse, will be found, as thus described, in the columns of the

accompanying lists, the dates in column 3 and the places of the radiant-points

in columns 5 and 6 being brought up (for precession) to the year 1875, neg-

lecting any perturbations which the orbit of the comet since the time of its

appearance may have undergone. In cases of appulses (or of earth's conjunction

with the comet-orbits at a common radial distance from the sun), the motions

of the meteor-particles are supposed to be equal and parallel to that of the

comet ill its orbit there, or at the point where its radius vector is equal to

the earth's distance from the sun ; as no regard is paid in the graphical

construction to the slightly elliptic form, both of the orbits of certain comets

and of the earth's orbit, which are severally assumed to be parabolic and

circular, small errors on these accounts will present themselves in the lists,

which, for preliminary purposes, may be looked upon as unimportant.

  A ---f or sign following the dates indicates if the comet's motion is direct

or retrograde ; and if the comet was approaching the sun, or if it was very

near to its perihelion at the node or appulse, there is added after the radius

vector, or appulse-distance, in column 4, a notation sign (* or §) denoting
these conditions ; where no such sign is added, the comet's motion is receding
from the sun. The italic letters after the comets' years in column 2 are

intended to supply some information of their general characters and appearance.

to them, are also roughly indicated by letters corresponding to their lengths

orbits are computed to have been hyperbolic. The sign following these cha-

Chambers in his ' Handbook of Descriptive Astronomy.' Orbits of comets of

more recent dates (since the year 1866) were extracted from M. A. Guillemin'a

comprehensive and exceediugly accurate descriptive work ' Les Cometes.' The

figures in the last column of the Table represent actual speeds of penetration

or of flight through the atmosphere of meteoric particles proceeding from

the comets, including the small additional velocities given to them by the

Aearth's attraction.  Table for obtaining these, and complete Tables for

 --Researches on Meteorites, and accounts of their recent falls or discovery. As

will be gathered from the following abstracts of papers and communications

relating to these subjects, great progress continues to be made in the investi-

gation of the origin of meteorites, and of the circumstances which attend

their fall. The first of these communications on the recent falls of Meteorites

(Part I.), and that on the latest analytical researches and examinations of their

structui'e (Part II.), contain descriptions of many such new occurrences and

interesting observations on them which have hitherto been scarcely accessible

to English readers, owing to the foreign languages and publications in which

the original papers describing most of these particulars appeared ; the

following brief analyses and abstracts of their principal contents having accord-

ingly been reproduced from his extensive summary of such recent contribu-

tions to aerohtic literature in the ' Geological Magazine ' of the present year

by Dr. Plight, they are presented here concisely and in a convenient arrange-

ment for reference in this Report.

--1873, August 24th. Marysville, California*.

   All the facts that I have yet been able to gather respecting this fall are
that an aerolite, weighing 12 lbs., crashed through the tree-tops with a bright

flash, and was buried to the unusual depth of eight feet in the ground. When

dug out it was so hot that it could not be handled.

  A block of metal, weighing 1-579 kilog., was left exposed on the surface of

the ground at the foot of the Schneckenberg, north of the Eisenberg, by a
heavy thunder-shower washing away the surrounding soil. It is a finely gra-
nular iron, through which are disseminated here and there yellow particles
of magnetic pyrites or troilite. Unlike metallic masses of undoubted meteoric
origin, it contains neither nickel nor cobalt ; when etched with nitric acid it

exhibits, in place of figures, minute star-like forms. It has the composition :

   The presence of silica was confirmed by treating the white, amorphous, some-
what rounded particles which remained iindissolved with hydrofluoric acid.

                         .

  A description of the meteor at Khairpur is given by the Eev. G. Yeates,

similar in aU essential details to that cited in these Eeports (1874, p. 300),
from the 'Astronomical Register,' with the addition that it first appeared
near the star Algenib (about 15° above the west horizon) as a meteor,or rather
cluster of meteors, each exceeding in brightness a star of the first magnitude ;
and the breadth of the train left behind them is estimated to have been from 3°
to 5°. From this point " its motion was not very rapid but steady, and by the time
it had reached about 10° of the meridian, which it passed south of the zenith,
it assumed an exceedingly brilhant appearance, the larger fragments, glowing
with intense white light with perhaps a shade of green, taking the lead in a
cluster, surrounded and followed by a great number of smaller ones, each
drawing a train after it, which, blending together, formed a broad belt of a
briUiant fiery red." It lit up the whole country, and produced an effect
similar to that of the electric light. It proceeded in this way, passing in its
onward course close under Orion, the lowest star of which (Rigel) was very
near the meridian, until it reached a point nearly due east, paling again as it
drew near the horizon, and at about 20° above it appeared to go out rather
than to fall. The train, which continued very bright for some time, was di-
stinctly traceable three quarters of an hour afterwards. At first it changed

to a dull red ; then, as the morning broke, to a line of silvery-grey clouds
that divided into several portions, and floated away on the wind. The track
of the meteor was unusually long, extending through nearly 180°. The sky
was cloudless, the morning being described as remarkably clear, with a faint
glow in the east, the sun being stiU 45 minutes below the horizon when the
 meteor was first observed. After it had disappeared, and while the train
stUl attracted attention, there was perfect silence, which was at length broken
 by a loud report, followed by a long reverberation, that gradually died away
 like the roU of distant thunder. This interval is estimated to have been four

 minutes.

    At Bhawalpur the explosion was sufficiently violent to shake the houses
 and slam the doors. At Bhawalgur, 80 miles from Khairpur, the meteor was
 seen, but no explosion was heard. It was also observed at Jodhpur and
 Moradabad, and was probably visible within a radius of 300 miles round

 Khairpur.

   A correspondent of ' The Pioneer ' of the 30th of September records his

 observations made on the Shujabad road, 13 miles south of Multan. He states

 that the different fragments into which the meteor broke up were distinctly
 visible, " more than twenty of them, I should say, moving in parallel courses,
 two or three of the larger ones taking the lead in the centre, and each of
 them leaving a tail of red light behind," which blending together, formed one
 huge band of light. The report, which was very terrific, followed after the
 lapse of about three minutes and a. half, which would make the point where
 the disruption of the aerolite took place about 42 or 45 miles distant. The
 train remained very bright for some time, and the clouds into which it was

transformed were visible upwards of an hour afterwards, till they faded away

in the bright sunlight.

    Another correspondent, " Shikaree," states that on the left bank of the
Chenab, some 60 miles S.W. of Bhawalpur, the meteor displayed great bril-
liancy, and that a double detonation followed after an interval of six or seven

minutes.

   One of the meteorites fell close to a man who had gone out into the jungle,
and frightened him so much that he hardly knew M'hat occurred, and was
under the impression that the stone pursued him for two hours. He showed

the spot where it fell, however, and this was the first fragment unearthed and
forwarded by the Tuhsildar of Khairpur to Major Minchin, PoKtical Agent
for Bhawalpur.

    The stones fell partly in the State of Bhawalpur and partly in the Multan
district, on either bank of the Sutlej, over an area extending 16 miles in a
direction bearing 35° S. of E., with a breadth of about three miles. The
largest and perhaps the greater number fell to the eastward of Khairpur, and
penetrated the earth to the depth of about 14 foot. They are preserved in
the following collections in India, and weigh respectively :

    Of those stones or fragments that fell on the Multan side seven have been

--heard of: four at different spots near Gogewala well, E.S.E. of Mahomed

Moorut ; two at Khurampur, on the right bank of the Siitlej ; and one at
Araoli, two miles N.W. of Khurampur. Of these, one only is in known hands,
that from Mylsi Pergunnah, which weighs 6 oz. 70 grs.

   The account of the physical characters of the stones is very meagre. They
are all very irregular in form, and are more or less broken. While some of
the fractures have evidently been accomplished by hand, and others probably
took place at the moment of falling, several appear to have occurred during
the fall, as the glazed surface has been partially renewed. The stones are of
the usual steel-grey colour and exhibit compact crypto-crystaUine texture.
One specimen has the specific gravity =3'66.

   In a letter from the War Correspondent of ' The Standard' it is stated that

among the poi'tents of evil which were observed at Coomassie while the
British Army halted on the banks of the Prah, an aerolite fell in the market-
place of Coomassie. In reply to an application for further details respecting

--this event, Mr. Henty writes that he obtained his information from one of the

clergymen of the Basle Mission. He sa3'S : " They mentioned these ' pro-
digies ' as matters of common rumour and belief at Coomassie, but they do

not appear to have even made any inquiries whatever as to their truth.
Coomassie was deserted when we got there, so there was no opportunity of

gaining further information."

  A short notice in ' Silliman's Journal ' states that the descent of these me-

teorites, numbering a dozen or more, was accompanied with a series of explo-
sions and rumbling noises which lasted about four minutes, and were " not
unlike the discharge of firearms in a battle a few miles off." Although the
fall took place by day, a luminous body was observed. The area over which
the fragments fell was ten miles long and three wide. Three stones, weigh-
ing 5-5, I'O, aud 0*8 kilog., have been found. The dull-coloured crust does
not entirely cover the stones, the fused matter forming it being scattered over
some small parts of the surface in the form of pear-shaped beads ; in one or
two crevices the fused material has penetrated 5 millims. below the surface,
and here it is more brilliant than on the surface.

   The colour of the interior is in many parts of a dark grey, owing to the
presence of a larger amount of nickel-iron ; in the lighter portions are seen
some white spots of a mineral that is doubtless enstatite. The specific gravity

of the stone is 2-601, and its proximate composition :

colour and a very finely grained texture, with grains of metal distributed

through the mass; in certain parts spherular structure is apparent. In a

microscopic section it was found that the transparent and almost entirely

colourless stony particles act on polarized light. The metallic portion is

acid, and numerous small black grains of chromite are distributed thioughout

    In the ' English Mechanic ' is a letter from a person signing himself " Ralph
Lowdon," of Gateshead, stating that at the above time and place " a massive
ball of intense light," accompanied by other pear-shaped balls of fire, was seen
to drop towards the earth. The aerolite, which is alleged to have fallen in an
orchard on the bank of the North Tyne, at no great distance from Hexham,
is stated to have been found the foUowiug day at 9 a.m. at a depth of 14 inches
in the soil, still quite warm, and to have weighed 301 g lbs. Letters directed
to the above are returned by the Post-ofRce authorities, while a courteous
reply which I received from the Rev. H. C. Barker, of Hexham, states that

--the editor of ' The English Mechanic ' must have been misinformed. The

reverend gentleman writes : " To make assurance doubly sure, I have made
inquiry in several quarters, and cannot find even the slightest foundation for

the statement."

--1875, February 12th, 10.30 p.m. (Chicago time). Iowa Co., State of lowaf.

   A very large and brilliant fireball passed over Iowa City at the above date,

in a direction slightly N. of W. ; the apparent size of the meteor was about

half that of the fuU moon, and it was accompanied by a broad train of light
of a slightly green hue. Three separate explosions of the fireball were noticed
while it was still in view, and about two or three minutes after it disappeared
three reports, resembling the discharge of the blast of a qiiarry, were heard.

   The phenomenon attracted general attention throughout several counties in
the central part of the State of Iowa ; and although the visible path of the
meteor does not appear to have exceeded 50 to 60 miles, the occurrence
attracted attention and was heard over an area measuring about 125 miles

from E. to W., and half that distance from N. to S. An observer at Brooklyn

was aroused from his bed by the report ; and another, who was riding in a
sleigh near West Liberty, 40 miles E._of the spot where the stones fell, states

that objects were rendered about as visible as if it were day, the explosions
being loud, and followed by a rumbling sound that lasted some 60 or 90
seconds. According to the ' Grinell Herald,' the interval, as observed at that
town, between the light of the meteor being seen and the report being heard
M'as three minutes. The ' Des Moines Register ' states that between Red Rock
and Newton some of the meteorites passed so near the earth's surface that
they chpped off branches from the trees.

   Prof. N. R. Leonard, of the Iowa State University, states that the meteo-
rites weighed altogether about 250 lbs., whereof 141 lbs. came into his pos-
session ; Prof. Hinriehs makes the total weight about 300 lbs. The largest
mass, which was broken in falling, weighed 43^ lbs., the chief fragments,
found together, being 20 lbs. and 16 lbs. in weight.

   According to a description, of a very sensational character, which is given
in the ' Dubuque Times,' one of the meteorites was found in a field about
three miles S. of the village of West Liberty, having penetrated, so it is stated,
to a depth of fifteen feet into the ground.

    The ' Davenport Gazette ' states that another stone fell at Homestead, near

Iowa City (lat. 41° 46' N., long. 92° 0' W.), in a field covered with ice and

snow, and rebounded in a N.E. direction for a distance of more than thirty

feet up a slight declivity, where it came to rest in the sand, which was fused

and adhering to it. It weighed originally about 7 lb. 6 oz., but had been

reduced by eager curiosity-hunters to 3 lb. 8 oz. ; the fractured surface of

this meteorite had a dark and less distinct coating than that belonging to the

larger block from which it had been detached by tbe explosion.

    The stones are covered with the usual black crust, and there is evidence on

some of the pieces of the meteorites of the fused material of the outer portion

having run partially over the freshly fractured surfaces. Some fragments

show distinct evidence of a sort of lamination or imperfect stratification, the

parts where the surfaces cleaved being smoothed down as if by pressure or

friction. About 100 were found, varying in size from 9500' to 50 grammes,

A25 kQogs. having been sent to Paris,                preliminary chemical examination

of this meteorite has already been made by L. Smith, who finds the specific

gravity to be 3"57 and the composition :

                              Nickel-iron =12-53, Troilite =5-82, Silicates =S1'G1: totallOO-00.

The nickel-iron consists of

                       Iron=89-W, Nickel =10-35, Cobalt=0-54: total 99-93,

with traces of copper, phosphorus, and sulphur. The silicate contains iron

protoxide, alumina, magnesia, soda, with traces of lithia and potash, and has,

according to L. Smith, very similar compositions to the meteorite of New

Concord, Guernsey Co., Ohio (1860, 1st May). Daubrce remarks on its chon-

dritic structure, and considers it to belong to a large class of meteorites,

notably represented by the stones which fell at YouiUc (1831, May 31st) and

Aumale, Algeria (1865, August 25th).

    This meteorite being of the stony kind, and having so recently fallen, it

occurred to Wright (see also the examination of the Texas Meteorite, p. 244)

to examine the gases contained in the particles of iron distributed throughout

its mass, with a view to learning whether they present the same characters

as the gases occluded by the iron forming large and independent masses.

   He extracted from this picked iron at a moderately elevated temperature

several times its volume of gas, consisting of 35 per cent, of carbonic acid, 14

per cent, of carbonic oxide, the remaining 51 per cent, being chiefly hydrogen.

These results were obtained from metallic portions removed with the magnet

the pulverized rocky residue, however, retained a considerable amount of iron in

too finely divided particles to enable them to lift tlie stony fragments adhering

to  them                      accordingly  a  piece  of the solid meteoi'ite, about four cubic  centimetres
                           ;

in amount, was reduced to powder and placed in the tube attached to the pump.

The warmth of the hand sufficed to disengage some little gas, which, when

tested, was found to contain carbonic acid and hydrogen. The pump was

then set in action, and heat applied to the tube in the following manner :

I. The temperature of boiling water continued for several hours. II. The

moderate heat (200°-250°) of a small Bunsen flame applied for a short time.

AIII. stronger heat, kept below visible redness, applied for nearly an hour.

IV. Low red heat maintained about half an hour. V. Full red heat. The

total amount of gas evolved was about two and a half times the volume of the

material operated upon, and twenty times that of the iron. The following are

the relative proportions of the gases obtained at different temperatures :

    As regards the gas they occlude, iron and stony meteorites sho-R^ a marked
distinction. While the gases of the Lenarto iron contained 85'68 per cent, of
hydrogen, those obtained from cosmical masses of the stony kind, if the Iowa
meteorite may be regarded as a type, are characterized by the presence of car-

bonic acid, Avhich constitutes nine tenths of the gas evolved at a temperature
of boiUng water, and about one half of that given off at a lo-^v red heat.

   The spectiTim of the gas of the lo-wa meteorite, when the pressure of the
pump -was high, gave very brilliant carbon bands, the hydrogen lines being

wcalv and comparatively inconspicuous, although at a very lo-^v pressure they
became relatively stronger. The brightest carbon bands -were the three in

the green and blue, the red one being much feebler. These are precisely the

ones most conspicuous in the spectra of some of the comets ; and this fact is
a remarkable confirmation of the received theory as to the meteoric character

of those bodies.

    This, moreover, is a very significant fact in sho-wiug that it is quite unneces-
sary to assume the existence of volatile hydrocarbons to explain comctary
spectra, as some -writers have done, and that the presence of the t-vvo oxides
of carbon in such quantity is quite sufficient to account for all that has been

observed -when we consider the circumstance that the tension of the gases of
the cometary appendage must be extremely small. Were a largo comet to

approach near enough to the sun to have its nucleus intensely heated, it is
lug-hly probable that, over and above the bands already observed, the hydro-
gen lines -would be found in its spectrum.

    AVright expresses regret that such a comet as Donati's should have departed
into space just early enough to escape observation with the spectroscope.
While the most probable cause of the emission of light under these conditions

is electricity, another may be found in the property of gaseous bodies of

emitting light of the same character as that which they absorb. It is not
altogether improbable, Wright suggests, that the solar radiations absorbed by
the gaseous matter, although for the most part converted into heat, would also
in part be emitted again as light, and that in the case of volumes of gas filling

many cubic inches, the intensity might be sufficient to give a distinct spectrum

of broad bands or lines, even though, on the scale of any possible experiment,
no trace of such an action can be detected. These researches have led the
author to accept the follo-yving conclusions :

    1. The stony meteorites are distinguished from those which are metallic by

occluding the oxides of carbon, chiefly carbonic acid, as their characteristic

gases, in place of hydrogen.

   2. The proportion of carbonic acid evolved is much greater at low than at

          _

high temperatures, and is sufficient to mask the hydrogen in the spectrum.
    3. The amount of gas contained in a large meteorite, or a cluster of such

bodies ser-ving as a cometary nucleus, is sufficient to form the train as ordi-

narily observed.

   4. The spectrum of these gases elofiely resembles that of several of the

comets.

   The cmissiou of gaseous constituents by the action of solar heat may explain

the loss of tail and the diminution of brilliancy observed in the case of several
comets in their successive revolutions ; and their final disappearance from sight
will follow as an inevitable consequence, the number of revolutions necessary
to discharge the gases depending chiefly on their size and the nearness of their

approach to the sun at their perihelia. When a meteorite enters our atmo-

sphere, the gases -which are evolved from it by the heat which is liberated
must greatly contribute to increase the intensity of that heat, while the
sudden expansion which these gases experience must constitute the leading

cause of the violent disruption of these masses.

within the area of the village of Zsadany in the courtyards of the inhabitants,

others in the open fields. They did not fall together, but at slight intervals,

which appear to have been at least one third of a minute. Some were picked

up immediately they reached the ground, and were found to be cold. It may

be mentioned here that the stones which fell at Dhurmsala, in Indiat (1860;

July 14th), are stated to have been so cold that they could not be held in the

hand.

interesting masses, to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The investigation

of this aerolite has been undertaken by Wartha and Krcnncr ; the former wiU

  A very brilliant meteor appeared from a bank of cloud about 20° above the

N.W. horizon ; it became elongated and pear-shaped as it traversed the
heavens from W. to E., attaining an altitude of 50° on passing the zenith,

where the nucleus appeared to break up and roll on in misshapen spheres of

various sizes. On reaclnng a point within 20° of the N.E. horizon, the light

became more intense and then the meteor disappeared. Eight or ten seconds

later, reverberations as of thunder were distinctly heard. An eye-witness

   As Graham t has shown that the Lenarto meteoinc iron contains 2-85 timea

its volume of occluded hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and nitrogen, and Mallet

found 3' 17 times its volume of hydrogen, carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, and

nitrogen occluded in the meteoric iron of Augusta Co., Virginia, it occurred

to the author that it might be possible to detect in the gas of these irons the

unknown gaseous elements assumed to be present in the solar corona and

chromosphere. The investigation was undertaken with the hope that the

spectroscope would reveal them, if present, although their small amount or

peculiar characters might render their detection by ordinary chemical methods

difficult or impossible.

  A vacuum-tube of the form ordinarily employed in spectroscopic work was

attached to a branch of the exhaust-tube of a Sprengel j)ump, and a prelimi-

nary examination was made of the lines exhibited by this tube after simple

withdrawal of the air. As Pliicker and Hittorf J have already shown, lines
of hydrogen and bands due to carbon make their appearance as soon as the

limit of exhaustion has been attained the author noticed the red hydrogen

higher degree of rarefaction was attained. Mercury lines, varying in bright-

were directed to an examination of the gases of the great Texas meteorite

preserved in the Mineral Collection of Yale College, and the meteoric iron of

Tazewell Co. and Arva, Hungary (pp. 247, 248). The iron was in very small
particles (chips produced by the borer), and the exhaustion was proceeded

with without application of heat. He noticed that the iron gave off a por-

Wright did not measure the amount of gas removed by the pump, but has

calculated this quantity from an observation of the degree to which 1 cub.

way the mixed gases extracted to have occupied 4-75 times the volume
of the metal. While this exceeds the quantity which Graham and Mallet

he used having been in a fine state of division.

      --1812, August 5th. Chantonnay, De'p. do la Vende'e, France*.

    In the winter of 1874 Tschcrmak published a paper on the structure of the

meteorites of Orvinio and Chantonnay, which appear to have many characters
in common. Sections of the latter stone, three drawings of which are given
in his paper, show it to be made up of chondritic fragments, covered -with a

dark-coloured crust, and cemented together with a black and in places semi-
vitreous material. The fragments are not very abundantly provided with
spherules, although large ones are here and there met with. It differs from
the chondritc of the Orvinio meteorite in containing less iron ; a section shows
olivine, bronzite, a finely fibrous translucent mineral, as well as nickel-iron
and maguctic pyrites. The presence of chromite was not recognized. Fiae
black veins of a mineral traverse the fragments here and there, and are con-
nected with the cementing material. Similar veins are noticed in the me-
teorites of Lissa, Kakowa, Chateau Renard, Alessandria, and Pultusk ; and
in the Lissa and KakoAva stones they present the appearance as if the me-
teorite had originally come in contact with a molten material which had been
injected into the clefts of its surface, lieicheubaeh was of opinion that the
black veins were directly and intimately connected with the fused surface
his view, however, is open to question, from the fact that the interior of a

meteorite has usually a low temperature when it reaches the earth's surface.
Moreover, in the case of the Chantonnay stone, clefts are to be met with into

which the black matter of the crust has penetrated to a depth of 6 mUlims.

only, although the cleft remains partly open. The black semivitreous magma

consists of an entirely opaque mass, enclosing flakes of the silicate -which
forms the fragments, as well as occasional spherules.

   Although Eammelsbcrg, who analyzed this stone, does not describe the phy-

sical characters of the material he operated on, and did not separately examine
the fragments and the cementing material, as Tschermak has done in his exami-
nation of the Or-vinio meteorite, Tschermak points out that the two meteorites

have much the same composition, and differ mainly in the proportion of iron.
The characters observed in these two meteorites point to the conclusion that

they did not originally possess their present constitution, but that by the dis-
integration of a solid rock-mass and its subsequent cementation with a semi-

vitreous magma they attained their present appearance. Though they

resemble somewhat the eruptive breccias, they differ from them in that the
meteoric cementing material is less homogeneous, and encloses compact flakes
of the rock itself. The Chantonnay stone exhibits the fine texture observed
in some metamorphosed breccias. The two stones convey to us evidence of
changes which must have occurred on the solid surface of some planet that
was subseqiiently reduced to fragments.

   The chromium oxide present as chromite is not mentioned at aU in the
above analysis. The iron sulphide is probably present as troilitc (iron mono-

sulphide mica, according to the older analysis). The greater part of the sul-
phur is in the part which is not attracted by the magnet. There the ratio is
given as Fe=3-92, S=2-04; the percentages for troilite, using the sulphur

as the basis for the calculation, would be re=3-57, S=2-04, and for mag-

=netic pyrites Pe=3-12, S 2-04.

   In a courteous letter received from the author he informs me that the

amount of vanadium present was too small to allow of a quantitative estima-

tion being made. He believes that in amount it is about half that met with

in the trap-rocks of Auvergne, which have recently been examined by him.

He is inclined to the belief that the vanadium is present as an oxide associated
with the chromite, " for we know vanadium occurs in terrestrial chrome-iron

in comparatively large quantities."

The iron which is found disseminated in small particles throughout the

mass of many meteoric stones represents in miniature the huge blocks of me-

teoric iron that from time to time have been met with on many pauts of the

earth's surface, the record of the fall of which is unknown, their descent

having probably taken place at an epoch long anterior to that of their discoverj'.

AVhile the stones enclosing iron have not unfrequently been seen to fall, the

descent of purely metallic masses has been rarely witnessed. At present we

--know of only the following few authentic cases : Agram (1751), Braunau

(1847), Victoria West, S. Africa (1862), NidiguUam, Madras (1870), and

Marysville (1873). To these few instances is to be added the one heading

this element in a meteoric iron. The gas extracted from this iron by A. W.
AVriglit, who has recently examined the occluded gases of the irons of Texas,

Arva, and Tazewell Co., as well as that of the meteorite of West Liberty, Iowa
(which sec), has nearly twice the volume of the metal operated upon, although

this is probably a portion only of that actually present. It is composed of :

  A question of no slight interest in regard to the changes which meteoric

irons undergo during their passage through the atmosphere is whether their

surface becomes fused. Prom his study of the Tennessee meteorite, Dr. Smith
has decided it in the negative. The fact of the delicate reticulated surface

having been preserved is a proof that the heat, instead of having been raised

to a high temperature on the surface, has quickly been conducted away into

the mass of the metal. Had fusion of the superficial layer taken place, the

meteorite would have been coated with molten oxide.
   The author finds in this fact a confirmation of his theory that the Ovifak

masses are not of meteoric origin.

                                                                               --1840. Szalnicza, Arva, Hungary*.

For his investigation by means of the spectroscope of the gases occluded by

meteoric iron, Wright examined those from the Ked Eiver, Texas, and Taze-

well Co., Tennessee (which see below).

The amount of carbon present in the former iron was found on chemical

Aexamination to be very small ; in the latter none was detected.                                                        series of

experiments were therefore made with the above iron, which, according to

Liiwet, contains a larger amount of carbon. While it was an easy task to

remove fragments of the above-mentioned irons, great difficulties were ex-

perienced in the present case, the metal having nearly the hardness of steel.

When the tube containing fragments of this iron was exhausted, and before

heat was applied to it, the spectroscope indicated the presence in the " vacuum-

tube" of both hydrogen and carbon gases; the lines of the former element

were very brilliant, and the first, second, and third bands of the latter,

counting from the red end, were visible. The application of a heat hardly

suificient to pain the hand caused an entire change in the appearance of the

vacuum-tube                                                   the broad part took a greenish hue, while in         the  spectroscope

stage of the operation was found on analysis to consist of hydrogen, carbonic
oxide, and carbonic acid, the latter amounting to three or four per cent.

    In some experiments on artificial soft iron the author obtained a spectium

in every way similar to that of the meteoric metals ; the hydrogen lines did

not appear so early nor were they so bright as in the latter instances.
    The iron of this meteorite, which by its great hardness was separated in

the state of fine powder, yielded, when heated at different temperatures up to
low redness, 44 times its volume of gas. While it seems not improbable that
some portion of what has been occluded gas may have been atmospheric air,
the yield is so unusually large that it suggests the question, May not the more

perfect removal of the gas from the iron be due to the fine state of division of
tlie metal operated upon? In the case of the Texas and Tazewell irons,
Avhere the yield of gas exceeded that obtained from the Lenarto and Augusta
Co. irons, the metals were in very small pieces, which would favour a more
refined and complete evolution of the gas ; in the last-mentioned instances

they were en bloc. That iron may under certain conditions, as when deposited

by electrolysis, take up nearly two hundred and fifty times its volume, has

been shown by the recent researches of M. Cailletet*. An observation re-

cently made has a bearing on this question, "WhUc analyzing a specimen of
silver amalgam, I endeavoured to remove from a weighed fragment of tho
mineral the mercury by heating the specimen in a hard glass tube for more
than five minutes in the flame of the table blowpipe. The silver immediately

fused and remained during that time in a molten state. When cold, the

globule of metal was flattened into a plate, and having cut it into strips and
subjected it to a second heating, I succeeded in removing a considerable part
of a per cent, of mercury from it.

   Wright's researches on the gases of meteoric irons have shown a varying
character in theox}-gen and nitrogen lines when in the presence of hydrogen,
and the near coincidence of two of them with prominent lines in the corona,
with the possible coincidence of a third line, which appears to indicate that
the characteristic lines in the coronal spectrum are due, not so much to the
presence of otherwise unknown elements, as to hydrogen and the atmospheric
gases oxygen and nitrogen.

   The observations were made with a spectroscope of six prisms with a re-

peating prism, giving the dispersion of twelve in all.

    This meteorite was one of those selected by the author for his investigation
with the spectroscope of the gases occluded by meteoric iron (see also the
meteorites of Eed Eivcr, Texas, and Arva, Hungary). It is noted for the
large amount of nickel, 14-62' per cent., which it contains; it had been exa-

mined by J. L. kSmith %, who found no carbon in it. As in the case of the

Texas meteorite, this iron appears to evolve gas before heat is applied ; the
red and green hydrogen lines were brilliant, while the bands of carbon were

not noticed. When heat was applied, the spectrum showed the hydrogen

lines very brilliantly, and the four chief carbon bands in great strength. As
the tension of the gas decreased, the hydrogen lines became relatively stronger,
and the carbon bands grew narrower ; and at 1 milUm. these bands were still
prominent, and some narrow bands, apparently belonging to nitrogen, were

intensities from those observed with nitrogen alone. One of the lines appeared

to coincide Avith the chief eoromd line 1474 K, although not so sharp as the

latter appears in the solar spectrum. An oxygen line likewise observed has

Kthe position 14G2 very nearly, and falls very near the position assigned to

a bright coronal line by Denza and Lorenzoni when observing the eclipse of

+distinct, has the position 1359 1 K. The author directs attention to the

complete change which the spectrum of an air-tube undergoes by the intro-

duction of hydrogen. According to the method by which Wright calculates

the amount of gas present in an iron (see the meteorite of the lied Eiver,

Texas, above), "this metal occludes 4-G9 times its volume of mixed gases.

Although the greater part of the gas had been removed, the author is of

opinion that the whole amount was by no means exhausted. The fact of the

volume of gas in this instance being in excess of that obtained by Graham and

Mallet probably arises from the Tazewell iron having been in a finely divided

state.    --1871, Spring of. Koda, Province of Huesca, Spain*.

   The exact date of the fall of this meteorite is not given, but it is stated to
have occurred during the spring of 1871 , at a spot two kilometres fi-om Eoda.

Two fragments in the possession of Pisani weigh about 200 grammes, aud

appear to have formed the half of a stone which was of the size of a fist. It

where this species of lustrous varnish has run. The interior is ashy grey,
with greenish grains resembling peridot (some several millimetres in diameter)
scattered throughout the mass. The grey surface is, however, not of a uni-
form tint, but presents two irregularly shaped areas, one being grey, the other
yellowish grey. The stone is very friable, and has no action on the magnetic
needle. Before the bloA\inpe it is fusible, becoming black and feebly magnetic.

    Only a small portion, 14-75 per cent., of the meteorite is broken up by acid,
that unacted upon amounting to 85-97 per cent. Below are given, in addi-
tion to the composition of the constituents separated by acid, tbe results of an
analysis of the minerals constituting the mass of the stone :

   The soluble portion appears to be an iron olivine, mixed probably with a

little anorthite ; the insoluble portion consists chiefly of bronzite, or, accord-

ing to Pisani, probably hypersthene, with the specific gravity of which mineral
that of the meteorite more closely accords. The sulphur and the chromium
are, it is presumed, present as magnetic pyrites and chromite ; no nickel

   These numbers indicate, according to Pisani's view, the presence of a hy-
persthene rather than a bronzite, a hypersthene richer in iron than that of
Tarsund, Norfray. The ratio of iron oxide to magnesia is the same as that
in the bronzites of the Haiuholz, Shalka, Borkut, and several other meteorites.

   On some grains of this mineral a well-marked cleavage was distuignished

along one direction ; in others a disposition to cleave along a second direction

was remarked : on examining such fragments in the polarizing microscope,
however, one of the optic axes was almost always seen, while the other is in-
visible. The angle of the optic axes, as measured in oil, was approximately
determined, malcing 2H=104°. The bisectrix is negative ; but whether it
was the acute or obtuse bisectrix was not determined.

   This meteorite is remarkable for containing no metallic iron, and a very
large proportion of bronzite or hypersthene.

   Daubree, during an examination of microscopic sections, noted many cha-

racters which favour the assumption that the chief constituent of this meteo-

--rite is bronzite rather than hypersthene. Such are : the absence of dichroism,

the frequent occurrence of the right angle iu the contour of the crystals, and

the fineness of the striae, peculiar to bronzite. When magnified 800 diameters,

most of the crystals are found to enclose yellowish brown rarely translucent
matter, with very varied contour, and occasionally with a crystaUiue form,
that of a modified oblique prism, which is that of pyroxene. They are ranged
in rectilinear series, which are not always orientated parallel to the axes of
the crystal. Here and there, adhering to the crystals, a brown vitreous sub-
stance, which is without action on polarized light, is seen ; and iu it occur
cavities of relatively large dimensions, closely resembling those usually found
iu basaltic rocks. The Eoda meteorite, with the single exception that it
contains no iron, bears a great likeness to the meteorite of Lodran (1868,
October 1st), and establishes a new link between cosmical rocks and those

belonging to our planet. If, says Daubree, we were to refuse to admit the
testimony of those persons who afiirm that they witnessed the fall of this

fragment of rock, the characters of its crust would fully attest its cosmical

  A meteor was seen at daybreak by many observers in tlie provinces of

Rome, Umbria, Abruzzo, and Terra di Lavoro. At first it appeared like a

large star of a red colour. It increased in brilliancy as it traversed the sky iu a

northerly direction, leaving a white train. At a certain point it became brilli-
antly white, and then vanished, a luminous cloud remaining, which was visible
for a quarter of an hour. The meteor appears to have crossed the coast-line at a
point near Terracina, to have passed over Piperno in a direction 7°W. of N., and,
moving N.N.E.over Cori and Geunazzano,to have explodedover the latter town.
After the lapse of two to three minutes, two reports were heard, the first like
that of a cauTion, the second like a series of from three to six guns fired in
rapid succession. The greater part of the stone fell at Orvinio, over which

placo the second explosion appears to have taken place, and some fragments

were carried farther northward.

    Six fragments of the meteorite, weighing collectively 3-398 kilogs., have

--been found : No. 1, weighing 4| grammes, fell with a hissing noise near a

peasant at Gerano ; No. 2, weighing 92 grammes, foil at La Scarpa, Avithin

ten metres of a farmer, who picked it up while hot ; No. 3, weighing

622 grammes, was found two or three days after the fall a few centimetres

below the surface, in a stubblod field at Pezza del Meleto, between Orvinio

and Pozzaglia ; No. 4, 1242-5 grammes in weight, was found a week after

the fall, close to Orvinio : the grass around it had been somewhat singed

No. 5, weighing 432 grammes, was picked up a week after the full at

Pezza del Moleto ; No. G, weighing 1003 grammes, was found on the 8th

of May, 200 metres distant from No. 4, at a very trifling depth, while

turning up the soil of a field.

   At the time of the fall a man was passing the spot where fragments num-

bered 4 and 6 wore found. Immediately after the explosion, he heard the

sound of a heavy body striking the earth, and he fell on the ground with fear.

At the same time, or a little later, a fire broke out in a barn filled with hay

in the village of Affile, and the occurrence was, with general consent, ascribed

to the meteorite.

In September 1873 Keller learnt that two more small fragments had fallen

near the village of Anticoli Corradi. The one fell near two boys who were

tending cattle. They became alarmed at the hissing noise, and believing this

projectile to be aimed by the devil, they picked it up, and threw it far away

from them. The other stone was observed to fall on the bare rock, and to

break in pieces. The fragments were collected ; but as they were held to be

of no value, they were subsequently lost. In the case of this aerolite, as in

that of others, the smaller appear to have fallen before the larger fragments.

The velocity of this fall must have been very slow. The authors do not

--state whether any of the fragments could be fitted together ; their specific

gravity ranged between 3-58 and 3*73 in one, richer in metallic constituents,

it amounted to 4-598. Two of the fragments bear portions of the crust lying

in pits and hollows. It is only | milhm. thick, has a pitch-black colour, and

exhibits in some places a waxy lustre. The mass of the stone is of a lead-

grey colour, being darker than that of the aerolites of Pultusk and Monte

AMilone.  polished surface exhibits metallic grains, some 2 millims. in dia-

meter, and a green silicate, probably oli-sine. The ground-mass appears to be

made up of two minerals, one clear and uniform, the other dull and less

homogeneous. The stone acts powerfully on the magnet.

In Ferrari's memoir is given a plan of the country near Rome, on which

is indicated the track of the meteor and the positions where the stones fell.
The line of flight, a singularly devious one, is seen to pass immediately over
the summits of M. Leano, M. Sempreviso, M. Lapone, and quite near to that
of M. Geunaro, the chief mountains of the district, and suggests (although

obviously only by appearance) the gravitating action of these more elevated

Amasses of the earth's surface on the path of the meteor.  sketch of the

latter, the trajectory of which is computed to have been inclined 27° to the

plane of the horizon, accompanies the map.

The paper of M. Lc Chevahor Michel-Etienne do Rossi gives the aiialysis

and observations of Prof. BeUucci, of Perugia. "When heated to 120° the
powdered mineral lost 1-875 per cent., and by treatment with water a httle

and acid 45-04 per cent. The analysis of a portion of the stone gave

= =1-07, iron=25-59, iron oxide {fer oxide)= 4-S2, sulphur 2-24, nickel

with trace of cobalt = 1-37, with traces of calcium, chromium, manganese,
arsenic, and phosphorus. Two points are worthy of remark in this analj'sis :

hrst, the astonishingly large amount of alumina present, far in excess of that
found in any other meteorite. In the absence of a second and confirmatory

analysis, it may be assumed that insufficient ammonium chloride was cm-
ployed, and the greater portion of the 1G-S4 per cent, is magnesia, which was

precipitated with the alumina. Secondly, the occurrence of arsenic, which
is of extreme rarity in a meteorite ; it is stated to he present in the iron of
Braunau and the olivine of the Atacama siderolito.

    Tschermak's report of his examination of this stone appeared in the winter

of 1874. The structure developed on cutting the stone is unusual and re-
markable, consisting of light-coloured fragments (I.), surrounded by a compact
dark cementing material (II.). The fonner arc yellowish grey, enclose sphe-
rules and particles of iron and magnetic pyrites, are, in fact, normal chon-
drite, and resemble the mass of the stone which fell at Seres, in Macedonia
(1818, June). The latter encloses numerous particles of iron and magnetic
pyrites, for the most part uniformly distributed ; the portion neai'est the en-
closed fragments bears very distinct indications of having been at one time
fluid, and convcj's the impression that this cementing material was at one
time in a plastic condition while in motion. Along the boundary of these two
very dissimlar portions flaws are seen, in which nickel-iron has crystallized
in delicate plate-like forms ; and here, moreover, the fragments are darker,
harder, and more brittle than those of the centre, which argues the exposure
of the cementing material to a very high temperature while in a plastic con-
dition. Both portions have nearly the same density and apparently the same
chemical composition and mineral characteristics. The Orvinio stone re-
sembles, in fact, certain brccciated volcanic rocks, which consist of a groimd-
mass through which granular fragments of the same rock are distributed, as
when older crystalline lavas are interpenetrated by others more compact and
of a more recent period.

   The light-coloured fragments are, as has been stated, chondritic ; the sphe-
rules are usually of one kind, lying in a splintery matrix of the same mineral,

containing some nickel-iron and magnetic pyrites. Among the transparent

constituents, olivine is recognized by its imperfect cleavage ; a second mineral,
Avith a distinct cleavage along a prism of nearly quadratic section, is evidently

bronzite ; while a third, which occurs in fine foliated or fibrous particles, may

be either identical with the above or be a felspathic ingredient.
    The meteoric rocks possessing chondritic structure arc regarded by Tschcr-

mak as tufas which have undergone detrition, and their spherides to be such

particles as, by their superior toughness, have, during the trituration of the
rock, instead of breaking up into splinters, acquired a rounded form.

   A black material is observed to coat the fragments of the rock and to fill

the finer flaws existing between them, whereby their transparent character
is considerably impaired ; this has also been noticed in the meteorite of Tad-
jcra (1867, June 9th).

    The dark-coloured cementing material contains two ingredients : an opaque
semivitreous constituent, and particles in every way similar to the dark crust

of the fragments from which they may probably have been detached ; many

of them can still be recognized as olivine and bronzite. The nickel-iron and
magnetic pyrites of this portion of the stone are more finely divided than

in the fragments, and have often a rounded form. The metal of this portion,
as -w^ell as in the other, exhibits no Widmannstiittian figures ; but in both, by
treatment -with acid, lines are developed like those of the Braunau iron.

   The two species of rock, the chondritic fragments (I.) and tlie darker ce-
menting material (II.), have the follcwing composition :
254. REPORT--1875.

peculiarities are perceived in meteorites which, as strongly as the preva-

lence of metallic ingredients, contribute to distinguish them from terres-
trial volcanic rocks. The early detection of olivine, and the separation of
augitc and (?) labradorite or anorthite (a felspar), in the mcteorito of Juvinas,
succeeded more lecently by the distinction of enstatite and olivine aa the
major constituents of stony meteorites, and finally (steps which we owe to the
chemical separation aiul skilful detection of tliese minerals by Maskclyne
with the polarizing microscope) the recognition of enstatite and its ferro-
magnesian variety bronzite as the iisual representatives of the " insoluble,"
combined with the basic mineral olivine as the " soluble " silicate entering into
their ordinary composition, forms the substructure upon which the chemical
analogy of their composition with terrestrial basalts in the many varieties
which are met with among the class of stony meteorites is at present based.

A system of structural classification according to the amount and mode of

dissemination of the metalhc iron, devised by Daubrc'e for the totality of
meteorites, and the distinction of " chondritic '" structure in aerolites or in
the stony portions of a great number of meteorites by Reichenbach, forms, on
the other hand, a ground-plan upon which their mineralogical description and

--microscopical examination are conducted, all aerolites and stony parts of

meteorites (with exception, perhaps, more or less, of the carbonaceous

aerolites) not of this description consisting in general of finely brecciated,
splintered and shapeless, cemented or otherwise consolidated crystalline
fragments, those aerolites being termed chondritic which enclose scattered

through their mass a number of rounded grains or si^herules. To these
ordinary characters of structure and composition many subordinate features
are also frequently superadded, as the presence of graphite, troilite, and mag-
netic pyrites, magnetite, chromite, schrcibersite, and of some rarer but equally
distinct minerals, as azmanitc, oldhamite, &c., and of gases occluded in the

metallic portions of the stones ; and, again, the crystalline structure of the

latter portions, as exhibited in Widmanstattian figures by etching their cleanly
polished surfaces with mercuric chloride or with dilate acids, together with
the vitreous or crystalline characters of the spheres or fragments and of the
cement composing the non-metallic portions of the meteorite, in the detection
of which thin sections of it are employed, and both the microscope and its
powerful auxiliary polarized light lend important aid. In all these methods
of interrogation and of systematic description great progress has recently been
made, to describe at length the various results of which would here occupy
too large a space. The sul)jcct has been ably handled by Dr. Flight in a
series of articles in the ' Geological Magazine ' of the present year (January-
xVugust, 1875), and more than a reference to its copious information in a

fifteen years' recapitulation of the united progress of similar investigations
need not be offered in this Eepoit as a sufficient recommendation for its perusal.

As a separate treatise on the subject to which its further Parts are intended

to contribute, it maj^ be indicated as the source in which, since the close in

the year 1860 of Dr. Buchner's chronological work on ' Meteorites,' students
of this department of science (at least in the English language) will find the
readiest assistance for their information and guidance in the recent abundant

development of these inquii'ies.

tions during the past year of a great number and variety of meteoric products.
In addition to those above described of the meteorites of Orvinio, Roda,
 Lodran, Adarc, and of several meteoric irons, the leading particulars of which
are given, some recent observations by Nordenskjold on snow-dust gathered
 from the neves of various climates are noticed, with its probable relation to
meteor-dust in the atmosphere and to the blue colour of glacier -ice. The
whole of these short abstracts, occupying several pages of the printed volume,
arc full of concise and itseful information on the advance and progress which
have been made in the various departments of meteoric mineralogy during

the brief interval of the past year.

   A speculative paper on the origin of meteorites by Dr. G. Tschermakf

expresses very clearly the author's views on the present aspects of knowledge
regarding their history, and presents a number of important remarks on their
formation. The spectroscope has conhrraed the earlier conjectures, derived
from a study of meteorites, of a prevailing similarity of materials in the che-

mical elements of the hcavcnty bodies ; and from the forms of meteorites it may

be expected that a knowledge of the processes to which they have been sub-

jected may be derived. Apart from their minute internal structure, it is

certain that externally thc}^ are acutely angular fragments, evidently of a

large planetary mass, and (as shown by the crystalline structure of meteoric
irons and by sliding faces in some aerolites) of a large cosmical body where
uniform temperature and long periods of tranquillity have prevailed. Their

internal structure, exactly analogous to that of our volcanic tufas, is another
evidence of the same conclusion ; and Daubree regards collisions or explosions

of such large cosmical bodies as the origin from which they sprang. But as
their proportions are always diminutive or dust-like in comparison to the parent-
l)odies, explosive rather than disruptive agencies, or projectile forces acting
from within outwards locally upon the bodies, appear to have ushered their
ejected fragments into cosmical revolutions. With regard to their internal
structure, a further acquaintance with these " star-masses " before their dis-
integration is afforded to us by a close examination. Their porous materials,
made up of pulverized rocks, were correctly pronounced by Haidinger to be

volcanic products, which may be characterized as meteoric tuffs. Spherular
forms are of widely sjiread occurrenc* among their triturated grains, quite
round and unconformably crystallized with regard to their figure, when the

materials are tough, and varying in size from microscopic dust to that of small
bird-shot or milbt-seeds ; round fragments as large as a cherry are of rare
occurrence ; but in the volcanic rocks of our globe they ordinarily occur in
sizes varying from that of a hazel-nut to that of a bead. Kumberless small

volcanic fissures, it may be conjectured, contribute to their ejection ; and in no
meteorites do we trace the appearance of slag-like rock enclosing well-deve-
loped crystals which their formation from lava would lead us to expect. An

example of a true crater of explosion without ejection of lava is furnished by
the Eifel ; and in planetary bodies, where evolutions of occluded gases play a
prominent part in the disturl)ances of the surface, the projection of such frag-

ments as we find in meteorites from active volcanic craters may not be an

unnatural or altogether improbable hypothesis of the kind of action of phy-

sical forces concerned in their formation,

--256 REPORT 1875.

   In the ' Astronomischc Nachrichten' (No. 2064), Herr N. v. Ivonkoly de-
scribes results of some spectroscopic observations of tbo PerscVds of August
187-4, examined by means of a Browning's meteor-spectroscope. The spectra
of 130 meteors on the nights of the 7th, 8th, and 10th to 12th of August, vary-
ing in brightness from 1st to -tth magnitude stars, showed continuous colours,
yellow and green predominating chiefly in all the nuclei, violet being always
and indigo mostly absent, and red only bright in those which were markedly
red-coloured. The spectra of the streaks were very various, those of di-
stinctly yellow meteors showing only the double yellow line of sodium (always
present in the streaks, and serving as a micrometric zero from which the
positions of the other bright lines could be relatively estimated). In the streak-
spectra of green meteors the green lines of magnesium were also visible ; and
in some of red colour red lines, apparently those of strontium, or of strontium
and lithium, were observed. Some of these meteors were brighter than
Venus, and left streaks which lasted for 30 or 40 seconds. The streak of one
which remained visible for 15G seconds was observed with the spectroscope
for 30 seconds. Not only the bright lines of sodium and magnesium, but

many other bright lines, especially in the green, and some also in the blue,

were seen, which were regarded as probably due to the presence of iron and
 copper in the substance of the streak ; a cotton-ball dipped in alcohol and in-
 flamed, having particles of sodium, magnesium, and ii'on with very little copper

in its fibres, exhibited, when tossed into the air, a very similar spectrum, while

 no other combination tried produced a similar effect.
    The following important paper by Dr. G. Tschermak on the meteorites of

 Lance (1872, July 23rd) in the fifth volume (pt. i. Jan. 1875) of his 'Minera-
 logische Mittheiluugen,' shows that (as was found by Daubree in the meteorites
 of Aumale, 1865, Aug. 25th) aerolites that fell about the period of the August
 meteor-shower have more than once presented the rare occurrence of sodium
 chloride in their composition. The appearance and general course pursued
 by this fireball is described with imusual completeness in a work by M.
 Nouel*, of Vendome, in the neighbourhood of which town the meteorites fell
 and the fireball was very generally observed.

     Dr. Tschermak's paper treats of the chemical analysis and of the micro-
 scopic examination of thin sections of the stone ; and besides eleven admi-
 rable lithographic representations of the latter, it contains three plates of the
  external appearance of the largest of the stones (found in three pieces at the
 bottom of a hole Ik metre deep) from difterent points of view, the directions

 of the slag-fibres on its crust showing clearly how the fj-ont or pyramidal

 part and back or flattened base of the stone had been differently exposed to

 tlie rushing and smelting blast of heated air through which it forced its way
 point foremost with apparently only one or two slight oscillations. The draw-

  ings of thin sections exhibit ' microscopic views of spherules of great variety,
  of a clear olivine crystal, and of one {the onJij unrounded one observed) of

 bronzite. Among the spherules a remarkable one of bronzite is immediately

  recognized by the numberless cleavages and cross cleavages exliibited by its
  structurally prismatic crystal. Other spherules are of transparent olivine with-
  out radial structure ; and some are of highly composite characters, appearing
  occasionally to have been incrusted or metamorphosed externally and con-
  centrically to a certain depth, but found by polarized light to possess only

  apparent radial and in reality excentrical crystalline structure when sub-

mitted to this test. The spherules do not exceed 1 millim. in diameter. Iron
and iron sulphide are disseminated tlirough both the spherules and pulverized
ground mass, the latter compound sometimes forming grains and spherules
about which metallic iron has incrusted, and conversely ; and the general

character of the meteorites is that of the minutely chondritic class.

can also be sublimed from them in a hydrogen atmosphere at a red heat ; and
the presence of a trace of copper can be detected by the aid of a spectroscope.

and iron pyrites (14'28 per cent., no troilite or iron monosulphide, it appears,
occurring in this aerolite), and 1-36 per cent, of sodic chloride and hygroscopic
water, there was found 42-4-i per cent, of silicates soluble, and 33-3-lr per

And if (under tlie foregoing restriction of only 4 bands from a carbon-atom)
we connect with each carbon-atom the greatest possible number of hydrogen-
atoms (as shown in the diagrams by the affixed numerals), we see that the

number of hydrogen-atoms is 12 (=2'5-(-2), and we have thus the repre-

sentations of three different paraffines, C. H^^. It should be observed that
the tree-symbol of the parafflne is completely determined by means of the
tree formed with the carbon-atoms, or say of the carbon-tree, and that the

question of the determination of the theoretic number of the paraffines
C,, H2,,_|.2 is consequently that of the determination of the number of the car-
bon-trees of n knots, viz. the number of trees with n knots, subject to the
condition that the number of branches from each knot is at most =4.

    In the paper of 1857 (which contains no application to chemical theory)
the number of branches from a knot was unlimited and moreover the trees

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

   To count the trees on tlie principle first referred to, we require the notions

of " centre " and " biceutre," due, I believe, to Sj'lvcster ; and to establish

these we require the notions of "main branch" and "altitude": viz. in a

tree, selecting- any knot at pleasure as a root, the branches which issue from
the root, each with all the branches that belong to it, are the main branches,
and the distance of the furthest knot, measured by the number of iuterme-

      WV

diate branches, is the altitude of the main branch. Thus in the left-hand

Afigure, taking as the root, there are 3 main branches of the altitudes 3, 3,

Arespectively : in the right-hand figure, taking                         as the root, there are 4

main branches of the altitudes 2, 2, 1, 3 respectively ; and we have then the

theorem that in every tree there is either one and only one centre, or else

one and only one bicentre ; viz. we have (as in the left-hand figure) a centre

A which is such that there issue from it two or more main branches of alti-

tudes equal to each other and superior to those of the other main branches

(if any); or else (as in the right-hand figure) a hieentre AB, viz. two contigu-

Aous knots, such that issuing from (but not counting AB), and issuing from

B (but not counting BA), wo have two or more main branches, one at least

Afrom and one at least from B, of altitudes equal to each other and superior

to those of the other main branches in question (if any). The theorem once

understood, is proved without difficulty : we consider two terminal knots,

the distance of which, measured by the number of intermediate branches, is

greater than or equal to that of any other two terminal knots ; if, as in the

Aleft-hand figure, the distance is even, then the central knot is the centre

of the tree ; if, as in the right-hand figure, the distance is odd, then the two

ABcentral knots  form the bicentrc of the tree.

HIn the former case, observe that if G, are the two terminal knots, the

Adistance of which is =2\, then the distance of each from is = X, and there

Acannot be any other terminal knot I, the distance of which from is greater

Hthan X (for if there were, then the distance of I from G or else from would

be greater than 2\) ; there cannot be any two terminal knots I, J, the dis-

tance of which is greater than 2X ; and if there are any two knots I, J, the

distance of which is =2\, then these belong to different main branches, the

A =distance of each of them from being X ; whence, starting with I, J (in-

Astead of G, H), we obtain the same point as centre. Similarly in the

latter case there is a single bicentre AB.

Hence, since in any tree there is a unique centre or bicenti-e, the question

of finding the number of distinct trees with n knots is in fact that of finding

the number of centre- and bicentre-trees -^ith n knots ; or say it is the problem

of the " general centre- and biceutre-trees with n knots:" general, inasmuch

as the number of branches from a knot is as yet taken to be without limit

or since (as will appear) the number of the biccntrc-trees can be obtained

without difliculty when the problem of the root-trees is solved, the problem

is that of the " general centre-trees -with n knots." It will appear that the

solution depends upon and is very readily derived from that of the foregoing

problem of general root-trees, so that this last has to bo considered, not

only for its own sake, but with a view to that of the centre-trees. And in

each of the two problems we doubly divide the whole system of trees

according to the number of the main branches (issuing from the root or centre

as the case may be), and according to the altitude of the longest main branch

or branches, or say the altitude of tho ti'ce ; so that the problem really is, for

a given number of knots, a given number of main branches, and a given

altitude, to find the number of root-trees, or (as the case may be) centre-

trees.

We next introduce the restriction that the number of brandies from any

knot is equal to a given number at most ; viz. according as this number is

= 2, 3 or 4, we have, say oxygon-trees, boron-trees*, and carbon-trees re-

spectively ; and these are as before root-trees or centre- or bicentre-trees, as

the case may be. Tho case where the number is 2 presents no difficulty : in

fact if the number of knots be =n, then the number of root-trees is either

«=3 =^ (n-f-1) or |«; viz.
                 and » 4, the root-trees are

   * I should have said nitrogen-trees ; but it appears to me that nitrogen is of necessity

."j-valent, as shown by the compound, Ammonium-Chloride, =NH4 CI : of course the word

boron is used simply to stand for a .S-Talent' element.

=and the inimber of centre- or biccntre-trees is al\vays l : viz. n odd, there ia

one centre-tree ; and n even, one biccntre-trce ; it is only considered as a par-

=3ticular case of the general theorem. The case where the number is  is ana-

lytically interesting : although there may not exist, for any 3-valeut element,

a series of hydrogen compounds B,, H,,_,_2 corresponding to the paraffiues. The

case -svliero the number is =4, or say the carbon-trees, is that which pre-

sents the chief chemical interest, as giving the paraffines C,, Ho,,^.2 ; and I caU

to mind here that the theory of the carbon-root trees is established as an

analytical result for its own sake and as the foundation for the other case,
but that it is the number of the carbon centre- and bicentre-trees which is

the number of the paraffines.

The theory extends to the case where the number of branches from a knot

= =is at most    any larger number ; but I have not developed the
          5, or

formula.

   I pass now to the analytical theory : considering first the case of general

Nroot-trees, we endeavour to find for a given altitude the number of trees

of a given number of knots w and main branches a, or say the generating

function

where the coefficient il gives the number of the trees in question. And we

assume that the problem is solved for the cases of the several inferior alti-

tudes 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . ]sr-i.

  NThis being so, observe that a tree of altitude can be built up as shown

ill the figure (which I call the edification diagram), by combining one
--or more trees of altitude N" 1 with a single tree of altitude not
-- K =exceeding I^ 1 ; viz. in the figure,
                                            3, we have the two trees

a, b, each of altitude 2, combined (as shown by the dotted lines) with

the tree c of altitude 1 : the whole number of knots in the resulting tree is

the sum of the number of knots on the three trees a, h, c : the number of

main branches is equal to the number of the trees a, h, plus tlie luimber of
                                                                                                 +;

main branches of the tree c. It is to be observed that the tree c may reduce

itself to the tree (.) of one knot and of altitude zero ; but each of the trees
N--a, h, as being of the altitude
                                              1, must contain at least IST knots.

N=2Taking     or any larger number, it is hence easy to see that the re-

quired generating function ^Q.f-x^ is

= (1-^^)-^ (1-a'N+i)-'^ (l-teN+2)-'-' ...[«'··"] (first factor),

              + + + +X {tyc" {t, t-)x^ (t,f, fi)x^ . ..                                (second factor),

where, as regards the first factor, the exponents taken -with reversed sign, that

Nis as positive, are l=no. of trees, altitude -- l,ofX knots; Zj=ditto, same alti-

N +tude, of (N+1) knots; ?.,=ditto, same altitude, of                         2 knots, and so on ; and

where the symbol                    ''  °°    denotes  that  in  the  function     or  product of     factors

                  [i' '                    ]

which precedes it, the tenns to be taken account of are those in f, t-,t^ . . .

=viz. that the term in t°, or constant term ( 1 in fact), is to be rejected.

In the second factor the expressions .v, (t)x-, {t, f) x^, . . . represent (for given

exponents of t, x, denoting the number of main branches and the number of
N--knots respectively) the number of trees of altitude not exceeding
                                                                                                   1 : thus

X, =lfx^ represents the number of such trees, 1 knot, main branch,

=1 + +; and so if the value of (t, f, f, t^)x' be (at+ftt- yf H')x% then for

--trees of an altitude not exceeding IS" 1, and of o knots, a represents the

number of trees of 1 main branch, /3 that of trees of 2 main branches, y that

of trees of 3 main branches, d that of trees of 4 main branches. It is clear

that the number of trees satisfj'ing the given conditions and of an altitude not

Nexceeding -- 1 is at once obtained bj' addition of the numbers of the trees
X--1satisfying the given conditions, and of the altitudes 0,1,2 ...
                                                                                                         ; aU

which numbers are taken to be known.

It is to be remarked that the first factor,

(l-<.r^)-' (l-f,t'N+')-'i {l-ti^+'~y-^ . . [«'··"],

shows by its development the number of combinations of trees a, 6 . . of the

X --altitude  1 ; one such tree at least viust be taken, and the symbol [«'···"=]

+ + +gives effect to this condition : the second factor x (t)x' (t, f) x^ . . shows
X --the number of the trees c of altitude not exceeding
                                                                                       1. And this being

so, there is no difficiilty in seeing how the product of the two factors is the

generating function for the trees of altitude X.

=xIn the case ^=0, the generating function, or GF, is                                       ; viz. altitude 0,

                 ON THE ANALYTICAL FORMS CALLED TREES.                     263

So far we have considered root-trees ; but rcf'erriug to the last diagram, it

is at once seen that the assumed root will be a centre, provided only that

N --(instead of, it may be, only a single tree a of the altitude   1), we take

always two or more trees of the altitude jS"-- 1 to form the new tree of the

altitude N. Aud we give effect to this condition by simply writing in place

of [*'···"] the new symbol [f^"""], which denotes that only the terms

f, f, <* . . . are to be taken account of; viz. that the terms in <" and f are to

N --be rejected. The component trees of the altitude  1 are, it is to be ob-

served, as before, root-trees ; hence the second factor of the generating func-

tion is unaltered : the theorem is that for the centre-trees of altitude N^ we

have the same generating function as for the root-trees, writing only [i^--"]

in place of [i' ·"']. Or, what is the same thing, supposing that the first

fector, unaffected by either symbol, is

             = + + ++l+w''(at fie+ ..) .v''+' (at (3'f+ ...) ..,

then affecting it with [«'·'"] the value for the root-trees is

               +=a.-N (at+l3('+ . . )^-.^^N+' {a't (i'e+ ...)+..,

and affecting it with [f--- "] the value for the centre-trees is

It thus appears how the fundamental problem is that of the root-trees, its

solution giving at once that of the ceutre-trees ; whereas we cannot conversely

solve the problem of the root-trees by means of that of the centre-trees.

As regards the bicentre-trees, it is to be remarked that starting from a

centre-tree of altitude N-|-l with two main branches, then by simply striking

out the centre, so as to convert into a single branch the two branches which

issue from it, we obtain a bicentre-tree of altitude N. Observe that the alti-

tude of a bicentre-tree is measui'ed by that of the longest main branch from

A or B, not reckoning AB or BA as a main branch. Hence the number of
=bicentre-trees, altitude ^N, is number of centre-trees of two main branches,

N +altitude  l.

   This is in fact the convenient formula, provided only the number of centre-

Ntrees of two main branches has been calculated up to the altitude 1-|- ; but
Nwe can find independently the number of bicentre-trees of a given altitude :

the bicentre-tree is in fact formed by taking the two connected points A, B

Neach as the root of a root-tree altitude (the number of knots of the bicentre-

tree being thus, it is clear, equal to the sum of the numbers of knots of the

two root-trees respectively) ; and it is thus an easy problem of combinations

to find the number of bicentre-trees of a given altitude JST. Write

Nas the generating function of the root-trees of altitude ; viz. for such trees,

l=no. of trees with N + 1 knots, /3=no. with N-f-2 knots, and so on;
Nthen the generating function of the bicentre-trees of the same altitude is
264     --REPORT 187b.
where
       ft,=f^s

       y=y + 4/3(/3+l),

and so on ; or, what is the same thing, calling the first generating function <j.a;

+then the second generating function is =J{(f^,v)" ^;(.r-)}.

It will be noticed that the bicentre-trecs are not (as were the centre-trees)

divided according to the number of their main branches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   they might be thus
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

divided according to the sum of the number of the main branches issuing from

the two points of the bicentro respectively ; a more complete division would

be according to the number of main branches issuing from the two points

respectively ; thus wc might consider the bicentrc-trees (2, 3) with 2 main

branches from one point, and 3 main branches from the other point of the

bicentro ; but the whole theory of the bicentre-trees is comparatively easy,

and I do not go into it further.

  We have yet to consider the case of the limited trees where the number of

branches from a knot is equal to a given number at most: to fix the ideas,

say the carbon-trees, where this number is =4. The distinction as to root-

trees and centre- and bicentre-trees is as before, and the like theory applies

to the two cases respectively. Considering first the ease of the root-trees,

Nand referring to the former figure for obtaining the trees of altitude                                                                                                                                                                                                                  from

N --those of inferior altitudes, then the trees a, h . . .oi altitude                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1 must be

=each of them a carbon-tree of not more than (4--1 ) 3 main branches : this

restriction is necessary, inasmuch as if for any such tree the number of main

branches was =4, then there would be from the root of such tree 4 branches
jihis the new branch shown by the dotted line, in all 5 branches ; and simi-

larly, inasmuch as there is at least one component tree a contributing one

=main branch, the number of main branches of the tree c must be (4--1 ) 3

at most : the mode of introducing these conditions will appear in the expla-

nation of the actual formation of the generating functions [see explanation

=4preceding Tables III., IV., &c.]. The number of main branches is                                                                                                                                                                                                                       at

most, and the generating functions have only to he taken up to the terms in

f ; the first factor is consequently in each case affected Avith a symbol [*' ' ' · ^],

denoting that the only terms to be taken account of are those in f, f, f, t^ ;
hence as there is a factor t at least, and the whole is required only up to t\
the second factor is in each case rec[uired only up to t^.

   As regards the centre-trees,' the generating functions have here the same

expressions as for the root-trees, except that instead of the symbol [<^-'*],

we have the symbol [<^ ··''], denoting that in the first factor the only terms

to be taken account of arc those in f, f, t* ; hence as there is a factor f at

least, and the whole is required only up to t\ the second factor is incachcaso

required up to f ; and wc then complete the theory by obtaining the bi-

centre-trees. The like remarks apply of course to the l)oron-trces, number
=3 =2of branches
       at most, and to the oxygen-trees, number                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          at most ; but,

as already remarked, this last case is so simple, that the general method is

applied to it only for the sake of seeing what the general method becomes in

such an extreme case.

  We thus form tlie Tobies, ^Yhich I proceed to explain.

    Table I. of general root-trees is in fact a Table of triple entrj', \-iz. it gives

for anj' given number of knots from 1 to 13 the number of root-trees cor-
responding to any given number of main branches and to any given altitude.
In each compartment, that is for any given number of knots, the totals of the
columns give the number of the trees for each given altitude, and the totals
of the lines give the number of the trees for each given number of main
branches : the corner grand totals of these totals respectively show for each
&given number of knots the -whole number of root-trees :

      viz. knots.... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
      numbers are. . 1 1 2 4 9 20 48 115 286 719 1842 4766 12486

as already mentioned, and which numbers were calculated by an independent

method.
   Table II. of general centre- and bicentre-trees consists of a centre part and

a bicentre part : the centre part is arranged precisel}^ in the same manner as
the root-table. As to the bicentre part, where it will bo observed there is no
division for number of main branches, the calculation of the several columns
is effected by the before-mentioned formula,

thus column 2, we have by Table I. (totals of column 2)

+ + + +<^.v                 Ux' -\-21x'+29x'°+ . .

and thence

'As already mentioned. Table I. is calculated each column by means of a
generating function given as a product of two factors, each of which is ob-
tained from the columns which precede the column in question ; and Table II.,
the centre part of it, is calculated by means of the same generating functions

slightly modified : these generating functions serving for the calculation of
the two Tables are given in the table entitled " kSubsidiary Table for the cal-
culation of the GP's of Tables I. and II.," which immediately follows these

two Tables, and will bo further explained.

I proceed to explain the Subsidiary Table, first in its application to

Table I.

The Subsidiary Table is divided into sections, giving the GF's of the suc-

cessive columns of Table I., each section being given by means of the pre-

ceding columns of Table I. ; for instance, that for column 3 by means of

columns 0, 1, 2 of Table I.

As regards column 0, the Table shows that the GF is =x.

GFAs regards column 1, that the              has a first factor,

                         (l-tx)-\ ={l) + tv + fx' + t\v'+ ...,

which is operated on by the symbol [<'···'"], viz. the constant term (1) is to

=be rejected ; and that it has a second factor, ,v : the product of these, viz.

{tv+t-x:--\-fx^ . . .) X X, is the required GF, the coefficients of which are ac-
cordingly given in column 1 of Table I.

  As regards column 2, it shows that the GF has a first factor,

                         (l-te=)-i (1-tv')-^ (1-te*)-' . . . .,

where the indices --1,-1, -- 1 , . . are the sums of the numbers in column 1,

Table I., which first factor is

                         + +r1 tv^+tx^ .     t \x^+ . .

(and  it  is  as before  to be operated  on  with  [<^ " " °°],                            viz.  the  constant term is to
                                                                                        '

= +be rejected) ; and further, that there is a second factor x+tv- t-x^+ . . .,

the coefficients of which are obtained by summation of the numbers in the

Weseveral lines of columns 0, 1 of Table I.                                                have thence column 2 of

Table I.

  As regards column 3, it shows that the GF has a first factor,

                              (l-te')-i (l-tx*)-'' (1-t.v')-* ....,

-- --where the indices 1, --2, 4 . . are the sums of the numbers in column 2

of Table I., which first factor is

                     =l+tx^+2tx^+U'3:'+ ( Qt\cc^+ ...

(and it is as before to be operated on with [i^""°°], viz. the constant term is
to be rejected) ; and that there is a second factor

                            te^+y t \x^+ / t \ x*-\- . . .,

the coefficients of which are obtained by summation of the numbers in the

several lines of columns 0, 1, 2 of Table I. : we have thence column 3 of

Table I.

   And similarly, by means of columns 0, 1, 2, 3 of Table I., we form the

GF of column 4 ; that is, we obtain column 4 of Table I., and so on in-

definitely.

   To apply the Subsidiary Table to the calculation of the GF!s of Table II.,
                                                                          :

ON THE ANALYTICAL FORMS CALLED TREES.                                     283

the only difference is that the first factors are to be taken without the terms

GFin fi : thus for Table II. column 3, the first factor of the

the second factor being as for Table I.

                                   (+')'

The remaining Tables are Tables III. and IV., oxygen root-trees and

centre- and bicentre-trees, followed by a Subsidiary Table for the calculation

of the GF's : Tables V. and VI., boron root-trees and centre- and bicentre-

trees, followed by a Subsidiary Table ; and Tables VII. and VIII., carbon
root-trees and centre- and bicentre-trees, followed by a Subsidiary Table. The

explanations given as to Tables I., II. and the Subsidiary Table apply

muUitis mutandis to these ; and but little further explanation is required

that given in regard to the Subsidiary Table of Tables III. and IV. shows how

this limiting case comes under the general method. As to the Subsidiary of

Tables V. and VI., it is to be observed that each* line of the Table is calcu-

lated from a column  of  Table V., rejecting the numbers which belong to  f
                                                                                ;

thus Table V., column 4, the numbers are

Aviz. in the columns 2, 3, 4, and the last column are the totals given by

the Tables IV., VI., VIII., and II., and the remaining- numbers of columns

5, 6, 7, 8 have been found by trial ; and in B the several columns are the

differences of the columns of A. The signification is obvious ; for instance,

if the number of knots is =9, then Table A, if valency, or maximum number

of branches from a knot,

Divisors (factor tables) and Tables of Primes), pp. 34^40. The tables there
referred to, such as Chernac, Burckhardt, Dase, Dase and Rosenberg, are
chiefly tables running up to very high numbers (the last of them the ninth

million), wherein to save space multiples of 2, 3, 5 are frequently omitted,

and in some of them only the least divisor is given. It would be for many

purposes convenient to have a small table, going up say to 10,000, showing

m every case all the prime factors of the number. Such a table might be

arranged, 500 numbers in a page, io. some such form as the following ;

390 to 399 : a prime number, e. g. 397, would be sutfieiently indicated by the

absence of any decomposition, or it may be further indicated by an asterisk.

    It may be noticed that in the theory of numbers the decomposition is spe-

--pcially required when the next following number is a prime, viz. that of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1,

p ^being a prime : and that this is given incidentally, for prime numbers
up to 1000, in Jacobi's ' Canon Arithmeticus,' post, No. 20, and up to 15,000

in Reuschle's Tables, V. (a, b, c) post, No. 22.

    2. It may be proper to remark here that any table of a binary form is

really a factor-table in the complex theory connected with such binary form.

+ +Thus in a table of the form rr i^, a number of this form has a factor a hi

V --1 +(i=
as usual) ; and the table in fact shows the complex factor a bi

of the number in question : a well arranged table would give all the prime

+complex factors a bi of the number. But as to this more hereafter ; at pre-

sent we are concerned with the real theory only, not with any complex theory.

3. Connected with a factor-table we have (1) Table of the number of less

relative primes ; viz. such a table would show for every number the number

of inferior integers having no common factor with the number itself. The

formula is a weU-known one :  for  a  number  'N=a°-b^cy .  .        ,  (a,  b,  .  .  .  the  di-
                                                                  .

  =Euler, Op. Arith. Col. t. ii. p. 128; viz. this is 7rl 0, x2=l, . . . ttIOO

=40.

   4. But it would be interesting to have such a table of the same extent with
the proposed factor-table. The table might be of like form ; for instance,

and it would be of still greater interest to have an inverse table showing the

Nvalues of which belong to a given value of ar(N) ; for instance,

succeeding p) is or is not a prime; but the intermediate numbers N+2,

consecutive composites. To obtain in this manner 99 consecutive composites,

2,637,900 ; but in fact the hundred numbers 2,637,901 to 2,638,000 are all

composite.

Legendre, in his 'Essai sur la Theorie des Nombres' (1st edit., 1798;

2nd edit., 1808 ; supplement, 1816 : references to this edition), gives for the

number of primes inferior to a given limit x the approximate formula

23. For a composite number n, if N='nr(n) be the number of integers less

than 11 and prime to it, than if x be any number less than n and prime to

--it, we have x^=l (mod. n). Eut we have in this case no analogue of a

prime root there is no number x, such that its several powers x^, x'-, ....

x^~'^ (mod. n) are all different from unity ; or, what is the same thing, there

is for each value of x some submultiple of N, say N', such that -i;^''=1

W(mod. n). And these several numbers have a least common multiple I,

Nwhich is not =]Sr, but is a submultiple of ; and this being so, then for all

the several values of x, I is said to be the maximum indicator. For instance,

=91 12, N='nT(ii); the numbers less than 12 and prime to it arc 1, 5, 7, 11.

= WWe have (mod. 12) l'=l, 5=^1, 7'=1, ir l, or the values of arc 1,

2, 2, 2; their least common multiple is 2, and we have accordingly 1=2:

viz. x-=l (mod. 12) has the «7(12) roots 1, 5, 7, 11. So n=24, vj{n)=S;
the maximum indicator I is in this case also =2.

  A table of the maximum indicator Ji^l to 1000 is given

   24. It thus appears that for a composite number n, the ^(m) numbers less

^than n and prime to it cannot be expressed as (mod. n) to the power of a

single root ; but for the expression of them it is necessary to employ two

A n=lor more roots.

odd numbers of the equation, x- -- D?/"=4. As remarked in the paper, " Note

sur I'equation x^ --'Dy-= +4, D^s5 (mod. 8)," pp. 369-371, this can be deter-

mined for values of D of the form in question up to D=997 by means of

  An interesting table would be one composed of the first lines of the above

series, viz. a table giving in its successive lines the developments of S, S^ B',

S', &c.

   There are throughout the work a large number of numerical results given
in a quasi-tabular form ; but the collection of these, with independent expla-
nations of the significations of the tabulated numbers, would be a task of

considerable labour.

   37. The forms here referred to present themselves in the various complex

N +theories, thus = «' &% --(a-\-bi)(a -- bi); this means that in the theory
+ Nof the complex numbers a bi (a and b integers) is not a prime, but a

^composite number. It is well known that an ordinary prime number 3,

+mod. 4, is not expressible as a sum cr b'-, being, in fact, a prime in the

^complex theory as well as iu the ordinary one, but that an ordinary prime
number  1, mod. 4, is (in one way only) =rt--f-6-; so that it is in the

^complex theory a composite number. A number whose prime factors are

each of them 1, mod. 4, or which contains, if at all, an even number of

times any prime factor hs 3, mod. 4, can be expressed in a variety of ways

+in the form a" h^ ; but these are all easily deducible from the expressions

the decomposition definite a is taken to be odd.

as a sum of at most 7 cubes ; and further, that every number greater than

but between 13^ and 14* only sixty-four such numbers ; and the author
conjectui-es " that for numbers beyond a certain limit every number can be

composition of forms (although in the mean time established by Gauss), are
not therein taken into account ; for this reason the Legendre's Tables I.
to VIII. relating to quadratic forms, given after p. 480 (thirty-two pages not

numbered), are of comparatively little value, and it is not necessary to refer

to them in detail.

The complete theory was established

Gauss, ' Disquisitioncs Arithmeticae,' 1801.

It is convenient to refer also to the following memoir
Lejeune Dirichlet, "Eecherchos sur diverses applications do 1' Analyse a

la theorie des Nombres," Crelle, t. xix. (1839), pp. 338, as giving a succinct

statement of the principle of classification, and in particular a table of the

characters of the genera of the properly primitive order, according to the

four forms D = PS^ P=l or 3 (mod. 4), and D=2PS^ P=l or 3 (mod. 4)

   46. Gauss must have computed quadratic forms to an enormous extent;

but, for the reasons (rather amusing ones) mentioned in a letter of May 17,
1841, to Schumacher (quoted in Prof. Smith's Report on "The Theory of

JN'umbers," Brit. Assoc. Eeport for 1862, p. 526), he did not preserve his re-

sults in detail, but only in the form appearing in the

" Tafel der Anzahl der Classen biniircr quadratischer Formen," Wevlce, t. ii.

This relates almost entirely to negative determinants, only three quarters

the number of genera and classes, as also the index of irregularity for the

six irregular numbers for quadric forms].

  =4x --675, --2700 is beyond the limits of Arndt's tables, and for this

number the calculation had to be made anew ; the table gives nine classes

(1, d, d') (1, cZj, d^') of the order ip on pp, but it is remarked that there may

possibly be other cubic classes based on a non-primitive characteristic ; the

point was left unascertained.

49. The theory of ternary quadratic forms was discussed and partially esta-

blished by Gauss in the ' Disquisitiones Arithmeticaj.' It is proper to recall

that a ternary quadratic form is either determinate, viz. always positive, such

--as a^+y'^+z", or always negative, such as --x'--i/- z' ; or else it is indeter-

minate, such as x^+y'^ -- z'. But as regards determinate forms, the negative

ones are derived from the positive ones by simply reversing the signs of all

the coefficients, so that it is sufficient to attend to the positive forms ; and

the two cases are practically positive forms (meaning thereby positive deter-

minate forms) and indeterminate forms ; but the theory for positive forms

was first established completely, and so as to enable the formation of tables, in

the work

Seeber, ' Ueber die Eigenschaften der positiven terniiren quadratischen

Formen ' (4to, Freiburg, 1831),

which is reviewed by Gauss in the ' Gott. Gelehrten Anzeigen,' 1831, July 9

(see Gauss, Werke, t. ii. pp. 188-193). The author gives (pp. 220-243) tables

" of the classes of positive ternary forms represented by means of the corre-

Asponding reduced forms" for the determinants 1 to 100.              specimen is

             -- (J;J;J)(J;J:?>

             Zuigeordnete /S, 8,  3\ / 7,                    7, 4\

where it is to be observed that Seeber admits odd coefficients for the terms
in yz, zx, xy ; \-iz. his

             +(^J ^' ^^) denotes ax'+hf- cz'+fyz+gzx+hxy,

and his determinant is

                           -- -- --4fflic af- hg- c7r +fgh.

Also his adjoint form is

51. The theory of binary quadratic forms {a, h, c), with complex coefficients

V --of the form a+/3t (j=   1 as nsual, <x and /> integers), has been studied by

Lejeuuc Dirichlet, Prof. H. J. S. Smith, and possibly others ; but no tables

have, it is believed, been calculated. The calculations would be laborious ; but

tables of a small extent only would be a suiBcient illustration of the theory,

and would, it is thought, be of great interest.

The theory of complex numbers of the last-mentioned form o+/3i, or say of

the niimbers formed with the fourth root of unity, had previously been studied

by Gauss ; and the theory of the numbers formed with the cube roots of unity

+ + =(a+/3w, w" w l 0, o and /j integers) was studied by Eisenstein ; but

the general theory of the numbers involving the nth roots of unity (ii an odd

prime) was first studied by Ivummer. It will be sufiicient to refer to his

memoir,

1845 ;   and Crelle,    t.  xxxv.  (1847), pp.  319-326                                    also  " Ueber die Zer-

N Nif in the complex theory is a prime, then any power of (to fix the ideas

W) N p=23say has no other factors than or N" ; but if                                      (and similarly for
N Whigher values of p), then may be such that, for instance, has complex
N W = N=47factors other than or (for ^5 23,
                                                    is the first value of N, viz.

AT has factors other than 47 and 47") ; say N^ has a complex prime factor A,

^or we have A as an ideal complex factor of N. Observe that by hypo-

Nthesis is not a perfect cube, viz. there is no complex number whose cube

=is A. In the foregoing general statement, made by way of illustration only,

all reference to the complex factors of unity is purposely omitted, and the state-

ment must be understood as being subject to correction on this account.

"What precedes is by way of introduction to the account of Reuschle's

Tables (Berliner Monatsberichte, 1859-60), which give in the different com-

=pplex theories  5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 the complex factors of the

decomposable real primes up to in some cases 1000.

It should be remarked that the form of a prime factor is to a certain ex-

tent indeterminate, as the factor can without injury be modified by aftecting

it with a complex factor of unity ; but in the tables the choice of the repre-

sentative form is made according to definite rules, which are fully explained,

and which need not be here referred to.

   The foregoing synopsis of EeuscUe's tables in the ' Berliner Monatsberichte'
"was written previous to the publication of Eenschle's far more extensive
work. It is allowed to remain, but some explanations which were given
have been struck out, and were instead given in reference to the larger work.

   Reuschle, " Tafeln complexer Primzahlen welche aus Wurzeln der Einheit
gebildet sind." Berlin, 4° (1875), pp. iii-vi and 1-667.

   This work (the mass of calculation is perfectly wonderful) relates to the
roots of unity, the degree being any prime or composite number, as presently
mentioned, having all the values up to and a few exceeding 100 ; viz. the
work is in five divisions, relating to the cases

       I. (pp. 1-171), degree any odd prime of the first 100, viz. 3, 5, 7, 11,

                  13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79,

   III. (pp. 193-440), degree a product of two or more odd primes or their

                  powers, viz. 15, 21, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 55, 57, 63, 65, 69, 75, 77,

               85,87,91,93, 95, 99, 105;
    IV. (pp. 441-466), degree an even power of 2, viz. 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
      V. (pp. 467-671), degree divisible by 4, viz. 12, 20, 24, 28, 36, 40, 44,

                48, 52, 56, 60, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100, 120

the only excluded degrees being those which are the double of an odd prime,
these, in fact, coming under the case where the degree is the odd prime

itself.

   It would be somewhat long to explain the specialities which belong to
degrees of the forms II., III., IV., V. ; and what foUows refers only to
Division I., degree an odd prime.

Report of the Committee, consisting of W. Spottiswoode, F.R.S.,

   Professor Stokes, F.R.S., Professor Cayley, F.R.S., Professor

   Clifford, F.R.S., and J. W. L. Glaisher, F.R.S., appointed to

   report on Mathematical Notation and Printing, with the view of
   leading Mathematicians to prefer in optional cases such forms as
   are more easily put into type, and of promoting uniformity of

    notation.

With a view to the questions referred to them for consideration, your Com-
mittee have made inquiries into the nature and processes of mathematical

printing, and the diiRculfcies attendant thereon ; and it appears to them that
a statement of the results of these inquiries will form the best introduction to
the suggestions which they have to make.

    The process of " composition " of ordinary matter consists in arranging
types uniform in height and depth (or " body" as it is termed) in simple
straight lines. The complications peculiar to mathematical matter are mainly
of two kinds.

    First, figures or letters, generally of a smaller size than those to which
they are appended, have to be set as indices or suffixes ; and consequently,
except when the expressions are of such frequent occurrence as to make it
worth while to have them cast upon type of the various bodies with which
they are used, it becomes necessary to fit these smaller types in their proper
positions by special methods. This process, which is called " justification,"
consists either in filHng up the difference between the bodies of the larger
and smaller types with suitable pieces of metal, if such exist, or in cuttiag
away a portion of the larger, so as to admit the insertion of the smaller

types.

   The second difficulty arises from the use of lines or " rules " which occur
between the numerator and denominator of fractions, and (in one mode of
writing) over expressions contained under radical signs. In whatever part

of a line such a rule is used, it is necessary to fill up, or compensate, the

thickness of it throughout the entire line. When no letters or mathematical

signs occur on a line with the rule the process is comparatively simple

but when, for example, a comma or sign of equality follows a fraction, or a

+ --or is prefixed to it, the middle of these types must be made to range

with the rule itself, and the thickness of the rule must be divided, and half of
it placed above and half below the type.

   The complications above described may arise in combination, or may be

repeated more than once in a single expression ; and in proportion as the
pieces to be "justified" become smaller and more numerous, so do the
difficulties of the workman, the time occupied on the work, and the chances
of subsequent dislocation of parts augment.

   The cost of " composing" mathematical matter may in general be estimated

at three times that of ordinary or plain matter.

   With a view of illustrating these remarks, we have taken as an example

an expression of not unfrequent occurrence in mathematics, but of consider-
able difficulty to the printer, and have marked out in compartments the
different types of which it has to be composed. The shaded parts represent
the "justification " spoken of

   Your Committee are unwilling to close this Report without alluding to the
advantages which may incidentally accrue to mathematical science by even
a partial adoption of the modifications here suggested. Any thing which
tends towards uniformity in notation may be said to tend towards a common
language in mathematics ; and whatever contributes to cheapening the pro-
duction of mathematical books must ultimately assist in disseminating a

knowledge of the science of which they treat,

resent investigations have concerned the question of the innervation of the

small intestine with regard primarily to its secretion, but also to its nutri-

Wetion, its blood supply, and its movements.  had already ascertained that

the paralytic profuse secretion, after division of the mesenteric nerves, which
was first observed by Moreau in dogs and rabbits, also occurs in the case of

cats.

   It remained to ascertain the centre and the channel of the inhibitory
influence which, according to the best-known analogy, that of the sub-
maxillary gland, must be supposed to control, imder normal conditions, the
intraparietal vasomotor and secretory ganglia of the small intestine.

   Before relating our own experiments, we may shortly refer to the results

obtained by previous observers.
   The first facts we have been able to find which bear on the question were

observed as long ago as 1853 by Ludwig and Haffter *, who ascertained that

after dividing the great splanchnic nerves there was no important alteration

in the intestinal secretion, although a slightly increased degree of moisture

of the mucous membrane in the upper part of the small intestine could

occasionally be remarked ; nor were the peristaltic movements either stopped

or accelerated.

   In 1856 Samuel published the results of experiments in which he had

extirpated the solar plexus in dogs, cats, and rabbits. He observed diarrhoea

in some cases ; and after death (which usually occurred between 12 and 24
hours) found the upper part of the intestine hypersemic, with occasional
ecchymoses and shedding of epithelium. The lower half was i;nafi"ected ; the
mucous membrane moist throughout.

   In the same year Pincus performed similar experiments on dogs, cats, and

rabbits. He also found that after as complete destruction as possible of the

solar 2)lexus, the mucous membrane of the upper half of the small intestine

was excessively hypersemic, with extravasations of blood and ulcerations.
This observer noticed that hyperaemia of the stomach and duodenum followed
section of the vagi. On dividing the cord of the sympathetic on the right
side in four places below the diaphragm, he found the mucous membrane of

the stomach, small intestine, and caecum very hypersemic, with slight hsemor-
rhage and ulceration, and also extravasation of blood among the muscles of
the right thigh. The same operation on the left side produced similar, but
less marked eifects. Lastly, the abdominal gangliated cord was divided on
both sides, and the solar plexus excised. Still more extensive hypersemia,
submucous ecchymoses, and haemorrhage into the intestine, with " disappear-

ance of whole pieces of mucous membrane," were the result. Uuhke Samuel,

Pincus did not observe any increased secretion whatever from the intestinal

mucous membrane.

   Budge, in 1860, found that extirpation of the semilunar ganglia in rabbits
produced increased fluidity of the faeces in the caecum and colon. N'o men-

tion, however, is made of any thing approaching to paralytic secretion in the

small intestine.

   In the same year Schiff also observed that, after extirpation of the solar
plexus in two cats, the faeces appeared somewhat softer and moister than in

healthy animals. He also found that application of an induced current to

the divided splanchnics was followed by contraction of the vessels of the
stomach and intestine, and anaemia of the chylopoietic viscera, including the

spleen, which disappeared on removing the stimulus and returned on re-

applying it.

ON INTESTINAL SECRETION.  341

   Lastly, Adrian, after extirpation (which he admits to have been imperfect)
of the solar plexus, found no alteration whatever in the vascularity, secre-

tion, or movements of the intestine.
   Last year your Committee satisfied themselves, by numerous experiments

detailed in their Report, that division of both right and left splanchnic nerves
was unattended by haemorrhage, hyperajmia, or excessive secretion of the

intestine.

   Messrs. Lewis and Cunningham, in their valuable report of researches on
cholera, have confirmed these results iu the case of dogs. The same observers
found in three cases that excision of the left semilunar ganglion, iu addition

to division of the splanchnics, had no positive effect.

  We have ourselves excised the right, the left, and both semilunar ganglia,

with division of both splanchnics iu each instance, in fourteen experiments,

and in no case did we find ecchymoses or excessive secretion. The mucous
membrane was frequently pale and dry, sometimes moist. In one instance
alone, however, as much as 4| cubic centimetres of pale opalescent fluid were

found in a loop of the ileum four inches in length. In another case a loop
of the ileum of the same length, 18 inches from the valve, contained 13 c. c. of
fluid. The 35 inches between this loop and the pylorus only contained 12 c. c.,
and the mucous membrane throughout was normal. In this case the right
semilunar ganglion had been completely removed, as was verified after death,
but the left ganglion and splanchnic were uninjured. The animal was in
full process of digestion, and the lacteals and receptaculum chyli were dis-

tended. It was killed four hours after the operation.

   We have next repeated the experiments of other physiologists, and have,

like them, observed that section of both jineumogastric nerves has no efl"ect
upon intestinal secretion. Since division of the vagi in the neck of the cat
involves section of the cervical sympathetic, it appeared to your Committee
that it has been sufiiciently demonstrated that the centre regulating the
intestinal nerves does not lie in the ganglionic cord either in the neck or the

thorax.

   We therefore next endeavoured to ascertain the effect of destruction of

the grey matter of the spinal cord, and with this object destroyed the cord
from the sixth dorsal vertebra downwards, not only by means of a bougie

passed down the vertebral canal, but also by complete removal of the laminte
of the vertebrce and excision of the cord entire. In numerous trials we
found that this lesion had no effect upon the vascularity or secretion of the
intestine ; and even when the vagi were also divided and artificial respira-

tion maintained, the result was negative.
    Looking, therefore, to the complete character of the experiments which

have been now carried out on the vagus, the splanchnics, and the spinal
cord, it would appear to follow, by way of exclusion, that the regulating

influence conveyed by the nerves divided in Morceau's experiments must

 arise from some of the ganglia of the great solar plexus.

    That the excision of the semilunar ganglia, in our own hands as in those

 of other experimenters, has been often followed by a negative result is true;

 but in three cases we obtained good evidence of a consequent paralytic secre-

 tion ; and the difficulty of this operation, as well as the varying luimbcr and

 irregular arrangement of the ganglia of the solar plexus in the cat, may not

 improbably explain the more numerous failures.

     It might be supposed, however, that the non-appearance of a paralytic
 secretion from the intestine after destruction, apparently tolerably complete,
 of the solar plexus, while it occurs after division of the mesenteric nerves
 going to a single loop of intestine, might be due to the blood going to any
--343 REPORT 1875.

one part being inaufflcient to supply the material for secretion ; for, in Mor-

ceau's experiment, the nerves going to a part of the intestine only are divided,

and any relaxation of the vessels of that part which succeeds the operation

will increase the supply of blood to the intestinal loop operated upon, as the
vessels in the after parts stUl retain their normal tone, and the blood naturally

flows in the direction of least resistance. When, however, the splanchnics,
which are the chief vasomotor nerves of the intestine, are cut and the solar
plexus destroyed, the vessels of the whole intestine become dilated and the

flow of blood through every part languid.
    Such an explanation appears all the more probable from the fact observed

by Cyon and Aladoff that section of the vasomotor nerves of the liver alone
increased the flow of blood through the organ and produced diabetes, while
section of these same fibres was not followed by this result if the intestinal
vasomotor nerves contained with them in the splanchnics were divided at the
same time. The reason assigned is that in the former case the blood flowed
easily through the dilated vessels of the liver, and a proportionately small

quantity through those of the intestine ; while in the latter, the vessels being
all dilated, there was not sufiicient pressure to keep up an active circulation
anywhere. In order, then, to avoid this source of fallacy, your Committee
repeated their experiments on the section of the splanchnics and excision of
the solar plexus, but at the same time ligatured the aorta between the mesen-
teric and renal arteries, so that the pressure in the vessels of the intestines
might be maintained as nearly as possible normal. These experiments also
yielded a negative result, so that the failure of the previous series cannot
have been due to diminished supply of blood to the intestine.

    Apart from paralytic secretion, a striking result thrice obtained by your
Committee was the occurrence of extravasations of blood into the mucous
membrane of a great part of the small intestine, and the exudation of a
bloody fluid into its lumen, after simultaneous destruction of the solar plexus
 and of the lower part of the spinal cord (Nos. 18, 19, 20). Although Samuel
 and Pincus had noticed this after destruction of the solar plexus alone, your
 Committee only observed it once, under these conditions, in the case of the
 dog (No. 23) ; while ecchymoses and extravasations were absent in all other
 cases, even when they succeeded in obtaining a paralytic secretion of fluid.
 Nor did your Committee observe haemorrhage in any case after destruction
 of the spinal cord and division of the splanchnics alone, even when this was
 accompanied by section of the vagi.

     In three out of the six experiments, on the other hand, in which the solar
 plexus and spinal cord were simultaneously destroyed, extravasations occurred
 to a most remarkable extent (Nos. 18, 19, 20). In one at least of the
 others their absence might be accounted for by the weak condition of the
 circulation. Another result, worthy of special notice, is the occurrence of
 vomiting in one animal after division of the vagus and splanchnic nerves on
 both sides.

    While the problem which has baffled so many previous investigations

 cannot yet be considered as solved, your Committee hope that their experi-

ments may be considered to have proved the absence of influence on the

 intestinal secretion through the splanchnic nerves, the pneumogastrics, the
 sympathetic above the diaphragm, or the spinal marrow, and the probable
 influence of the gangha contained in the solar plexus, though certainly not
 of the two semilunar ganglia exclusively. Also the independent occurrence
 of hemorrhage and of paralytic secretion appear to point to a separate nervous
 influence on the blood-vessels and the secreting structures of the intestine.

Third Report of the Sub-Wealden Exploration Committee, consisting

   of Henry Willett, F.G.S., R. A. C. Godwin-Austen, F.R.S.,
   W. TopLEY, F.G.S., T. Davidson, F.R.S., Prof. J. Prestwich,
   F.R.S., Prof. Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., and Henry Woodward,
   F.R.S. Drawn up by Henry Willett, F.G.S.

Of the £150 granted by the Committee of Recommendations in further-
ance of this undertaking, £25 was voted in 1872, and, as reported at Brad-
ford, in the subsequent twelve months, 295 feet of strata were penetrated at

a diameter of 9 inches.

   The second grant of £25, made in 1873, encouraged an enlarged subscrip-
tion of sufficient amount to warrant the Committee in entering into a con-
tract with the Diamond Boring Company to extend, by their process (at a
diameter of 3 inches), the bore-hole to 1000 feet. This depth was success-
fully reached on the 18th of June, 1874.

   In the report made at Belfast it was announced that the Government had
(in consequence of a memorial signed on behalf of their Councils, by the
Presidents of the Eoyal Society, of the Geological Society of London, and of
the Society of Engineers) consented to a Treasury grant of £1000, to be
paid on the condition that be5'ond the depth of 1000 feet an additional 1 foot
should be explored for every £1 of the aforesaid grant.

   The foregoing facts induced the Committee of Recommendations at Belfast
to give further assistance by a third and enlarged grant of £100. Thus
again encouraged, the Committee arranged a contract with the Diamond
Boring Company for an extension to 1200 feet, at an additional cost of £400 ;
but at 1018 feet the strata were found to be so much broken and fissured
that it became absolutely essential to line the entire depth. The estimated
cost of this operation was an additional £400.

    Engineering difficulties of an unforeseen and of a finally insurmountable
nature ensued ; and, in consequence, the Treasurer of the British Association

--was informed, in October 1874, that the grant might possibly not be re-

quired at any Tate, not at that time.
    In January 1875 the contractors, with laudable courage and energy,

volunteered to commence de novo, and to put down a bore-hole of consider-
ably enlarged diameter, which should be lined at their expense to the depth
of 1000 feet, at a cost, including lining tubes, of £600; viz. of £200 only
beyond what had been agreed upon as the price for lining the old 3-inch

diameter.

    This work, begun on February 12th, 1875, went on uninterruptedly, as
will be seen by the subjoined statement :
--

ON SUB-WEALDEN EXPLORATION.  347

    It should be remembered that the problem originally offered for aolution
was one based on the strong opinion expressed by our most eminent geolo-
gists, that there was a high degree of probability that Palaeozoic rocks (fol-
lowing the course of the axis of Artois, and dipping beneath the surface in
Belgium and the north of France) would be found at a depth variously esti-
mated at from 700 feet to 1700 feet.

    In this aspect the problem is solved, a depth of 1753 feet having been

explored with the certainty that (within the aforesaid maximum distance)

no such rocks exist in this locality, i

   On the contrary, an extraordinary and unexampled thickness of sedi-
mentary beds, possessing many features of the Jurassic series, with a fauna

most persistent in type, and such as has hitherto been considered to denote
the Kimmeridge Clay of England and of the Continent, is the result so far of
the discoveries made by the Sub-Wealden Exploration.

   Although no economic advantages were ever sought by the promoters, two
not unimportant results have ensued :

  A1. company has been established for developing the rich beds of gypsum

which we have discovered, and which were hitherto unknown to exist in

Sussex.

  We2. have proved that the project for supplying Hastings with .water by

means of a deep well on the Artesian system would be abortive.
   After three years of toil and anxiety, it is some satisfaction to be able to

state further that, owing to the munificent response made by lovers of
science, of all orders and degrees of men among us, a contract has been
entered into for completion to 2000 feet, should no unavoidable hindrance

occur.

   Ko additional grant is solicited, or will be required, from the British

Association.

   The geological results will be fuUy explained in more minute detail by
Mr. Topley's report, hereunto appended.

   To him, to Kobert Etheridge, Esq., E.R.S. (for his invaluable palseonto-
logical services), to J. H. Peyton, Esq., F.G.S. (for numberless journeys of
inspection to the works), to Prof. Kamsay, to the Committee of Scientific
Reference, over which he has so ably presided, and to the Patrons and Sub-
scribers who have so generously supplied the funds for prosecuting the work,
the thanks of all sympathisers with scientific advancement are due.

   Although, by Mr. Warner's offer of £300, on reaching 2000 feet, that depth

has been named as the maximum limit to be aimed at, yet the friability of

the strata at the present depth (1762 feet), and the persistent character of
the sedimentary deposits, seem to show the wisdom of stopping any further
outlay on the " Sub-Wealden Exploration."

Geological Report hy W. Topley, F.6.S., Assoc. Inst, C.E., Geological Survey

   In the Report submitted to the Association at Belfast an account was
given of the strata passed through and of the fossils found down to a depth
of 1013 feet. It was then believed that certain Ammonites found in the
lower cores were Oxford-Clay foims ; and it was therefore supposed that the
boring had passed from the Kimmeridge Clay to the Oxford Clay without
finding any representative of the Coral Rag or Calcareous Grit.
--348 REPORT 1875.

   The first boring was abandoned at the depth then attained (1013 feet),

and a second boring was commenced, which has now (August 1875) reached

the depth of 1820 feet. This has proved that the Kinuneridge-Clay fauna

extends much lower than was inferred from the results of the first boring.

Gryphoea {Exogyra) virgula has been met with at various depths down to

1656 feet. Ammonites ynutahilis extends from about 960 feet to 1652 feet.

RJiynchonella pinyuis is common in some of the lower cores. The presence

of these fossils would seem to settle the question as to the age of the beds in

which they occur ; but fortunately we are not now left to palaeontological
evidence alone. At about 1769 feet an oolitic rock was reached, which con-

tinued to 1786 feet, where the beds again changed to shale. The upper part

of this 17 feet of rock is rather coarse in grain ; the lower part is finer. Save

as regards colour (which depends on weathering) these cores may be matched
precisely by examples of Coralline Oolite in the Museum of the Geological
Survey at Jermyn Street. Mr. Bristow kindly referred me to the specimens

which are contained in 3iV^all-case No. 46. No. 58 in this case is a rather

coarse-grained oolite from Steeple Ashton in Wiltshire, exactly resembling

the cores found at about 1770 feet. No. 59 is an oolite of finer grain from

Buckland, near Faringdon, which as closely resembles the cores found at

about 1782 feet. These rocks are not very fossiliferous ; and in the boring
they appear to contain only small oysters, which occur chiefly in the lower

part. The coarse oolite in the boring is hard, and takes a fine i^olish ; the

finer variety is softer.

  We may, then, with some degree of safety, assume that these rocks repre-

sent the Coral Rag (Coralline Oolite). The Upper and Lower Calcareous Grits

are either absent, or they are represented by sandy, rather calcareous shales,

which do not in any way differ from shales which are abundant in the true

Kimmeridge Clay.

It will perhaps be better to leave the description of the fossils until the

materials have been more carefully worked iip and the whole series fully

arranged ; it will also be as well to defer till then a detailed section of the

strata. Mr. Etheridge has carefully looked over the cores ; and from his
notes the foregoing remarks on the fossils are taken.

ilr. H. Woodward has examined the Crustacea, and he refers some

remarkably fine examples, found in the Kimmeridge Clay at 1057 feet, to a

Henew species of Ccdlianassa.  proposes to call this C. isocJiela ; it is the

oldest known form of the genus. Fragments of another crustacean were

found at the same depth ; Mr. Woodward refers this to Mecochh-us Peytoni,

Woodw.

Beds of sandstone have been met with at various depths in the Kimmeridge

Clay. Frequently they are traversed by wavy concretionary lines, which

AUlook exactly like fossils on the, outside of the core.  these sandstones are

cemented by carbonate of lime. Oysters are almost the only fossils which

they contain. Throughout both borings it has been noticed that oysters are

most abundant in the sandy beds.

The shales are frequently traversed by oblique veins of carbonate of lime.

The hole, when not lined, is very apt to fall in at these points. In the

method of boring employed by the Diamond Company it is necessary to send

a stream of water down the middle of the rods from the surface, the water

rising again to the surface outside the rods. Mr. Thornton, the engineer in

charge, noticed that the hole fell in much more readilj' after heavy rain, when

the brook from which the water was pumped was swollen, than it did when
the brook only ran with spring-water. He referred this, no doubt correctly,
ON SUB-WEALDEN EXPLORATION.  349

to the superior solvent power for carbonate of lime of the rain-water charged
with carbonic acid.

    The Kimmeridge Clay probably began at about 274 or 275 feet from the
surface. If it extends to 1769 feet, we have here a thickness of 1495 feet
in one continuous section, all the beds l5iug flat. The greatest thickness as-
sumed by Mr. Blake for the Kimmeridge Clay of England, where exposed
at the surface, is 1050 feet ; this thickness, however, is not present in any
one district.

          of Steel for structural purposes will be printed in the next volume.

Since the last meeting of the British Association science has had to mourn the

loss of one of its pioneers in the deatli of the veteran astronomer Schwahe, of

Dessau, at a good old age, not before he had faithfully and honourably finished his

work. In truth this work was of such a nature that the worker could not be ex-

pected long to survive its completion.

   It is now nearly fifty years since he first began to produce daily sketches of the
spots that appeared upon the sun's surface. Every day on which the sun was
visible (and such days are more frequent in Germany than in this country), with
hardly any intermisssion for forty years, this laborious and venerable observer made
his sketch of the solar disk. At length this unexampled perseverance met with its

reward in the discovery of the periodicity of sun-spots, a phenomenon which very

speedily attracted the attention of the scientific world.

   It is not easy to overrate the importance of the step gained when a periodicity

was found to rule these solar outbreaks.

  A priori, we should not have expected such a phenomenon.

   If the old asti-onomers were perplexed by the discovery of sun-spots, their

successors must have been equally perplexed when they ascertained their periodicity.

For while all are ready to acknowledge periodicity as one of the natural con-

ditions of teiTestrial phenomena, yet every one is inclined to ask what there can be

to cause it in the behaviour of the sun himself.

Manifestly it can only have two possible causes. It must either be the out-

come of some strangely hidden periodical cause residing in the sun himself, or
must be produced by external bodies, such as planets, acting somehow in their

varied positions on the atmosphere of the sun.

   But whether the cause be an internal or external one, in either case we are

completely ignorant of its nature.

  We can easily enough imagine a cause operating from the sun himself and his

relations with a surrounding medium to produce great disturbances on his surface,

but we cannot easily imagine why disturbances so caused should have a periodicity.
On the other hand we can easily enough attach periodicitj^ to any effect caused by
the planets, but we cannot well see why bodies comparatively so insignificant should
contribute to such very violent outbreaks as we now know sun-spots to be.

   If we look within we are at a loss to account for the periodicity of solar dis-
turbances, and if wo look without we are equally at a loss to account for their

magnitude.

2 REPORT 1875.

But since tliat witMn the sun is hidden from our view, it cannot surely be con-

sidered blameworthy if astronomers have directed their attention to that without,

and have endeavoured to connect the behaviour of sun-spots with the positions of

the various planets.

Stimulated, no doubt, by the success which had attended the laboui-s of Schwabe,

an English astronomer was the next to enter the Held of solar research.

The aim of Mr. Carrington was, however, rather to obtain very accurate record.s

of the positions, the sizes, and the shapes of the various sun-spots, than to make a
very extensive and long-continued series of observations. He was aware that a

series at once very accurate and very extended is beyond the power of a private

individual, and can only bo undertaken by an established institution. Nevertheless

each sun-spot that made its appearance during the seven years extending from the

beginning of 1854 to the end of 1860 was sketched by Mr. Carrington witli the

--greatest possible accuracy, and had also its heliographic positions that is to .say,

--its solar latitude and longitude accurately determined.

One of the most prominent results of Mr. Carrington's labours was the discovery

of the fiict that sun-spots appear to have a proper motion of their own, those

nearer the solar equator moving faster than those more remote. Another was the

discovery of changes apparently periodical atfectiug the disposition of spots in

solar latitude. It was already known that sun-spots confined themselves to the

sun's equatorial regions ; but Mr. Carrington showed that the region affected was

liable to periodical elongations and contractions, although his observations were not

sufficiently extended to determine tlie exact length of this period.

Before Mr. Carrington had completed his seven years' labours, celestial photo-

gi-aphy had been introduced by Mr. Warren Ue La Rue. Commencing with his

private observatory, he next persuaded the Kew Committee of the British Associa-

tion to allow the systematic photography of the sun to be carried on at their

observatory under his superintendeuce, and in the year 1862 the lirst of a ten j'ears'

series of solar photographs was begun.

Before this date, however, Mr. De La Rua had ascertained, by means of his

photoheliograph, on the occasion of the total eclipse of LS60, that tlie red promi-

nences surrouuding the eclipsed sun belong, without doubt, to our luminary himself.

  Tlie Kew observations are not yet finally reduced, but already several importaut

conclusions have been obtained from them by Mr. Do La Rue and the other Kew
observers. In the first place the Kew photographs confirm the theory of Wilson

that sun-spots are phenomena the dark portions of which exist at a level consider-

ably beneath the general sm'face of the sun--in other words, they are hollows or

pits, tlie interior of which is of course tilled up with the solar atmosphere. The

Kew observers were likewise led to associate the low temperature of the bottom of

sun-spots with the downward carriage of colder matter from the atmosjihere of the

sun, while the upward rush of heated matter was supposed to account for the

faculse or bright patches which almost invariably accompauj' spots. In the next

place, the Kew observers, making use not only of the Kew series but of those of

ydiwabe and Carrington, which were generously placed at their disposal, have dis-

covered traces of the influence of the nearer planets upon the beliaviour of sun-

spots. This influence appears to be of such a natiu-e tliat spots attain their maxi-

mum size when carried by rotation into positions as far as possible remote from

--the intiueuciug planet that is'to say, into positions where the bodj^ of the sun is

between them and the planet. There is also evidence of an excess of solar action

when two influential planets come near together. But although considerable light

has thus been thrown on the periodicity of sim-spots, it ought to be borne in mind

that the cause of the remarkable period of eleven years and a quarter, originally

discovered by Schwabe, has not yet been properly explained. The Kew observers

have likewise discovered traces of a peculiar oscillation of spots between the two

hemispheres of the sun                                                                                          and finally their researches will place at the command of
                                                                                                             ;

the observers the data for ascertaining whether centres of greater and lesser solar

activity are connected with certain heliocentric positions.

While the sun's surface was thusljeing examined both telescopically and plioto-

graphically, the spectroscope came to be emploj-ed as an instrument of reseai'ch. It

had already been sm-mised by Professor Stokes that the vapom of sodium at a
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                       6

compai-atively low temperature forma one of the constituents of the solar atmo-

Dsphere, inasmuch as the dark liuo in the spectrum of the sun coincides in position

with the brijjht line gjven out by incandescent sodium vapour.

   This method of research wtis greatly extended by Kirchhoff, who soon found

tliat many of the darlc lines in the solar spectrum were coincident with the bright
lines of sundry incandescent metallic vapours ; and a good beginning was thus made

towards ascertaining the chemical constitution of the sun.

   The new method soon brought forth further fruit when applied, in the hands of

Ilugg-ins, Miller, Secchi, and others, to tlie more distant heavenly bodies. It was

speedily found that the fixed stars had constitutions very similar to that of the sun.

But a peculiar and unexpected success was attained when some of the nebulfB were

examined spectroscopically. To-day it seems (so rapidly has knowledge progi-essed)

very much like recalling an old superstition to remind you that, until the advent of

the spectroscope, the irresolvable nebulae wei'e considered to be gigantic and remote

clusters of stars, the individual members of which vv'ei-e too distant to be separated

from each other even with a telescope like that of Lord Rosse.

But Mr. Iluggins, by means of the spectroscope, soon foimd that this was not the

case, and that most of the nebulos which had defied the telescope gave indications

of incandescent hydrogen gas.

It was also found by this observer that the proper motions of some of the fixed

stars in a direction to or from the earth might be detected by means of the displace-

ment of their spectral lines, a principle of research which was first enunciated by

Fizeau.

Hitherto in such applications of the spectroscope, the body to be examined was

viewed as a whole.

   It had not yet been attempted to localize the use of this instrument so as to

--examine particular districts of the sun as, for instance, a sun-spot, or the red flames

already proved by De La Rue to belong to our luminary.

This application was first made by Mr. Lockyer, who, in the year 1865, examined

a sun-spot spectroscopically, and remarked the greater thickness of the lines in the

spectrum of the darker portion of the spot.

Br. Frankland had previously found that thick spectral lines correspond to great

pressure, and hence the inference from the greater thickness of lines in the umbra

--of a spot is, that this umbra or dark portion is subject to a greater pressure that is

to say, it exists below a greater depth of the solar atmosphere than the general sur-

face of the sun. Thus the results derived from the Kew photoheliograph and those

derived from the spectroscope were found to confirm each other. Mr. Lockyer next

caused a powerful instrument to be constructed for the purpose of viewing spectro-

scopically the red flames round the sun's border, in the hope that if they consisted of

ignited gas the spectroscope would disperse, and thus dilute and destroy, the glare

which prevents them from being seen on ordinary occasions.

Before this instrument was quite ready, these flames had been analyzed spec-

troscopically by Capt. Herschel, M. Jansseu, and others on the occasion of a total

eclipse occurring in India, and they were found to consist of incandescent gas, most

probably hydrogen. But the latter of these observers (M. Janssen) made the

important observation that the bright lines in the spectrum of these flames remained

visible even after the sun had reappeared, from which he argued that a solar eclipse

is not necessary for the examination of this region.

   Before information of the discovery made by M. Janssen had reached tliis coun-

try, the instrument of Mr. Lockyer had been completed, and he also found that by

its means he was able to analyze at leisure the composition of the red flames with-

out the necessit}' of a total eclipse. An atmosphere of incandescent hydrogen was

found to surround our luminary, into which, during the greater solar storms, sundry

--metallic vapours were injected sodium, magnesium; and iron forming the three that

most frequently made their appearance.

Here we come to an interesting chemical question.

It had been remarked by Maxwell and by Pierce, as the result of the molecular

theory of gases, that the final distribution of any number of kinds of gas in a vertical

direction under gravity is such that the density of each gas .at a given height is the

same as if all the other gases had been removed, leaving it alone.

                                                                    1*
4 REPORT 1875.

In our own atmosphere the continual disturbances prevent this arrangement from

taking place ; but in the sim's enormously extended atmosphere (if, indeed, our lumi-
nary be not nearly all gaseous) it appears to hold, inasmuch as the upper portion

of this atmosphere, dealing with known elements, apparently consists entirely of

hydrogen.

   Various other vapours are, however, as we have seen, injected from below the

photosphere into the solar atmosphere on the occasion of great disturbances ; and
Mr. Lockyer has asked the question, whether we have not here a true indication of

the relative densities of these various vapoiu-s derived from the relative heights to

which they are injected on such occasions.

This question has been asked, but it has not yet received a definite solution ; for

chemists tell us that the vapour-densities of some of the gases injected into the sun's
atmosphere on the occasion of disturbances are, as far as they know from terrestrial

observations, different from those which would be indicated by taking the relative

heights attained in the atmosphere of the sun. Mr. Lockyer has attempted to bring
the question a step nearer to its solution by showing that the vapours at the tem-

perature at which their vapour-densities have been experimentally determined are

not of similar molecular constitution ; whereas in the sun we get an indication, from

the fact that all the elements give us line spectra, that they are in similai- mole-

cular states.

   Without, however, attempting to settle this question, I may remark that we have
liere an interesting example of how two branches of science, physics and chemistry,

meet together in solar research.

It had already been observed by Kirchhoff that sometimes one or more of the

spectral lines of an elementary vapour appeared to be reversed in the solar spec-

trum, while the other lines did not experience reversal. Mr. Lockj'er succeeded in
obtaining an explanation of this phenomenon. This explanation was found by means

of the method of localization already mentioned.
   Hitherto, when taking the spectrum of the electric spark between the two me-

tallic poles of a coil, the aiTangements were such as to give an average spectrum of

the metal of these poles ; but it was fomid that when the method of localization
was employed, diifereut portions of the spark gave a different number of lines, the
regions near the terminals being rich in lines, while the midway regions give com-

parativelv few.

   If we imagine that in the midway regions the metallic vapour given off by the
spark is in a rarer state than that near the poles, we are thus led to regard the short

lines which cling to the poles as those which require a greater density or nearness

of the vapour particles before they make their appearance ; while, on the other hand,
those which extend all the way between the two poles come to be regarded as those

which will continue to make their appearance in vapour of great tenuity.

  Now it was remarked that these long lines were the very lines which were

reversed in the atmosphere of the sun. Hence when we observe a single coinci-
dence between a dark solar line and the bright line of any metal, we are further

led to inquire whether this bright line is one of the long lines which will
continue to exist all the way between two terminals of that metal when the

spark passes.

   If this be the case, then we may argue with much probability that the metal in

question really occurs in the solar atmosphere ; but if, on the other hand, the

fiiincidence is merely between a solar dark line and a short bright one, then we

are led to imagine that it is not a true coincidence, but something which will

probably disappear on further examination. This method has already afforded us

a means of determining the relative amount of the various metallic vapours in the

sun's atmosphere. Thus, in some instances all lines are reversed, whereas in others

the reversal extends only to a few of tlie longer lines.

    Several new metals have thus been added to the list of those previously detected

in  the  solar  atmosphere                                                         and it  is  now  certain  tliat  the  v.ipours  of hydrogen,

been found capable of performing tlie same good service towards the compound
instrument consisting ot the telescope and its attached spectroscope, which it had
previously been known to perform towards the telescope alone.

   It is of no less importance to secure a permanent record of spectral peculiarities

than it is to secure a permanent record ot telescopic appearances.
   This application of photography to spectrum observations was first commenced

on a sufficient scale by Mr. Rutherford, of New York, and already promises to be

one of the most valuable aids in solar inquiry.
   In connexion with the spectroscope I ought here to mention the names of

Respighi and Secchi, who have done much in the examination of the solar surface

from day to day. It is of great importance to the advancement of our knowledge,
that two such competent observers are stationed in a country where the climate is

so favom'able to continued observation.

   The examination of the sun's surface by the spectroscope suggests many interest-
ing questions connected with other branches of science. One of these has already

been alluded to.

   I may mention two others put by Mr. Lockyer, premising, however, that at
pi-esent we are hardly in a position to reply to them.

   It has been asked whether the very high temperatures of the sim and of some of

the stars may not be sirfficientto produce the disassociation of those molecular struc-
tures which cannot be disassociated by any terrestrial means ; in other words, the

question has been raised, whether our so-called elements are really elementary

bodies.

  A third question is of geological interest. It has been asked whether a study of

the solar atmosphere may not throw some light upon the pecidiar constitution of
the upper strata of the earth's surface, which are known to be of less density than

the avei-age interior of our planet.

   If we have learned to be independent of total eclipses as far as the lower portions

of the solar atmosphere are concerned, it must be confessed that as yet the upper

-- --portions the outworks of the sun can only be successfully approached on these

rare and precious occasions. Thanks to the various Government expeditions

despatched by Great Britain, by the United States, and by several Continental

-- --nations thanks, also, to the exertions of Lord Ijindsay and other astronomers we

are in the possession of definite information regarding the solar corona.

   In the first place, we are now absolutely certain that a large part of this ap-
pendage unmistakably belongs to our luminary ; and in the next place, we know

that it consists, in part at least, of au ignited gas giving a peculiar spectrum,

which we have not yet been able to identity with tliat of any known element.
   The temptation is great to associate this spectrum with the presence of something

lighter than hydrogen, of the nature of which we are yet totally ignorant.

  A peculiar physical structure of the corona has likewise been suspected. On the

whole, we may say that this is the least known, while it is perhaps the most

interesting, region of solar research ; most assuredly it is well worthy of fm-ther

investigation.

   If we now turn our attention to matters nearer home, we find that there is a

difficulty in grasping the facts of terrestrial meteorology no less formidable than

that which assails us when we investigate solar outbreaks. The latter perplex us

because the sun is so far away, and because also his conditions are so different from

those witli which we are here familiar ; while, on the other hand, the former pei'plex
us because we are so intimately mixed up with them in our daily lives and actions
because, in fact, the scale is so large and we are so near. The result has been that
until quite recentlj' our meteorological operations have been conducted by a band

of isolated volunteers, individually capable and skilful, but from their very isolation
incapable of combining together with advantage to prosecute a scientific campaign.

Of late, however, we have begim to perceive tliat if we are to make any advance in
this very interestmg and practical subject, a difierent method must be pursued, and
we have already reaped the first fruits of a more enlightened policy ; already
we have gained some knowledge of the constitution and habits of our atmo-

dew, Humboldt, Dove, Buys Ballot, Jelinek, Quetelet, Hansteen, Kupffer, Forbes,

Welsh, Glaisher, and others have done much to give us an accurate kaovsrledge of

the distribution of terrestrial temperature.

Great attention has likewise been given to the rainfall of Great Britain and

Ireland, chiefly through the exertions of one individual, Mr. G. J. Symous.

   To Dove we are indebted for the law of rotation of the wind, to liedfield for the

spiral theory of cyclones, to Francis Galton for the theory of anti-cyclones, to

Buchan for an investigation into the disposition of atmospheric pressure which

precedes peculiar types of weather, to Stevenson for the conception of barometric

gi-adients, to Scott and Meldrum for an acquaintance with the disposition of winds

which frequently precedes violent outbreaks ; and, to come to tlie practical applica-
tion of laws, we are much indebted to the late Admiral FitzRoy and the system

which he greatly helped to establish for our telegraphic warnings of coming storms.

Again, the meteorology of the ocean has not been forgotten. The well-known

name of Maury will occur to every one as that of a pioneer in this branch of inquiry.

FitzRoy, Leverrier, Meldi-um, Toynbee, and others have likewise done much ; and

it is understood that the meteorological offices of this and other maritime countries

are now busily engaged upon this important and practical subject. Finally, the

movements of the ocean and the temperatures of the oceanic depths have recently

been examined with very great success in vessels despatched by Her Majesty's

Government ; and Dr. Carpenter has by this means been able to throw great light

iipon the convection-currents exhibited by that vast body of water which girdles

our globe.

   It would be out of place to enter here more minutely into this large subject ; and

already it may be asked, what connexion has all this with that part of the address

that went before it ?

There are, however, strong grounds for supposing that the meteorology of the

sun and that of the earth are intimately connected together. Mr. Broun has

shown the existence of a meteorological period connected apparently with the sun's

rotation, five successi\e years' observations of the barometer at Singapore all giving

the period 2o-74 days. Mr. Baxendell, of Manchester, was, I believe, the first to

show that tlie convection-currents of the earth appear to be connected somehow

with the state of the sun's surface as regards spots ; and still more recently Mr.
Meldnmi, of the Mamitius observatory, has shown, by a laborious compilation of

ships' logs, and by utilizing the meteorological records of the island, that the

cyclones in the Indian Ocean are most frequent in years when there are most sun-

Hespots.    likewise affords us grounds for supposing that the rainfall, at least in

the tropics, is gi-eatest in years of maximum solar disturbance.

M. Poeyhas found a similar connexion in the case of the West-Indian hun-icanes

and, finally, Piazzi Smyth, Stone, Koppen, and, still more recently, Blanford have

been able to bring to light a cycle of terrestrial temperature having apparent reference

to the condition of the sun.

  Thus we have strong matter-of-fact grounds for presuming a coimexion between

the meteorology of our luminary and that of our planet, even although we are in

complete ignorance as to the exact nature of this bond.

   If we now turn to terrestrial magnetism the same connexion becomes apparent.
   Sir Edward Sabine was the first to show that the disturbances of the magnetism
of the earth are most violent during j^ears of maximum sun-spots. Mr. Broun has
shown that there is likewise a reference in magnetic phenomena to the period of

the sun's rotation about his axis, an observation recently confirmed by Ilornstein

and still more recently Mr. Broun has shown that the moon has an action upon
the earth's magnetism which is not altogether of a tidal nature, but depends, in
part at least, upon the relative position of the sun and moon.

  I must trust to your forbearance if I now venture to bring forward considera-

     _

tions of a somewhat speculative nature.

  We are all familiar with the generalization of Hadley ; that is to say, we know there

are undercun-ents sweeping along the sm-face of the earth from the poles to the equator,

Weand upper currents sweeping back from the equator to the poles.  are likewise

aware that these currents are caused by the unequal temperatm-e of the earth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         they
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

Wethe hottest and coldest parts of the earth's surface.         may expect them, there-

fore, to have a reference not so much to the geographical equator and poles as to

the hottest and coldest regions. In fact we know that the equatorial regions

into which the trade-winds rush and from which the anti-trades take their origin,

have a certain annual oscillation depending upon the position of the sun, or, in

Weother words, upon the season of the year.                     may likewise imagine that the

region into which the upper currents pour themselves is not the geographical pole,

but the pole of greatest cold.

In the next place we may imagine that these currents, as far as regards a par-

ticular place, have a daily oscillation. This has, I believe, been proved as regards

the lower currents or trade-winds, which are more powerful during the day than

dm'ing the night, and we may therefore expect it to hold good with regard to the
upper currents or anti-trades ; in fact we cannot go wron^- in supposing tliat they

also, as regards any particular place, exhibit a daily variation in the intensity with

which they blow.

Again, we are aware that the earth is a magnet. Let us uot now concern our-

Weselves about the origin of its magnetism, but rather let us talce it as it is.  must

next bear in mind that rarefied air is a good conductor of electricity ; indeed,

according to recent experiments, an extremely good conductor. The return trades

that pass above from the hotter equatorial regions to the poles of cold, consisting

of moist rarefied air, are therefore to be regarded in the light of good conductors

crossing Hues of magnetic force ; we may therefore expect them to be the vehicle

of electric currents. Such electric currents will of course react on the magnetism

of the earth. Now, since the velocity of these upper currents has a daily variation,

their influence as exhibited at any place upon the magnetism of the earth may be

expected to have a daily variation also.

  The question thus arises. Have wo possibly here a cause which may account for

the well-known daily magnetic variation r Are the peculiarities of this variation

such as to correspond to those which might be expected to belong to such electric

currents? I think it niay be said tliat, as far as we can judge, there is a likeness of

this kind between the pecidiarities of these two things ; but a more prolonged
scrutiny will of course be essential before we can be absolutely certain tliat such

currents are fitted to produce the daily variation of the earth's magnetism.

Besides the daily and yearly periodic changes in these upper convection-cun-ents,

we shoidd also expect occasional and abrupt changes forming the counterparts of

those disturbances in the lower strata with which we are familiar. And these mav

be expected in like manner to produce non-periodic occasional disturbances of the

magnetism of the earth. Now it is well known that such disturbances do occur,

--and, further, that they are most frequent in those years when cyclones are most fre-

quent ^that is to say, in years of maximum sun-spots. In one word, it appears to

be a tenable hypothesis to attribute at least the most prominent magnetic changes

to atmospheric motions taking place in tlie upper regions of the atmosphere, where

each moving stratum of air becomes a conductor moving across lines of magnetic

force; and it was Sir William Thomson, I believe, who first suggested that the motion

of conductors across the lines of the earth's magnetic force must be taken into

account in any attempted explanation of terrestrial magnetism.

   It thus seems possible that the excessive magnetic disturbances which take place

in years of maximum sun-spots may not be directly caused by any solar action,

but may rather be due to the excessive meteorological disturbances which are like-

wise characteristic  of such  years                             on the other hand, that magnetic and meteoro-
                                                             ;

logical influence which Mr. Broun has found to be connected with the sun's rotation

points to some unknown direct effect produced by our luminary, even if we

imagine that the magnetic part of it is caused by the meteorological. Mr. Broun

is of opinion that this effect of the sun does not depend upon the amount of spots

on his surface.

In the next place, that influence of the sun in virtue of which we have most

cyclones and greater meteorological disturbance in the years of maximum spots,

cannot, I think (as far as we know at present), be attrijjuted to a change in tlie
Weheating-power of the sun.
                                have no doubt traces of a temperature effect which

appears to depend upon the sun-period ; but its amount is very small, whereas the
                                                                                                                                                             --;

Wevariation in cyclonic distuvbauce is very great.                                                    are thus tempted to associate

this cyclone-producing- influence of the sun with something diflerent from his light

and heat. As far, therefore, as we can judge, our luminary would appear to pro-

--duce three distinct effects upon our globe : In the first place, a magnetic and

meteorological effect, depending somehow upon his rotation ; secondly, a cyclonic
effect, depending somehow upon the disturbed state of his surface ; and lastly, the
well-known light-and-heat effect with which we all are familiar.

If we now turn to the sun, we find that there are three distinct forms of motion

which animate his surface-particles. In the first place, each particle is can-ied

round by the rotation   of our luminary                                                               secondly, each particle is influenced by the
                                                                                                   ;

gigantic meteorological disturbances of the surface, in virtue of which it may

acquire a velocity ranging as high as 130 or 140 miles a second ; and lastly, each

particle, on account of its high temperature, is vibrating with extreme rapidity,

and the energy of these vibrations communicated to us by means of the etherial

medium produces the well-known light-and-heat effect of the sun.

   Now, is it philosophical to suppose that it is only the last of these three motions
that influences our earth, while the other two produce absolutely no effect ? On

the contrary, we are, I think, compelled, by considerations connected with the theory

of energy, to attribute an influence, whether great or small, to the first two as well

as to the last.

  We are thus led to suppose that the sun must influence the earth in three ways,

one depending on his rotation, another on his meteorological disturbance, and a

third by means of the vibrations of his surface-particles.

But we have already seen that, as a matter of fact, the sun does ajjpear to

influence the earth in three distinct ways^one magnetically and meteorologically,

depending apparently on his period of rotation ; a second cyclonically, depending

apparently on  the  meteorological conditions of                                                      his surface                                            and a third by means
                                                                                                                                                          ;

of his light and heat.

WeIs this merely a coincidence, or has it a meaning of its own ?                                                                                             cannot tell

but I may venture to think that in the pursuit of this problem we ought to be pre-

pared at least to admit the possibility of a threefold influence of the sun.

Even from this very meagre sketch of one of the most interesting and important

of physical problems, it cannot fail to appear that while a good deal has already

been done, its progress in the future will very greatly depend on the completeness

Weof the method and continuity of the observations by which it is pursued.

have here a field which is of importance not merely' to one, or even to two, but

almost to every conceivable branch of research.

  Why should we not erect in it a sort of science-exchange into which the physi-

cist, the chemist, and the geologist may each carry the fruits of his research,

receiving back in return some suggestion, some principle, or some other scientific
commodity that will aid him in his own field ?

But to establish such a mart must be a national undertaking, and already several

nations have acknowledged their obligations in this respect.

Already the German Government have established a Sonneuwarte, the mere

building and equipment of which is to cost a large sum. With an appreciation of

what the spectroscope has done for this inquiry, the first directorsliip was offered

to Kirchhoff, and on his declining it, Ilerr Vogel has been placed in charge. In

France also a physical observatoi'y is to be erected at Fontenay, on an equal, if not

greater, scale, of which Janssen has already accepted the directorship while in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

Italy there are at least three observatories exclusively devoted to this branch of

research.

Nor must we forget that in this country the new observatory at Oxford has been

so arranged that it can be emploj-ed in such inquiries. But what has England as

a nation done ?

Some years since, at the Norwich Meeting of this Association, a movement was

set on foot by Colonel .Strange which resulted in the appointment of a Royal Com-

mission on the advancement of science, with the Dulce of Devonshire as chairman.

This Commission have quite recently reported on the steps that ought, in then-

opinion, to be taken for the advancement of scientific research.

One of their recommendations is expressed in the following words :
       . TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                         9

   "ImportJint classes of phenomena relating to physical meteorology and to terrestrial
and astronomical physics require observations of such a character that they cannot
be advantageously carried on otherwise than under the direction of Government.
Institutions for the study of such phenomena should be maintained by the Govern-
ment; and in particular an observatory should be founded specially devoted to

astronomical physics."

   If the men of science of this countiy who procured the appointment of this com-
mission, and who subsequently gave evidence before it, will now come forward to

support its recommendations, it can hardly be doubted that these will be speedily

carried into eftect.

  But other things besides observations are necessary if we are to pursue with

advantage this great physical problem.

   One of these is the removal of the intolerable burden that has hitherto been laid

upon private meteorologists and magneticians. Expected to furnish their tale of

bricks, they have been left to find their own straw. Nothing more wretched can
be imagined than the position of an amateur (that is to say, a man who pursues
science for the love of it and is unconnected with any establishment) who has set

himself to promote observational inquiries, whether in meteorology or magnetism.

   He has first to obtain, with great expenditure of time pr money, or both, copies
of the individual observations taken at some recognized institution. He has next
to reduce these in the way that suits his inquiry, an operation again consuming

time and demanding means. Let us suppose all this to be successfully accomplished

and a valuable result obtained. It is doubtless embodied in the Transactions of
some Society ; but it excites little enthusiasm, for it consists of something which

cannot be repeated by every one for himself like a new and interesting experiment.
Yet the position of such men has recently been improved. Several observatories and
other institutions now publish their individual observations ; this is done by our
Metereological Office, while Dr. Bergsma, Dr. Neumayer, and Mr. Broun are recent
examples of magneticians who have adopted this plan. The publication of the

work of the latter is due to the enhghtened patronage of the Rajah of Travancore,
who has thus placed himself in front of the princes of India and given them an ex-

ample which it is to be hoped they will foUow. But this is only one step in the right
direction ; another must consist in subsidizing private meteorologists and magne-
ticians in order to enable them to obtain the aid of computers in reducing the

observations with which they have been furnished. The man of science would

thus be able to devote his knowledge, derived from long study, to the methods
by which results, and the laws regulating them, are to be obtained ; he could be
the architect and builder of a scientific structure without being forced to waste his

energies on the work of a hodman.

Another hindrance consists in our deficient knowledge as to what observations
Weof value in magnetism and meteorology have already been made.
                                                                 ought to

have an exhaustive catalogue of all that has been done in this respect in oiu- globe,

and of the conditions under which the various observations wiU be accessible to

Aoutside inquirers.  catalogue of this kind has been framed by a committee of

this Association ; but it is confined to the dominions of England, and requires to

be supplemented by a list of that which has been done abroad.

  A third drawback is the insufficient nature of the present facilities for the inven-

tion and improvement of instruments and for their verification.

  We have no doubt advanced greatly in the construction of instruments, espe-

cially in those which are self-recording. The names of Brooke, Robinson, Welsh,

Osier, and Beckley will occur to us all as improvers of our instruments of obser-

vation. Sir W. Thomson has likewise adapted his electrometer to the wants of

meteorology. Dr. Roscoe has given us a self-recording actinometer ; but a good

instrument for observing the sun's heat is still a desideratum. It ought likewise
to be borne in mind that the standard mercurial thermometer is by no means a

perfect instrument.                                                            the

  mIn conclusion, it cannot be doubted that a great generalization is looming
--distance a mighty law, we cannot yet tell what, that will reach us, we cannot yet

say when. It will involve facts hitherto inexplicable, facts that are scarcely re-

ceived as such because they appear opposed to our present knowledge of tlieir causes.

It is not possible, perhaps, to hasten the arrival of this generalization beyond a

certain point ; but we ought not to forget that we can hasten it, and that it is our
duty to do so. It depends much on ourselves, our resolution, our earnestness, on
the scientific policy we adopt, as well as on the power we may have to devote our-

selves to special investigations, whether such an advent shall be realized in our day
and generation, or whether it shall be indefinitely postponed. If governments would
understand the ultimate material advantages of every step forward in science, how-

ever inapplicable each may appear for the moment to the wants or pleasures of

ordinaiy life, they would find reasons, patent to the meanest capacities, for bringing

the wealth of mind, now lost on the drudgery of common labours, to bear on the

search for those wondrous laws which govern every movement, not only of the
mighty masses of our system, but of every atom distributed throughout space.

                       On a Screw-complex of the Second Order,
                      By Professor E. S. Ball, LL.D., F.R.S.

   Denoting by 6^, B^. . . , the six coordinates of a screw, then an homogeneous
equation of the second degree, Ue=0, between the sLx coordinates denotes what

may be termed a screw-complex of the second order. If c* be a given screw, then

being a linear equation in 6^, . .., 6^, denotes the locus of screws about which a
body which has freedom of the fifth order can be twisted. To this system one

screw (ji is reciprocal ; and we may call the screw 6 thus defined the polar of the

=screw u, with respect to the screw-complex 11^ 0. The relation between « and

its polar is independent of the screws of reference.

   The locus of the screws about which a body can twist so that when it has the

unit of twist velocity its kinetic energy is zero is an imaginary screw-complex of
the second order. The polar of any screw » with respect to this screw-complex is

the screw an impulsive wrench on which would make the body commence to twist

    On tlie Analytical Form? called Factions. By Professor Catley, F.R.S.

    A faction is a product of difierences such that each letter occurs the same number

ot  times                              thus  we have a quadrifaction where each  letter  occurs twice, a cubifac-
                                    ;

Atiou where each letter occurs three times, and so on.                                   broken faction is one

which is a product of factions having no common letter ; thus

                                             {a-h)~(c-cl)(d-e){e-c)

is a broken quadrifaction, the product of the quadrifactions

                             {a~hf and {c-cl)(d-e){e-c).

We have, in regard to quadrifactions, the theorem that every quadrifaction is a

sum of broken quadrifactions such that each component quadriiaction contains two
or else three letters. Thus we have the identity

2{a-l){h-c){c-d){d-a) = (b-cy .((i-df-{c-ay . {b-d)^+{a-hy .(c-d)*,

which verifies the theorem in the case of a quadrifaction of four letters ; but the
verification even in the next following case of a quadrification of five letters is a
matter of some difficulty.

   The theory is connected with that of the invariants of a system of binary quantics.

FormulcB of Verification in Partitions. By J. W. L. Gi,aisher, M.A., F.R.S.

   At the Edinburgh Meeting (Report, 1871, Transactions of the Sections, pp. 23-
25) Sylvester gave a formula for verifying, in writing down all the partitions of a
given number w, that none had been omitted. The formula in question was that

     2(l--x+xy--xyz+.ryzw--&C.)--0,                                                                                                                  (1)

where in any partition x denotes the number of I's present, i/ the number of 2's, s

the number "of 3's, and the 2 extends to all the partitions ; so that 2l=N, the total

number of partitions of «.
   In this very elegant formula, however, as the terms are alternately positive and

negative, an omission may easily cancel itself ; ex. gr. if the omitted partition con-

tains one 1 and no 2, it would appear as 1 in the first term, as 1 in the second term,
and as zero in the succeeding terms, so that its omission would not be pointed out.
It becomes therefore a matter of interest to examine what the formula (1) becomes

if all the terms are taken with the positive sign.

The two formulae (1) and (2) taken together form a much better verification than
either singly ; viz. we have

                 =+2(l ay+a;i/2M?+&c.) 2(x+xyz+Scc.) = 22'-i,

in which we may replace 22''~i by 22', s denoting the number of cliaiu/es in any

partition.

   The following formulae afford additional verifications :
   II, From the identity

we have

                     2+2'-i = 0,1, or -1,

according as n is not a square, is an even square, or is an uneven square : the sign+

--is to be used if the partition contains an even number of terms, and the sign if

the number is uneven.

we have

                     22'= (-)»(E-R'),

where II denotes the number of representations* of « as the sum of an even number

of squares, and R' the number of representations as an uneven number of squares.

_  w=7To verify these results in the case       we have^ for II., considering the parti-

tions with an even number of terms,

                     22'-i=6x 2+1x2'= 16;

and for the partitions with an uneven number of parts,

                           22'-i=2x 1 + 5x2+1x2^=16,

thus verifying the theorem, since 7 is not a square.

   For III. the partitions of 7 as a sum of squares are two, viz.

                     1+1+1+4 and 1 + 1+1+1+1+1+1.

The former gives rise to 4 X 16 representations and the latter to 1 x 128 representa-

tions, and the formula becomes

                     64=(-)-{4x 10-128}.

The four theorems taken together, viz.

with     2(l+a?y+&c.) = 2(,x+xyz+&c.) = 22'-i = i(-)''(R-Il'),

                                  2+2'-i=0, 1, -1,

form a striking system of mutually related formnlje of verification.

   The author had investigated other systems, but this was the most satlsfactorv he
had met with.

Theorems on the n^^ roots of Unity. By J. W. L. Glaisher, M.A., F.M.S.

If n he any nimiber and if all the sets of r elements that can he formed from the

numerals 1, 2, 3 . . . w -- 1 be written down according; to any rule with regard to

sequences and breaks, then the sum of all these sets will always be rational if the

1--numerals 1, 2, 3 . . . w -- 1 be supposed to stand for  1--.r, .r-, 1 -- x^... 1--.%"-^,

X being any prime «th root of unity.

  To make the theorem clear, consider an example. Take n= 7, and write down

all the sets which can be formed from the numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, having (say) a

sequence of two and one break (». e. having two numbers consecutive and one non-

consecutive or isolated), viz. these are

124, 125, 126, 235, 236, 346, 341, 451, 452, 561, 562, 563

then the theorem asserts that x being a 7th root of unity, the expression

+ + 1-- 1--1 -X . 1--x^ . 1--x* 1 -.r . l-.r= . 1--x^
                                                           1--.r .  .r^ .  .r«+ . ,

                                               1--
+ + .rM--1-- 1--.r^' . 1--x'^ .                                     .r" . 1--z^
                                          .r^

is rational. The simplest case is that of a sequence without any brea k ; ex. gr. con-
sider a sequence of two, then, since 12, 23, 34, 45, 56 are the only sets, the theorem

asserts that

      l-x.l-x'-\-l--x^.\-x^-\-l--x\l~x^-\-l-x'.l~x' + \~xW-x^

is rational.

   The general mode of proof will be easily gathered from the demonstration of the
truth ot the theorem in the case of these two examples. Take the second first, and

consider the function of s,

                         +(1-=) {l-xz), = l Kz+-Qz\ say,

X being a 7th root of unity. Since 7 is a prime number every root is a prime root,

=and the roots of the equation .r'' l are x, x-, x^, x*, x', x^, 1 ; so that, substituting

successively these values for s, and adding the results, we see that

    0--x)(l-x.x) + {l-x''){\-x.x^)+(l-x'')(l-x.x^)+{\-x%\-x.x')
                   ++ {l-x')(\-x .x') l\-x'){l-x .x^)+{l-x'')0.-x .x')

A B(the last two terms being zero) is rational, since the coefficients of and vanish

by the summation.

   To prove the theorem in the case of the first example, note that all the sets may

 be obtained by starting with the three in which the sequence is 12, and continually
adding imity to each of the three numbers in each set, thus

                                               124,

the other columns. It is evident in this example that the three cycles include all

the sets which contain a sequence of two and one break ; so that the theorem is
Aproved for this case.
                        little consideration, however, shows too that if aU the sets

formed according to any fixed rule regulating the sequences and breaks be written

down, they must consist of a group (or cycle), or of an aggregation of several groups

each of which is rational. For consider any one set : it must belong to a group, for

we can obtain a group from it by increasing the numerals in it, each by unity, succes-
sively tiU it reproduces itself ; also no set can be common to two groups.

  We thus see that the truth of the general theorem depends upon two considera-

tions, viz. (i) upon the remark that any function such as

             + + X^)+(plx, x) (f){x, X^') <f)(x,  . . . (f)(x, Xn),

where

             4>{x, s) = A+B3+0s' . . . +P3"-i

PC(B,        being any non-infinite functions of x), is rational ; and (ii) upon the
       . ..

proposition that the total series of sets formed by arranging the numerals according

to any law of sequences and breaks consists of the aggregation of groups.

   It is evident that the theorem is equally true if we imderstahd 1, 2, 3 ... to mean

or even                 (Y-ccy, {i-x^r, (1-xy-,...,

                        (l-.r)", Q.-x'^Y, (l-.r')» . . .

or, in fact, any functions

                            ^{x, x), <l>{x, X-) . . .

=subject to the conditions that ^(.i', 1) 0, and that in the development of the type

expression involving s the coefficients of the terms in s", s», s^n . . . are to be inde-
pendent of X.

   If the former condition is not satisfied, the theorem is still ti'ue if the sets are

formed from the series of numerals 1, 2, 3 . n. . (i. e. including n). With this

alteration therefore the theorem is true for

             1+x, l+a:^ . . . or for (l-1-.r)", (l+^O" · · ·

The point of the theorem lies in the fact that functions of the roots of an equation
which are not in appearance symmetrical, are rational ; but it is generally quite
easy to go further and assign the absolute values of any of the expressions con-

sidered, since the value of any gi-oup is readily assigned : ex. gr. consider the

group written above, viz. 124+23o-f 346-J-56] j this is

         =2(1-- ^)(1--a:2)(l-a;=3) 2 (l+As+Bs^+Cs^), for s=.r,a?=' . . . x'
                                     = 7,

=n 1--and generally each group                             .r, 1 x^ · · · )> ^° ^^^* ^^®
                            (1, 2 . . . standing for
=value of an expression n times the number of groups it contains.

It is also to be noted that very often it is not necessary that x should be a prime

7ith. root ; ex. gr. in the expression just written it is enough that

                            22=0, 2s2=0, =2s' 0,

i. e. that neither x, x'^, nor x' should be unity. In this particular instance, since 7

is prime, every root is a prime root; but whatever 7i may be, if there be only

three numerals in each set, it is enough that a; is an nih. root which is not a square
or cube root of unity ; and the generalization of this remark is obvious.

               I. On the Shadows of Plane Curves on Spheres *.

   1. M. Chasles, in his Geometrical Memoirs on Spherical Conies (which laid the
foundation of the subject), has investigated several of their properties from projec-

tions of the circles lying in a cyclic plane of the cone.

   It was proposed to establish general analytical processes which should embrace
these theorems, particularly as that geometer has urged the subject on analysts.

   2. The several systems of coordinates in ordinary use were adapted from plane

to spherical geometry.
   Cartesian coordinates are reduced from gnomonic projection to Gudermann's

system, in which the coordinates of a point, whether rectangular or oblique, are

tangents of the arcs intercepted on the arcs of reference. From gnomonic projec-

tion, Boothian tangential coordinates are represented on the sphere by cotangents
of the arcs intercepted on the arcs of reference.

   Ex. The focal equation to the plane conic

                                 =- l-|-ecos^.

The equation to its projection on the sphere has the same form^

where the symbols have the ordinary acceptation.
   The same process was shown to be applicable to determine the analytical forms

and geometrical properties of both pole- and polar-spherical curves.
   3. Equations to a circle or conic, which are expressed in rectangular coordinates

in a cyclic plane of a cone, were converted into three-point tangential equations of

the projected spherical ciu-ve.

   Two points of reference are situated in the cyclic arc, and the third is the polar
point of the cyclic arc with respect to the spherical conic. By this process the several

properties of the spherical conic which relate to a single cyclic arc are simply
deduced from those of the plane circle, in following the geometrical guidance of

M. Chasles.
   4. Formula3 were next given to express the shadow of a plane curve, as deter-

mined by tiilinear coordinates, by spherical coordinates.

By this process it was shown that the shadow of a circular cubic has the shadow

of the line at infinity for a cyclic arc. The shadow of a Cartesian, which has cusps

at the circular points at infinity, has two (and may have three) coincident cycUc

arcs in the shadow of the line at infinity.

   5. Formulre were given to determine the tangential equation of the shadow on a
sphere of a plane curve, which is itself expressed by tangential coordinates

OA smp OB OBp' : q' : r' ; :
                                     : sin q : sin?-

                     amp: : p^ sin a         : p.^ sin 6 sin j : ^3 sin c sin r.

In the particular case where OA, OB, OC are equal, the formuloe of transformation

are identical in form.

   These formulae were applied to deduce equations to spherical curves, and in par-
ticular to investigate the projections of the circular points at infinity, and their

properties.

   G. This outline of the doctrine of projection on the sphere may be regarded as
a separate chapter in spherical analytical geometry, and may suggest further deve-

lopments of the subject by following the lead of the great French geometer.

        II. On Cubic SrHEEiCAL Cubves with triple Cyclic Arcs and

                                                    TRIPLE Foci.

 --1. On the classi/tcation of cubic cones and spherical ctibics. There are five cubic
--cones simplex, complex, crunodal, acnodal, and cuspidal, to use the nomenclature

of Prof Cayley. The singular and non-singular forms have been studied in the
canonical and other distinct equations.

 --It is here proposed to classify them according to their cyclic planes or arcs (1)

with three single cyclic arcs, (2^ one double and another single, and (3) with a
triple cyclic arc. The classification of Newton and PlUcker for plane cubics will

thus be imitated ; but the number of groups is much less, viz. three in all.
   As there are three real foci in a plane curve of the third class, it is inferred that

there are three real foci in a spherical cubic of the same class, since the tangential

equations to both are identical in form ; hence, by reciprocation, there are three

cyclic planes in a cubic cone of the third order. The three groups may be con-

veniently studied in trilinear equations :

                     =(1) Ka^iy la-\-m^-\-nv,

                     (2) Ka'fi =y,

                     =(3) Ka'                ^,

where ac is the variable perimeter in each group. The left-hand side defines the
cyclic arcs, the right-hand the satellite arc. The symbols denote the sines of the

respective arcs. If the variables be interpreted as tangential coordinates, these

--three groups represent all cubics of the third class both plane and spherical viz.

(1) with three single foci, (2) with one double and one single focus, (3) with one

triple focus,

   As this investigatioii has a double interest, it is desirable that the five cubic

cones of the third class should have distinctive names*.

 --2. On the cubic referred to a triple cyclic arc. Let the triple cyclic arc and its

satellite include any angle c ; since the third arc of reference is arbitrary, assume
it to be the quadrantal polar of the intersection of the other two.

   The trilinear equation to this group is

              Ka'+3i3(4;t=)=0, vrhere (4m=) denotes a=+/3^+cV+2ai3 cose,

the expression for six times the volume of the plane tetrahedron formed by the
centre of the sphere and the vertices of the spherical triangle of reference. (The

symbols may denote the sines of the arcs in question.) It is seen that the cubics of

this group have a diametral arc and a Nevytonian centre at the point of inflexion.

 --3. All cubics with trijile cyclic arcs have triple foci. The equivalent tangential

equation to these cubics denotes in general curves of the sixth class,

       +9»:V'(2=+r=)2+.32K(;;y+>-^ cos e)^-- 36/c(j^' >") (r+r-) (pq+r' cos c)

                       +12(p''+7-y(p-+q^+c-r^---2pqcosc) = 0.

This equation may be arranged to exhibit the triple focus

          (p--q cos c) {9K'(2pq cos c--p^--q-) (p--q cos c) --4iK(q--p cos c)'}
                               +(/>^+y^+cV-- 2pg' cos c)wi=0.

 --4. If the non-singular cubics of this group be complex, all six real foci are situated

on the dia7netral arc ; if simplex, only four. After removing the factor which de-
notes the triple focus from the preceding tangential equation, the remaining factor

denotes three other foci,

                      9k(2/}2 cose--;;--- j')(p-- g cose)-- 4(5'--^ cosc)^

Its discriminant will be found to be the same as that of the given cubic equation

--to the curve. Hence follows the truth of the proposition.
   5. Critic centres in the general case. Pliicker has defined them for plane cubic
curves as middle points, irrespective of their being the sites of nodes.

  A plane cubic of a particular group intersects the lines of reference in three col-

linear fixed points : the locus of the middle point of a straight line through one of
these points, intercepted between the other two lines of reference, is a hyperbola

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the intersection of three such hyperbolae determines the critic centi-es.

   The same definition is applicable to spherical cubics.
   In particular, if {Ka^y=la-\-m^-\-7iy) denote a spherical cubic of the first group
refen-ed to three rectangular arcs of reference, the critic centres determined by this
definition are the intersections of three non-singular complex cubics with concur-

rent cyclic arcs,

that for values of c between 30° and 150° the curve is simplex, and there is no

nodal point.
    In particular, if the cyclic arc and its satellite are at right angles to each other,

the cubic is simplex and trilateral or campaniform.

   At the terminal values, c=+30°, the cubic is cuspidal, and will be separately

considered.

   If 4 cos ^O'S, the cubic may have all four forms, according to the value of the

   8. By dualizing, corresponding theorems may be obtained for cubics of the third
class with triple foci and triple cyclic arcs. The properties of plane cubics of this
class may be deduced, although, as in cubics of the third order, they are not co-

extensive.

   There are three species only in piano of trifocal cubics (complex, bitangential,
and simplex), whereas all five occur in trifocal spherical cubics. Plane trifocal
cubics exhibit (in their point-equations) cusps at infinity, but have not coincident

asymptotes.

   If we consider any number of quantities, say four, -whose product xyzu is equal

=to a contstant jij, their sum, S, ,r+»/+s+M, is the smallest possible when they are

all equal ; for if two of the quantities are unequal, we can diminish their sum Si
by replacing each by the square root of their product. From these well-known
principles we can deduce the solution of a celebrated question, known as Huyghens's

problem, as follows :

   2. The sums of the products of these quantities, taken two and two and three
and three, viz.

              S.;^=xy^xz+m-\-yz-^yu-\-zu, S^ = xyz+xyu+xzu-]-t/zu,

are composed of terms which, multiplied together, give a constant product jj,. S3

and S, will therefore have their smallest possible values when the terms are equal,

viz. when x=y=z = u.

   3. The product,

         V=a + x)il+i/)Q.+z)(l+u), which =l+Si+S,+S3+i>,

is the least possible when x=y=z=u, because then Sj, Sj, S3 have their minima

values.

--taining n variables in treating the well-known question (Huyghens's) : " Let there

be any number of perfectly elastic balls ranged in a straight line ; the first strikes

the second with a given velocity, the second with the velocity communicated by

the first strikes the third, the third strikes the fourth, and so on. The masses a

and h of the first and the last being given, determine the masses of the intermediate

balls that the last may receive the maximum velocity." M. Picart has treated this

question by means of the difierential calculus (' Nouvelles Annales de MathtSma-

tiques,' 1874, pp. 212-219) ; but the investigation is long. The mathematicians
who had solved it previously (Huygheus, Lagrange, &c.) have, he states, only de-

Hmonstrated that was really a maximum in the case of three balls. The present

note contains a simple and complete solution by means only of elementary algebra.

gular solution. When this singular solution exists, we have simultaneously the

three relations

Besides, in general, the two equations (5) or (6) have as a consequence the third

equation (A) or (B), contrary to what takes place in the first case t.

    2. M. Darboux, to whom is due the subdivision of the subject as indicated above,

Wehas given several examples where the rule II. seems to fail.  shall show that

this is not the case if we introduce in the injinitedmal analysis the notion of singular

which does not satisfy the equation, as it belongs to the case of exception (7), viz.

J--5-= 00 ; the system (6) is not equivalent to (4). The latter gives

The systems (5) and (6) lead to the relation ?/+a;^=0, which is not a singular solu-
tion, as it also belongs to the case of exception (7). But the systems (3) and (4)

lead to

                  z--x=(X>, or »/y+x^--x=aci                                        (")

a relation which is in a certain sense a singular solution of the given equation.
To show this, put

                          »/y+x^--xs=A, or y=2Ax+A?,

and we deduce

                                           2A

On the other hand, the curves represented by the general integral have, after (8),

for the coefficient of the direction of their tangent

                             x'=-AL

AIf increases indefinitely, these two values of x' tend towards the common limit

zero. In a certain sense, therefore, the equation (9) represents a singular solution
of the given equation.

   These two examples are sufficient to explain the apparent exceptions to rule II.,
which we may consequently regard as giving all the singular solutions which are
not at the same time particular integrals.

Contributions to the Mathematics of the Chessboard. By H. Martyn Taylor,

                M.A., Felloiv and Tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge.

   The object of the paper was to ascertain the relative values of the pieces on a
chessboard. If a piece be placed on a square of a chessboard, the number of squares
it commands depends in general on its position. If we calculate the average num-
                                                                  --

ber of squares which any particular piece commands when placed in succession on

every square of the hoard, it seems fair to assume that this gives a not very inexact

measm-e of the value of the piece.

 -- AFor special reasons the above problem is stated in the following manner : "

kino- and a piece of different colours are placed at random on two squares of a chess-

hoard of tx^ squares : it is required to find the chance that the king is in check."

The ordinary chessboard has an even number of squares ; and as some of the results

take difierent forms for odd and even values of n, the residts are here given merely

for even values of w, and the results for the ordinary chessboard of sixty-four squares

deduced from them. As the relative values of the knight and bishop on the ordi-

nary chessboard on this hypothesis come out in a ratio very different from the ratio

that is ordinarily received by chess-players, it occurred to the author to investigate
the chance that'when a king and a piece of different colours were placed at random

on two squares of a board, the king should be in check but unable to take the

piece. This check is called safe check in distinction to a mere check, which may

be safe or unsafe, which is called simple check.

                                            ASTEOKOMT.

 On the Total Solar Eclipse of April 5, 1875, observed at Bangchallo {Siam).
                                    By Dr. J. Janssen.

   Dr. Janssen used a special telescope for the study of the corona. The results
obtained by the observations are as follows :

   1. It was established that the line 1474 is infinitely more pronounced in the
corona than in the protuberances. This line seems even to stop abruptly at the
edge of the protuberances without penetrating them. The light, therefore, which
this line 1474 gives belongs especially to the corona. This observation is one of
the strongest evidences that can be brought forward to prove that the corona is
a real object, matter radiating by itself. The existence of a solar atmosphere
situated beyond the chromosphere (an atmosphere that Dr. Janssen had recognized

--in 1871 and proposed to call the coronal atmosphere) thus receives confirmation.
   2. Height of the Coronal Atmosphere. In 1871 Dr. Janssen announced that the
coronal atmosphere extended from a distance of half the sun's radius to the distance
of a whole radius at certain points. This assertion has been confirmed not only by

the direct observation of the phenomenon, but also by photography. At Dr.

Janssen's request, Dr. Schuster took photographs of the corona with exposures of
one, two, four, and eight seconds. In this series of photographs the height of the
corona increases with the time of exposure. The height of the corona in the eight-
seconds' photograph exceeds at some points the sun's radius. (It is true that
account ought to be taken of the influence of the terrestrial atmosphere.)

   3. As the sky was not perfectly clear at Bangchallo, Dr. Janssen was enabled to
observe phenomena that explain previous observations of eclipses which seemed
to invalidate the existence of the corona as an incandescent gaseous medium.

   On the whole the observations of April 5, 1875, have advanced us a fresh step
in the knowledge of the corona by bringing forward new proofs of the existence of

an atmosphere round the sun, principally gaseous, incandescent, and very extended.

     Transit of Venus, December 8, 1874.

By the Rev. S. J. Peekt, F.R.S. , F.R.A.S.

The remarks made refen-ed mostly to the Kerguelen Expedition, of which the

author had the charge.

  Some of the members of this Expedition left England on May 20, and the rest

on June 20, 1874. All met at the Cape of Good Hope, and proceeded thence in
two of H.M. vessels, the 'Volage' (Captain Fairfax, R.N.) and the 'Supply'
(Captain Inglis, R.N.). The Crozetswere passed with fair wind and weather; but

a storm encoimtered off Kerguelen delayed the landing for two days. During this
time many of the sheep, goats, and oxen, and other live stock taken on board at

the Cape were destroyed, and a large boat carried off by the waves. No injury

. was sustained by the instruments, except the deck thermometers, and no lives were

lost,

  A few days were spent in surveying the west and south coasts of Royal Sound,

and two excellent stations were found by the aid of Captain Bailey, of the sealing

schooner ' Emma Jane.' The huts and instruments were erected at once at the

Aprincipal station, and three weeks later at the second station.  third station was

occupied a few days before the transit, as it was found to be perfectly impracticable
to attempt observations at MacDonald Island.

   The weather generally was not so bad as we had been led to expect ; but we were

visited by snow-storms even in the middle of summer, and the wind blew half a

gale at least five days out of every seven. Still we were free from mist, and the
sky was fairly fine during at least part of most days.
                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                       25

On the morning of the transit the preparations were all complete, and every

assistance was rendered to the astronomers by Captain Fairfax and Captain Inglia

and the other officers. At Stations 2 and 3 excellent results were obtained at

ingress ; but a cloud prevented internal contact being obtained at Station 1. During

the progress of the transit a few photographs, and some measures with the double-

image micrometer, were taken at Station 1, clouds, however, interfering with con-

tinuous work. At egress both internal and external contact were observed at

Stations 1 and 3.

Considering the position of the Island of Desolation, these results were considered

satisfactory, and the determination of the longitude was pursued with all possible

Aenergy.  most successful chronometer-run had been made from the Cape of Good

Hope under the direction of Lieut. C. Corbet, R.N., who also connected the three

British Stations in Kerguelen with those of America and Germany ; but as the

longitude must depend mainly on lunar observations, no opportunity was lost of

observing the moon. An altazimuth, especially designed by Sir G. B. Airy for

Kerguelen, procured for the longitude ninety double observations of the moon's

azimuth or zenith-distance ; whilst the transit gave nineteen meridian passages of

the moon, and the equatorial one occultation.

In the mean time the observers carried on a very complete series of meteorological

and magnetic observations, which were continued during the homeward journey,

and the Rev. A. E. Eaton studied the natural history of tue island.

Goats and rabbits were left on the island to propagate.

On February 26th the lunar observations were considered sufficient to secure a

fundamental longitude ; and, provisions running short, in less than two hom-s after
the last meridian observation of the moon H.M.S. ' Volage ' and ' Supply' were on

their way, one to Ceylon, the other to the Cape.

About a week after leaving the Island of Desolation H.M.S. 'Volage' encountered

a cyclone, which might have ended unfortunately for the observers, though their

observations were secured by being sent home in duplicate on board H.M.S.

'Supply' and the 'Monongahela,' U.S.N.

  The other Government Expeditions were sent to the Sandwich Islands, to New
Zealand, Egypt, and Rodriguez ; and all were successfid except New Zealand, where

only a few micrometric measm-es were obtained.

The Stations in India and Australia, Lord Lindsay at Mauritius, and other

private observers were also fairly fortunate ; so that we may hope that England will

aid largely towards the accurate determination of the solar parallax.

On the Ratio of the Actinic Poiver to the Illuminating Poiver of the Magneto-

     Electric Light. By Capt. W. de W. Abnet, B.E., F.O.S., F.B.A.S.

   In some recent experiments with magneto-electric machines driven at varying
speeds, and consequently with varying engine-power, the author obtained photo-
metric measurements, by optical and also photographic means, of the dift'erent

intensities of the light produced.

   At iii'st sight a discrepancy seemed to arise between the resiilts obtained from
the two distinct methods. When, however, the values were laid down graphically,
showing the power of the lights in comparison with the work expended in their
production, the resulting cm-ves became interesting ; they showed that the actinic
power of the light diminished much more rapidly than the optical power as the
" work done " decreased.

   The results of the experiments also showed that there is a certain point for each
machine beyond which it is wasteful to increase the motive power, the increase in

optical or actinic value of the light being very small.

                        On Mirage at Sea. By Dr. J. Janssen.

   Many facts relating to the phenomena of mirage at sea are already known ; but

the anther has paid great attention to these appearances in aU his voyages since

--1868, and has made some remarkable observations on mirage, especially at sunrise

and sunset. lie has established : 1. That the mirage is nearly constant at the
sm-face of the sea. 2. That the appearances can be explained by assuming the
existence of a plane of total reflection, situated at a certain height above the sea.
3. That the phenomena are due to the thermic and hygrometric action of the sea
upon the neighbouring atmospheric strata. 4. That there exist at sea direct,
inverse, lateral, and other mirages. 6. That these phenomena have a very general
influence upon the apparent height of the sea-horizon, which is sometimes lowered,
sometimes raised.

    This variation of the apparent horizon it is very important to take into account,

if we consider the use made of the horizon in nautical astronomy.

On the Photographic Revolver, and on the Observations of the Transit of Venus

who was provided with a 6-inch telescope. He observed facts which attest the

existence of an atmosphere round Venus.

                   On the Optical Properties of a Titano-Siticic Glass.
                        By Professor Stokes and J. Hopeinson.

    At the Meeting of the Association at Edinburgh in 1871, Professor Stokes gave
 a preliminary account of a long series of researches in which the late Mr. Vernon
 Harcoiu-t had been engaged on the optical properties of glasses of a great variety
 of composition, and in which, since 1802, Professor Stokes had cooperated with
 him*. One object of the research was to obtain, if possible, two glasses which

 should achromatize each other without leaving a secondary spectrum, or a glass
 which should form with two others a triple combination, an objective composed
 of which should be fiee from defects of irrationality, without requiring undue

 curvature in the individual lenses. Among phdsphatic glasses, the series in which

 Mr. Hareourt's experiments were for the most part carried on, the best solution of
 this problem was oflTered by glasses in which a portion of the phosphoric was
 replaced by titanic acid. It was found, in fact, that the substitution of titanic for

phosphoric acid, while raising, it is true, the dispersive power,_ at the same time

end of the spectrum, which ordinarily beloupfS only to glasses of a much higher

Adispersive power.  telescope made ot disks of glass prepared by Mr. Ilarcourt

was, after his death, constructed for Mrs. Harcourt by Mr. Iloward Grubb, and was

exliibited to tlie Mathematical Section at the late Meeting in Belfast. This telescope,

which is briefly described in the ' Report' *, was found fully to answer the expec-

tations that had been formed of it as to destruction of secondary dispersion.

Several considerations seemed to make it probable that the substitution of titanic

acid for a portion of the silica in an ordinary crown glass would have an effect

similar to what had been observed in the phosphatic series of glasses. Phosphatic

glasses are too soft for convenient employment in  optical  instruments                                                          but should
                                                                                                                              ;

titano-silicic glasses prove to be to silicic what titano-phosphatic glasses had been

foimd to be to phosphatic, it would be possible, without encountering any extra-

vagant curvatures, to construct perfectly achromatic combinations out of glasses

having the hardness and permanence of silicic glasses; in fact the chief obstacle at

present existing to the perfection of the achromatic telescope would be removed,

though naturally not without some increase to the cost of the instrument. But it

would be beyond the resources of the laboratory to work with silicic glasses on

such a scale as to obtain them free from striae, or even sufhciently free to permit of

a trustworthy determination of such a delicate matter as the irrationality of

dispersion.

  When the subject was brought to the notice of Mr. Hopkinson he warmly

entered into the investigation ; and, thanks to the liberality with which the means
of conducting the experiment were placed at his disposal by Messrs. Chance

iJrothers, of Birmingham, the question may perhaps be considered settled. After

some preliminary trials, a pot of glass free from strins was prepared of titanate of
potash mixed with the ordinary ingredients of a crown glass. As the object of

the experiment was merely to determine, in the first instance, whether titanic acid

did or did not confer on the glass the unusual property of separating the colours at

the blue end of the spectrum materially more, and at the red end materially less^

than corresponds to a similar dispersive power in ordinary glasses, it was not thought

necessary to employ pure titanic acid ; and rutile fused with carbonate of potash

was used as titanate of potash.  The  glass  contained about  7 per cent,                                                        of  rutile
                                                                                                                                                          ;

and as rutile is mainly titanic acid, and none was lost, the percentage of titanic

acid cannot have been much less. The glass was naturally greenish, from iron

contained in the rutile; but this did not affect the observations, and the quantity

of iron would be too minute sensibly to affect the irrationality.

Out of this glass two prisms were cut. One of these was examined as to

irrationality by Professor Stokes, by his method of compensating prisms, the other

by Mr. Hopkinson, by accurate mea'sm-es of the refractive indices for several definite

points in the spectrum. These two perfectly distinct methods led to the same

--result namely, that the glass spaces out the more as compared with the less

refrangible part of the spectrum no more than an ordinary glass of similar disper-

sive power. As in the phosphatic series, the titanium reveals its presence by a

considerable increase of dispersive power ; but, unlike wliat was observed in that

series, it produces no sensible effect on the irrationality. The hopes, therefore, that

had been entertained of its utility in silicic glasses prepared for optical purposes

appear doomed to disappointment.

 --P.S. Mr. Augustus Vernon Ilarcourt has now completed an analytical deter-

mination which he kindly undertook of the titanic acid. From 2-171 grammes of

the glass he obtained -13 gramme of pure titanic acid, which is as nearly as possible

per cent.

On the Decomposition of an Electrolyte hy Magneto-Electric Induction *.

                  By J. A. Fleming, B.Sc. {Lond.), F.C.S.

When a solid conductor is moved on a magnetic field induced cun-ents are

created in it. In a solid these expend themselves partly or wholly in producing

heat in the conductor. This paper is occupied with an examination of the effect

produced on electrolytes under the same circumstances, viz. when made to flow or

move in a magnetic field. Experiments are described to show, first, that induced

currents are produced under these conditions in electrolytes, and then that the

electroljiie is to some slight extent decomposed by these currents.

--AThe experiment which gives gi-oxmds for making this statement may briefly be
described thus :                           glass tuhe, 2 centims. in diameter, has platinum plates placed

in its interior at the sides ; these are welded to platinum wires sealed through the

^lass. The tuhe is supported between the poles of a powerful electromagnet

in such a way that the tube is perpendicular, and the line joining the plates is at

right angles to the line joining tlie poles. This tube is connected, by means of a

siphon, with a reservoir of dilute sulphm-ic acid, placed at a height of ahout

3 metres above the floor. After filling the tube and siphon and carefully depo-

larizing the plates, the magnet is magnetized by a current from twenty Grove's

cells, and then the plates connected by wires with a delicate mirror-galvanometer

in another room.

On allowing the liquid to flow down, the galvanometer indicates a cun-ent

passing across fi:om one platinum plate to another; this is the induced cuiTent

created by the flow of the liquid in the magnetic field. Various and numerous

precautions have to be taken to prevent any movement or vibration of the platinum

plates and variation in the strength of the field. The magnet being kept mag-

netized, the plates are then short-circuited, after having been carefully depolarized,

and the liquid allowed to flow down. When the acid is nearly exhausted, this

shorty circuit is broken and the flow of the liquid immediately after stopped.

--On joining the plates to the galvanometer a reverse current is now perceived that is,

one opposite in dii-ection to the real induced current. This indicates that the

plates have become polarized again hy the effect of the induced current created
by the flow of the electrolyte in the magnetic field. It was found that this polari-

zation could be rendered more decided by covering over the platinum plates with a

layer of coarse cloth, or by placing a cloth tuhe in the interior of the glass one in

such a way that the liqiud flows down the imide of this tube, but the platinum

plates are on the outside. The reason of this is because the rapid downrush of the
liquid mechanically clears away the film of gases from the plates, and so renders

the polarization less than it should be.

   In the last part of the paper the question is raised of how far the foregoing facts
may have interfered with the success of Faraday's experiment on the flow of the
Thapes at Waterloo Bridge. Since this polarization introduces a reverse electro-

motive force, unless the electromotive force due to the strength of field and velo-
city and width of stream is greater than that required to decompose water, no
permanent current can be produced in an electrolyte flowing in a magnetic field

but only a transient one, the strength of the induced ciu-rent rapidly decreasing as

it polarizes the electrodes.

On the Influence of the Physical Properties of Water on Climate. By Henry

    Hennessy, F.B.S., Professor of Aj^plied Mathematics in the Boyal College

    of Science for Ireland.

   The conditions of climate depend essentially on the thermal properties of the
materials of the earth's outer coating. These materials are solid, liquid, and gaseous
and inaccurate ideas as to the relative thermal influence of these several substances
necessarily lead to erroneous conclusions regarding problems of climate aii'ecting
both the present meteorology of the globe and its past geological history.

 --Several years since Sir John Herschel enunciated his views on this question very

clearly in the following words : " The effect of land imder sunshine is to throw
heat into the general atmosphere and to distribute it by the carrying-power of the
air over the whole earth.

   "Water is much less effective in this respect, the heat penetrating its depths and

being there absorbed, so that the surface never acquires a very elevated temperature,

even imder the equator "*. These views, owing to the high name of their author,
have naturally commanded much attention, and have been quoted in support of
theories of terrestrial climate. This has been done especially by the late Sir Charles
Lyell, in all the recent editions of his celebrated ' Principles of Geology.' As Sir
John Herschel's views may still exercise an important indii-ect influence over in-

quiries into terrestrial climate, the author called attention to the entirely different

conclusions presented by him some time before the publication of the edition of
Sir John Herschel's work from which the foregoing passage is quoted.

   On carefully considering the properties of land, air, and water, with reference to

heat (namely, their specific heat or capacity for heat, their properties with reference
to conduction and convection, radiation and diathermancy), he came to the conclusion
that of all substances largely existing in nature, water was that most favourable to
the absorption and distribution of solar heat throughout the external coating of the

earth.

   The relative heat-storing power of substances depends upon their specific heat ; and
thus the results published by Pfaundler in Poggendorff's 'Annalen ' lor October 18G6,

p. 102, have an immediate bearing on our inquiries. He has found that the specific
neat of soils varies from 0-50 down to0*19, taking the specific heat of water as unit.

The lowest specific heat is found in sandy soils free from vegetable earth or humus.

We may in general assume that dry sand, whether calcareous or siliceous, has only

one fifth of the specific heat of water. As we might expect, this inquirer has found

that small capacities for heat are favourable to great fluctuations of soil-teuiperatwre,

Awliile large capacities have tlie effect of lessening sucli fluctuations.  sandy soil,

Bucli as tfiat of the great African desert, although capable of exhibiting a very high

temperatui-e diu-ing the day, becomes cooled down during the night, and is one of '

 ^the worst substances for storing up the heat derived from sunshine. Water, on the

.

contrary, stores up such heat better than almost any other bodj'i

The grounds for the author's conclusions as to the thermal properties of

water wer§ fully exhibited in a paper published in the 'Atlantis ' and the ' Philoso-

phical Magazine' for 1859, and subsequently republished wholly or partially in
some foreign scientific journals. Instead of the dictum expressed by Sir John

Herschel, we may make the following almost diametrically opposite announcement.

The effect of land receiving simshine is to throw off the heat it receives, not only

into the atmosphere, but into the interplanetary spaces by night as well as by day ;
and thus, although it rapidly produces a considerable increase of temperature in the

stratum of an- immediatelj^ in contact with it during the day, it is iU adapted for

storing up and retaining the thermal energy it has received. Water is much more

effective in this respect ; heat penetrates to a gi-eater depth within it, and afterwards

becomes more steadily absorbed, owing to the much higher specific heat of water

and the ratchet-wheel action exercised on the luminous heat-rays from the sim,

which, on their transformation into obscm-e rays, cannot again return through the

liquid. Prof. Tyndall has established that this ratchet-wheel action of water exists

for water in its vaporous state as well as in its ordinary condition, and accordingly

that a vapour-charged atmosphere, though comparatively diathermanous for the

sun's heat-rays, which pass without considerable loss to the earth's surface, j'et this

moist air almost completely stops the radiation of non-luminous heat from the

ground.

   In his earlier researches the author pointed out how the distribution of heat over

the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and the general laws followed in the distri-

bution of the isothermal lines of islands, and especiallj' in the British Isles, confirmed

these views.

At this Meeting a remarkable confirmation is afforded by the results communi-

 cated by Captain Toj-nbee, whereby he has shown that in the equatorial Atlantic

.

 the water-surface temperature is higher than the air-temperature above it. With

regard to geological climate, these conclusions were long since adopted and acknow-

ledged by Professor Phillips. They have been also adopted, but not acknowledged,

bj' other writers besides the distinguished and lamented geologist to whom this

Association is so gTcatly indebted.

The distribution of terrestrial temperature depends essentially both on oceanic

and atmospheric cm-rents, and the question of oceanic circulation is thus closely

--connected with that of climate. Much attention has been recently excited by two

theories one which ascribes oceanic currents to the motions of the atmosphere, and

the other to the direct influence of gravity on masses of water unequally heated.

This or the gravitation-theory has been already broached in the author's paper

already referred to. It has been recently pm'sued in more detail, and with his

usual ability, by Dr. Carpenter.

On the possible Tn-fluence on Climate of tJie suhstitution of Water for Land in
         Central and Northern Africa. By Prof. H. Hennesst, F.R.S.

   The author referred to the fact that more than six years since he had put forward
proofs of the connexion between some of the hot winds which blow from the south-
west in Central and Southern Europe with the currents of the Atlantic and not with
the desert of Sahara, as has been usually supposed *. Similar views had been also
enunciated by Prof. 'W^ild, Director of the Physical Observatory of Russia, Prof.
Dufour of Lausanne, Dr. Hann, and other meteorologists. The attention excited
by the great midday heat of Central Africa caused many to overlook the
remarkably low nocturnal temperature, and thus to ascribe to the desert a thermal
influence which it does not possess. The conclusions which the author has established
with regard to the physical properties of water in connexion with climate (of which

a resume is presented in tJie preceding paper) enable ua to infer that the substitution

of an area of water over the Sahara for the existing dry land would be followed by

the storing up of the heat received so largely in that region from the sun's rays

which is now partly dissipated by nocturnal radiation.               - -_

A great Mediterranean sea in Africa, possessing an area equal to theGulf ofMexicb

and Caribbean Sea, would become, like these seas, a som-ce of positive thermal in-

fluence on distant places. In the Red Sea the temperature is high by night as

well aa by day, and this would also occur in the hypothetical Mediterranean of the
Sahara. The evaporation from its surface would give to the air above an immense

mass of vapour containing heat in a potential or latent state. This vapour-charged

atmosphere, like a similar atmosphere over the Atlantic, would tend, in consequence

of the earth's rotation, to move from south-west towards north-east, thus carrying

heat towards the western regions of Asia and the eastern part of Europe. Theclimatal
etiect of this sea would, upon the whole, result in a higher mean temperatm-e for

these parts of the globe, and it would undoubtedly not operate in producing a lower

temperature in Europe so as to cause a descent of the snow-line. Its action, if any,

would probably be the reverse.

On the apparent Connexion between Sun-spots, Atmospheric Ozone, Bain, and

                Force of Wind. By J. Moffat, M.D., F.G.S., 4'C.

   In this paper the author stated that, in discussing ozone observations from 1850-69,

he observed that the maximum and minimum of atmospheric ozone occurred in
cycles of years, and that he had compared the number of new groups of sun-spots in

each year of these cycles with the quantity of ozone ; and the results showed that

in each cycle of maximum of ozone there is an increase in the number of new groups
of sun-spots, and in each cycle of minimum of ozone there is a decrease in the num-
ber of new groups of sun-spots.

   In a Table he also showed that there is an increase in the quantity of rain and

the force of wind with the maximum quantity of ozone and sun-spots, and a de-
crease in these with the minimum of ozone and sun-spots.

On tlie Rainfall in Monmouthshire and the Severn Valley on July liih, and
    on some subsequent Floods in England and Wales. By G. J. Stmons.

The author stated that it would hardly have been right to say nothing about the

wonderful rainfall in the neighbourhood of Bristol on the day named. The rainfall

was simply a mass of vapour that came up from the west, and commenced to fall as

rain at Tenby between midnight and 1 a.m. on the morning of the 14th of July.

Its front edge travelled at the rate of about 18 miles an hour ; and at 4 p.m. on the

same day it passed off by the north coast of Norfolk. As to its breadth, it took

about 36 hours to pass over any given point. The quantity of water that feU varied

very much over the whole country, and was deepest on the west side of a line drawn

from the Isle of Wight to the Isle of Sheppey, and thence to the north-west. Most

stations in Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire had a rainfall of over 3 inches; at

fourteen stations the rainfall exceeded 4 inches, at six it was over 5 inches; and

at Tintern Abbey, usually considered a dry station, the rainfall was 5-31 inches in

24 hours. The result of this heavy rain was, as many of the inhabitants of Bristol

knew too well, that most of the low-lying parts had been flooded. This was fol-

lowed, especially in the Midland Counties, and as far north as Manchester, by storms

in which from 2 to 3 inches of rain fell ; and this coming on saturated gi-ound, a great

deal  of damage was  done  in  Leicestershire,  Cambridge, and  Huntingdon and                                                          ho
                                                                                                                                     ;

mentioned as an instance that when the day arrived for holding the Huntingdon

races, the race-course was 2 feet 6 inches under water. The rainfall dining July

waa wonderfidly concentrated; for instance, at Tamworth there was the extraordinary

^fall of 9i inches in 8 days, or of the average rainfaU for a year.

                                                      CHEMISTEY.

Address by A. G. Veenon Haecouet, M.A., F.H.S., F.C.S., President of the

                                                                 Section,

To the privilege of presiding over this Section custom has added the duty of

offering some preliminary remarks upon the branch of science for whose advance-

ment we are met.

In discharge of this duty some of my predecessors have reviewed the progress of

Chemistry during the previous year                                                                                                                                       and until  a few years ago there was no more
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

needful service that your President could render, though the task of selection and

abstraction was one of ever-increasing difficulty. But a few years ago the wisdom

and energy of Dr. Williamson transformed the Journal of the Chemical Society

into a complete record of cliemical research, and this Association materially pro-

moted the advancement of science when it helped the Chemical Society in an

undertaking which seemed at one time hopelessly beyond its means. The excellen

abstracts contributed to the Journal err, if at all, on the side of brevity ; and yet
the yearly volume seems to defy the bookbinder's press. I shall not venture to

attempt fiu-ther abstraction, nor to put before you in any way so vast and miscel-

laneous an aggregate of facts as the yearly increment of chemistry has become.

The advancement of our science (to borrow again the well-chosen language of the

founders of this Association) is of two kinds. The first consists in the discovery

and co-ordination of  new  facts                      the second in the diffusion of existing knowledge
                                                   ;

and the creation of an interest in the objects and methods and residts of scientific

research. For the advance of science is not to be measiu-ed only by the annual

growth of a scientific library, but by the living interest it excites and the number

and ardour of its votaiies. The remarks I have to offer you relate to the advance-

ment of Chemistry in both aspects.

 --One fact has been brought into unpleasant prominence by the Journal of the

Chemical Society in its present form namely, the small proportion of original work

in Chemistry which is done in Great Britain. All who are ambitious that our

country should bear a prominent part in contributing to the common stock of
knowledge, and all who know the effect upon individual character and happiness

of the habit and occupation of scientific inquiry, must regret our backwardness in
this respect. The immediate cause is easily found. It is not that English workers

are less inventive or industrious than their fellows across the Channel, but that

their number is exceedingly small. How comes it that, in a country which abounds

in rich and leisurely men and women (for neither the reason of the case, nor the

jealousy of the dominant sex, nor partial legislation excludes women from sharing

this pursuit with men), there are so few who seek the excitement and delights of

chemical inquiry ? Moralists tell us that the reason why some men are content

with the pleasures of eating and drinking and the like is, that they have never

had experience of the greater pleasure which the exercise of the intelligence affords.

I am not about to represent it as the moral duty of those who have means and

leisure to cultivate Chemistry  or any branch of                                                                                                                                    science                               but no taste for a pursuit
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

Acan be developed in the absence of any knowledge of its nature.                                                                                                                                                          taste for

Chemistry is often spoken of as a peculiar bias with which certain men are born.
No doubt there are differences in natural aptitudes and tastes ; but the chief reason
why it is so rare for men of leisure to addict themselves to scientific pursuits is,

that so few boys and young men have had experience of the pleasure which they

bring. Much has been done during the last twenty years, both at the Universities

and at the Public Schools, to provide for the teaching of science. To speak of what
I know best, the University of Oxford has made liberal provision for the teaching

of science, and for its recognition amoQg the studies requisite for a degi-ee ; nor

have the several Colleges been backward' in allotting Scholarships and Fellowships

as soon as and whenever they had reason to believe that those elected for profi-

cienc;y in science would be men equal in intellectual calibre to those elected for

proficiency in classics or mathematics. But the result is somewhat disappointing

and under a free-trade system science has failed to attract more than a small per-
                                                                                                            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                      33

centage of University students. Excellent lectures are delivered by the Professors

to scanty audiences, and the great bulk of those educated at the University receivo

no move tincture of science than their predecessors did twenty years ago.

The recognition of Science among the subjects of University examinations is by

no means an unmixed advantage to those concerned. Examinations have played

and will continue to play a useful part in directing and stimulating study, and in

securing the distribution of rewards according to merit ; but they produce in the

student, as has often been pointed out, a habit of looking to success in examination

as the end of his studies. This habit of mind is peculiarly alien to the true spirit

of scientific work. Only such knowledge is valued as is likely to be producible at

the appointed time. Whether a theory is consistent or true is immaterial, provided

--it is probable that is to say, advanced by some author whose authority an examiner

would recognize. All incidental observations and experimental inquiry lying out-

side the regular laboratory course, which are the natural beginnings of original

work, must be eschewed as trespassing on the time needed for preparation. The

examination comes                                                                                           the University career  is at  an  end ;  and  the  student departs,
                                                                                                         ;

perhaps with a considerable knowledge of scientific facts and theories, but without

having experienced the pleasure, still so easily gained in our young science of

Chemistry, of adding one new fact to the pile of knowledge, and, it may be, with

little more inclination to engage in such pursuit than have most of his contempo-

raries to continue the study of Aristotle or Livy.

However, examinations have their strong side, to which I have referred, as well

as their weali side ; and although it is the natural desire of a teacher to see his

more promising pupils contributing to the science with whose principles and

methods they have laboured to become acquainted, the younger, like the elder,

branches of knowledge must be content to serve as instruments for developing men's

minds. Chemisti'y can only claim a place in general education if its study serves,

not to make men chemists, but to help in making them intelligent and well in-

formed. If it is found to serve this purpose well, the number of chemical students

at the Universities ought to increase ; and if the number increases, no rigour of the

Examination System will prevent one or two, perhaps, in every year adopting

Chemistry as the pursuit of their lives. But the Universities have little power to

determine what number of students shall follow any particular line of study. With

certain reserves in favour of classics and mathematics, their system is that of free

trade. Young men of eighteen or nineteen have tastes already formed, some for the

studies which were put before them at school (in which, perhaps, they are already

proficient and have oeen already successful), some for games and good-fellowship.

It is, from the nature of the case, with the masters of schools that the responsibility

rests of fixing the position of science in education. During the last ten years
provision has been made at most of the larger schools for the teaching of some

branches of science ; and those who recall the conservatism of schoolboys, and their

consequent prejudice in favour of the older studies, will understand a part of the

difficulties which have had to be encountered. The main and insurmountable

Adifficulty is what I may call the impenetrability of studies.                                                                                            new subject cannot

be brought in without displacing in part those to which the school-hoiu-s have been

allotted. It is the same difficulty which occurs again and again in human life.
There are many things which it would be well to know and well to follow ; but
life, like schooltime, is too short for all. From the educational phase of this diffi-

culty the natural difference of tastes and aptitudes provides in some degree a way

of escape. I think that wherever a school can afford appliances for the teaching

of Chemistry, all the boys should pass through the hands of the teacher of this

subject. Two or three hoiu-s a week during one school-year would be sufficient to
enable the teacher to judge what pupils were most promising. There may be in-
stances to the contrary; but I do not think it likely that any boy who attended

chemical lectures for a year without becoming interested in the subject would ever

pursue it afterwards with success. Suppose that out of one hundred boys who

have gone through this course five are selected as having shown more intelligence

or interest than the rest; they shoidd be permitted to give a considerable part of

their time, while still at school, to studying science, without suffering loss of

position in the school or forfeiting the chance of scholarships or prizes. If any

sucli system is possible and were generally adopted, eacli school sending annually

to the Universities, or other institutions for the education of young men, its small

contribution of scientific students, the Professors' lectm-e-rooms and laboratories

woidd be filled with young men who had already learnt the rudiments of science.

Laboratories of research as well as of elementary insti'uction would find a place at
the English Universities, and the reproach of bai-renness would be rolled away.

   Some of the defects or difficulties to which I have adverted are perliaps peculiar
to om- older schools and universities. The introduction of the study of natm-al
science has borne earlier fruit in schools whose celebrity is of more recent date,

such as the excellent College in this neighbourhood. O.xford and Cambridge ought
to possess, but are far from possessing, such laboratories as have lately been built
at the Owens College, Manchester. It is proposed to constitute in this citv a
College of Science and Literatm'e, similar to Owens College and in connexion willi
two of the Oxford Colleges. The scheme set forth by its promoters appears

thoroughly wise and well considered, and all who are interested in scientihc educa-

tion must wish it success.
   I have placed first among the modes in which science, and in particular Chemi-

cal science, may be advanced the assignment to it of a more prominent and honoured
place in education ; but owing, as I do, my own scientific calling and opportunities
of work to a bequest made to Christ Chm-ch by Dr. Matthew Lee more than a

hundi'ed years ago, I cannot forget or disbelieve in the influence of endowments.
   I have spoken of the leisurely class in this country as that to which scientific

Chemistry must look for its votaries. In our social conditions and in the absence

of endowments it is hard to see where else they can be found. Men who have
their livelihood to make cannot afford to spend monej', and still less to bestow their
time and energy, on the luxury of scientific inquiry. Even if they have the oppor-
tunity of earning their livelihood by scientific teaching, and with it the command
of laboratory and apparatus, no leisure may remain to them for original work ; and

the impulse to such work (often, it must be admitted, of a feeble constitution)

may be starved in the midst of plenty. The application of endowments to the
promotion of original research is a difficidt question. I am inclined to think

that posts, constituted chiefly with this object, should be attached in every case
to some educational body, and should have light educational duties assigned to

them. The midtiplication of such posts in connexion with the many colleges
and schools in this country, where there is some small demand for chemical
teaching, with the pro\-ision in each case of a sufficient laboratory and means of
work, would probably do more than any centralized scheme for the promotion of

chemical research.

   To the advancement of Chemistry by the formation of public opinion on the
questions of scientific education and the endowment of original research, the
Chemical Section of the British Association may reasonably hope to contribute.
But doubts have been expressed as to the serviceableness of tliis or any such
organization for the direct advancement of our Science itself. No doubt we can-
not accomplish much. Chemical inquirers at the present time may be compared
to a party of children picking wild flowers in a large field ; at first all were near
together, but as they advanced they separated, till now they are widely scattered,
singly or in groups, each busy upon some little spot, while for every flower that is

gathered ten thousand others remain untouched.
   That the Science of Chemistry would advance more rapidly if it were possible

to organize Chemists into working parties, having each a definite region to explore,
cannot, I think, be doubted. Is such organization in any degree possible ?

   The experiments of which Bacon has left a record, though curious historically,
have no scientific value. But in one respect his ' Phj^siological Remains ' furnisli
an example which we might foUow with profit. " Furthermore," he writes, " we
propose wishes of such things as are hitherto only desired and not had, together
with those things which border on them, for the exciting the industry of man's
mind." I wiU quote further, as an example, a part of one of his " wishes," which
has very recently been fulfilled. " Upon glass four things would be put in proof.
The first, means to make the glass more crystalline. The second, to make it more
strong for falls and for fire, though it come not to the degree to be malleable."

   I do not know tliat the industry of M. de la Bastio's mind was excited by
Bacon's mention of glass more strong for falls and for fire among things hitherto
only desired and not had ; but the conception of such an enumeration seems to
me worthy of its author. Much fruitless and discouraging labour might be saved,

a stimulus might be given to experimental inquiry, and chemical research might
become more systematic and thus more productive, if Bacon's example were
followed by the leaders of Chemistry at the present day.

   The Council of tlie Pharmaceutical Conference, whose meeting has just pre-
ceded our own, has published a list of subjects for research which they commend
to the attention of Chemists. Where one of these subjects has been undertaken
by any Chemist his name is appended to it. Might not the representatives of

Scientific Chemistry issue a similar list ?

   Perliaps two or three of the distinguished English Chemists who are members

of this Association might be willing to serve on a Committee, which should put
itself into communication with the leaders of Chemical inquiry abroad, and
should make and obtain and publish suggestions of subjects for research. Such a
list so got together would, I think, find a welcome place in all scientific journals,
and would thus be widely known and easily accessible to every student.

   That which chiefly makes the organization of Chemical inquiry desirable is the

boundless extent of the field upon which we have entered. Not every fact, how-

ever laboriously attained and rigorously proved, is an important fact in Chemistry
any more than in other branches of knowledge. Our aim is to discover the laws

which govern the transformations of matter ; and we are occupied in amassing a

vast collection of receipts for the preparation of different substances, and facts as

to their composition and properties, which may be of no more service to the
generalizations of the science, whenever our Newton arises, than were, I conceive,

the bulk of the stars to the conception of gi-avitation.

It may, howevei', be urged that the growth of Chemical theory keeps pace with

the accumulation of chemical facts. It is so, if the elaboration of constitutional

formulcie is leading us up to such a theory. But at present, however usefid and

ingenious this mode of summarizing chemical facts may be, it does not amoimt to

a theory of Chemistry.

Two obiections to regarding .such formtdae as any thing more than a chemical

short-hand, as it has been termed, seem worth recalling. The first is mentioned at

the outset in most text-books in which these formulpe are employed, but some-

times, I venture to think, lost sight of afterwards. The arrangement of the atoms

of a molecule in one plane is equally convenient in diagrams and improbable as a

natm-al fact. But is not this an-angement used as though it were a natural fact

when the possible number of isomeric bodies is inferred from the nimiber of

ditierent gi-oupings of the atoms which can be eilected on a plane sm-face ? The

conceptions of plane Geometry are much simpler than those of solid Geometry

(which is  another recommendation  of  the  present system of  fonnulas)                                       but so far
                                                                                                            ;

as I am able to foUow the similar theories which have recently been propounded

independently by MjVI. Le Bel and Van 't Hoti:', the consideration of the possible

isomerisms of solid molecules leads to new conclusions *. Wislicenus has found that

paralactic acid undergoes the same transformations as ordinary lactic acid when
heated and when oxydized. The two acids differ in their action on polarized light.

His conclusion is that paralactic acid does not differ in its atomic structure from

the lactic acid of fermentation, and that the Irind of isomerism which exists between

the two acids is not connected with the difference in the reciprocal arrangement of

the atoms, but rather with a difference in the geometric structure of the molecule.

To this difference he gives the name of " geometric isomerism " t- The authors
named above agi-ee in supposing that the action of substances in solution on

   The second objection relates to the statical character of the account which

The modern theory of heat supposes not only that the molecides which constitute

auy portion of matter are in constant rapid motion, Taut that the atoms which con-
stitute each molecule are similarly moving to and fro. Such movement might be

an oscillation about the position assigned to the several atoms in the constitutional

formula of the molecule. Since, however, the modes of formation and decompo-

sition of substances are the principal facts upon which their formulae are based, it

is to be considered whether these facts may not depend altogether upon the nature

--or average nature of the motion impressed upon the atoms that is, upon dynamical

and not upon statical differences.

   Many substances are known whose existence is contrary to the theory of

valency and saturation, such as nitric oxide and carbonic oxide; others which

transgress the theory of isomerism, such as chloride of dichlordibromethane

(C CP Br-, CP) and bromide of tetrachlorethane (C" CV, Br'), which should be

identical,  but  are  isomeric  *        yet  these  theories  are  simply  an expression  of the  state-
                                      :

ment that certain substances can exist or can differ, while others cannot. It is true

that in the vast majority of cases the theoretical limitation seems to hold good.

But just as the absence of any fossil remains of the connecting links between

species is only significant if the geologic search has been sufficiently thorough, so

it is with chemical theories depending upon the non-existence of certain classes of

bodies. Indeed, in om- case, where investigation is guided by theory, and, as a

rule, only those things which are looked for are found, the limitation may be

Apartly of our own making.               Chemist who should depart from the general com'se,

and set himself to prepare substances whose existence is not indicated by theory,

would perhaps obtain results of more than the usual interest.

Among chemical inquiries, if ever such a list as I have ventured to suggest

should be drawn out, I hope that many would be included relating to the most

familiar substances and the simplest cases of chemical change. The thorough

study of a few reactions might perhaps bring in more knowledge of the laws of
Chemistry than the preparation of many new substances.

I believe that if any Chemist not content with a process giving a good yield of

some product examines minutely the nature of the reaction, observing its course
as well as its final result, he will find much more for study than the chemical

equation represents. He will probably also find that the reaction and its con-

ditions are of a formidable complexity, and will be driven back towards the

beginnings of Chemistry for cases sufficiently simple for profitable study.

  In concluding my remarks, I desire briefly to refer to another branch of Chemical

--Science, to the advancement of which this Association seeks to contribute

mean, applied or technical Chemistry. One of the principal differences between

the papers read before this Section, as a class, and those which the Chemical

Society receives, is the larger proportion in our list of papers on technical subjects.

Whatever Chemists may hold, there can be no doubt that the estimation of oiu-

science by the outside world rests largely on the well-founded belief that Chemistry

is useful. Indeed, though scientific Chemists are justly eager to vindicate the

value of investigations remote from any application to the arts, they cannot but

feel a livelier sense of triumph when the successful synthesis of a vegetable

principle yields at the same time a product of great technical value, as in the case

of the production of artificial alizarin.

By visiting in turn the principal centres of British industry, this Association
Webrings together men engaged on pure and on applied Chemistry.

as visitors may hope that om' papers and discussions here may bring fresh

interest in the science, if not actual hints for practice, to those whose art or

manufacture is based on Chemistry. In return, the most interesting communica-

tions the Section has received have not imfrequently been the descriptions of local

industries ; and there is no part of our hospitable reception more welcome and

more instructive to us than the opportunities which are provided of seeing chemical

transformations on a large scale eflected by processes which observation and inven-

tiveness have gradually brought to perfection and with the surprising familiaiity

and skill which are engendered by daily use.

Note on a Meilml of effecting the Solution of diffculthj Soluble Substances.

                      On the Nature of Berthelot's Vinylic Alcohol.

                           By Henry E. Armstroxg, Ph.D.

   According to Berthelot, acetylene is slowly absorbed when agitated with con-
centrated sulphuric acid ; and if the solution be diluted with water and distilled,
a liquid product is obtained which is slightly more volatile than water, and
possesses an extremely pungent odour recalling somewhat that of acetone.

   This product does not appear to have been obtained in a state of purity and

analyzed ; nevertheless Berthelot regards it as vinylio alcohol (O^ H3 . OH), formed
by the addition of the elements of a molecule of water to a molecule of acetylene ;
and it is described as such in several of our text-books. The author believes,

however, that theoretical considerations warrant a totally different conclusion.
   Thus experience entirely justifies the assumption that the first action probably

consists in the combination of a molecule of acetylene with two molecules of sulphuric

acid in the manner represented by the equation

                           CH CH3

   But Kekult? and Zincke's experiments on the condensation of aldehyde lead us to
believe that the aldehyde thus produced would, under the influence of the sulphuric

acid, be converted into crotonic aldehyde :

and since the properties of Berthelot's product agree closely with those assigned to
crotonic aldehyde, there can be little doubt that the supposed vinylic alcohol is in
reality that compound, especially as the properties (b. p. &c.) of the " vinylic
alcohol " are not at all those which are likely to characterize the lower homologue

of allylic alcohol. Experiments to prove this are already in progress.

On the Alkaloids of the Aconites. By G. H. Beckett and C. R. Alber Wright,

       D.Sc., Lecturer on Chemistry in St. Mary's Hospital Medical School.

   Through the kindness of Mr. J. B. Groves, of Weymouth, we received for ex-

amination a quantity of the crystalline mixed nitrates of certain bases contained in
Aconitum napellus, together with the hydrochloride of a base which separated from
the liquor at a certain state of concentration during the process of extraction, and
a crystalline base extracted from A. fero.v ; the method of extraction was, in each
instance, essentially exhaustion by alcoholic hydrochloric acid, _ evaporation to a
small bulk, and extraction of the alkaloids by addition of ammonia and ether.

   After careful purification, the hydrochloride above mentioned gave numbers
which are best represented by the formula 0,i H^., NO,;,, HCl, UH., 0. This salt
ervstallizes from water in small sillry crystals, but the solutions have a strong
tendency to supersaturation : the free base refuses to crystallize from ether or

with a di'op of dilute hydi-ochloric or nitric acid ; this base appears to be almost

inert, its salts possessing a bitter taste, not producing the prickling of the tongue

characteristic of the aconites, and, according to Mr. Groves's observations, producing

no result when swallowed by the human subject in half-grain doses.

From the mixture of nitrates a base was extracted (by means of spontaneous

evaporation of the ethereal solution of the mixed free bases) which crystallized

readily from ethei- in small anhydrous crystals, producing energetically the aconite

tongue-prickling, and forming well-crystallized salts ; the yield of pure base from
2 cwt. of roots was, however, very small, being only a very few grams. This sub-

stance gave numbers agreeing with the formula CggH^jNOj,, the air-diy hydro-

chloride containing SH^O; the body answered to the description of crystalline

"aconitine" given by Duquesnel; but the formula arrived at by this chemist was

The base from A. ferox gave numbers agi'eeing with the formula G^^ Hjg NOu

it crystallizes in indistinct crystals from ether and alcohol by spontaneous evapora-

tion : its salts refuse to crystallize, di-ying up to varnishes. On leaving the freshly

precipitated free base in contact with water and emulsin a change is produced, a

salt of an alkaloid not yet investigated being gradually formed in solution ; no

glucose, however, can be detected in the liquid.

Apparently the two last described bases of the aconites are readily alterable ; on

treating with mercuric iodide dissolved in potassium iodide the solution of then-

salts, iodo-mercurates,  are  precipitated                                                                                                                           and  on      decomposing                                                   these     with  sulphu-

lower molecular weight than the original base used {i. e. the gold salt contained a

somewhat larger percentage of gold). One specimen of the A. ferox base thus re-

generated from the iodo-mercurate by Mr. Groves was magniticeutly crystalline,

forming well-defined rhombohedra                                                                                                                                     whilst that  examined by the authors (prepared

and quite different in appearance under the microscope. These and other analogous

circumstances observed lead us to conjecture that either the constituents of the

roots are variable under diiferent conditions of soil, climate, &c., or that the alka-

loids originally present are apt to undergo considerable changes during the process

of extraction.

On Japanese CamjiTior from Peppermint. By G. H. Beckett and C. R. Alder

  "Weikht, D.Sc., Lecturer on Chemistry in St. Mary's Hospital Medical School.

   Oppenheim has sho\\Ti that this camphor is a monatomic alcohol indicated by
the formula Cn, Hj,, . OH, and that by the action of dehydrating agents it loses the
elements of water, forming a hydrocarbon, menthene, 0,,, H,^.

   Through the kindness of Mr. John Moss (Messrs. Corbyn and Co.) we received a

quantity of this camphor, and obtained the following corrected values for the
melting- and boiling-points of the pm-iiied substance and its derivative menthene :

                       Camphor, melting-point 42° (in capillary tube).
                               ,, boUiag-point 212°.

                       Menthene, ,, lG4°-5 to 165°-5.

   Mr. Moss found 39° as the melting-point and 37°-5 as the solidifying point of
another specimen of camphor less completely purified ; whilst Oppenheim gives 36°
as the melting-point and 210" as the boiling-point of the camphor, and 103° as the
boiling-point of menthene.

may be regarded as a derivative of a marsh-gas homologue, Ck, Ha.,, i- e- as tetra-

The cymene thus obtained ia identical with that described in former Reports to the
Association by one of us as being produced from numerous terpeues and substances
contained in essential oils and allied to the terpene family.

   It thus results that by a single reaction of decomposition a paraffine substitution
derivative breaks up, forming a beazene homologue, a somewhat unusual if not

quite novel reaction.
   Simidtaneously with solid Japanese peppermint-camphor a liquid oil is imported

this seems to be the liquid portion of an essential oil from which the solid has been

partially separated by standing and pressure. From the results obtained, it appears

that this oil consists either of the solid camphor or of a liquid isomeride dissolved in
or mixed with a liquid oil of composition 0^^ Hjg O, and identical or isomeric with

the similar substance constituting the majority of citronella-oil. By the action of

dehydrating agents, menthene, terpenes and their polymerides, and resinous bodies

are formed fi-om the liquid oil.

 Some Account of the Manufacture and Rejtning of Sugar in Bristol, 1875.

                              By Henkt T. Ohambehlain.

   For about two centuries refining of sugar has' been cari-ied on here. The old
style was rude and little beyond melting in open pans by fire heat, and allowing
the sugar to gi-anulate. This old and uncertain process was much shortened by the
new style and improvements, which consisted of the use of animal charcoal and
the vacuum-pan, afterwards followed by the introduction of the centrifugal machine,

for all sugar except loaf.

   There is now scarcely any loaf made in England ; the French have an internation-
ally unfair monopoly. The refiners now make only finest crystals, fine and yellovr
pieces, and treacle, most of them pleasing to the eye and pure in quality. Scientific
knowledge is now brought much into use in sugar-refining, The following coui'se
of manufacture is used by most refiners. The raw sugar as imported is melted with

a little water, then filtered through bags, and afterwards through animal charcoal
into cisterns, the first runnings pm-e and colourless as water ; it is then boiled in
vacuo, at a low temperature, to the granulating point, taken from the pan to the
centrifugal machine, where in a few minutes of revolution all moisture is driven

oft^ and the sugar remains finished and fit for use. As far as possible, all syrups
are allowed to run by gravitation to save pumping. All syrups uucrystallizable
form treacle, all washings and sweet water are evaporated, and not a particle of

saccharine matter is lost.

    There are four sugar-refineries in Bristol, working, or capable of working, 1700

to 1800 tons weekly.

               Action of Ethyl-hromobutyrafe ujpon Ethyl-sodaceto-acetate.

   Ethyl-bromobutyrate was prepared by the method of Gorup-Besanez and Klink-
sieck*, and the fraction boiling between 175'^ and 185° C. was added slowly to a
benzene solution of ethyl-sodaceto-acetate prepared as directed by Wislicenus f.

A violent reaction occurred with evolution of much heat and separation of sodium

bromide.
   After heating the mixture on the water-bath tmtil no further separation of

sodium bromide occurred, the benzene was removed by distillation, and the sodium"'
bromide by washing with water. The resulting liquid was rapidly fractionated,
and the portion which distilled over between 200° and 203° again fractionated ; on
being subjected to an elementary analysis it yielded the following analytical num-
bers, which agree perfectly with those requii'ed by diethyl aceto-etliyl succinate :

was the first to make a systematic analysis of the products of combustion ; but it

was not possible satisfactorily to explain the reactions taking place by a formula.

The researches of Professor Bunsen and Schischkoff have shown that a much larger

number of products is formed than was previously supposed, rendering it even more

difficult to explain the nature of the changes taking place by a symbolic formula.

Professor Bunsen, of Heidelberg, found, by the combustion of a mixture of hydrogen

and carbonic oxide with a quantity of oxygen not sufficient to bm-n the whole of

the two gases, that the water and carbonic acid produced stood to each other in

proportion of their molecular weights, or then- molecular weights multiplied by

simple coefficients ; and these coefficients may be the same for mixtures of various

compositions, but change suddenly when the amount of one or both of the gases is

changed beyond certain limits. The author has shown that the same law obtains

when a mixture of bai-ic and calcic chloride is precipitated by an insufficient amount

of sodic carbonate, viz. that the barium carbonate and calcium carbonate precipi-

tated are in proportion of their molecular weights, or their molecular weights

Amultiplied by a simple coefficient.  necessary condition is that the reactions

should be simultaneous. In the combustion of powder in an ordinary gun this

condition is very nearly satisfied, and accordingly the quantities of some of the

products formed obey the law enunciated by Bunsen. The author deduced from

-the analytical results published in Messrs. Noble and Abel's most excellent

researches on fired gimpowder, as well as from the analyses of the products of the

combustion of powder published by Bunsen and Schischkoff, the following general

--results concernmg the products of combustion : (1) the sum of the potassium con-

tained in the potassic hyposulphite, sulphate, and sulphide stands to the potassium

in the potassium carbonate approximately in simple proportions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              (2) the carbon of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the carbonic oxide stands to the carbon of the potassic carbonate also approximately

in a simple proportion. From this, as well as from the relation of the sum of the

potassiimi contained in the sulphide and hyposulphite to the potassium in the sul-

phate, it is possible to foi-m a theory for the combustion of powder. There are

several reactions between the constituents of powder when the latter is fired. Two

of these are simultaneous ; the way in which the others succeed each other cannot
be accuratel)' determined : at first, when a poi-tion of the carhon is burned, potassic

carbonate, carbonic oxide, nitrogen, and carbonic acid are produced. Simultane-

--ously with this reaction another takes place a portion of the saltpetre and the

whole or a portion of the sulphur form potassic sulphate and carbonic acid. The

action of still vmburnt carbon and of free sulphur on the potassic sulphate, in a suc-
ceeding stage of the combustion, causes the formation of potassic sulphide and hypo-

sulphite. On the ground of such considerations, the processes taking place dm-ing the
combustion of powder can be represented by equations. These, with other details,

will be published elsewhere.

                  On the Manufacture of Sole-leather in Bristol.

                      Bu Spaeke Evans, Avonside Tannery.

Very little notice is taken of the trade in city records, probably from the position

of the tanneries being outside the city boundaries. In 1816 there were nine tan-

neries, now there are thirteen. The trade was formerly much fettered by absurd
restrictions and excise laws. The leather made in this locality is of excellent

quality, from proximity to oak-woods and the length of time allowed in tanning.

M'CuUock estimates the leather-trade as third in importance in the United

Kingdom, giving precedence only to wool and iron.

The growth of commerce caused such a demand for leather that it would soon have

attained a fabulous value but for the introduction of South-American hides and
Turkish Valmiea. South-American hides were first imported to Castile in 1580 : total

shipment from South America in 1872 of dry and salted hides 3,121,758, the prodiice
of vast herds roaming over the pampas, which is estimated at 11 to 15 millions.

Hides obtained of cattle in a semi-wild state much thicker than from high-bred

animals. The loss occasioned by branding to prove ownership computed at

£300,000 yearly.

The recent practice of pickling on the voyage strongly objected to, yet likely to

prove its own cure.
   Messrs. Conyers and PuUein have introduced a mode of suspending hides in lime,

thus unhairing in four days without heat. Neither cool-sweating process used in

America nor the sulphide of sodium or by charcoal used in Bristol.

    Bristol early adopted the system of rounding. Failure of all patent processes for

tanning. Rapid processes and new materials generally regarded with distrust,

twelve months being required to make thick leather both pliable and impermeable.

A considerable quantity of army leather supplied from this city, for which prize

medals have been awarded. The British troops are better shod than any other
soldiers in the world ; and Sir Garnet Wolseley says, " The regiment that can
march best in an army is the best in that army."

On the Separation of Lead, Silver, and Mercury, with a proposed process for

                 estimation of Lead. By T. Fairley, F.U.S.E.

These metals form a group generally precipitated together as chlorides, and

various processes, more or less perfect, have been devised for their separation. Thus

the silver chloidde may be separated by ammonia, or the lead chloride by boiling
with much water,_ or the niercurous cliloride by boiling with nitric acid or aqua

regia. This last is tedious and is open to the objection mentioned by Fresenius,

that mercuric chloride volatilizes with the vapour from boiling water.

In the study of the reactions of hypochlorites and while engaged in teaching the

ordinary course of analysis, the author ascertained that the conversion of mercurous

chloride into soluble mercuric chloride is instantaneously effected by boiling with

alkaline hypochlorite, taking care that tlie solution remains acid throughout.

The hypochlorite used may be potassium, sodium, or calcium hypochlorite. The

author finds the most convenient to be a solution prepared by passing chlorine into

a lO-per-cent. solution of sodium hydrate until the impurities (alumina &c.) con-

tained in it begin to separate out. On then adding a small proportion of the sodium

hydrate solution, say about one tenth of the quantity saturated with chlorine, we

obtain a liquid of convenient strength, and which when kept in the dark remains

almost unchanged.

Of course in the absence of acids &c. affecting the solubility of calcium compoimds,

solution of ordinary bleaching-powder may be used.

   The separation of lead from mercurous salts may be readily performed by a con-

     ^

tinuation of the above process. If any free acid be present, add sodium acetate or

hydrate and sufficient acetic acid to ensure an excess of the latter throughout the

process. On boihnij with hypochlorite all the lead is precipitated as brown dioxide.

The dioxide so                                      obtained is pure                                                              and as no  lead remains in solution the author has
                                                                                                                               ;

On a netv Method of prepariny Periodates, ivith Apiplication as a Test
          for Iodine and Sodium. By T. Faiklet, F.R.S.E.

When we boil any iodide or iodate with excess of alkaline hydrate and hypo-

chorite, then, if sodium salts be present, a crystalline precipitate is after some time

thrown down consisting of sodium periodate.

Using potassium hydrate and hypochlorite this test may be used to ascertain the

·presence of sodium compounds in any substance added to the boiling liqiud. In a

solution of about .30 cub. centims. in volume less than 0-1 gramme can readily be

detected ; and with a smaller V9lume more minute quantities nniy be detected.
   As a test for iodine it is of course unable to take the place of more delicate well-

known tests                                         but it is useful as affording in any case confirmatory evidence.

The Relation of the Arranfjement of the Acids and Bases in a Mixture of Sails

   to the original manner of Comhination. By Dr. J. H. GLiDsxoNE, F.R.8.

  --The question proposed for cousideration was : Suppose two salts (such as chloride

of sodium aud sulphate of magnesium) are mixed in equivalent proportions in a
certain quantity of water, is the solution identical with a mixture of equivalent
proportions of sulphate of sodium and chloride of mag-nesium in the same amount of
water ? The method emploj'ed for testing the question was to mix such pairs of
solutions with a certain quantity of an intensely coloiired salt, such as ferric sulpho-
cyanide, ferric meconate, terbromide of gold, or platino-iodide of potassium, and to
note the diminution of colour that resulted from the reciprocal decomposition of
the constituents. Four separate pairs of mixtures were examined, aud each pair
proved identical in its action on the coloured salts. As small differences can be

easily detected by such a method, the question may be considered as answered in

the afiirmative.

                        Notes on tlie Action of the Copper-Zinc Couple*.

           By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.Ii.S., and Alfred Tribe,

   Pure zinc will scarcely decompose a weak solution of sulphvu-ic acid ; but if a
minute quantity of copper be deposited on the same zinc, it will decompose it

readily.

   Zinc which contains arsenic when " coupled " with copper decomposes pure water
with the evolution of hydrogen which is free from arsenic. If, however, arsenious
acid be added to the solution, arseniuretted hydrogen makes its appearance. The
presence of this gas when arsenical zinc is dissolved in ^dphuric acid is most

probably due to the solubility of the arsenic in that acid.

On the Avgmentation of the Chemical Activity of Aluminiiim by contact with

   Aluminium alone decomposes water only at a white heat, but when " coupled "

with copper or platinum it will decompose water slowly at the ordinary temperature
aud rapidly at 100° 0. The aluminium-platinum couple, as might be expected,
gives a still larger amount of hydrogen in the same time.

   Thus Hesperidenc (the terpene of oil of orange-peel) yielded an acid solution

    h. This experiment was made with the terpene isolated from nutmeg-oil by sodium

treatment and fractional distillation. It boiled at 164° C, and consisted of terpene
 containing a little cymene. It yielded by oxidation a solution containing 0'0915
 gramme peroxide of hydrogen in 100 cub. ceutims.

    c. This third trial was made with that fraction of nutmeg-oil, hydrocarbons,
boiling at 173°-ir6°, and therefore mainly cymene (as shown by Wright). This
gave, on oxidation with water, a solution containing 0'0114 gi-amme H20j, in 100

a result found by other means by H. Gil.

   The oils of caraway, bergamotte, juniper, cubebs, lemon, and chamomile also
absorb oxygen from air, forming in the presence of water peroxide of hydrogen.

Their essential terpenes in a pm-e state have not yet been examined.

   Such bodies of the formula Cj, H^^ as I have examined fail to develop H^ 0^ by

atmospheric oxidation.
    This is true at least of the so-called clove terpene, isolated by Church from oil of

cloves (Jom-n. of Chem. Soc. ser. 2, vol. xiii. p. 113), and also of patchouli, although
it is to be remarked that the patchouli I examined was not oxidized by myself;
and so the experiment requires repetition.

   Cymene from all sources is identical, as proved by the researches of Fittica,
AVright, and Paterno, «fcc. I have oxidized three samples :

    a. Cymene from camphor by zinc chloride. Of this 7 cub. centims. absorbed
52 cub. ceutims. oxygen in 18 days, and formed peroxide of hydrogen.

   h. Cymene from the dibromide of cajeputol, boiling at 176°-177°, gave by oxida-
tion with water a solution containing 0-196 gramme H^ O^ in 100 cub. centims.

  Ac. mixture of quantities of cymene from various sources. This also gave

affirmative results. Besides peroxide of hydrogen so obtained by atmospheric
oxidation of cymene, a toluic acid seems also to be formed. A. crystallized acid
was obtained from the solution- having the ordinary characters of a toluic acid;
but there was not sufficient quantity to admit of analj-sis.

    It is to be remarked that the oxidation in eacli case was effected by exposing the
oils with water to sunshine and air, or passing a ciu-rent of air through the mixture
at40°C.

    I have shown, in Parts I. and 11. of this research, that turpentine by oxidation in

--this way gives rise to the formation of campho-ic acid and peroxide of hydrogen

indirectly that is, by the decomposition by water of a previously formed peroxide
of an organic nature.

    Bodies of C^j, Hg, composition have not yet been examined.
   These researches also prove that cymene is the nucleus matter of the terpenes
and thus is established another link between the terpenes and the benzene series.
   Fittica (Deut.Chem. Ges. Ber. vii. 323) has shown cymene to be normal propyl-
methyl-benzene in which the methyl and propyl occupy the paraposition.

   On Apparatus and Modes of Examination for the Source of Polluted Air,
                             By "William Thomson, F.C.S.

   This paper has reference principally to the detection and relative determination
of the amount of hydrochloric and sulphmic acids issuing from chemical or other
works sm-rounded by works which are also said to pollute the air, to prove the
amount of pollution proceeding from any individual works.

  My first experiments were confined to litmus-paper, which I found would not act

well unless the papers were kept moist. To effect this I took bottles flattened on
both sides, having a small hole bored in the shoulder ; a piece of blotting-paper was
fixed on the front of the bottle by elastic bands, and kept quite wet by a piece of
cotton-wick passing thi'ough the small hole in the bottle, which was filled with pure
water : the litmus-paper was then moistened with water and laid on the wet blotting-
paper ; it may thus be kept moist for any length of time without washing any of

the litmus from the paper. If, then, several moist litmus-papers be kept at the
side of the works, in a direct line with the direction of the smoke, and another set of
papers placed at exactly the opposite side of the works, and both left for a few hom-s,
a comparison of the two sets of papers will give a fair idea of the amoxmt of acidity
emitted by the works by the difference in point of redness of the litmus.

  With the view to determine the actual amount of impm'ities put into the atmosphere
hy any individual works, I placed carbonic-acid bulbs, connected by means of india-
rubber tubing with an aspirator, and so arranged them that by means of a pulley they

could be raised or lowered through a range of about 30 feet on a j oiuted pole ; by this
means they could be placed as nearly as possible about the level at which the smoke and
other vapours passed : but as the wind changed often it was necessary for the experi-
ment that the pole, bulbs, and aspirators should be moved about in accordance with
the changes in the direction of the wind ; this was done by having the appliances
fixed on a vehicle. About 120 gallons of air were passed thi-ough 500 grains of water
alone and also made slightly alkaline with pm-e caustic soda, the apparatus being kept
always in the direct line of the smoke from the works ; and 120 gallons of air were
passed through other bulbs, the apparatus always being kept to exactly the oppo-
site side from that to which the smoke was blown. Thus I was enabled to get the
relative amount of impurities in the atmosphere immediately before and immediately
after it pa-ssed the works ; and as it took about twelve hours to pass this quantity
of air through each apparatus, it no doubt gave a fair estimate of the amount of
impurities emitted by the works.

   It is also advisable to corroborate these results by other means, such as collecting
rain-water from different directions near the works, at the same time observing the
direction of the wind during the time the rain is falling &c.

JS^ote on Miintz and Samspachers Apparatus for tlie Estimation of Tannic
                                 Acid. Bxj JoHJsr Watts, D.Sc.

The following avrangement was devised by MM. Mihitz and Ramspacher in order

to ascertain with accuracy the actual Icather-prodiiciiic/ power of an astringent sub-

stance, which, according to the experience of the manufactm'er, does not appear

always to coincide with its percentage of tannic acid.

The apparatus may be briefly described as a shallow gim-metal drum of about

200 cubic ceutinis. capacity, permanently closed ot one end by an india-rubber

plate, and capable of being closed watertight at the other by a piece of depilated

hide when clamped upon a stand over which the hide has been previously stretched.

The drum is perforated at the side with a screw to admit of the introduction of the

tanning liquor, and is fitted above with a screw-piston to compress the india-rubber

disk. When the piston is lowered the liquor is forced through the hide, while the

latter retains the whole of the tannic acid. The density of the liquor is taken

b.ifore and after the operation by means of a very fine hj'drometer graduated to a

special scale, when the difference expresses at once the percentage value of the

In order to compare the results of Eamspacher's tannometer with Hammer's

table of percentages of tannin in solutions of different densities, and to compare

both with the results of evaporation, a number of experiments were undertaken by

the author, as shown below. The percentages only indicate the value of the par-

ticular sample under examination.

The numbers iu the first cohiiuu were obtained by taking the specific gravity at
lo° before and after removing tlie tannin, and obtaining the percentage equivalent
frorn^ Hammer's Table. The third coliimu was found by evaporating 25 cubic
centims. in a platinum dish before aud after the removal of the tannin^ and drying

the residue for three or four hours at 100°.

Address hi/ Thomas Wiught, M.D., F.R.S.E., F.G.S., President of the

                                                             Section.

myIn taking this Chair today, I desire first to express    deep sense of gratitude to

the Council of the British Association for the honour conferred on me, and, secondly,

to say how much I feel the responsibility of the position iu which I am placed

when I recollect the long list of distinguished sacans who in former years have

presided over this Section. The fact that Buckland, Conybeare, De la Beche, Forbes,

Geikie, Hopkins, Jukes, Lyell, Murchison, Phillips, Eamsay, and other men illus-

trious in the annals of British Geology have filled this chair, may well make mo
mydoubt how far own feeble powers are equal to an efficient discharge of its duties
however, I shall bring a willing mind and an honest determination to do my best

on this occasion.

  We have met again in one of the most interesting centres iu England to all

students of practical geology ; for within a short distance of this spot we can

examine some of the most instructive sections of Palaeozoic aud Mesozoic rocks,

and study a magnificent collection of local fossils obtained from them. So I pui-pose

occupying the short space of time allowed for this introductory address in attempt-

ing to give you a general outline of the geological character of the country around

Bristol, willi a resume of some of its more remarkable Palceontological features, by

way of inducing you to visit and study the admirable collection of local organic
remains so well displayed in the Museum of the Bristol Philosophical Institution.

   Geology is the history of the Earth ; for it attempts to construct a table of pheno-
mena, physical and chemical, organic aud inorganic, which have succeeded each

other from the past to the present, and on the terrestrial surface traces of its origin

and progTess are preserved.

That phase which we see today is only the most recent of its eventful history,

and although the last, is not the final one, as the physical forces that are ever in

action among its diiiereut parts are slowly and steadily producing new combina-

tions, which in time will effect mutations in its structure, change its physiogi'aphy,

and remodel the whole.

   There is probably no other' place in England where, within so limited an area,

typical examples of so many different formations occur as around this city : for
within a short distance by road or rail we may investigate the Silurian, Devonian,

Carboniferous, Triassic, Liassic, Oolitic, and Cretaceous formations^ all of which

will yield many interesting species for the cabinet of the palreontologist, and a

valuable series of rocks and minerals for the student of Physical Geology.

These diflPerent fonnations in relation to the entire series of stratified rocks will

be better understood by a reference to the following Table, in which the periods,

divisions, formations, and typical localities are given :

 --Silurian. Tortworth has long been classical groimd to the geologist, and was

first brought into notice by Dr. Cooke, formerly (1799-1836) rector of the parish.

This gentleman made an extensive collection of fossils from all the rocks in the

district, which after his death passed through my hands ; and I can therefore speak
                                                                                                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                  49

Ato the fact,                                     description of the Geology of Tortworth was made by Mr. Weaver*

and by Buckland and Conybearef. These memoirs were written at a time when

the correlations of the then so-called Transition rocks were not understood ; there-

fore they help us little toward a correct imderstanding of their age and character.

It was not imtil Murchison had succeeded in making out the true relation and

character of the upper fossiliferous beds beneath the Old Red Sandstone, and had

arranged his groups by their organic remains in consecutive order under the name

of the Silurian System, that the true age and relation of the Transition strata of

Tortworth were understood. It then appeared that the Silurian rocks of Tort-

worth are the southern extension of the same formations which, extendino- through

Micklewood Chase and the Vale of Berkeley, appear as a dome of Upper Silurian,

rising near Tites Point on the left bank of the Severn near Purton Passage. The
same rocks are foimd wrapping round the base of May Hill and Huntley Hill in the

Forest of Dean, in the Valley of Woolhope, Herefordshire, on the western slopes

of the Malvern Hills, and extending through Eastnor and Ledbury to Wenlock
Edge, Salop. Whatever, therefore, is true relating to the Palfeontological cha-

racter of the Upper Silurians in these other localities, is equally correct of the

same formations that lie in the miniature basin of Tortworth. The Caradoc Sand-
stone, or, as it is now called, the Upper Llandovery Sandstone, is the oldest rock at

Tortworth, and forms the dominant stratum of the district. It covers an extensive

area                     and some small sections are seen at the south side of Micklewood Chase, and
                     ;

on both banks of the Avon near Damory Mill. Lithologically and palreontologically

it is indistinguishable from hand specimens of the same formation at May HHl. It

abounds in fossils : Pentamerus, Strophotnena, Orthis, Atrypa, Spirt/era, andZeptcma,

with broken Trilobites belonging to the genera Trimicleus, Cahjmene, Illeenus, and

Phacops, are found, together with the stems of Crinoids and Tentaculites.

The Wenlock Limestone is exposed at Falfield Mill and Whitfield and other

places                                   from its various beds the characteristic Upper Silurian Corals                                                  are collected,
                              ;

as Favosites, Syringopora, Halysites, Porites, Caryophyllia, and Acervularia.

   Dohmitic Conijlomerute. ^Veayer described this formation as composed princi-

pally of " rounded aud angular fragments of limestone exceeding the size of the

head, with fragments also of quartz aud hornstone. These are all cemented together

--by a calcareous paste, which is frequently of a marly natirre or of a carbonate of

lime either of an earthy or compact structure ; " the cement is generally magnesian,

and in this there are many cavities frequently lined with crystals of calcareous spar

and quartz, and also with the sulphate of strontian.

This remarkable formation forms a land of iiTegidar broken fringe, hanging on

Wethe flanks of the older rocks, and resting unconformably upon them.                                                    shall

meet with this conglomerate again in connexion with the beds in the Mendip Hills

--aud in the Clifton section.
  New Red Sandstone. The upper aud central members of the New Red Sand-

stone arc found near Tortworth ; they consist chiefly of red clay and marl.

Avicida-contorta beds have been found by the Earl of Ducie in the form of the

Boue Bed, the series resting on the inclined edges of the Carboniferous Limestone.

                            2. Mendip Hills.

The Mendip Hills proper extend from Bleadon Hill near Hutton on the west, to

Elm and Whatley on the east ; and they strike nearly due west and east, and are

about 30 miles in length, with an average breadth of 5 to 6 miles. They constitute

the southern base of the Bristol Coal-field, or the base of an almost equilateral tri-

angle, formed b}^ the Pala30zoic rocks, comprising the area from Burton Passage and

Tortworth to the south slopes of the Mendips ; this includes the outlier Bream

Down, which is only a westerly prolongation in the Severn, separated from the

main range of the Mendips by the alluvial flat of the estuaiy of the Axe.

The Lithology of the Mendips consists of Old Bed Sandstone, Carboniferous

Limestone, and Trias, the latter represented chiefly by the Doloniitic Conglomerate,

which lies unconformably on the Old Red and Carboniferous, flanking nearly the

entire range of hills, and in places capping their summits.

Numerous islands of Carboniferous Limestone surrounded by Triassic rocks occur

east of Wells and south of Croscombe, also encircled by fringes of Dolomitic Con-

glomerate, of which Church HiU, "Worminster, and Ivnowl-foot Hill are examples
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

these outliers testify to the southern extension of the Carboniferous Limestone

beneath the New Bed S.andstone and Lias south of tlie Slendips, and lend us aid

in determining the probable position of deep-seated Coal Measures similar to those

at Vobster, Colford, Edford, Ilolcombe, &c., north of the Mendip range.

  The lower flanks of thenorthern portion of the range are covered by the New Red

Sandstone, that of the south being a mere strip traversed by the Wells-and-

Axbridge Eailway, the peat plains and bogs of Sedgmoor covering them up to a

certain level to the east of the meridian of Glastonbury. The Lias occupies an '

extensive plain, masking likewise the older rocks beneath.

Old Red Sandstone forms the oldest stratified rock, and is, strictly speaking,

the axis of the Mendip Hills. It is exposed in four well-marked areas along the

highest  ridge :-- (1)  Blackdown                                                         (2)  North Hill and Pen Hill;  (.3) Beacon Hill
                                                                                       ;

and (4) Bownhead Common, wliich is the largest exposed tract. The intervening

areas are occupied by a mantle of Carboniferous Limestone, which arches over and

covers the underlying Old Red, denudation having yet spared the limestone.

The Old Red is exposed along two anticlinal axes, these being, indeed, the chief

cause of its exposure ; the axes being post-Carboniferous and pre-Triassic, are not

traceable beneath or where the patches of Dolomitic Conglomerate and cherty

Lias cover up the Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone, as at Harptree

Hill, Rowham, Shipham, &c.

The most northerly anticlinal brings up the fine range of Blackdown, on the north,

south, aud east of which occur the Lower Limestone Shales resting on Old Red.

The northern dip of the anticlinal is higher than the southern, being in places

as high as 54° in the north, whilst in the soutli it does not exceed 20°. This anti- '

clinal is traceable from uenr the exposure of the igneous rock at Uphill, along

Bleadon Hill, thence under the New Ked Sandstone to Padiugham, and Dolomitic

Conglomerate and Calamine beds of Shipham, through the Old Red Sandstone of

Blackdown, and on through the Carboniferous Limestone of Lamb-bottom, where

it is lost under the cherty Khtetic beds of Harptree Hill. From Little Elm on the

extreme east to Masbury Castle nearly due west of the range, the Old Red is again

exposed for three miles, which is likewise due to the anticlinal axis.
   At Masbury Castle we lose trace of tliis S.E. anticlinal, and a second .and parallel

cue to that of Blackdown occm-s, ranging from the Old lied of North Hill through

the Carboniferous Limestone of Stoke Warren, and last under the dolomitic conglo-

Wemerate of North Draycott. This may j oin the great anticlinal near Egar Hill.

thus see that the strike of the Mendipswas induced by a force which has brought out

its oldest rock to the surface, and thereby produced the present physiogi-aphy of the

bold range of hills we are now considering.

Carhoniferous Limestone surrounds the exposed and concealed nucleus of Old Red,

and is conformable therewith both in dip and strike. The Carboniferous Limestone

has gi-and development in the Mendips, and constitutes the gi-eat mass of the chain,

having a continuous spread of five miles between Westbury Beacon and Abley, also

between Crosconibe and Eniben-ow. The Lower Limestone shales are .nowliere

more finely exposed than around and resting on the upper members of the Old Red

Sandstone, and are highly fossiliferous throughout, the beds being crowded with

Strojyliomena, Chonetes, Spinfei-a, Polyzoa, the ossicula of Crinoids, and many Tri-

lobites, presenting a strong contrast to the barren beds of the Old Red on which they

conformably rest. The Shales are well developed around Blackdown, especially to

the east of Charterhouse, at Rowbarrow and Priddy, west of North HiU, and Nine

Barrows                                           and east  of Egar Hill tliey  attain  a  thickness  of 500 feet,  and  are extremely

rich in organic remains. They present an extended outcrop from Masbury to Stoke

Lane, and Leigh upon Mendip, and in the Downhead beds near Asham Woods.
The local development of these argillaceous beds of the lowest division of the Car-

boniferous Limestone first gave origin to the name Lower Limestone Shales. They

are almost special to the west of England, and are exposed on both flanks of the

Mendip range. On them rest the thick-bedded strata of the Carboniferous Lime-

stone, which is everywhere traceable for thirty miles from Oldford, the gorge of the

Vallis to Elm on the east, to the distant headland of Bleadon in the west, and

everywhere abounding more or less with organisms which form the leading fossils

in its beds.

  --Coal Measures. On the northern flank of the Mendips, between Binegar and

Wells, and resting on the Millstone Grit, highly faxdted and contorted, are the well-

known Coals of Vobster, Holcombe, Pitcot, &c., that portion on the west at Stratton

on the Fosse, Downside, &c. being covered by Dolomitic Conglomerate, the eastern
side at Newbury and Vobster being overlain by the same rock and the Inferior

Oolite. There is no reason why we should not conclude that the Coals of the

northern side once extended across the Mendips and now lie deeply buried along the

south parts of the range. At Ebber rocks, west of Wells, we have evidence of the

Millstone Grit resting on the Carboniferous Limestone ; and the elevation of the
Mendips being post-Carboniferous, lends an additional reason for the occurrence of

the Coals of the northern area to the south of the Mendips, and beneath the Lias

and Peat plain of Glastonbury, Castle Carey, the Pennards, and the Poldon Hills.

No Coal area in the United Kingdom is so disturbed and folded both along its strike

and on the dip of tlie Coals as those of North Mendips ; and like the Coals of the

" Mons Coal-field" in Belgium, which exists under similar conditions, the seams are

vertical and thrown over, so that the same seams are passed through by shafts two or
three times. The Vobster and Holcombe Coal-seams are the same as those at Ashton
and Kingswood near Bristol, Twerton near Bath, and probably the same as those at
Yate. They underlie the whole area between the IMendips and'Bristol, and are proba-

--bly the sanie that occur at Iun<?swood and underlie the Pennant at Coal-pit Heath.
   27(6 Trias. Two divisions of this group are greatly developed around and upon

the Mendips, especially the inferior or Dolomitic Conglomerate, a peculiar and local

condition of the base of the Keuper Sandstone of the Bristol and South Wales

Coal-fields, chiefly that portion of the latter which attends from Cardifl:' to Bridg.

end. The entire range of the Mendips is surrounded by Dolomitic Conglomerate

and ten or twelve patches still remain as unconformable undenuded masses of that

formation resting upon the older rocks forming the massive range of the Mendips.

This remarkable deposit completely covered the range when at a lower level, its

partial removal being conclusively shown by the remnants that still cling to the

steep face of the northern and southern flanks of the Mendips.

This Conglomerate is composed entirely of greater or lesser fragments of the older

rocks composing the hills, and is the result of the denuding action of the sea that

deposited the Keuper Beds. This marine denudation took place when the entire

area occupied by the Mendips and Coal-basin underwent depression, the Dolomitic

Conglomerate and sandstones accumulating ^;ro rata with the depression and con-

sequent destruction of the rocks offered for resistance. This conglomerate, the " over-

lie" of the coal-miners of the Bristol basin, although visible only upon the Palaeozoic

rocks surrounding the coal-bearing area, is nevertheless entirely spread over them,

and beneath the New Red Sandstones that occupy nearly the entire area from Tort-

worth to the southern flanks of the Mendips, its presence being marked by the marls

and sandstones of the Keuper, the Lias limestones, and in other places the Oolitic

rocks that lie within the Coal -basin, especially along its south-east border from Bath

Weto Wells.  have no physical evidence more convincing of denudation, elevation,

and depression over large areas of the earth's surface than what we can witness so

easily and study so advantageously in the Mendip Hills ; for this conglomerate

rock here defines the limits between Mesozoic and Palaeozoic times : the highly

inclined Old Red Sandstone forms the nucleus of the chain, the Carboniferous rocks

resting upon it ; and the Coal Measures in conformable succession to the latter were

all indurated, metamorphosed, elevated, and thrown into folds long prior to the time

·when, under slow depression, destruction, and denudation, the Dolomitic Conglo-

--merate was laid down by the Triassic Sea the resultant of wave forces along

a coast-line which was then the Mendip range, its shingle and boulders being slowly

cemented by a magnesio-calcareous paste derived from the wasting beds of the

great limestone series. For further details regarding the natural history of the Dolo-

mitic Conglomerate I must refer to a valuable memoir on this formation by Mi".

Etheridge, F.R.S.*

  --The Rhcetic. Singular beds of cherty and sandy deposits of Rhsetic age occur in

several parts of the Mendips, in places brecciated, or as a conglomerate, and resting

either upon the Dolomitic Conglomerate or Carboniferous Limestone.

The fossils are either cherty, or they have been removed, and their moulds are

formed of chert, or cavities are left where organisms existed.

These beds are exposed at East Harptree, Egar Hill, Ashwick, and Shepton-

Mallet. In the Vallis they repose immediately on the upturned edges of the Car-

boniferous Limestone, and even fill in the numerous veins, pockets, and faults in that

formation with fossil species common to the beds.

Nowhere can the geologist read more clearly the physical history of the groups of

associated rocks composing the structure of the Eastern Mendips than at Wells,

the Vallis, Watley, Elm, Nunny, and Holwell, where Old Red Sandstone, Car-

boniferous Limestone, Coal Measures, Dolomitic Conglomerate, Rhsetic Beds, Lias,

and Oolites are all exposed in natural sequence to each other. There can be

no doubt that the Rhsetic Sea surroimded and covered the Mendips ; for its remains

are found reposing on the Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferoiis Limestone, Coal Mea-

--sures, and Dolomitic Conglomerate, and pass upwards into the Lias beds.
    The Lias. Fragmentary portions of this formation are found resting upon the

summits of the Mendips, covering respectively Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous

Limestone, Dolomitic Conglomerate, and Rhsetic beds, and in the Holcombe and

Barrington districts resting upon the Coal Measures, proving the former exten-

sion of the Liassic Sea over the Mendips ; for upon some of their highest points, as

near as Castle Comfort, the cherty beds, with their characteristic fossils, are found
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

also at Chewton Mendip, Emberrow, and Ashwick, &c. ; and on the south side of

the hills it is found at a considerable height, as at Downside, Chilcott, and West

Herrington. During the Lias age the Mendips must either have been an archipe-

jago, or they Were totally submerged beneath the sea which deposited the Liassic

plain to the north and south. The re-elevation of the Mendip range has occasioned the

removal by aqueous denudation of most of the Lias beds deposited on their summit,

whilst along the southern flanks of the hills, and in the valley, a considerable thick-

--ness of this formation still remains in situ.
   Igneous Bocks. Mr. Charles Moore* has shown that there is an exposure of

basaltic rock (dioritic) along the anticlinal of the Mendips, a little west of Dovm-

head, extending visibly nearly as far as Beacon Hill, between two and three miles in

length and a quarter of a mile in width.

This igneous mass appears in the form of a dyke, and is coincident with the anti-

clinal line along the axis of the Mendips, which is here traceable for seven miles,

and is again continued from near Harptree to Shipham.

There is likewise at the south end of UphiU cutting (Bristol and Exeter Kailway),

at the western extremity of Bleadon Hill, an extensive patch of igneous rock, dis-

covered when that line was made, and described by Mr. W. Sanders, F.R.S.

this exposure was also in the line of the anticlinal, and ended in the fault which

there crosses the line. This rock, according to Mr. Butley's analysis, is a Pitchstone

Porphyry, whilst Mr. David Forbes considers it a Dolerite.

Whether this dyke was really eruptive or overflowed the Old Red Sandstone is

still a question to be solved ; and whether it is coextensive with the range is un-
--known
                                 ;
        but its  age                                                                                         must be subsequent to  the Coal Measures  the whole of the

Palaeozoic rocks being distm-bed alike, and lying .at one general angle of inclination,

the overlying secondary strata not being influenced or at all aflected by these

Palreozoic changes. The Old Devonian rocks in contact with the dyke are not

altered or metamorphosed, thus establishing the facts of age and condition.

   Among the many interesting features of the neighbourhood in which we are

--assembled is the Bristol Coal-field, which still offers an inexhaustible subject for

scientific inquiry extending from Cromhall in the north to Frome in the south,
and from Bath in the east to Nailsea in the west, comprising an area of 238 square

miles.

From a very early date it attracted the attention of geologists, and was long ago

the subject of a paper by Mr. Strachey, which was published by one of the local

societies. Dr. Bucklandf contributed an able memoir on this Coal-field, in which a

great quantity of important information was placed on record, which has been of the

greatest possible use down to the present time.

Subsequently this area has formed the subject of able papers contributed to the

North-of-England and South- Wales Institutes of Engineers, by Mr. J. C. Greenwell,

F.G.S., and Mr. Handel Cossham, F.G.S., and to other scientific societies by Mr.

Robert Etheridge, F.R.S., and IVIi-. Charles Moore, F.G.S.

During the past twelve j'ears Mr. J. M'Miu'trie, F.G.S. , of Radstock, has been con-

tinuously engaged in working out the physical geology of the district, and has con-

tributed a series of memoirs on the Bristol Coal-field to the Bath and Somerset-

shire Societies, which have thrown a new and important light on those marvellous

disturbances which have distorted the strata.

That part of the Report of the Royal Coal Commission bearing upon the Bristol

Coal-field and prepared by Professor Prestwich, and papers by Mr. Horace Wood-

ward and Mr. John Anstey, have summarized our previous knowledge, and added

recent facts thereto                                                                                         but with  all that has been done much remains to be investi-
                                                                                                          ;

Although more or less connected throughout, the Coal-fields adj oiuiug Biistol con-

sist of three well-defined areas, called the Gloucestershire, Radstock, and NaUsea
basins, each of which has its own distinctive features. The Gloucestershire is

separated from the Radstock basin by the great KingsM'ood anticlinal, which inter-

sects in a ridge-like form the entire Coal-field from east to west ; and the Nailsea

basin has been almost, if not entirelj', cut off" from the principal coal district by the

elevated limestones of Broadfield Down. Of these three areas Radstock basin is the

most extensive, both geographically and sectionally, a great portion of its thickness

heing yet entirely undeveloped. One of the features which will be remarked by

visitors coming from other parts of England is the number and chai-acter of the

Secondary formations by which the Radstock basin is overlain. Here and there, it

is true, Mesozoic rocks have been denuded ; but by far the greater portion of the

Coal-field is hidden beneath a covering of New Red Sandstone, Lias, and Inferior

Oolite, and many of the shafts have had to pass through all these formations before

the coal-seams were reached.

  A veiy slight change in the geological circumstances of the past would have left

us in entire ignorance of the existence of a Coal-field so far south as Bristol ; and this

reflection induces the hope that in other parts of our country (at present believed to

be without coal, or, if present, to lie at such a depth from the sui-facethat it cannot

be worked) it may yet be discovered at a moderate depth.

   Another feature of the Kadstock Coal Measiu-es is their great thickness, which

Mr. M'Mui-trie estimates at 8000 feet. From this we may infer that, however

limited the areain Somersetshire of which we have at present positive knowledge,
we are very far indeed from the edge of that infinitely more extensive area which

the Coal Pleasures of the south of England originally occupied, and within which

outlying basins may still be found.

It is abundantly evident that the Bristol Coal-field was originally connected with

that of the Forest of Dean and South Wales, with which it has many characters in

common, although it differs in other respects.

 --_ In all we find the same arrangement of the different strata, namely: 1st, an upper

division of productive Coal Measures ; 2nd, a central mass of Pennant Sandstone

and, 3rd, beneath, a lower division of productive Coal JNIeasures resting upon, 4th, the

Millstone Grit. Hitherto it has been fomid impossible to correlate the seams of

coal                   but they present many points of general correspondence in the districts referred

mations I have ah-eady noticed in speaking of the Mendip Hills ; therefore I shall

now only add such special remarks as are required to complete their sketch in the

Bristol district.

The Old Red Sandstone forms, as we have seen, the axis of the Mendip Hills, and

here occurs as a massive rock in difterent regions of the Bristol Coal-field, formiuo-

ranges of hills that have been sculptured by denudation out of its anticlinal folds'.
The beds in general are very unfossiliferous.

   In the neighbourhood of Portishead, however, the remains of some large fishes

--have been found in a hard conglomerate, belonging to the genus Holoptycliius

reminding us of the fishes of the Old Pied Sandstone of Scotland, which were all
encased in a bony armour, and possessed some of tlie most remarkable forms of the

ichthyic type. Pterichthys or wing-fish, Holoptychius or wrinkle-scaled fish, Cepha-

laspis or buckler-shielded fish are all forms of the Old Red, and the earliest repre-

sentatives of the class Pisces in the Palspozoic rocks.

   The Carboniferous Limestone is a great marine formation, and is formed of the
sediments of an extensive and wide-spreading sea ; the beautiful scenery so charac-

teristic of the Avon, Severn, and Wye is in a great measure due to the development

of this rock in these regions. One of the grandest sections of all the beds of the Car-

boniferous Limestone is that exposed in the gorge of the Avon near Clifton, where it
is seen resting on the Old Red Sandstone, and overlain by the Millstone Grit.

   The various conditions of the old sea-bottom in which this mass of calcareous
rock was formed may here be studied with ease. The entire thickness of the strata

exposed is upwards of 4000 feet ; of this the Old Red Devonian is 768 feet, the Car-

boniferous Limestone 2338, and the Millstone Grit 9o0 feet. This magnificent section

has repeatedly been the subject of memoirs by Buckland*, Conybearet,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Bright f,  and

Limestone series you have a succession of Brachiopoda                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Spirifera,     Producta, and

dated with tlie coral masses are other organisms which lived on the reefs or in

shallow lagoons. The coral beds are corered by strata formed of Oolitic limestone

and other detrital materials derived from the debris of wasted reefs, and formed

along the shores of the ancient coral strand ; sections of these oolitic Ijeds prepared

as slides for the microscope disclose the fact that the nucleus of the oolitic granules

is often the shells of Foramiaifera.

   Millstone Grit is well seen at Brandon Hill ; it rests upon the Limestone, and

attains a thickness of 1000 feet. On this repose the Coal Measures of the Bristol

Coal-field, which I have already described in connexion with the Mendip and Bad-

stock districts.

  --Dolomitic Camihmerate. The Palfeozoic rocks of the Bristol Coal-field are here

and there covered over by patches of Dolomitic Conglomerate lying unconformably

on their uptm-ned edges, at heights varying from 20 to 300 feet above the Avon.

This remarkable formation is very well seen in the new road leading fi-om the Hot-

wells to Clifton and Durdham Down. It has been long well known to geologists,

--and was in former days described by Bright, Gilby, Buckland, and others.
   Rh<etic. Between the uppermost beds of the grey marls of the Keuper and the

lowest beds of the Lias there lies a remarkable assemblage of strata, which I for-
merly described * as the " Avicula-contoi-taheds," from that shell forming the leading

fossil therein. The name Rhastic has since been given to the series, from a supposi-

tion that the beds are identical with some that occur in the Rhtetian Alps, which is,

however, more than doubtful. Typical sections of the Avicidn-contorta series are ex-

posed at Garden Clift", Aust Cliff, Penarth, and Watchet on the Severn, and at Wes-

ton, Keynsham, Willsbridge, and Saltford near Bath, and Puriton, Uphill, and "Wells

in Somersetshire, as well as at many other localities. Two of the most classical of

the series are Garden Clitt'and Aust Cliff"; the latter has been long known to conti-

nental geologists as the Bristol Bone-bed. In the upper part of the section are dark

grey shales, intersected by bands of limestone ; Avicula contorta, Cardium Rhceticum,

Pecten Valoniensis, Axinus, &c. are found in these. The Bone-bed consists of a

hard dark grey siliceous grit full of the bones, spines, scales, and teeth of fishes

belonging to the genera Nemacanthus, Acrodus, Sargodon, Hybodtis, Ceratodus, &c.

Beneath this thin Bone-bed with its ichthyic debris is a bed of shale which rests upon
Athe gi'ey marls of the Keupei".
                                      similar succession of strata is repeated in most of

the other typical sections. I have named especially those at Garden Oliftj Penarth,

Uphill, and Watchet.

   Aust has been long famous for its Cemtodtts-teeth, and is, I believe, the only

locality where they are collected. You will find a tine series of them in the Bristol
Museum. This wonderful collection is quite unique and will well repay an atten-

tive examination.

The only living representative of the genus Ceratodus now lives in the rivers in

Queensland ; and a fine specimen was lately piuchased for and presented to the

Museum by W. W. Stoddart, Esq., F.G.S., for the purpose of showing the com-

parative size of the recent and fossil teeth.

  --The Oolitic Formations. The Oolitic formations will long remain classical ground

of English geologists, as it wa,swhil8t studying these rocks in Wilts and Somerset
that Dr. William Smith first acquired that knowledge which enabled him to " iden-
tity strata by organic remains, " and establish a true natural system of stratigraphical

geology.

  --The Oolitic period admits of a subdivision into three groups the Lower, Middle,

and Upper ; each group is based on a great argillaceous formation, on which rest
minor beds of sands and cream-coloured Oolitic and Pisolitic limestones. The
Argillaceous formations form broad valleys, extending diagonally across England in
a direction north-east by south-west. The limestones constitute low ranges of hills,
with escai-pments facing the south-west and overlooking the valleys. The Lower
Oolites rest on the Lias, the Middle Oolites on the Oxford Clay, and the Portland
and Upper Oolites on the Kimmeridge Clays.

The Lia3 Formation is well developed around Bristol ; aud many interesting and

instructive sections of the Lower beds may be studied at Ilorfield, Keynsham, Salt-

ford, aud Weston, whilst the Middle and Upper divisions are exposed in other

localities. It has been often repeated of late years that the geological record is

imperfect, and that many of the leaves, and even whole chapters of the Rock-book

on  which  the  hieroglyphics  of its  history were wi'itten, are wanting                                                                                                                               yet " Time

which antiquates antiquities, and hath an art to make dust of all things, hath yet

spared these minor monuments ;" for it is certainly true that the Jurassic formations

contain a marvellously complete record of the succession of life in time during their

deposition from the dawn of the Lias imtil the close of the Ooral Sea, amid whose

islands fossil Cycadea luxuriantly flourished, and whose remains are buried in their

native Dirt-beds in the Portland Oolites.

I have shown elsewhere that the three divisions of the Great Lias formations

admit of several subdivisions or zones of life, each characterized by a group of species

Awhich individualize it.       careful examination of these subdivisions has further
--proved that there is no confusion in the rocks when carefully examined that Nature

IS always true to herself, although all geologists are not true to Nature. The

fossils of the Lower Lias are quite distinct from those of the Middle Lias, and

both specifically different from those of the Upper.

The Ammonites are important leading Liassic shells, that appear to have had a

limited life in time, but a wide extension in space ; and they have greatly aided us
in determining periods and making out the history of the Liassic Sea. The great
Saubopterygia, represented by the Plesiosaunis, and the Ichtiiyopterygia by

the Ichthyosaurus, are remarkable forms of Reptilia adapted to the waters of that

  --The Jurassic Age. Dundry Hill, 700 feet in altitude, is the most westerly out-

lier of the Oolitic range, from which it is nine miles distant. It is a locality of great

interest to the local naturalist, as it affords capital lessons of stratigraphical geo-

logy, admirable examples of sm-face-rock sculptiu-e by denudation, and a command-
ing point of view for siirveying the same, and showing the grand panorama in the
midst of which it stands. * The greater portion of the Hill is composed of Lower
Lias strata, which are well exposed at Bedminster Down, Whitchurch, Keynsham,
Queen Charlton, Norton, Malreward, Winford, and Barrow. The beds consist of
alternations of limestones and shales, having a total thickness of 550 feet. The

Middle Lias and Marlstone are feebly developed, and the Upper Lias repre-
sented by some thin clays, with dwarfed specimens of Ammonites hifrons and A.

communis and the Upper Lias Sands, from 1 to 2 feet thick, are not fossiliferous.
                                              ;

On these rest beds of Inferior Oolite rock which have long yielded a very fine series
of organic remains, some of the best of which are now preserved in the Museum

collection. The Inferior Oolite of the south of England admits of a subdivision into
thi-ee zones of life : the Loiver, resting upon the Lias Sands, has the Ammonites Mur-

chisonce as its leading fossil ; the Middle contains a large assemblage of Mollusca,

and especially of Am^nonites, among which Ammo7iites Humphriesianus, So^ccrhyi,

concavus, and Blagdeni are conspicuously characteristic ; the Upper contains Am-

monites Parkinsoni, Martinsii, and subradiatus, with many Echinoderms and a large

series of reef-building corals. These three subdivisions are rarely all developed in

the same section ; but the order of then- sequence in uatm-e is as stated in Dundi-y.
The lower beds are feebly represented ; and there is an immense development of the

middle and upper divisions.
   In the iron shot shelly beds there is a fine assemblage of Lamellibranchs ; and the

stratum which covers then is very rich in Ammonites, many with their shells pre-

served, and having their oral lobes and other appendages in situ.
   These are succeeded by other conchiferous strata ; and the whole is covered by

Ragstone and Building-stone, forming the upper zone, with Ammonites Parkinsoni,

Ecliinida, and Corals. Tlie stratigraphical, lithological, and palreoutological

conditions seen in the Oolitic capping ot Dundry Hill are repeated in other locali-

ties in Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, and Dorsetshire : and a full development of

   The gi-eat importance of the Bristol district as a source of mineral wealth, added to

mythe complicated sti-uctm-e of this reo-ion, led old friendMr. William SanderSjF.Ii.S.,

to construct an elaborate geological map of the Gloucestershire and Somersetshire

Coal-fields and adjacent counti-y, on the scale of foiu- inches to a mile. The topo-

graphical portion of this undertaking was reduced to one scale fi-om the Tithe-Com-

missionMaps ; and Mr. Sanders traced out all the geological boimdary lines in the field,

and laid them down in MS. copies of the Tithe Maps, making copious notes of the

strata as he proceeded with his work. The whole was finally reduced to one scale

foiu- times the size of the Ordnance-Survey Maps, and reproduced with the most

scrupulous care by Mr. Stratton, who for many years assisted Mr. Sanders with the

work which he had made the chief object and occupation of his later years ; and it is

but simple justice to say that, single-handed, no such exact map for any one area

was ever before constructed, either as regards scale or details. This undertaking

occupied its author 15 yeai-s, fills 19 separate folio maps, and is a most valuable

acquisition to the estate-agent, mineral engineer, and practical geologist. Its real

merits can only be fidly appreciated by those who understand how much patient

laboiu-, long-sustained energy, and high mental qualities were required to complete

80 extended a siu-vey over such a complicated piece of country. In doing this, how-

ever, Mr. Sanders has made his scientific reputation, enriched his native city, and

achieved a success which falls to the lot of tew men. Having considered the sti-a-

tigraphical relation of the rocks in the Bristol district, I desire now to say a few words

on a branch of the subject which falls more immediately within the range of my

own special stiidies, I mean the organic remains found imbedded in these strata.

The science of Palaeontology forms an immense field of observation, and one that

widens more and more every year. It is impossible to enter upon any of its details

now ; but some of its principles may be satisfactorily explained, and this I shall

endeavour to do.

It is now established, 1st, that the stratified rocks containing organic remains

admit of a division into four great groups, representing four gi-eat periods of time :

a, the Palseozoic or Ancient ; b, the Mesozoic or Middle ; c, the Oaiuozoic or Ter-

tiary                       and d, the Quaternary or Modern periods.              2ud. That each period is distin-
                         ;

guished by its own hieroglyphic characters, which ai'e engTaven on the rocks in

definite and determinable characters. 3rd. That these hieroglyphics are the fossil

remains or imprints of animals that lived in the water in which the sediments were

formed in successive layers on the earth's crust, and are only found in the rocks

they distinguish ; so that it is possible to determine the age and position of the strata

from which they have been collected, or, in other words, identify strata hij orijamc

remains; and by this key are we enabled to read the pages of the Rock-book, study

the history of extinct forms of life, and determine their distribution in time and

space.

Let us apply these principles to the subject we have in hand. The Palseozoic

period comprises the history of the Cambro-Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and

Permian ages ; and if we attentively examine the fossils of this period contained in

the cases of the magnificent Geological Museum of this institution, we shall see that

all the organisms belonging to one age are entirely distinct from those belonging to

the others. You will find, for example, in the case of the Silurian age, some beau-

tiful corals, crinoids, and cephalopods, with a remarkable assemblage of Crus-

tacea, the representatives of an extinct family, the Trilobitidse, which are so highly

characteristic of chis age that the rocks may be called Trilobitic.

   The Devonian age succeeds the Silurian ; and among the corals and shells so well
seen in this Collection we observe a striking resemblance to those of the Silurian on

the one side and the Carboniferous Limestone on the other; but when closely ex-
                                                            ;

amined we find that many are goncrically, and all are specifically distinct from both
bi-'side.s this we discover that a new group of organisms of a dillereut and higher

--type of structure are now introduced for the first time namely, those remarkable

forms of the ichthyic class the fishes of the Old Red Sandstone, and whose singular

forms with their bony armour and osseous scales remind us of the remarkable
fishes Lepidosteus and Poli/pterus from North-American, African, and Australian
rivers of our time. The hieroglyphics, therefore, engraven on the strata of the
second age are visibly diiferent Irom those on the first.

   The Carboniferniis" succeeds the Devonian ; and here we find a marvellous deve-

lopment of the life of this age preserved in the cases of this Institution. Pray
study attentively the fine specimens of Anthozoa here exhibited, all derived from
the upper beds of the Carboniferous Limestone at the gorge of the Avon, and show-
ing very clearly that this portion of tlie section was formed in a tropical sea, and

that the limestone is the product of the living energies of those Polyps, sections of

whose skeletons lie there before you. Of the fiimily FAVOsixtDiE we see Favusitcs,
Alveolites, Syrinr/opora Michelima ; and of the family Cyathophyllid^ we have
Ciinthophyllimi, Lithosirotion, Lonsdnlia, &c. Many of the beds of limestone are
almost entirely composed of the o.ssicula of Crinoids ; and we see the stems, arms,

and calyces of these sea-lilies strewed in abundance in the rocks, such as Actino-
crinus, Poferiocrinns, Platycrinus, Cyatliucrinus, Pentremites, &c., with the remark-
able ancient Sea-urchin Palcecliinus associated with them. The MoUusca were

chiefly represented by the Brachiopoda, which were very common in the Carboni-
ferous age, as you may see in the large slabs containing Orthis, Spirifcra, vrad. Pro-
thtctus in great profusion. The Lamelhbranchiata were represented by Cardiomorpha
and Conocardium, and the Gasteropoda by Euumphalus, Plenrotomaria, and Natica,
and the Cephalopoda by Goniatites, Orthoceras, kc. The Trilobites, which formed

so remarkable a feature in the fauna of the Silurian sea, are here represented

by a few specimens of Phillipsia, a dwarfed genus of this family. The tine

collection of teeth and spines of large fishes from the Carboniferous Limestone
enables us to compare the forms of this age with those of the Devonian already
described, and shows at a glance that the ichthyic types in the seas of these two

periods were entirely distinct, and both evidently adapted to conditions of existence

widely difterent.

   The life of the Carboniferous Limestone proves that it was a great marine forma-
tion accumulated during a long lapse of time out of the exuvne and sediments of
many generations of Mollusca, Echinodermata, and Actiuozoa, the reef-building
corals having contributed largely to the thickness of the Coral-beds, and the wasted

reefs of former generations having been used up again and again in the formation

of the Oolitic beds which succeeded the reef-building periods.
rv The Coal Measures present a remarkable contrast to the Coral sea of the Carboni-
ferous era. The Ferns (Styillana, Lepidodendra) and other arborescent Acrogens of
the Coal-seams grew and flourished in low islands ; and their remains were accu-
mulated under conditions very difterent from those in which the thick-bedded lime-
stones of the Avon section were formed. Good typical examples of the vegetation

of this remarkable time in the world's history are well preseiTed in the large
collection, filling several cases ; these specimens are aU very fine, and require, and

I am sure will have, a careful examination.
   With the close of Palaeozoic time there appears to have been a great break in

the stratigraphical sequence of the fossiliferous rocks ; mighty changes then took
place. Volcanic agency was intense and active, flexing, contorting, and upheaving
the older beds. These displacements in our area were post-carboniferous and
fire-triassic, and are well exemplified in the unconformable position of the Dolomitic

 Conglomerate and New Red Sandstone of the Bristol district.

   The dolomitic conglomerate contains the bones of Dinosaurian reptiles clis-
covered in Durdham Down, and preserved in this Museum ; they were described
by Dr. Riley and Mr. Stuchbury in 1836*, and were then the oldest Dinosauria
in Britain. Since that date the Triassic sandstones of Cheshire, Scotland, and

North America have been found to contain the foot-imprints of Cheirotheria,
and the same formation near Warwick the bones and teeth of remai'kable reptiles

belonging to the fiimily Lahyrinthodontia ; subsequently it has been discovered
that the coal-field of Miinster-Appel in Rhenish Bavai-ia, and that of Saarbi-iick
between Strasburg and Treves, contain the skulls and bones of several species
of air-breathing reptiles which were described by Goldfuss under the generic

name Archegosmirus. The reptilian remains of the conglomerate, though now

not the oldest of their class, still retain their interest for the Pahneontologist, as they
prove that highly organized Dinosauria lived on Triassic land. I must refer you to

the original memoir for a full account of these bones, which enabled its authors to
establish two genera for them. The one, Thecodontosaurus, has the teeth placed
closely together in the jaw-bones. They are shai-p, conical, compressed, and have
their anterior and posterior borders finely denticulated, and the extremity slightly
bent, like the teeth of Megalosaurus. Palc^osaurus has the teeth compressed and

pointed likewise ; but one of the borders only is denticulated, and the other tren-
chant. The species are distinguished by the size and form of the teeth. The ver-

tebr£e resemble those of Teleosmirus in being contracted in the middle, and having

their articular surfaces slightly biconcave ; and the rest of the bones of the skeleton

resemble the forms of the Lacertian type.

  We know very little of the life of the Trias in the district under consideration,

beyond the reptilian remains first noticed here, until we come to the close of this

age, when we find upper grey marls of theKeuper overlain by and passing into a series
of black shales and limestones known as the Avicula-contorta or Khtetic beds, which

have a great interest for us, as they comprise the famous Bone-bed of Aust Olift'
known to all geologists. The leading fossils are Avicula contorta, Cardium lihceti-
cum, Monotis dectissata, Pecten Valonimsis, and tlie small crustacean Esthcria mimda.
The fishes are Nemananthus, Saurichthys, Hyhodus, Gyi-olepis, Sargodon, and Ccra-

todiis, with bones of Plesiosauriis and Ichfhi/osuurus. It is the teeth of Ceratodus,

or horned teeth, that have made Aust Cliff" famous ; and more than 400 different forms
have been described. Mr. 0. T. Higgins made the finest collection of these remains,
which has been purchased for the Museum, and forms one of its rarest treasures.

When these horned teeth, so called from the prominences they exhibit, were first

described by Agassiz, the living species of this genus was not known ; it is now

ascertained that it lives in the Mary, Dawson, and other rivers of Queensland, and
is called by the natives " Barramanda." The Cercdodus is very nearly allied to the

Lepidosiren , is cartilaginous, a vegetable-eater, and, like the Lepidosiren, lives in

muddy creeks ; during the hot season it buries itself in the mud, whence it is

dug up by the natives, its retreat being discovered by the air-hole through which

it breathes ; its nostrils are placed in the inside of the roof of the mouth.

  A very interesting paper on Ceratodus Fosteri (the specimen in the Museum) by

Mr. Stoddart, F.G.S., will be found in the ' Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists'

Society,' vol. i. p. 145,

   The Lias, which succeeds the Avicula-contorta beds, presents a remarkable contrast
to them, and shows how much the life-conditions of every age depend on the phy-

--sical agents that surround it. Two groups of animals appeared in great force in the

Liassic Sea Ammonites and Reptiles.

The Ammonites of the Lower Lias beds (A. angulatus, A. Bucldandi, A. Cony-

heari and others) attained a largo size and the middle and                                                                                                                                                          upper divisions of the

same formations were all characterized by different species that marked horizons

of life in these divisions. Associated with the Ammonites a large assemblage of

other Mollusca are found, as Grypluea, Lima, Unicardium, Pholndomya, Cardinia,

Hippopodium, Pleurotomaria, and a profusion of Belemnites and large Nautili.

The Reptiles were very large, as you can see by the fine specimens on the w.alls

Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus were the dominant forms of this Class ; and Ptero-
dactyles with expanded wings performed the part of birds on the dry laud of that

era ; so that the air, the estuary, and the ocean had each separate forms of Reptile

life in the Lias age. Another change of conditions introduces us to new forms in
Athe Lower Jurassic sea,
                          large number of species of Conchifera and Gasteropoda

crowd the shelly beds of the Inferior Oolite ; and new forms of Ammonites apper-

taining to groups entirely different from those of the Lias are found in abundance

Echinodermata, and a large collection of reef-building corals in the upper beds of

tlie liill. Nothiug gives us a clearer insight into tlie fact that all fossil species had
a limited life in time than the distribution of the Echinodermata of the Jurassic
strata, inasmuch as tliese animals possess a skeleton of remarkable structure, on
which generic and specific characters are well preserved ; they form, therefore, au
important class of tlie luvertebrata for the stud}^ of the life-history of species in

time and space ; and the Table of the stratigraphical distribution of the Jurassic

Echinoderms which I now exhibit reduces these observations to a practical demon-

stration.

   The Oolitic rocks were formed in a coral sea analogous to that which rolls its
waters in the Pacific between 30° on each side of the equator. In the Lower Oolites

are four or five Coral-formations superimposed one above another, with intermediate
beds of Mollusca. The Middle Oolite is remarkable for the number and extent of
its coral reefs, and the Upper Oolite for those found in the Portlandian series.

   The Jurassic rocks were accumulated as sediments or shore-deposits under many

changes of condition ; and the idea of a slowly subsiding bed of the coralline sea
gives us, perhaps, the nearest approach to what appears to have prevailed.

   The Jurassic waters were studded with coral reefs, extending over an area equal
to that of Europe, as they stretch through England diagonally from Yorkshire to
Dorsetshire, through France from the coast of Normandy to the shores of the
Mediterranean, forming besides a chain winding obliquely through the Ardennes

in the north to Charente-Inferieiu'e in the south, including Savoy, the Hautes-Alpes
and Basses-Alpes, the JuraFranche-comte, the Jura Chain of Switzerland through-
out its entire length from Schafi'hausen on the Rhine to Cobourg in Saxony, and
along the range of the Swabian Alps and Franconian Jura. Throughout all
this widely extended oolitic region coralline strata were accvmiulating through

countless ages by the living energies of Jm'assic Polypifera, as all the Madreporic
limestone beds in these formations are due to the life-energies of different species of

Anthozoa and were we to venture to estimate the lapse of time occupied in the sedi-
                                                       ;

mentation of the coralligenous Oolites by what we know of the life-history of some
living species, we should find good reasons for concluding that the Jurassic age
must have been one of long duration. It is not the mere coralline structure ^;f;- se

that is due to Polyp-life, but the entire mass of Oolitic limestones are the products
of the same vital force ; for there could be no doubt in the mind of any competent

observer who carefully examined such a rock as that in my hand that it was a mass

of coral secreted by a Jurassic polyp, and that the Oolitic limestone which surrounds
the coral stem is the product of a portion of a wasted reef which had been broken
up, ground into mud, and constituted the calcareous paste that had coated particles
on the shore, and formed by the roll of the waves the oolitic globules which were
afterwards cemented by calcareous waters, and the whole transformed into the rock

we call Oolitic limestone ; and thus the genesis of the Oolites was due to the vital

energies of the myriads of polyps that lived in the Jurassic seas.

   The reefs that remain are merely fragments of what had existed ; and those that
have disappeared fm-nished the calcareous material out of which the Oolites of sub-
sequent formations have been built up.

   I have to thank my old friend Mr. Etheridge for the valuable notes he has

supplied on the Mendip Hills (which he knows so well), and to Mr. M'Murtrie for
his excellent notes on the Radstock district (which he has so long explored), and to
Mr. Stoddart for kindness and assistance in many ways. Without their friendly

cooperation it would have been impossible for me to have given so much exact
information on the structure of the interesting and complicated region in which we

have again assembled.
    In these remarks I have cra-efully avoided any allusion to the origin of species,

because Geology suggests no theory of natural causes, and Paljeontology affords no
support to the hypothesis which seeks by a system of evolution to derive all the
varied forms of organic life from preexisting organisms of a lower type. As far as
I have been able to read the records of the rocks, I confess I have failed to discover
any lineal series among the vast assemblnge of extinct species, which might form a
 basis and lend reliable biological support to such a theory. Instead of a grada-

 tion upwards in certain groups and classes of fossil animals, we find, on the con-

 trary, that their first representatives are not the lowest, but often highly organized
62 KE PORT--1875.

types of the class to which they belong. This is well illustrated ia the Corals,
Crinoids, Asteriadfe, Mollusca, and Crustacea of the Silurian age, and which make
up the beginnings of life in the Palreozoic period. The fishes of the Old Red Sand-

stone we have already seen occupy a respectable position among the Pisces ; and the

Ileptiles of the Trias are not the lowest forms of their class, but highly organized
Dinosauria. Ichthyosaurus, Plesiosaurus, Fterodncfi/Ius, Teleosaurus, and Mcgalo-
saurus stand out in bold relief from the Mesozoic strata as remarkable types of animal
life that were specially organized and marvellously adapted to fulfil important con-
ditions of existence in the Reptilian age ; they afford, I submit, conclusive evidence

of special work of the Great Designing Mind which pervades all creation, organic and
inorganic. In a word, Palaeontology brings us face to face with the Creator, and
shows us pLiinly how in all that marvellous past there always has existed the most
complete and perfect relation between external nature and tlie structure and dura-
tion of the organic forms which gave life and activity to each succeeding age.

   Palreontology likewise discloses to our feeble understanding some of those methods
by which the Infinite works through natm'al forces to accomplish and maintain His
Creative design, and thereby teaches us that there has been a glorious scheme and
a gradual accomplishment of purpose through unmeasured periods of time ; but
Palffioutology affords no solution of the problem of creation, 'whetlier of kinds, of
matter, or of species of life, beyond this, that although countless ages have rolled
away since the denizens of the Silui-ian beach lived and moved and had their being,
the same Biological laws that governed their life, assigned them their position in
the world's story, and limited their duration in time and space, are identical with
those which are expressed in the morphology and distribution of the countless
organisms which live on the earth's surface at the present time ; and this fact realizes
in a material form the truth and force of those assuring words, that the Great Author
of all things, in these His works, is the same yesterday, today, and for ever.

Description of a new Species of Lahyrinthodont Amphibia from the Coal at

   Jarrow Colliery, near Castlecomer, co. Kilkenny. By William Hellier

   gical Survey of Ireland.

The discovery of the remains of as many as seven genera of vertebrate animals

of the Labyi-inthodont type, associated with large Ganoid fish (Hhizodus, Gyracmi-

fhus, &c.) and plant-remams {Lepidodeiidnm and Siyilluria, with a few ferns, Ak-

thopteris lonchitica, Sphenopteris lutifolia, &c.), ten years ago in the coal of Jarrow

Colliery, co. Kilkenny, by Mr. W. B. Brownrigg, and their description by Prof.

Huxley (see a joint memoir by that gentleman and Prof E. Perceval W' right.

Trans. Royal Irish Acad. vol. xxiv. 1867, pp. 351 &c.) was alluded to by the

author.

Since then a much larger example than any of those previously described had

been obtained from the same colliery by the Geological Survey of Ireland, and

was the subject of the present communication. The occurrence of the genus

Anthracosaiinis amongst the fossils formerly obtained from this colliery had already

been indicated by Prof Huxley ; that specimen, however, only consisted of a group

of vertebrae and ribs, now in the British Museum collection. This the author had

examined, and believed it to be identical with corresponding parts in the fossil now

brought before the notice of the Association, and which he had named Anthraco-

satinis Edyei, considering it to be allied to, but not identical with, A. liusseili,

portion of the head, with the teeth, was the only part known. In A. Hdf/ei a

side view of the entire head is presented to view, triangular in shajje, with a

rounded snout, showing the large eye-orbits, external nostrils, and series of alveolar
Acavities.

evidently belonged to it ; they were described as conical, slightly curved, pointed,

and finely striated, Ij inch long by ^ inch in diameter ; also other smaller ones,
only three eighths of an inch by one eighth and a half. The characteristic

sculptured surface of the bone was well preserved on the detached jaw, and obser-

Avable on several parts of the head.                                                                                                       portion of the body, consisting of displaced

vertebrffi and ribs, with some larger bones (probably humerus, ilium, and other

bones of the fore and hind limbs), were scattered over the slab ; the termination of
the body and tail was unfortunately deficient.

The bones were not in a very satisfactory state for study. Some of the verte-

brae possessed their spinous processes (neurapophi/scs) and exhibited their concave

articular surfaces                                                                                in  others                          the  cetitra only were                                   preserved ;  these were about an

inch long and half an inch in breadth, the spinous processes being from I5 to

2 inches in height and J inch wide at their upper and widest part. The longest

lib measured about 65 inches with the curve, being f inch broad, a slight gi-oove
traversing its length ; the ju'oximal end shows the double articulating portions,

ctqntulum and tubercidmn. In the group of ribs and vertebrae fi-oni the same col-

liery, before alluded to as being in the JBritish Museum, one of the ribs measured

Q\ inches with the ciuwe and J inch in breadth, showing it to have belonged to a

much larger animal.

The extreme length of the head is about 14 inches, measuring from the snout to

the tympanic bone ; its height from the lower portion of the under jaw to the

supraoccipital is Og inches, being in the proportion of two thirds to the length.

The total length of the specimen is about 3 feet ; this does not, however, represent

any thing like that of the entire animal when complete, which must have been at

least 6 or 8 feet long.

The condition of the fossil, which is impressed upon two large slabs of anthracite

coal (obverse and reverse of the same specimen), is not at all favourable for exact

determination, and it is much flattened by pressure.

On tlie Action of Ice in wTiat is usually termed the Glacial Period.

                       By the Eev. James Bkodie.

   It is generally supposed that there was a lengthened period intermediate between
the tertiary and the quaternary eras, when a great part of the earth was subjected
to extreme cold. This has been called the Glacial Period or Great Ice Age.

   The facts adduced in support of these conjectm-es are :

      Traces of glacier-action have been foimd in regions which now enjoy a

           temperate climate

      Boulders, evidently transported by glacial currents from northern regions,
           ai'e found in temperate localities.

  My reply is, that these discoveries prove that in former times there must have

been great cold in places which are now comparatively warm ; but they do not

prove that that cold was contemporaneous over all the quarters where these traces

are found. When the climate was cold in one place, there is every reason for sup-

posing that it was warm in others.

Glaciers are rivers of ice                                                                                                            they come down from the mountain-side ; but they are
                                                                                                                                   ;

fed by the vapours that are principally raised by the action of the sun on the in-

tertropical seas. If the area from which that vapour is raised be diminished, the

vapour will be diminished; and if vapour is not supplied, no glacier can be

formed.

Glacial currents come from the                                                                                                             polar  regions                                      but they would cease if counter-

currents from the equator did not bring up water to supply the place of that which

they carry away.

It has continued its uninterrupted onward course, the cold gradually increasing

in intensity, down to the present day.

6-l< REPORT 1875.

On the further Exten&wn of the lihcetic or Penarth Beds in WanvicJcsliire,
   Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Yorlshire, and Cumberland ; and on the
    Occurrence of some supposed Remains of a new Lcd>yrinthodon and a new
   Radiate therein. By the Rev. P. B. Beodie, F.G.8.
   The author points out a considerable extension of the Rhsetics in Warwickshire,

Leicestershire, Nottinp-hamshire, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire, and traces of them in
Cumberland and Staffordshire. Many sections are described and characteristic
fossils given, thus showing that though they appear to thin out north and north-
eastwards, yet in aU probability they will be detected beneath the Lias in its range
from S.W. to N.E. The line typical sections of Aust, Watchet, Penarth, AVest-
bm-y, and Wainlode cliffs are alluded to. In this formation near Leicester probable
remains of the Lab^Tinthodon and a new Radiate are for the first time recorded.
Thus the British Rhffitic series, though greatly inferior both in thickness and
abundance and variety of fossils to the much more largely developed rocks of this
age in the Austrian Alps, is still a well-defined and highly fossiliferous formation
occupying a considerable area and holding an important and independent position
and future researches will no doubt greatly increase our knowledge both of its
extent and fossils.

    Note on the Deposit of Tin-ore at ParJc of Mines, St. Columb, Cornwall.

               By Clement Le Neve Foster, B.A., D.Sc, F.G.S.

   The tin-ore occurs in thin layers, generally 1 or 2 inches thick, interposed be-
tween the planes of bedding of the clay-slate, or Jiillas, a hardened jointy shale.

These layers strike E. & W., and dip north, at an angle of 60° or 70° with the

killas. They appear to be lateral offshoots of small north and south veins, and they

rarely extend more than a few feet to the E. and W. of tliem. Sometimes the

killas is full of little layers of tinstone for a distance of 100 fathoms from N. to S.,
40 fathoms along the dip, and 6 to 10 feet along the strike.

On Moraines as the retaining Walls of Lalces. By Ebwaed Fet, Q.C.

The object of this paper is to ask a question.

The origin of many lakes is attributed to terminal moraines of extinct glaciers,

which are supposed to act as the retaining walls by which the water is held back to

form a lake. Llyn Idwj'l is referred to as an illustration of this theory. But all

terminal moraines of existing glaciers are cut through to the level of the ground

by the streams from the glaciers. The numerous terminal moraines of the Rhone

glacier, each cut through by the infant Rhone, were referred to as an illustration of

this familiar fact.

For a moraine to act as a retaining wall for water, the breach must be wholly or

Howpartially filled up.  has this been done ?

shown to be a bed of only local occurrence, thinning away and disappearing entirely
to the north. The beds above the Chatsworth Grit in Derbyshire which are called
Second Grits by the Geological Survey, and the rocks in South Yorkshire which
are called Third Grits by the Geological Survey, were shown to be in a general
way the equivalents of one another, though, on account of the numerous changes
that are met with in passing from place to place, no correlation of individual beds
was possible.

    (1) is a group less changeable as a whole than the Middle Grits, but liable to

many local variations. One very striking case of the sudden thinning away of a
great mass of Grit and Conglomerate that forms its base in Derbyshire was de-
scribed. To account for the variations spoken of, it was pointed out that wedge-

shaped masses of sandstone have been, sometimes banks formed in shallow water
and tailing out in the direction in which the water deepened, sometimes heaps piled
up by the action of opposing currents. But it seemed that in the present case the
occurrence of lenticular masses of sandstone could in several instances be best
explained by supposing that the floor on which these beds were deposited was very
uneven and full of hollows, and that the great cakes of sandstone had been formed
by the filling-up of these depressions Iby drifted sandy sediment.

Notes on Carboniferous Encrinites from Clifton and from Lancashire.

                     By J. G. GuENFELt, B.A., F.G.S.

The author exhibited and described a series of Poteriocrinm plicatus from the

base of the Carboniferous limestone in the gorge of the Avon. The new facts
brought to light by these specimens are the anal plates, the arms which bifurcate

four times, giving eighty rays, the stem and its side arms, and a very remarkable

proboscis exhibiting a structure hitherto unknown amongst the Crinoids. One of

mthese is 4^ inches long by f inch wide, and is composed of long narrow plates
ai-ranged     five horizontal rows with longitudinal    and  transverse   rido°-es.
              number of plates is upwards of 1.300.
   The total

A new species of Poteriocrinus was then described, P. rugosus (GrenfeU), found
in the Lower Limestone Shales, Clifton, which resembles P. pentagoiws and

P. lomjidactijlus (Austin), but is distinguished by the depression of the ano-les and

lateral articulations of the body-plates, and  by  the  surface  of  the  body  being    rouo°-h
and that of the arms strongly wi-inkled.
A specimen of Rhodocrimis venis from Clifton showed that the rays of this species
hitherto unk-nown, were twenty in number and closely tentaculated. Miller's

figures of this species include  a distinct Silurian fossil, for which Phillips and
                                 name P. vents. Since, however, Miller's detailed
De Koninck would retain the

drawing of the species agrees with the specimen exhibited, it was urged that this
latter has the best claim to the name.

Jthodocrinui verisimilis (Grenfell), a new species from Olifton, was described. It

mresembles H. verus, but differs the arms being short, wide, and flat, and in the

rays being 40.

   The author then showed that Phillips's generic description of Gilhertsocrinns was
inaccurate in the shape of the scapulas and first intercostal ; but he argued that tlie
genus should not be confounded with Rhodocriniis, as had been done of late years,
being clearly distinguished by the form of the brachials and by the presence of

orifices opening into the perforations in the arms. He suggested that these openings

are not ovarian, but for the purpose of admitting water into the interior.

   Gilhertsocrinns may be defined thus :

    Basals 5 ; subradials 5 ; radials 3 ; brachials several, irregular ; the second
brachial channelled at top, and leading into an orifice which communicates with
the perforation in the arms : axillary plates well developed ; arms round, and gene-
rally set at right angles to the body ; body-plates generally tuberculate.

  A new species of Gilbertsocrimis from Lancashire was described, G. Konincld

(GrenfeU). It is distinguished from aU except G. simplex (Portlock) by five
prominent tubercles round the base. Fr<im that species it diflfers in shape and
size, in the narrowness of the subradials, and tlie presence of tubercles on the body-

plates.

On the Influx and Stranding of Icebergs during tlie so-called Glacial Epoch,
   and a suggestion of the possible cause of the Oscillation of the Level of Land

   and Water to ivhich that Influx may be due. By John GuNif.

   The author repeated his previously propounded views, that an influx of icebergs
was due to the increased area and depth of the sea in the northern hemisphere, by
which the perpetual snow-line was altered, and consequently masses of ice and
glaciers were disengaged and set floating southward.

   When the sea was of suflicient depth the icebergs would float over the land, and

their passage would be marked by boulders let fall, as was the case in the Chalk, iu
which they are occasionally found imbedded ; but when the sea was shallow they

would be stranded, and the eQects described by Mr. Gunn would be produced, as in

Ireland and the east of England.
   These phenomena were, he represented, distinct from glaciers formed on moun-

tainous districts, as in Wales and the north of England, whicli would be indicative
of cold ; whereas the increased area of the sea would indicate a milder climate,
except so far as it would be aflected by the influx of ice.

   Mr. Gunn conjectured that as no adequate cause had' been assigned for tlie
alternate increase of water iu the two hemisplieres, it might possibly be due to the
motion of the solar system in space, which Sir John Herschel had treated as a

useless speculation, but to whicli Otto Struve and other astronomers had directed
their attention, and had endeavoured to demonstrate the velocity and direction
of. They had not, however, at present been able to ascertain whether the sun
with its cortege of planets revolved around any and what centre.

   Here, therefore, was an tmknown quantity ; and since all other movements are
inadequate to produce aU the required results, he ventured to hint that they might

be due to this. He referred to the possibility that the tides might be aflected by

the relative position of the sun to the earth, which might undergo a change diudng

the enormous extent of the revolution of the solar sj'stem. At any rate it appeared
to him that no positive conclusion could be arrived at until this was settled.

   The tloor;of the brick-pits is of red Keuper marl, restinj^ on which is a thick
bed of grey marl, about 16 feet, with insect and fish remains, selenite and pseudo-
morphlc salt-crystals, pittings <as of rain-drops, c&c. On its uneven upper surface

teeth of Ichtht/osaurwi, ribs of Plesiosatiriis, spines of Neniacanthus monilifer and

Ilyhodus minor, teeth, scales, &c. of Ilyhodus, Lavicthys a^ncalis, Ceratodus, &c.

 Undulations of the ChalJcin the North of France, and their probable existence

             under the Straits of Dover. By Professor E. HIbert.

   I showed at the Brighton Meeting that the beds of Ohalk in the north of France
are folded so as to form five anticlinal axes having a S.E. and N.W. direction, viz.

                                                  the axis of the Perche,

                                                    ,, ,, Seine,
                                                 ,, ,, Bray,
                                                    ,, ,, Bresle,
                                                       ,, ,, Artois.

  On the present occasion I am about to prove that there is another series of folds

at right angles to the former, that is to say having a S.W. and N.E. direction.
   The mode of demonstration is very simple and rigorous. I take for example a

well-known bed, such as the Chloriiic Marl, and observe its altitude at various

points.

   Taking, for example, the region between F(5camp and Paris, which belongs to the

S.E. and N.W. anticlinal axis of the Seine, we see the Chloritic Marl at Fecamp at

the level of the sea ; the beds rise to the S.E., and the same bed (near Mentheville,
10 kilometres off) reaches 270 feet. Then they sink, so that the surface is soon
formed of the Micraster cor-testudinariuni beds, which are separated more than 200
feet from the Chloritic Marl. They afterwards rise again, and the Chloritic Marl
once more attains a height of 2G0 feet at Pavilly. It next descends by 470 feet at
least, rises again to 150 feet at Rouen ; and the base of the Ohalk with 31. cor-testu~
dinarium reaches the height of nearly 500 feet. Again a dip takes place between
Ilouen and Vernon, this time of 340 feet ; then at Pressagny, near Vernon, the
Chloritic Marl appears at 169 feet ; and finally there is a regular dip towards Paris,
where the Chloritic Marl is at about 1500 feet below the level of the sea.

    Thus the region between Fecamp and Vernon presents four undulations (Fecamp,
 Pavilly, Ilouen, and Vernon), the extent of which ranges between 400 and 500 feet.

   By a similar method I find that the region comprised between Treport and

 Compiegne (the anticlinal axis of the Bresle) presents three bosses, the first having

its summit at sea to the N.W. of Tr6port, the second at Aumale, the third at

 Breteuil.

    The axes of the Bray and of the Boulonnais present similar undulations. Blore-
 over it is easy to observe that these various bosses are connected among themselves
 thus the centre of the Bray axis is precisely on the line which runs from Rouen to
 Aumale, and this line, prolonged to the north-east, passes by Picquigny-s.-Somme,
 where is a rising of the Chalk, crosses at Ari'as the axis of Artois, and fi-om this
 point is directed towards the ancient rocks which extend from Douai to Tournay.

    Here is then a S.W. and N.E. fold of a well-marked character, and tlie extent of
 wliich is recognized from Rouen into Artois.

    The Vernon boss is the point whence starts another fold, parallel to the precediu"-
 one. This fold traverses the Bray near Ville-en-Bray ; it then passes at Breteuil,
 where a very distinct boss is to be seen.
68 UEPOR'r--1875.

These two folds are separated by a very distinct syucliual depression, which is

anterior to the Bel. nmcrvnata chalk, which at the north, near Moreuil and Hardi-

villiers, haye only been deposited in the depression and not on the rise.

  A third parallel fold extends from Mentheville, near Fecamp, to Tr(;port ; to

the north-east it passes near Lillers, where the Devonian crops out ; at Dieppe

this fold has caused a fault of about 250 feet. All the Boulounais is to the N.W.

of this line, and the beds dip to the sea. The Gault descends more than 330 feet

from Fiennes to Wissant.

But this movement of depression does not continue, and the strike of the beds,

which can be perfectly followed at low water, indicates a gradual rise. This strike

makes an angle of 38° to 40*^ with the coast-line (Chelloneix). The beds get further
off to the north ; but as we find them again exactly the same at Dover, they must

necessarily curve round towards the west ; and this can only be by the eifect of an

undulation similar to the last.

It is a legitimate inference to draw that the lie of the beds is the same under the

channel as on the coast; and direct observation brings us to the same conclusion,

viz. that the Cretaceous beds are raised in the form of an anticlinal axis in the

middle of the Straits. Most certainly, starting from any point of the coast between

Blanc Nez and Calais, so as to proceed to Dover in a straight line, it will be

impossible to keep in the same horizon of Chalk Marl, or Chalk without flints,

even if this bed were 400 feet thick. An undulation or boss some 400 to 5C0 feet

must be expected.

  We should therefore have here, in consequence of the preceding facts and argu-

ments, a fourth axis (S.W. and N.E), Faxe de la Manr.he.

   The existence of this axis was announced in 1846 by D'Archiac, who reasoned

from very diil'erent data. Every thing concurs to prove its reality.

It will be noticed that the extent of these undulations, which always bring the

Upper Greeusand to the surface in the north of France, increases constantly on

approaching the sea.

At Fecamp the Upper Greensand, which is here quite sandy, crops out at more

than 270 feet ; at Aumale it reaches 400 feet ; there is therefore serious cause for
thinking that a tunnel carried in a straight line would go through not only the

Upper Greensand, but also beds of older age.

The two systems of folds which I have described both bring about important

faults, from 260 to 400 feet in throw. The first parallel to the axis of the Boulou-

nais and Weald is not likely, in my opinion, to have produced any great fault in

its line of trend in the beds to be cut through by the tunnel. As to the second,

there would be nothing surprising if it should have caused a line of fracture parallel

to the  Channel axis                                                           but hitherto no evidence  has  been forthcoming on this point.
                                                                            ;

It follows from what I have said that if the tunnel is bored in the Chalk Marl or

the ChaUi ivitlioid Flints, or even proximately above this layer, it will leave not

only this bed, but also the Chalk Marl and G}-ee9i Chalk, and meet Upper Green-

sand, the sandy base of which, lying on the clay of Gault, may, or rather must,

contain a sheet of water.

  A means of avoiding the Upper Greensand would be to take a northerly direction

towards Calais, and to enter first the Chalk with Flints and then to go down into

the Chalk Marl. But this Chalk with Flints contains permeable beds; so that the

boring made at Calais in 1844 tapped at 5S0 feet a feecier of brackish water.

  In my opinion these permeable bands are beds of hard limestone pierced by holes

such as I have ii'equently observed in the Chalk. It is to one of these bands that

Mr. Whitaker has given the name of Chalk Hock. I do not say that these beds
are always permeable, but that they may be so. I believe that it is they which feed

the Artesian wells of Artois.

  Now there is one of these beds at the top of the Chalk with Amntonites ManteUi

and Ammonites rotomagensis (Grey Chalk) ; and there is usually one, sometimes

two or three, at the top of the Chalk with few flints. Above that horizon come

the Holaster j)lanus Chalk-beds of Dover, then those with Mic. cor-tcstudinarivm of

the base of the southern cliff" of St. Margaret ; all these beds are generally haid,

fissured yet they will occasion less dangers than the base of the Upper Greensand,
                                           ;

and their permeableness may be but accidental.

On ilie Oeohgy of Neiv Zealand. By Dr. J. Hector, F.R.S.

On some Areas ivliere the Cambrian and Silurian TtocJcs occur as Conformable

                          Series. By Henky Hicks, F.O.S.

   The author stated that of late years it has been generally supposed that there
was strong evidence in many Welsh sections of the presence of several important
breaks in the succession in these rocks, and that the series forming these formations
were not deposited over an area becoming gradually depressed, the usual idea being
that the area was at one time under water and at another dry land. That this
was really the case over limited areas he was not at present prepared to deny ; but
he thought the evidence of this was as yet imperfect. In other cases, however, he
was prepared to contest this view, and, amongst other sections, mentioned the
following as showing conclusively that there was not the slightest evidence of the
presence of an unconformity.

   In Pembrokeshire the succession from the Cambrian to the top of the Llandovery
rocks is a perfectly continuous one ; and there are no breaks seen anywhere but such
as are produced by faults.

   In the neighbourhood of Llandovery, the Oaradoc, Lower Llandovery, Upper
Llandovery, Wenlock, and Ludlow beds are seen resting quite conformably upon

each other.

   In parts of Sliropshire, the Caradoc, Lower Llandovery, Upper Llandovery,
Wenlock, and Ludlow are also seen, and there they also appear to be conformable
in the neighbourhood of Cornwen, in Merionethshire, the sections also appear to show
a regular succession from the Caradoc through the Tarannon shales to the Derbyshire

slates, flags, and grits.

   He therefore looked upon these areas as portions of one gi-eat and gi-adually

subsiding area, which remained continually under water, and received deposits
Tininterruptedly from the commencement of the Cambrian to the close of the
Silurian epochs. Pie believed that this was the case over the whole European area
where not greatly disturbed by volcanic forces.

On tlie Distribution of the Graptolites in the Lower Ludlow Roclcs near Ludlow.

                         By John Hopkinson, F.L.S., F.G.S.

   The author first drew attention to the special interest attaching to the Ludlow

rocks, in connexion with investigations on the vertical distribution of the Grapto-
lites, as being the formation in which they apparently die out.

   The Rhabdophora, or true Graptolites, which, with the Cladophora, or dendroid
forms, we find in infinite variety when they first appear in the Ai-enig rocks, genera
the most complex coming in simultaneously with simpler forms, were stated to be

--represented in the Lower Ludlow rocks by but a single genus, and that the simplest,

Monograptus and the Cladophora also by one genus only, Ptiloyraptus.

  A list of the Graptolites of the Ludlow rocks, given in a former communication

to the British Association (1873), was then alluded to*, and the main conclusions as
to the distribution in these rocks near Ludlow of the species enumerated, arrived
at in the course of a few days spent at Leintwardine immediately before the opening
of the present Meeting, were given.

   It was shown that several species of Monograptus abound in the lowest beds of
the Lower Ludlow, when these lowest beds do not, as they do near Stokesay, form
a limestone divided from the Wenlock Limestone by a few feet of shales ; that some

stone                        and that when a decided change in the strata takes place, indicating- in some

places, by more siliceous and gritty beds, comparatively shallow water deposits,

and in others, by excessively hard hne-graiued limestones, a deeper sea, a decided

--change in the Graptolite fauna occm-s the gi'itty beds containing in myriads a

single new species, Monograpius leintumrdensis; and the indurated limestone alone

containing the few species of the Cladophora, belonging to the genus Ptilo;/rapius,

which have yet been detected. Monograptus tolomts (a form passing up from the

lowest Llandovery beds) appeared to be the only species which sui'vived these

physical clianges, it having alone been seen in the softer beds high in the Lower

Ludlow, and passing up from tliese into the harder calcareous shales, which in some
places immediately underlie the Aymestry Limestone, when this is at the summit of

the Lower Ludlow, and again passing up into this limestone bed, in which it seems

finally to disappear.

   The author considered this Aymestry Limestone to form a portion only of the
Lower Ludlow rocks, not being constantly present, and sometimes having beds of

Lower Ludlow shales of considerable thiclmess bet%veen its layers and concluded by
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

showing the dependence of the fossil fauna and flora of these rocks on the physical
conditions of the Lower Ludlow seas, the fossils frequently' being only locally dis-

tributed, and varying slightly in their horizons according to the nature of the sedi-

ment deposited, the Graptolites especially being influenced by these changes, to
which their final extinction, or at least their dispersion from the area under con-
sideration, was considered to have been most probably due.

 Notes on the Classification of the Sedimentary Itocl-s. Bif T. M'^K. Hughes,
    M.A., F.S.A., F.G.S., Woodwardian Professor of Geology, C'amhridr/e.

   Prof. Hughes, in advocating a revision of the classification of the sedimentai-y

rock's, pointed out :

   (1) That, although the accumulation of rock-material may have been going on

somewhere throughout the whole of the periods -with which geologists have to do,
still that deposition has been locally inteiTupted many times

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

   (2) That the whole evidence had to be considered in each case, as it was a matter
of every-day observation that trifling geographical changes might produce con-

siderable alteration not only in the character of the sediment, but also in the faima
and flora of a given area; and small local in-egularities, due for instance to volcanic

action, might produce phenomena which alone would be taken for an unconformity,

implying a long interniption of deposit
   (3) That denudation proves a lapse of time somewhat commensurate with the

deposition of a similar thickness of material to that denuded.
    Bearing these principles in mind, he observed that the great divisions should be

drawn where it can be sliown there was the greatest and longest interruj)tion in
the continuity of conditions, the minor subdivisions being founded upon more
rapidly varying circumstances, which often produce even greater diflference in litho-
logical character and fossil contents.

  --He pointed out that our present classification was vei-j inconsistent some of

the breaks within the Primary, for example, being far more important than that
between the Primary and Secondary rocks themselves.

   He proposed the foUowing classification, read in ascending order :

a group ·would be made out'-betwcen the Labrador series, or Upper Laurentian, and

the Cambrian. lie considered that the attempt to identify the subdivisions of the

pre-Cambrian rocks in distant countries (l?ritain and iVmerica for instance) was pre-

mature. Calling attention to the two unconformable gi-oups which Dr. ilicks had

made out at St. David's, he felt satisfied that the Cambrian was unconformable to

the upper as well as to the lower, and stated that he had himself found fragments of

the horustones, i. e. the Upper pre-Cambrian group, in the conglomerates at tlio

base of the Cambrian. The oldest rocks of N. W. tScotland, of t!ie Malvern Hills,

and of Scandinavia, he thought could at present onlj^ be safely called pre-Cambrian.

 --(jth Epoch. Gap between Iluronian and Cambrian. Since we have in Britain

certainly two, and in America probably three series of deposits before the Cam-

brian, and the Cambrian may rest on any one of them, it is impossible to estimate

the diu'ation of the period between the Cambrian and the newest of the pre-Cam-

brian rocks.

 --Ith Epoch. Cambrian. He referred especially to the labours of Dr. Tlicks, and

thought that there were no hard and fast lines of demarcation between diflerent

subdivisions of the Lower and Middle Cambrian, but only zones of life, and that

the boundary-lines between the portions of the series in which these zones of life

occurred were continually being shifted. Sometimes, where a change in the sedi-
ment happened to come between two zones, this was seized upon as marking a con-

venient place to draw a line. Such a boundary was that offered by the Garth frrit,

which comes between the zone of Am/eUna Seclf/wickii and that of JEJt/lina binodusa.

No life zone older than this last appears to have been yet made out in the Lake-

district. This grit is not a conglomerate formed of fragments of the underlying

rock, but is made up almost entirely of quartz-pebbles, small and well worn, as if
Aderived from a distance.
                                             precisely similar grit occurs associated with some-

what similar slate low down in the gi-een slates and porphyry in Chapel-le-Dale ou

the S.E. border of the Lake-district, probably not very far above the horizon of the

Garth Grit. It is like the grit which occm-s frequently in South Wales in the

Caradoc beds, in the Denbigh Grits in North Wales, and in the Lake-district in

the Coniston Grits, and in all these cases is known to be far above the base in a

conformable series.

  A great part of the series above this horizon is, in the Lake-district and in North

Wales, made up of volcanic ejectamenta. In North ^^'ales the ash and lava seem to

have been deposited in the sea and modified by its action ; while in the intervals

between the periods of volcanic activity various forms of marine life lived on the

muddy bottom, which enable us to correlate the beds with the Bala series. In the

Jjake-district the sea seems to have been filled up by the immense quantity of
material thrown out, and much of the accumulation is supposed to have been sub-

aerial. In both districts volcanic activity seems to have ceased, while the fauna of
tlie ]5ala Liniestone still inhabited the area ; and subsidence went on while the
Bala and Hirnant Limestones, with a great mass of interbedded and overlying
Hags, were deposited in North Wales ; and in the Lake-district the con-esponding

deposits, viz. the Coniston Limestone, Fairy-Gill Shales and Ash-Gill Flao-s

(= Lower Coniston Flags), were formed. In South Wales and the western borders

of England only a few ash-like beds suggest the not distant line of volcanic outbursts.

Scotljfnd, Scandinavia, Bohemia, and America yield a series which, if not in detailj

can in a general way be correlated with these. The fact that the Lake-district
and North Wales were during this period the seat of old volcanoes, will partly explain
the difficulty that was experienced by Prof. Sedgwick and Sir Roderick Murchison

in identifying the corresponding beds in the two areas independently examined by

them                        and the  sudden  ending of the volcanic deposits may probably account for the
                         ;

local apparent irregularity of the Coniston or Bala Limestone on the underlj-ing

series, which induced Professor Sedgwick to make that limestone the base of his

upper subdivision, and which has recently been urged as proofs of an unconformity

by Mr. .Eveline. Except in connexion with the volcanic deposits, no break has

been proved from the conglomerates which form the base of the Harlech group to

the top of the Bala series.

Llandovery. He criticised the palseontological and other evidence upon which

this division had been made, and protested against the introduction of the name

Llandovery Rocks instead of May-Hill Sandstone, under which it was first de-

scribed by Prof. Sedgwick. In the Lake-district and in North Wales in every

open section there was an apparent conformity, though the overlap of the Graptolitic

mudstone, from the Coniston Limestone of Windermere to the Ash-Gill Flao-s of

Coniston, seemed to suggest an unconformity. The May-Hill Sandstone, thinning

out to the north and creeping over the edges of the Cambrian rocks and along the

ancient mountain-range of the Malvern and Longniynd, rests on the oldest parts of

the Cambrian and even on the pre-Cambrian. Still this cannot be said to repre-

sent the previous denudation of the whole thickness of the Cambrian rocks, as they

themselves thin out against the old Malvern ridge                                                                                                                                                                                        so that this epoch would appear

  Wi Epoch. Silurian. This series he thought commenced with the base of the

May-Hill Sandstone {i. e. at the bottom of the Lower Llandovery, with some cor-

rections of boundary). There was a very considerable change in the forms of life,
and this was conspicuous even where the stratigraphical discordance was not well

marked. There was little difference of opinion as to the grouping of beds, except

at the commencement and close of the period. Conglomerates mark the base at

Austwick and Sedbergh, on the western borders of the Lake country, accompanied

by a change in the character and colour of the sediment and of the organic remains.

The boundary can be traced through the Lake-district proper, and in North Wales

by the same change in the fossils and the sediment, but there is no conglomerate.

In South Wales a conglomerate frequently marks the base ; but the group of fossils

that comes on first is very different, and seems to suggest an earlier submergence

of the southern area.

Passing over the Wenlock and Ludlow, the next difficulty is in drawing the

upper boundary. This he would take at the top of the red shales and marls of the

river Sawdde and the country east of Horeb Chapel in South Wales                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               for there is no

evidence of a break there or anywhere else between the tilestones and the red

shales ; and where fossils have been found, as at Ijcdbury, in the red shales they

are common Ludlow forms.

   The author pointed out, by reference to original and published sections by Prof.
Sedgwick, that the views he now advocated as to the classification of the Cam-

brian rocks and the position of the boundary-line between them and the Silurian

were exactly those of Prof. Sedgwick. He further showed, by comparison of the
map and sections of Murchison with those of the Survey and later authors, that

Murchison had not, in 1839, correctly placed any one of the beds about which he

later came into collision with Sedgwick ; that the Caradoc of Murchison's sections,
supposed to rest on the Llandeilo Flags south of Llandeilo, was May-Hill Sandstone

or Wenlock ; that the Cambrian rocks, supposed by Murchison to crop out from below

the Llandeilo Flags, were Caradoc and newer beds overlying it ; that the supposed

base of the Llandeilo Flags was in fact the top. He further stated that when these

errors were corrected there was no acknowledgment of the approach made in the

new editions to the original classification of Sedgwick ; that the latest change had

carried the base of the Silurian below the unconformities in the Cambrian roclcs

given in vol. iii. of the 'Memoirs of the Geological Survey,' and had left it where

he thought no one would now venture to suggest there was any palseontological

or stratigraphical break. As this must be chano;ed, and the unconformities above

mentioned .would, he thought, be certainly abolished before long, he asked whether

for justice and consistency we should not, in adopting Prof. Sedgwick's classifica-

tion, adopt his nomenclature also.

 --loth Ejjoch. The Gap bchveen the Silurian and Carboniferous. This he con-

sidered one of the two most strongly marked gaps (except, possibly, some pre-

Cambrian intervals) in all the geologic series. In the north of England the

Cambrian and Silurian rocks were folded and denuded down to the Skiddaw

Slates : strata to the thickness of at least five or six miles were removed. In

the north-west of AVales a similar denudation  seems                                                                                                                                                                                     to  have  been                                                                                                                        going on                                     but

was not sucli great contortion and denudation previous to the deposition of the

basement-bed of the Carboniferous rocks. The patchy sedimentary base, consisting
of sands and conglomerate, rests on the Denbigh grits and flags. Skipping the
region of mid Wales, we find in South Wales still less pre-Carboniferous crumpling
and denudation. As pointed out above, higher beds belonging to the Silm-ian series

are left than any seen further north ; and the sedimentary base of the Carboniferous

Ls thicker. Still further south (in Devonshire &c.), though the actual base is no-

where seen, we have the sedimentary series more strongly developed ; and the early
t^'pe of Devonian fossils agrees with the idea that the Devonian area went down
first at the commencement of the Carboniferous epoch.

 --Uth Epoch. Carboniferous. In accordance with the above view of the pre-

Carboniferous geographical changes, the author, while disagreeing with Prof.

Jukes in his interpretation of the stratigraphical structure of Devonshire, still goes

with him in bracketing the Devonian with the Carboniferous, and would refer to
the same age most of the Old Red of Scotland, while a great portion of the Old
Red of South Wales he would group with the Silurian. Running over the principal

subdivisions of the Carboniferous, and noticing the occun-ence of coal-seams at

lower and lower horizons as we proceed from S. to N., the author next drew at-

tention to the large masses of rock of Carboniferous age which had been so deeply

stained from the overlying New Red that they had been gi-ouped with that forma-

tion                 and pointed out that as we approach the newest known beds of Carbqniferous
                  ;

age, we find indications of the commencement of earth movements in the local

irregularities in the sequence of the uppermost Coal-measnres.

  --\'2th Epoch. The Ititerval hettveen the Carboniferous and New Red.- This he con-

sidered the second most important gap in the geologic series. The geographical

changes which occurred in it were the hardening and upheaval of the whole of the

Carboniferous (and how much besides we have not evidence to show), the carving-

out of these rocks into hill and valley, and the development of a flora and fauna

difiering considerably from those preserved in the Carboniferous rocks. As the

base of the New Red rests on the edges of rocks from one to four miles in thick-

ness, this epoch must have been of very long duration.

  --\Zth Epoch. Neiv Red and Jurassic. This epoch, like the Carboniferous, com-

menced with the variable deposits accumulated along the shores and in the lakes
and valleys of an irregular continent unequally submerged. They consist of con-

glomerates, sandstones, and mudstones, and, like those at the base of the Carboni-
ferous, generally of a bright red colour. The red stain penetrates deep into the

underlying rocks, the siu-face of which often shows evidence of subaerial wea-

thering. What wonder that, as headlands disappeared, as barriers went down, as

--depressions got silted up, there should be irregularities of all kinds observable

between successive deposits such, for instance, as that at the base of the Upper

Magnesian Limestone in places, or that between the Lower and Upper New Red,

or that between the Bunter and Keuper. (He dropped the word Permian, as it

was only a new name given by Murchison to what had been previously correctly

described by Sedgwick as Lower New Red.)

   These rocks passed up through the Rhfetic and Lias into the Oolitic series, at

the close of which, as in every other case, we have a hint of the approaching
changes. Probably we shall some day have sufiicienj data to speculate on the limit

to which it is possible that continuous deposition can go on uninterruptedly in the

same area. However that may be, the further on we get in geologic history the

more clear does the evidence become that, as great waves of depression pass across
an area, sometimes the accumulation of sediment keeps pace with it, and leaves depo-

sits which show that the hollows had been tilled and lagoons and estuaries had taken
their place by the time the trough of depression had passed and the wave of upheaval
had succeeded. Towards the close of the Jurassic epoch, at any rate, we have the
Purbeck freshwater beds, and later the Weald estuary, where we know there had

been hundreds, and probably thousands of feet of continuous marine deposits.

   The author then considered briefly the gaps which occurred at the base of the
Neocomian and of the Cretaceous, and the intervals of which we have evidence at the

base of the Eocene and of the IMiocene, but reserved the fuller investigation of these

points for a future occasion.

Observations on the Discovery, by Count Abbot Castracane, of Diatoraacece in Coal

   from Lancashire and other places*. By Prof. Edavakd Hull, F.B.S.

   The author considered this discovery of so much interest and importance as to

entitle it to the special notice of the Section, and particularly for the light it throwa
on the mode of formation of Carboniferous coal. Diatoms had been observed by
Count Castracane in specimens of coal from Liverpool, Newcastle, Scotland, and
St. Etienne ; and in these, after repeated observations in which every precaution
had been taken to guard against deception, examples had been found in greater or
less numbers. The species observed are identified by Count Castracane with ex-
isting forms, and, with the exception of tliree maiiue genera from the coal of
Lancashire, were all of freshwater origin. The results appeared to the author to

corroborate the views of those who consider that Carboniferous coal had its source

in the decay of forests of plants, which gi'ew with their roots and parts of their
stems under stagnant lagoons, into which the waters of the ocean occasionally
found access.

The Dnfting-power of Tidal Currents and that of Wind-waves\.

                By G. Henry Kinahan, M.B.I. A. ^-c.

The author referred to the Report on Waves by J. Scott Rus.sell (Brit. Assoc.

Reports', vol. xiii. 1844, p. 311), which he considered ought to have decided the

relative merits of the tidal currents and wind-waves. This, however, seems not

to be the case, judging from the recent paper on the Chesil bank, Dorsetshire, read

by Professor Prestwich before the Institution of Civil Engineers (February 2nd,

1875), and the discussion that followed the reading of it.

After mentioning what can be learned from Scott Russell's Report, the author

gives the general conclusions he arrived at, after many years of the study of the

driftiug-power of the tidal currents and that of wind-waves on the coast of Ireland

and to illustrate these general conclusions, a detailed description was given of that

portion of the coast of Ireland (part of AVicklow, Wexford, and Waterford) con-

&tained in the Admiralty charts (Ireland, sheets xiv. xv.), as this coast was

aninutely examined and the results tabulated.

Tile memoir concluded as follows. The information gathered on this portion of

tlie coast of Ireland goes to prove the following :

   1st. The driftage due to tlie incoming tidal currents is alwaj-s, during its
progress, goingon in deep water, and more or less in the shallow water.

   2ud. The driftage due to wiud-waAes only occurs dui-ing gales, and even then

is only due to the waves that break on the shores.
   ·Ji'd. To prevent the tidal driftage, groins or piers should be erected ; and if

the pier is to form a harbour, transverse groins should run out from it to stop the

back-wash generated by the piers; for otherwise this back-wash would cany the

driftage seaward to be sucked round tlie pier into the harbour.

   4th. As the wind-wave driftage occurs during gales, and then only on the

shore-line, it might be prevented from silting up a harbour or damaging the ship-
ping in it by placing a breakwater across the direction from wliicli the prevailing

storms come. If sucli a breakwater were a fixed one, built of stone or some such,

it must more or less aiiect the tidal diiftage, and probably would help to silt up the

harbour                             but  if  it  were  floating,  it would break  the  wind-waves in  deep  water,
                                 ;

thus destroyino- theii- drifting-powers, wliile there would be no impediment to inter-
fere with the tidal driftage.

On the Geohgkal mmning of the term " liiver-hasin," and the desirahility of
           suhsfituting "Drainage-area." By D. Mackintosh, F.G.S.

The author believes that though field-geologists understand the meaning of the

word "river-basin," it is not only liable to convey a false impression, but has actu-

ally induced many geographers to represent watersheds as almost invariably run-

ning along the higher ground ; and, as a consequence, mountain-chains are repre-

sented as if they ran continuously along the lines of watershed or water-parting.

In most maps, so-called river-basins are represented as if they were really basin-

shaped ; but tlie author contends that there is scarcely such a tiling in nature as a

river possessed  of an  uninterrupted basin extending from  end                                                                                    to end  of its  course
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

that in mountainous countries rivers either flow through ruined mountain-domes,

or what might be called inverted river-basins, or they traverse with equal indifier-

ence a series of basins and connecting narrow gorges. These basins are generally

oblong ; and in most instances the rivers cross them, not in the direction of their

length, but obliquely. He describes the ruined dome through which the Dee flows

in North Wales, and shows that the majority of the highest eminences are situated

Henot on the sides, but towards the centre of this so-called river-basin.                                                                                          also de-

Wyescribes the miscalled basins of the        in South Wales, the Taniar, and the

Bristol Avon. After recommending the word "drainage-area " a.s a substitute for

" river-basin," he concludes with an explanation of how mountains constituting

" lines of weakness " were either worn down into valleys or merely sawn asunder

by marine denudation, so as to leave a series of narrow gorges through which rivers

found their way to the sea.

     On the Origin of two polished and sharpened Stones f'om Cefn Cave.
                             By D. Mackintosh, F.G.S.

   The author entered particularly into a description and explanation of the peculi-
arities of form and polish presented by two fragments of limestone found in the
part of Cefn Cave where sand and sea-shells might still be seen clinging to the
roclty wall. One of the stones was axe-shaped, with a vei^ sharp edge, and an
intensely polished though only partially smoothed surface. Many reasons were

stated for arriving at the conclusion that the stones were first in the state of rocky

--projections, roughly shaped by fresh water charged with carbonic acid gas that

the subsequently polished surfaces and sharpened edges could not have resulted

--from human agency, as they exhibited no indications of design, and could never

liave answered any human purpose and that tliey were merely an extreme or ex-
ceptional result of some Idnd of natural agency. The author endeavoured to show
tliat the polished surfaces could not have been caused by the rubbing of cave
mammalia, as they occurred on both sides, and ran very nearly all round the spe-
cimens. In discussing the natural causes by which the stones were finally shaped
and polished, he showed that fresh water or a stream of water running only in one

direction could not have been the agent, and that the only adequate explanation

was to be foimd in the to-and-fi:o, recur^-ing, insinuating, and powerful action of
sea-waves. The author went on to show that the sea-waves must liave wielded
ijroken ice, that at the time the stones received their final polish the ice must have

been free from coarse sand, <and that the sand by which the stones became enve-

loped was tranquilly introduced. He opposed the idea that the sand was derived

by fresh water from the boulder-clay on the platform above the cave.

 Queries and HemarJcs relative to existing Ice-action in Greenland and the

   Alps, compared ivith former Ice-action in the N.W.of Enr/land ami Wales.

    B>j D. Mackintosh, F.G.S.

    The author begins by discussing the question whether the so-called continental

 ice of Greenland be a true ice-sheet formed independently of mountains, or merely
 an exaggeration of a confluent system of glaciers. [Tliis and several other ques-
 tions, furnished by the author, were incorporated with the Instructions for the

 Arctic Expedition.] He then goes on to consider the state of the surface of the

 Greenland ice-sheet, and believes that the amount of moraine matter is locally
 limited and of small extent. In querj^ 3 he defends the idea of the internal purity
 of existing ice-sheets ; and in query 4 he states reasons for doubting whether
 glaciers are capable of persistently pushing forward the large stones they may find,
 in their beds, though he admits that the base of glaciers is charged with finer

 debris by means of which tliey grind and striate rock-surfaces. He mentions that

 in tlie Lake-district he had never seen a sharply bordered groove on a glaciated
 rock-surface which might not have been produced by a stone smaller than a walnut.

 He then quotes Forbes and Lyell to tlie eftect that scarcely any of the stones found

 in the moraines of existing Alpine glaciers are polished or striated ; and this leads
 him to ask, in query 6, whether the base of the Greenland ice-sheet be capable of

 holding"Jstones firmly fixed in its grasp. He states reasons for doubting this ; and

 after referring to the paucity of umformly striated small stones among tlie mountains
 of the Lake-district and Wales, which once must have been covered with an ice-
 sheet or ice-sheets, compared witli the abundance of regularly glaciated small
 stones in the boulder-clay of the neighbouring plains, he proceeds to consider the
 geological action of icebergs, and believes that they carry more roclvy d(5bris in
 their base than on their surface. In query 10 he considers whether grounding ice-
 Ijergs can give a roimded form to submarine rocks, or glaciate do-uTihill ; and
 states reasons for believing that they can do so to a certain extent, but that dome-

 shaped roches mmdonnees have been principally formed by land-ice. He sees no

 reason for doubting that revolving icebergs are capable of scooping out hollows in
 the rocky bottom of the sea, and thinks that lake-basins on the rocky summits of

 hills, or on waterslieds, may have been produced in this waJ^ He then gives

 reasons for supposing that the drift-knolls called cakers, where their forms are very

 abrupt, may have been partly formed by eddying currents or waves generated or

 intensified by ice-movements, which sometimes will set the sea in motion as niucli

  as sixteen miles off".

     The principal and most original part of the paper is on the subject ot coast-ice.
 The author brings forward a mass of testimony, accompanied by considerations
 which tend to show that floating coast-ice is the principal transporter and glaciator
  of stones, and that the uniformly striated stones found in the boulder-clay of the

 plains were both glaciated and transported by coast-ice. He enters minutely into
 a consideration of how stones, previously more or less rounded, became flattened

  and uniformly grooved on one, two, or more sides, the grooves on each side varying

 in their dii-ections. He believes that manj' of the stones found in the boulder-clay

  of Cheshire must have been frequently dropped and again picked up by coast-ice
  during the passage from their original positions.

  On certain Isolated Areas of Mountain-Limestone at Luclcington and Yohster.

  on which they rest, and the secondary formations by which they are overlaid. He

then proceeded to point out tliree remarlcable outliers of Mountain-liniostoiio occur-

ring at LiR-kingtou and Vobster immediately to the north of the Meudip Hills,
which, owing- to their abnormal position, had long been the subject of curious
speculation, and concerning which diftereut authors had arrived at very opposite
conclusions. The dimensions and situation of these limestone masses were de-
scribed in detail. The largest of the three occurred at Upper Vobster, and mea-
sured 1150 yards in length by 300 yards in breadth ; another at Luclnngton was
450 yards in length by l20 yards in breadth ; while a third, called the Tor Rock,
was of smaller dimensions. They were completely surroimded by Coal-measures,
and occurred at a distance of from 1300 to 1900 yards from the principal outcrop

of limestone in the Mendip range.

   The writer then proceeded to explain the views of other writers on the subject,
which may be classed under three heads :--First, the original fault theory of Dr.
Bucldand and the Geological Survey ; second, the combined fault and anticlinal

theory of Mr. H. B. Woodward; and third, the overthrow theory of Messrs.
Greenwell, Moore, and others. As to the first two theories, he said the workings

of adjacent collieries had failed to show any proof of their existence. He then

proceeded to prove that the limestones in question were superficial maases of no
great thickness, and that they did not extend downwards to connect with the
great underlying mass of Mountain-limestone, for the workings of several mines
and one or two wells had proved the existence of Coal-measures beneath them at a

comparativelv shallow depth.

   He expressed his belief in the theory that, during the upheaval of the Mendips

and the inversion and crumpling-up of coal-strata which accompanied it, the

limestone masses of Luckington and Vobster were in some way carried over from

the Mendip range, and so rested upon the Coal-measures instead of lying far be-
neath them. The paper was explained by numerous diagrams and sections, the
latter showing that the Mendips had originally attained a much higher elevation,
and that the limestone strata removed by denudation were probably more nearly

vertical than those which remain, if indeed the beds were not partially folded over

in the same way as the Coal-measures.

 On the Age of the Durdham Down Deposit, yieUlng Thecodontosaurus ^-c.
                               By Chaeles Moore, F.G.S.

   About forty years ago some conglomerates were opened up apparently resting on
the Carboniferous Limestone of Uurdham Down, in which were found scattered
reptilian remains, described by j\Iessrs. Eiley and Stutchbury under the names
Thecodontosaurus and Falceosaurics. They were then supposed to be of Permian
ao-e, but are now refen-ed to the Magnesian Limestone. The author believed them

to be still more recent, and that they belonged to the Ehretic period.
   In support of this conclusion he referred to a paper by himself published in the

' Geological Journal ' for 1807 *, in which he showed that over a large area in the

Mendip district the Carboniferous Limestones had formed the floor of the seas of
more recent geological epochs, and, having become fissured, those fissures had
been filled with the organic and other contents of more recent periods, these being
shown to be as wide apart as from Rhcetic to Liassic times. In veins of the former
ao-e he had found a fauna of great interest, including the reptilia Thecodontosaurus
and Palaosaurus, foimd only before at Durdham Down, and amongst the fish-
remains numerous examples of Saurichthys ajficalis and Acrodus 7nitn))tns.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ^

   The author then showed that precisely similar physical, mineralogical, and
palteontological conditions were to be found on the tableland of Durdham Down,
where numerous veins, one of them 18 feet in thickness, traversed the Carboniferous

--Limestone. One of these, near the Zoological Gardens, was proved to be of the

an-o of tlie Lower Lias Ammonites, Echini, Foraminifera, and other remains of
that age being exhibited by the author taken from between the walls of the Car-

boniferous Limestone 30 feet from the surface. In another vein near the Suspension

Bridge he had found numerous scattered fish-remains of Rhaetic age, including
Saurichthys and Acrodus, mentioned above, foimd also with the Thecodontosmtrm
and Palaosaunw on the Mendips ; and he could therefore come to no other conclu-

On Azygograptus, a neiu Genus of Graptolites from the Skiddaw Slates. By

    H. Alxeyne JSTiCHOLSojr,- M.B., D.Sc, F.R.S.E., Professor of Natural
    History in the University of St. Andrews.
   In this communication the author recorded a new and remarkable genus of

Graptolites from the Skiddaw Slates, founded upon specimens obtained by Mr. W.

R. Dover. To this genus the name of Azt/ffoc/rapfiis was given ; and in describing
it the author associated Mr. Lapworth with himself, as he was greatly indebted to

that gentleman for assistance in working out its true affinities.
   The polypary in Azyr/oyraptus is simple and unilateral, consisting of a single

monoprionidiau stipe, which is developed from the central portion of the " sicula "
on one side. The cellules are slightly overlapping.

    This genus seems to be intermediate in its characters between the Nemagraptidje

and the true Monograptidae, no member of the latter family having as yet been
found in strata as old as the Skiddaw Slates. With the Monoyrapti the present

fenus agrees in the fact that the polj'pary consists of a single unicellular stipe

  ut it diliers altogether from these in its mode of development, the cellidiferous
stipe springing directly from one side of the sicula about its centre. In this im-
portant character Azyf/oyraptm agrees with no other known Graptolites than JVe-
mayraptus, Emmons, and Cmiograptus, Hall, both of these, however, including
bilaterally developed forms. The cellules of Azyyograptus .are essentially of the

type oi MonoyraptKS Nilssom, Barr., and in this respect the genus is connected in-
ditFerently with either the MonogTaptidse or the Nemagraptidaj.

   The only known species of the genus was described under the name of Azyyo-

graptus Ldpu'urtlii. It is a slender form, about an inch in length as a rule, and

hitherto obtained by Mr. Dover only in the Lower Skiddaw Slates of Hodgson-

How Quarry, near Portinscale. It is very readily recognized, even in small frag-

ments, by the unique appearance presented by the triangular sicula standing nearly
at right angles to the slender celluliferous stipe. The fact also that the stipe
originates from the centre of the sicula, below its broader end, gives it a most
characteristic appearance, and prevents its being confoimded witli a broken Didy-

 tnograptus.

 On the Central Group of the Silurian Series of the North of Enyland. By

    H. AiXETNE Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc., F.R.SE., Professor of Natural History
    in the University of St. Andrews, and Chaeles Lapwoeth, F.G.S.

    In this communication the authors record the results of their investigation of the
central series of Silurian deposits which intervene between the Borroicdale series
 of volcanic rocks ("Green Slates and Porphyries") on the one hand, a)id tlie Corns-

ton Flcif/s on the other. They conclude that the series in question may be naturally

 grouped as follows, in ascending order :

          A. The CoNiSTON Limestone series, composed of
                     a. The Diifton Shales.
                     h. The Cmiiston Limestone,
                     c. The Trinucleus Shales.

          B. The CoNiSTON Mudstone seeies, composed of
                    u. The SkeJyill Beds,
                     h. The Knock Beds.
                                                                        ;

TKANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                           79

   The Dufton Shales are shown to constitute a mass of fossiliferous shales imder-
Ijiiig the Coniston Limestone, without the intervention of any igneous rock of con-
temporaneous oiigin. They pass upwards into the limestone, and are about

300 feet thick under the Pennme chain, but thin out in proceeding westwards.
The Coiiiston Limestone is the only constant member of its series, and the Trimicleus
Shales form a local group developed above it in the Sedbergh district. The entire

Coniston Limestmie series is shown to be identical with the limestones of Kildare

and Pomeroy in Ireland and Girvau in Scotland.
   The Coniston Mtidstone series is divided into two distinct groups, the Skelgill

Beds and the Knock Beds. The name of Skelgill Beds i& given by the authors to a
group of black graptolitic mudstones and shales, which seem rarely or never to
exceed GO feet in thickness, and which are found almost eveiywhere above the
Coniston Limestone. These beds are replete with Graptolites belon^ng to an ex-
ceedingly well-marked group of forms, which can be precisely paralleled with the

species" characteristic of the highest beds of the Iloffut series of the south of Scot-

land {Birkhill Beds). Similar Graptolites occur in certain black beds which occupy
a similar position on the shores of Belfast Lough and elsewhere in Ireland.

   The Knock Beds form a small but exceedingly well-marked group of rocks, which
are typically developed near the village of Knock in Westmoreland, but are found
everywhere surmounting the Skelgill graptolitic beds. They consist mainly of

green and purple shales and grits, and have yielded two species of Graptolites, viz.
Monocp-aptiis priodon and M. Browjhtonensis, n. sp. The authors consider the
Knock Beds to be the diminutive representative of the Gala and Ilajvick Beds of
the south of Scotland. They conclude, further, that tlie entire Coniston Mudstone

--series is to be regarded as belonging to the Middle Silurian period that is, to the

period in which the Loiver and UjJjJer Llandovery and the Tarnnnon Shales of

" Siluria " were laid down.
    Finally, the authors conclude that the true Coniston Flags are to be entirely

separated from the Coniston Mudstone series. They parallel the Coniston Flags
with the Denbighshire Flags of North Wales and the Balmae and Ricrurton Beds
of the south of* Scotland, and they regard them as forming the true base of the

 Upper Silurian series.

The Cause of the Qlacial Period, with reference to the British Isles*.

                   By Chables Eickexts, M.D., F.Q.S.

   Some wlio consider that the Glacial Period was dependent on extreme cold caused

by the winters occm-ring when the earth was in aphelion, with a greatly increased
eccentricity of its orbit, have deduced inferences which do not appear to_ accord

mwith present physical conditions. With great glacier systems, such as existed

North America and in Europe, the an- would have had almost the whole of its

moisture condensed out of it by the cold long before it reached the Arctic circle
consequently glaciers could not have existed on the water-slope of the land sur-

rounding the Arctic Ocean any more than they do now ; and, so far from an _" ice-

cap " covering the Arctic regions, there would not have been sufficient moisture

lett to form in it ice-floes so great or extensive as at present.

  The increased accumulation of snow now talring place in Greenland is accom-

panied by subsidence of the land, whilst elevation is at the same time rapidly

occurring in Norway and Spitsbergen; it is therefore not requisite to attribute

"the invariable occurrence of submergence along with glaciatiou to change in the

centre of gravity of the earth." The cause of the present subsidence of Greenland,
mas well as that in Britain during tlie Glacial Period, was ascribed
                                                                      the eftcct

which an increased weight of snow would have in forcing downwards the crust of

the earth into its fluid substratum (see Geol. Mag. vol. ix. p. 119).
    Previous to the Glacial Period the Gulf of Mexico extended as far north as the

junction of the Mississippi and the Ohio, Florida was submerged, and an extensive
belt of land on the east coast of the United States was covered by a sea hnvin^ a,

tropical temperatm'c. Such alterations in the coast-lines must have induced a

condition of climate nearly approaching, if not similar to, that which is indicated
by the beds of plant-remains found in Greenland, Iceland, and Spitzbergen.

    Dr. Carpenter has demonstrated that the north-polar " set " or cm-rent (commonly
 called the north-east branch of the Gulf-stream) is dependent on diminution of
 temperature in the Polar regions, causing displacement by sinldng of the surface
 sea-water rendered denser by cooling, and the consequent influx of lighter, that is
 warmer, water to supply its place. Increased severity of the winter in the north
 would therefore augment the volume and velocity of this current, and, cceteris
 paribus, thus render milder that of Britain. This appears to be in accordance with
 the persistent increase of cold in Greenland and Iceland simultaneously with
 recession of the glaciers in Norway and the occurrence of milder winters in Britain,
 and also -nath clianges which occasionally take place of a more temporary character,
 as the occurrence of winters in America of exceptional severity, whilst the same
 seasons were remarkable for their mildness on the eastern shores of the Atlantic,

 and vice versa.
     Not only has the Gulf of Mexico extended far up the valley of the Mississippi,

 mbut a former depression of the land has occurred the West-Indian Islands, to

 2000 feet and even to 6000 feet ; raised sea-beaches occm- on the west coast in
  California ; and the Gulf of California is but an extension of the Colorado river,
 which has been submerged. Subsidence to so gteat an extent on each side would
 in all probability affect the isthmus in a similar manner. If such a depression took
 place in certain areas to the extent respectively of 134 <and 300 feet only, it would
 enable the waters of the Atlantic to flow into the Pacific Ocean. The fauna have
 been considered to afibrd indications of a former intercommunication of the two

 oceans by the identity or similarity of many of the Mollusca (Mr. P. P. Carpenter,

  Brit. Assoc. Report, 1840) and also of the Echinodermata (' Depths of the Sea,'
 p. 14) on each side. It is thus more than probable that a passage for the equatorial

 current has been aflbrded at Panama and Nicaragua. If it occurred to a consider-
 able extent, the north-polar cun-ent would have had no higher temperature than
 that which it could derive from the temperate zone. Such a removal of the Gulf-

  sti-eam is by most, if not all, considered sufficient to reduce the temperature so as
 to cause the formation of glaciers in Britain ; but though the intense cold would
  condense the atmospheric moisture so as to cause extensive ice-floes between
  Greenland and Norway, there would have been but little remaining to be precipi-
  tated in the Arctic Ocean.

     It was contended that the succession of Glacial Periods, having intervening
  times characterized by a mild or even genial climate, as demonstrated by Mr. James
  Geikie, might have been caused by successive depressions and upheavals of the
 Isthmus of Central America. To obtain positive proof of this supposed change in
  the direction of the equatorial cun-ent, it is requisite that investigations with this
  object in view be made in Nicaragua and other parts of Central Ainerica.

On certain Icmje Bones in Shcetic Beds at Ausf Cliff, near Bristol.
                       By "William Sandeks, F.B.S.

   In the year 1844 a large cylindrical bone was found on the shore at Aust by

Mr. Edmund Higgins, from whom it was subsequently purchased for the Bristol

Museum. It measures about 15 inches in length and'about 17 inches in circum-

ference. About four years later Mr. Alexander Thompson, residing near Aberdeen,

found the largest of the bones, and generously presented it to the Museum. This

is about 25 inches in length, and about equal to the other in circumference, that is,
Aabout 17 inches.
                   third bone, the smallest of the three, was found a few years

ago, with a large vertebra, closely adjoining the thick "bone-bed; " it is 8 inches
long, with a circumfei-ence of 15 inches.

   Neither of these pieces had retained its terminations ; they were therefore incom-
plete fragments. The two larger concurred in having a long furrow, apparently

adapted to receive an artery or vein ; and the late Mr. Samuel Stutchbmy, who
was then Curator of the ]Museum, observed that an analogous furiow pnsfed along

the femur of the frog, and suggesttd that these bones might have belonged to

Asome huge Batracliian allied to the Labj'rinthodon.  few years ago Professor

Huxley saw the boues, aud remarked that Mr. Stutchbury's determination could

not possibly be correct.

  Subsequently I took them to Oxford, so that they might be examined by my
late estimable friend Professor Phillips. He immediately brought into comparison

with the large bone the femiu' of a Bleyalosannts. It was observed that the femur,

as well as the bone in question, was covered with minute longitudinal indentations ;

also that these changed their course on approaching the process of the lesser

Nowtrochanter.  on the large bone there was a slight protuberance, and the longi-

tudinal markings changed their direction on approaching it. If, then, this small

protuberance were the remains of a larger one constituting a lesser trochanter, the

resemblance between the bone in question and the femur of the Megalosaums would

become Aery insignificant. The great difierence would consist in their relative

dimensions, the circumference of the femur being about 13 inches, while that of the

bone is about 17 inches.

  Now it might be supposed that I should venture on the conjectm-e that we have

before us the  remains  of  a very large species  of  Megalosannts                                                      but I refrain from
                                                                                                                     ;

this because there is a striking difference in one respect between the two limbs that

have been thus compared. Phillips says " the femur is, or appears to be, internally

hollow." It will be seen that the Rhfetic bones are, on the contrary, solicl

throughout.

MyI do not Imow of any other definite character requiring notice.                                                       object is to

draw attention to these remark.able remains, so that if any explorer of Rhsetic

strata should find in any other locality large bones of mysterious character, he

may remember these, and bring his discovery into comparison with the bones

of the Bristol Museum.

                   On Auriferous Limestone at Walton.
                By W. W. Stoddakt, F.C.S., F.G.S., 4-c.

   jMr. Stoddart described the unusual occun-ence of the presence of gold and silver
which Mr. Pass and he had discovered in a sample of Carboniferous Limestone
taken from a quaiTV in the neighbourhood of Clevedon. The limestone contains
more than 94 per cent, of carbonate of lime, and is sufficiently pure to be used in
the manufacture of glass, the principal impurity being oxide of iron. The author
remarked the absence of sulphur and silica which so often accompany gold deposits,
but which in the present case were absent. The analysis of the dried limestone

gave the following :

   In order to coiToborate the results of the analyses which they had made, samples

were sent to Mr. J. P. Merry, a well-known assayer at Swansea, who completely

verified the fact of there being gold and silver present in the limestone. Although

the quantity of these metals is exceedingly small, yet the fact of their occurrence

in carboniferous limestone at all is exceedingly interesting and unusual. The
amount of silver present in the limestone varies in dift'erent samples, one sample
containing 94 grains per ton, while another contains nearly an oimce. The quantity
of gold present varies from 3 to 5 grains per ton. The limestone is granular, and,
when magnified, shows a great number of specks of oxide of iron ; the presence of
pyrites was carefully looked for, but none could be detected. It is very difficult to
account for the origin of these metals; in the part of the quarry from which the
samples were taken the limestone appeared much weathered, and darker in colour

   After noticing earlier opinions which gave a Devonian age to the limestone, the
views of Mr. Baker were cited as the first expressed on the Carboniferous side.
The latter origin was upheld by Mr. S. G. Perceval's determination of the corals
in the Taunton Museum. The present .author had found Lithostrotion irreytdare
in situ, which was held to be conclusive as to its Carboniferous age. The occuri'ence
of Triassic veins intersecting the limestone was noticed. Theoretically the Carbo-
niferous age makes more probable the existence of productive Coal-measm-es imder

the Somersetshire flats.

Discovery of a Submerged Forest in the Estuary of the Orwell.

                           By J. E. Tatior.

The author stated that his attention had been drawn to some peaty material

which came from the bed of the river Orwell during the excavation of a nev.^

channel. Fm-ther investigation proved it to be 9 feet in thickness, full of recum-

bent trees, such as dwarf oak, pine, alder, &c., the lower part resting on a marl

of freshwater shells &c., imderneath which was the solid chalk. The peat-bed was
Aburied beneath G or 8 feet of black river-mud.
                                                 series of thirteen excavations

and di'edgings conducted last November proved that the submerged forest extended

for seven or eight miles. The peat-bed on an average was about 9 feet (in some

places 14 feet) below low-water neap-tide.3. The tide rose 12 to 14 feet, and

therefore, even if the old forest had grown at the sea-level, it must have stood about

30 feet higher than we now find. Mr. Taylor then referred to other post-glacial

forest beds along the eastern coast, and expressed his belief that they represented

the last stage of the continental condition of England before the depression took

place which brought the North Sea over the low-lying plains, and so formed the

present German Ocean. Some fine perfect teeth of the Mammoth {Elephas primi-

t/enius) were found in the Orwell forest-bed and exhibited.

  Notes on the South-African Diamonds. By Professor J. Tennakt, F.G.S.

   The first diamond was found in March 1867, and was pronoimced by Dr. "\V. G.

Atherstone to be genuine.

   The number and quality of diamonds from the Cape are equal to these from the
Drazils, which have chiefly supplied Em-ope dming the last eighty years.

   .vbout 10 per cent, of the Cape diamonds may be taken as those of the first

quality, 15 per cent, of the second, 20 per cent, of the third ; the remainder, under
the name of barf, are employed for cutting diamonds, and for the numerous appli-
cations to which this valuable subst;mce is applied on the part of the glazier, the

engineer for drilling rocks, the lapidar}', and others. Many diamonds contain specks
and cavities ;. these are placed in the hands of skilled workmen who are acquainted

with the cleavage, and by careful manipulation they often get out portions of the
first quality for making small "brilliant?,'" "roses," and "tables."

   It is estimated that the value of the diamonds found at the Cape, from March
1867 to the present time, exceeds twelve millions of pounds sterling.

On a new Genus of Rwjous Corah from tJte Mountain-Limestone of Scotland.

                              By James Thomson, F.G.S.

The author stated that this genus was closely allied to Dana's genus Clissio-

Ithylltim. It, however, diftered from that genus, not ouljr in its external aspect,

but also very materially in the internal structure. He briefly^ described the cha-

racteristics by which the genus Clissiophyllum can be distinguished, viz. that there
was always a conical boss in the centre of the calice, and that in the centre of the
corallum there was always a coluniellarian line, which passed from the apex of the
boss down the centre of the corallum, and terminated at the inferior extremity
and that there were lamellie which passed from the inner margin of the primary

septa into the columella in the centre of the calice, and that they were united by
convex endothecal dissepiments, convexity upwards and outwards.

   The genus he proposed to establish can readily be distinguished from Clissio-
phyllnm, not only externally, but also fi-om the internal structure. The boss in the

centre of the calice never assumes a conical aspect, and is only slightly raised above

the inner margin of the primary septa, and is divided in tAvo by a strong middle

ridge, from which the author derives the generic name. He is confident that the

structure of the central portion of the corallum is more characteristic for generic

Wedistinction than any other part.  cannot, however, rely alone on that or any

other part of the corallum for either generic or specific distinction. If it is taken,

however, in conjunction with the other parts of the internal structure, it will enable
ns to readily decide as to what group the form ought to be classified with for

diagnostic purposes.

   Gmeric Characters. Corallum simple, cylindro-conical, tall in some forms, whilst
in others it is short and more or less turbinate and marked with ii-regular accre-
tion-ridges. Calice moderately deep, thin around the margin in some forms,
whilst in others it is everted. Septa thin, with lamina) for fully half their length
from the inner margin, wherein they become flexuous. Coluniellarian boss slightly
raised above the inner margin of the primary septa, with a prominent middle ridge,
which, in a transverse section, is seen to be formed of convex endothecal dissepi-
ments, convexity outwards. The outer area is formed of lamellffi, which pass from
the inner margin of the primary septa to the convex dissepiments of the median

ridge.

  A vertical section shows that the central area is dissimilar from the genus Clis-

siophylhim. Instead of a coluniellarian line in the centre of the corallum, as in the

latter genus, there is a system of convex dissepiments, which converge to the centre,
convexity outwards and' upwards ; whilst in other foinis there are several vertical
plates passing down the centre of the corallum, and each are united by concave
endothecal dissepiments. Fossula with small septa in it.

    This genus is established for the reception of a group of corals that the author

discovered many years ago in Ponneil Water, five miles south of Lesmahagow,
Lanarkshire. He has subsequently found them in several localities in the central
valley of Scotland, details of which will be given hereafter, when the specific cha-
racteristics wiU be described in detail.

On the Occurrence of a Loiver Boulder-clan or Till tvith Shells, in the Counties

  of Down and Mayo, Ireland. By William A. Traill, M.A.I, (blaster in

   Engineering), F.H.G.S.I., H.M. Geological Survey of Ireland.

   The author, in introducing his subject, briefly reviewed the divisions of the Drift

series, especially so far as they related to the occuiTence of shells in the lower boulder-

clay, which he had met with in several localities in Ireland, and hoped that such
places, and the mode of occurrence of such, would be carefully examined and noted,
as only a few instances of these shelly drifts in Ireland had been recorded.

   After long examination in the county Down, he was fortunate enough to find
some shells in the undoubted lower boulder-clay in four localities adjacent to the

Mountains, across Avbich the ice-ilow came from the N.N.W. and N.W., though
obstructed and deflected, yet passing over elevations of at least 2000 feet, is covered
by deep accumulations of drift, excellent sections of vrhich are exposed iai the river
and sea-escarpments, some up to 120 feet in thickness. In these were seen the
lower boulder-clay, or genuine till, restmg on the denuded and often glaciated
surfaces of the Silurian rocks, with subangular, rounded, and ice-scratched blocks
firmly imbedded in a brownish clay, the lowest portion being chiefly a blue clay,
and containing shells, mostly fragmental, those identified being TurriteUa com-
munis, Bticcimim undatinn, Leda rostrata. Overlying this boulder-clay in the above
cases, and as illustrated in diagrams, were the " interglacial saTids and gravels,"
mostly horizontally bedded, and often forming extensive flat-land surfaces. Over-
lying these in places were accumulations of in-egularly bedded gravels.

   In the county Mayo, near Ballycastle, a section in tlie Glenulra river, 120 feet
in depth, showed on top irregularly bedded coarse gravels for 25 feet, then evenly
bedded fine gravels and sands for 30 feet, containing shell fragments, below which,
though graduating from it, was some 50 feet of lower boulder-clay, the lowest part
being a stifle plastic blue clay ; in these, especially in the latter, the shell fragments
were very abundant. In several localities adjacent, particularly in the stream
Fiddawntawnanauneen, the specimens obtained were both numerous and very per-
fect; those identified were 'Tel/ina pro.rhna, Cyprina islandica, and a Balanus. The
author, without wishing to theorize on these deposits, wished only to add a few
facts to the general store of knowledge regarding our drift deposits.

    {^Master in Engineering), F.R.G.S.I., H.M. Geological Survey of Ireland.

   The district in which this rock occurs is situated on the northern shore of the
county Mayo, the rocks of the country consisting of Carboniferous sandstones and
limestones," viz. white, brown, yellow, and red sandstones, with bands of shales,
and pure and impure limestones, mostly inclined at low angles E.N.E. In that
district several stalactite formations and deposits of carbonate of lime occur, the
largest being "The Glen Rock," about two miles from Ballycastle, a mass of
calcareous tuff" and travertine resting on the easternflanksof the valley along which

--the limestone beds crop out, approximately of the following dimensions : length

N. and S. 310 feet, E. and W. 285 feet, and in depth or thickness from G to '80

feet. The mass is irregular, and in cubic contents about 2,100,000 cubic feet. The
tuft' varies from a soft porous nature to a hard ringing travertine, and is composed

 chiefly of the casts or incrusted forms of diverse vegetations, of brambles, ferns,
 grasses, and ivy. Sec, and containing the bones of birds and small animals, aud

 shells of land-snails, &c. The origin of this large mass must be attributed to a
large spring or " Holy Well," situated a little above on the slope of the hill. The
 water, by its passage through the limestone rock, becoming highly impregnated
 with lime, and by flowing over the vegetation on the slopes, has encased and
 cemented them together, and produced a much more vigorous growth, thus more

--rapidly building up this isolated mass of tuft", which stands out as a striking feature

 throughout the valley the age of this mass being, of course, quite recent, after
 the present conflgTiration of the coimtry had been formed. There are evidences,
 however, that it has not increased in thickness for the last 300 years, as foundations

 of that age still exist on its highest summit ; but now it seems to be rather break-
 ing up under its own superimposed weight.

    For upwards of twenty j'ears a school was held in a natural cave in this rod:,
 enlarged for the accommodation of sixty scholars, but which was closed in
 the year 1815. Since then the roof has subsided, filling it up for the most
 part. Various traditions connected with this rock were also noted, and specimens

 exhibited.

Note on the BejptiUan Remains from the Dolomitic Conglomerate on Durdham
                     Down. By Dr. Thomas Weight, F.E.S.E.

   The author placed on the table the original specimens of Thecodontosaiirm and
Palaosaunis ootained from the dolomitic conglomerate of Durdham Down, and

described by Dr. Riley and Mr. Stutchbury in the Geological Transactions, 1836.

The author briefly described the principal characters of these remains, especially
the jaw, teeth, vertebrae, and bones of the limbs, and which were all firmly im-

bedded in the conglomerate rock. He said the object he had in view in bringing

this subject before the Section was to obtain an authoritative expression of opinion

from the local geologists present as to the age of the conglomerate containing these

Dinosaurian remains, as a doubt had been cast on the usually received opinion of

the age of this formation in the late discussion which had taken place on the

W.Avicida contorta or Rhcetic beds. IMr.  Sanders, whilst objecting to the term

"dolomitic conglomerate," had nevertheless stated his conviction that the conglo-

merate formed part of the New Red Sandstone or Triassic series, and as such he

had placed it in his geological map of the district. Mr. W. W. Stoddart, who

admitted the conglomerate to he of Trias age, stated that he had analyzed the rock,

and found it to be for the most part a double carbonate of magnesia and lime, and

that it contained minerals foimd only in the Triassic rocks. Mr. Etheridge was

also cited by the  author as giving affirmative testimony to the  same  opinion                                he
                                                                                                            ;

therefore held that, with the evidence adduced, there could be no doubt that

the dolomitic conglomerate was of Triassic age, and that the bones exhibited
belonged to Dinosaurian reptiles of that period. This conglomerate rock was alto-

gether different from the Liassic and other debris, rolled and rounded, that filled

fissures in the Carboniferous limestone, of which they heard so much on a pre-

vious occasion. This conglomerate had been likened by one of the. sj)eakers in the
Avicida-contorta debate to the matrix of these fissui-es ; but the expression of opinion
given to-day on this subject, he hoped, would remove the doubt that had been cast

upon this point, and settle the question of the age of the dolomitic conglomerate,

which was, he believed, a formation of the Triassic period.

                                                                     Section.

In the office, which I-have now held for more than sixteen years, of Secretary to

the Zoological Society of London, I have been not unfrequeutly requested by our
Members and Correspondents in various parts of the world to furnish them with
information as to the best works to be consulted on the Zoology of the coimtries
in which they are resident, or which they are about to visit. With the well-

furnished Library of the Zoological Society at my command this is not usually a

very difficult task, so far as publications are actually in existence to supply the

desii-ed information. I am also frequently asked to point out the principal defici-

encies in our knowledge of the animals of particular countries. This is also a not
very difficult reqviest to comply with, although it is somewhat embarrassing on ac-

count of the veiy imperfect information which we still possess of geogi-aphical zoology
generally, and the largeness of the claims I am therefore constrained to put forward
for the attention of those who make such inquiries. Great, however, has been the
progress made of late years towards a more complete Imowledge of the faunas of

the various parts of the earth's sxu-face. Expeditions have been sent out into
countries not previously explored ; collections have been formed in districts hitherto

little Imown ; and many general works have been published combining the results
of previous fragmentary Imowledge on this class of subjects. Under these circum-

stances I have thought that suclx an account as I might be able to give of the
          --                                                                                                                                                      --

general p-ogress that has been recently made towards a better knowledge of the

zoology of the various parts of the earth's surface, accompanied by a series of
remarks upon the best available authorities to be consulted upon such subjects,
might supply a want which, as above mentioned, I know, by personal experience, is
often felt, and at the same time would form a not inappropriate address from the

chair which I have now the honour to occupy,

  I must premise, however, that my observations must be restricted mainly to the

terrestrial members of the Subkingdom Vertebrata. To review the recent progress of

our Ivuowledge of the various sections of invertebrate animals in different countries

would be beyond my powers, and would inordinately enlarge my subject. Besides,

it is certain that the higher classes of animals have occupied the principal attention

of recent writers on geographical zoology, and it is with the distribution of these

classes that we are best acquainted.

   Taking therefore in succession the seven great Regions into which the earth's

surface may be most conveniently divided for zoological purposes, I will endeavour

to point out our present leading authorities on the Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Batra-
chians, and Fishes of each of them and their main constituent parts. At the saiue
time I will endeavour to indicate the principal deficiencies in our knowledge of
these subjects, and may perhaps be able to add a few suggestions as to how some
of these deficiencies might be best overcome.

   In these remarks I will take the divisions of the earth's surface in the same order

as I have generally used in my lectures on zoological geography *, namely :

              I. Palajarctic Region "^

               II. Etliiopian Region I
              Ilrt. Lemurian Subregion \ Arcfoffcea.

              III. Indian Region

              IV. Nearctic Region    J

                                   J

              V. Neotropical Region                                                                                                                  ^^  ,
                                                                                                                                                  |
              V«. AntiUean Subregion [ ^««''-».'/*«-

              VI. Australian Region . .Antarctof/fpa.

              VII. Pacific Region                                                                                                                    Ornithogmi.

                        I. THE PALiEAROTIC REGION.

   The Palrearctic Region I shall consider for convenience' sake in the following

seven subregions :

   1 The Cisatlantean Si(hregion, embracing all that part of the Palfearctic Region
lying south of the Mediterranean Sea.

   1«. The Atlantic Islands,
   2. The Euroiwan Siibrcc/ion.
   3. The Siberian Stibregion, embracing the whole of Northern Asia.
   4. The Mantchurian Subregion, containing Northern China and the adjoining
part of Mongolia.
   5. The Japanese Subregion, embracing the Japanese Islands.

   6. The Tartarian Suhregion, containing the great desert-region of Central Asia.
   7. The Persian Subregion, embracing Persia, Asia Minor, and Syria.

              1. The Cisatlantean Subregion,

As regards the zoology of the main western portion of this district (Tunis and

Algeria) our knowledge may now be said to be pi'etty far advanced. The standard

work on the subject is the 'Exploration Scientifique de I'Algurie' (1), published
by the French Government, in which are treatises on the Mammals and Birds of

Algeria by Loche, and on the Reptiles and Fishes by Guichenot. This work was

commenced in parts in 1840; and the portions relating to the Mammals and

Birds were, I believe, intended to be written by jM. Vaillant, the artist of the

Commission ; but only the plates were issued ; and the text, by Captain Loclie, was

Anot completed imtil 1867.  smaller and more convenient work for travellers is

the last-named author's catalogue of the Mammals and Birds of Algeria (2) pub-

lished in 1858; whilst upon the Freshwater Fishes, Gervais's article iu the

· Comptes Rendus ' for 180(3 (3), and the memoir of Messrs. Playfair and Letoui'ueux

in the ' Annals ' for 1871 (4), may be profitably consulted.
   As regards the Herpetology of Algeria, an excellent memoir on this subject,

bv Ur. Alexander Strauch, will be found in the fourth volume of the new me-
moirs of the Academy of St. Petersbm-g (5). Those who penetrate beyond the Atlas

will find many references to the vertebrated animals of that district appended to
Canon Tristram's ' Great Sahara' (6). Many interesting details about the birdsof
Tunis and Algeria will likewise be found in the papers communicated to ' The Ibis,'

by Messrs. Salvin (7), Tristram (8), and J. H. Gurney, jun. (9).
   Of Morocco and the extreme western portion of the Atlas our knowledge is as yet

by no means so perfect. As regards the Birds of Tangier and its vicinity we have

Colonel Irby's lately published volume on the Ornithology of the Straits of Gibraltar

(TO), in which the "" observations on the Moorish Birds are in a great measm'e culled
from the MSS. of the late M. Favier--a collector long resident in Tangier." But

iu the south of Morocco, in the Western Atlas, and surroimding district there is
certainly a considerable terra incorinita within easy reach of England, which has

hitherto been almost inaccessible ' to naturalists, though the short expedition of

Dr. Hooker, Mr. Maw, and Mr. Ball in 1871 (of which a notice only_ has been

published (11) ; but a complete scientific account is, I believe, in preparation) shows

that it may be penetrated if proper precautions are taken.

                                 1 a. The Atlantic Islands.

   The Atlanteau Island-groups of the Canaries, Madeira, and the Azores may

perhaps be most naturally appended to this division of the Palsearctic Region.
Our knowledge of the fauna of each of these three groups is tolerable, although

there is of course much to be done in worldug up details. As regards the Canaries,
the standard work is AVebb and Berthelot's ' Histoire Naturelle des lies Canaries '

(12), published at Paris under the auspices of the Minister of Public Instruction.

Ur. Carl BoUe has -v-isited the group more recently, and has written several excel-

lent articles in Cabanis's Journal on its Ornithology (l-S).
   Madeii'a has had the advantage of the residence of several first-class English

natiu'alists ; I need only mention the names of Lowe, Vernon-Wollaston, and

.Johnston to establish this point. More than twenty years ago Mr. E. Y. Ilarcourt,

in his Sketch of Madeira (14) and in contributions to the ' Proceedings of the
Zoological Society' (15) and ' Annals of Natural History ' (16), gave us a good

accoimt of the Ornithology of Madeira. Mr, F. Godman has recently published

an exceUeut article on the Birds of Madeira and the Canaries, in ' The Ibis for 1872
(17), in which a complete r^sum^ is given of the whole of our previous knowledge
of this subject, together with the information obtained by the author himself

during his expedition to those islands in 1871.

   As regards the Fishes of Madeira, they have formed a subject of study of several
excellent Ichthvologists. The Rev. E. T. Lowe made numerous communications
to the Zoological Society of London upon them in the early days of the Society,

and published in their ' Transactions ' iu 1839 a Synopsis of Madeiran Fishes (18),
to which several supplements were afterwards added. Subsequently Mr. J. Y.
Johnson took up the subject and made numerous additions to Mr. Lowe's experi-
ences, which were mostly published by the same Society (19). Dr. Giinther has
likewise contributed to our knowledge of Madeiran Fishes (20) ; so that on the
whole there is, perhaps, hardly any locality out of Europe with the Ichthyology of

which we have a better general acquaintance.

    For our knowledge of the higher animals of the third of the Island-groups above
spoken of, that of the Azores, we are mainly indebted to the energy of Mr. F._ D.

Godman, who made a special expedition to those islands in 1865, with the object
of studying their fauna. The results are embodied in his volume on the Azores,
published by Van Voorst in 1 870 (21). Morelet's work (22), previously published,
18 mainly devoted to the Land-shells ; Mr. Godman is almost our only authority

upon the Mammals, Birds, and other Vertebrates.

                               2, The European Subbegion.

   To discuss, or even to give the titles of all the works that have been published
on the Vertebrates of Europe would extend this address to far beyond its proper
limits. I must content myself with a few words on the principal works which
have appeared of late years, first, upon the zoology of Europe generally, and,
secondly, upon the faunas of its chief political divisions.

                                                                                           A. Mammals of Europe.

To begin with the Mammals, our standard authority upon the European mem-

bers of this class is Blasius's ' Naturgeschichte der Saugethiere Deutschlands und

der angrenzenden Lander ' (23); and an excellent work it is. Unfortunately, how-

ever, it does not extend into Southern Europe, where alone many of the more in-

Ateresting forms of European Mammal-life make their appearance.                                                   work founded

on Blasius's volume and embracing the additional species of Mammals to be met

with in Spain, Italj^ and Turkey is very desirable ; and it is with great pleasure that

I have been informed that an energetic Member of this Association has already set

some such undertaking before him. The only work of reference of this extent that

I am at present acquainted with is Lord Clermont's useful ' Guide to the Quadru-

peds and Reptiles of Europe,' published in 1859 (24).

   As regards the constituent countries of the European Subregion, there are but few

recomniendable works devoted to the illustration of their Mammal-faunas. In

England we have Bell's 'British Quadrupeds,' belonging to Mr. Van Voorst's excel-

lent seiies (25). This remained long out of print, until its recent reissue in 1874

by the author (26) with the assistance of Mr. R. F. Tomes and Mr. Alston. For

France, M. Gervais's ' Zoologie et Paleontologie Fran^aise ' (27), enumerates both
recent and fossil Mammals, though most regard is paid to the extinct Fauna. As

regards Spanish Mammals, almost the only authority I am acquainted with isRosen-

hauer's ' Thiere Andalusiens ' (28), which, however, is very defective, the author

having devoted himself principally to the study of the Invertebrates. Capt. Cook

(afterwards Widdrington) was the original discoverer of several of the rarer

Mammals of Spain                                                                           but the account of them in his ' Sketches ' (29) is very meagre.
                                                                                        ;

A bare list of the Mammals of Portugal is given by Prof. Barboza du Bocage

in the ' Revue Zoologique ' for 1863 (30). Passing over to Italy, Bonaparte's

' Fauna Italica ' (31) and Costa's ' Fauna del Regno di Napoli ' (32) must be men-

tioned, though both are somewhat out of date. But the former work is still the

Aonly authority on certain of the rarer Italian species and local forms.                                          recent

summary of Italian Mammals has been given by Prof. Cornalia in ' Italia ' (33)
but on the whole it must be allowed that a good work upon the Mammals of the

Italian peninsula is still a desideratum. Of the Mammals of Switzerland, on the

other hand, we have an excellent recent work by Dr. Fatio, forming the first

volume of his ' Faune des Vert^br(5s de la Suisse ' (34 ), in which special attention

is devoted to the difficult groups of Rodents and Insectivores. No student of

the European Mammal-fauna should omit to consult Dr. Fatio's work.

Passing to Eastern Europe, we find our state of exact knowledge as to the

Mammals very defective. As regards Greece, we may refer to the French ' Ex-

pedition Scientifique en Morde,' in which there is a memoir on the Mammals by

Geoftroy St.-Hilaire (35), and Erhard's 'Fauna der Cykladen ' (36) and Unger
and Kotschy's volume on Cyprus (37), which give some details on the Mammals

of the Greek archipelago. Of Turkey we find little or no information, and there

is certainlj' still much to be done as regards the smaller Mammals of this part

of Europe. In Southern Russia we have Menetrids's Catalogue of the Animals

of the Caucasus (38), and P. D(5midoff"s ' Voyage dans la Russie Mdridionale

(39), and perhaps other works in the language of the comitry, which I am not

acquainted with. But there can be no doubt that it is" in South-eastern Europe

that our knowledge of the Mammal-fauna of this continent is very defective,

and that most remains to be done in order to complete our acquaintance with

this branch of Em-opean zoology.

In Northern Europe, which we now turn to, the case is quite different. The

highly cultivated and laborious naturalists of Scandinavia have for many years
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          --

                                                                                                           TRANSACTIONS OF'THE SECTIONS.                                                                                  89

paid gi-eat attention to this as to every other part of their fauna. The first volume

of Nilsson's 'Scandinavian Fauna' (40), published at Lund in 1S47, has long been

a standard book of reference on this branch of zoology. Much, however, has been

done since that period                                                                                     and in Prof. Lilljeborg's lately issued work  on                                                          the  Mam-
                                                                                                        ;

mals of Sweden and Norway (41), we have an exhaustive account of the present

state of our knowledge of this subject.

As regards the few Mammals of Spitzbergen, reference should be made to the

second volume of Heuglin's ' Reisen nach dem Nordpolarmeer ' (42), where that

energetic naturalist has put together an accoimt of the nineteen species of Mam-

mals that penetrate so far north.

                                                                                                           B. Birds of Europe,

--a. Ewope generally. There can be no question, I suppose, that the attractive

class of Birds has received much more attention than its sister-classes of verte-

brates in Europe, as generally elsewhere. Of late years especially a considerable

number of naturalists in almost every part of this continent have bestowed their

--principal attention on Ornithology. Two journals are devoted solely to this

science in which the larger nimrber of articles treat of the birds of some portion

or other of Europe.  The                                                                                   mass of literature  on the  subject is large                                                           and I must

should be referred to by an inquirer on European Ornithology.

   First, as to the Avifauna of the whole continent, Temminck's ' Manuel ' (4.''>)

--long the acknowledged authority upon this subject was superseded in 1849 by

the issue of Degland's ' Ornithologie Europ^enne ' (44). The new edition of

this work, revised by Gerbe and issued in 18G7 (45), is perhaps now the
most complete book of its kind. But it has great faults and imperfections,

particularly as regards its indications of the distribution of the species. This
branch of the subject has never been properly worked out until the recent issue of
Mr. Dresser's (formerly Sharpe and Dresser's) 'Birds of Europe ' (40), which contains,
so far as it has hitherto progressed, by far the most exhaustive account of the

European Avifauna yet attempted. Its large size and numerous illustrations, how-
ever, render it rather cumbersome as a manual; but a handbook based on it when
completed, and containing a judicious abridgement of its iuformatiou, (which I

hope Mr. Dresser will not fail to prepare,) would, I am sure, form a most valuable

work.

   Fritsch's ' Naturgeschichte der Vogel Europa's ' (47), lately published at Prague,

is a cheap and useful manual for those who understand German ; while Gould's

' Birds of Europe ' (48), though out of date, will be always referred to for its

illustrations.

 --b. Birds of Great Britain. For many years the standard book of reference on the

Ornithology of these islands has been YarrelFs ' British Birds,' and its several

Supplements (49). The new edition of this work, commenced in June 1871 by
Prof. Newton (50), is familiar, no doubt, to most of the Members of Section D.
As to its merits there can be no question ; I think it is seldom indeed that a task

is intrusted to one so thoroughly competent to perform it, or so careful in tlie
execution of what he undert.akes. But the slow progress of the work is appalling :

after four years only one of the promised four volumes has been completed. As

amongst the best of numerous local works on the Birds of this country recently

issued should also be mentioned Gray's 'Birds of the West of Scotland ' (51), and
AHancock's memoir on those of Northumberland and Durham (52).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  very useful

work of reference for Ornitliologists is also Mr. Ilarting's ' Hand-book of British

Birds' (5-3), in which the exact dates and places of occurrence of all the rarer

visitants are recorded. Those who love life-sized illustrations, and have full

purses, will not fail to acquire (provided a copy is left) Mr. Gould's splendid work

on the Birds of Great Britain (54), now complete in five volumes. After this

enumeration it will be almost needless to remark that Ornithology has no reason

--to complain of want of support in this country.
   c. Birds of France. In France less attention has been devoted to the native

birds of late vears ; and besides the new edition of Degland's ' Ornithologie
                                                    '

Europeenne ' already spoken of, I have only to mention Bailly's ' Ornithologie cle la

Savoie ' (55), and Jaubert and Barth^lemy-Lapomnieraye's ' Richesses Ornitholo-

giques du Midi de la France ' (66), in each of which will be found mnch informa-

--tion aboiit the rarer birds of the districts respectively treated of.
   d. Birds of Spain and Portugcd. Much attention has been paid to the Avifaima

of Southern Spain of late years, but rather by visitors from the north than by native

naturalists. Lord Lilford and Mr. Howard Saunders hare both given us some

excellent articles in * The HdIs ' on this subject (57, 58), and have made a variety of

interesting discoveries, amongst which are actually several new species *, or at all

events well-marked local forms. Dr. R. Brehm, long resident at Madrid, has

also devoted much attention to Spanish Ornithology, and written a complete list of

Spanish Birds (59), which should be consulted. To Colonel Irby's work on the

Straits of Gibraltar (10) I have already alluded ; as regards the southern extremity

of the peninsula he is our best and most recent authority. For information on the

birds of Portugal we must again go to an English source, Mr. Alfred Charles

Smith's Narrative of his Spring Tour (60) containing the best information which

I am acquainted with on this subject.

 --e. Birds of Italy. Savi's ' Ornitologia Toscana ' (61), published as long ago as

1827, was for long almost our outy authority on Italian Ornithology. Bonaparte's

' Iconogi-afia,' already alluded to (31), gave some additional information as to

rarer species. Salvadori's memoir on the Birds, forming the second volume of the

recently published ' Fauna d'ltalia ' (02), is the best and most recent authority on

Athis subject, and contains an excellent " Bibliografia Omitologica Italiana."

large illustrated work on the birds of Lombardy has been recently published at

Milan by Bettoni (6.3). I must also call attention to the persevering way in

which Mr. C. A. Wright has worked up the Avifauna of Malta (64), and to Mr.

--A. B. Brooke's recently published notes on the Ornithology of Sardinia (65).
   f. Birds of Tia-key and Greece. Dr. Kriiper, a well-known German naturalist,

has been long resident in various parts of the Levant, and has contributed nume-

rous articles upon the birds met with to various periodicals. These have been

recently put together and edited by Dr. Hartlaub, and published as a number of

Mommsen's ' Griechische Jahreszeiten ' (06), which thus contains a summaiy of all

our principal information on the birds of Greece and its islands. Before that our

best authority on Grecian birds was Lindermayer's ' Vogel Griechenlands ' (67)
As regards European Turkey, Messrs. Elwes and Buckley have lately published a

good paper in ' The Ibis ' on its birds (68); and MM. Alleon and Vian have written

several articles in the ' Revue Zoologique ' (69, 70) on the ornithology of the

neighbourhood of Constantinople. But there is certainly still much to be done as

regards birds in this part of the continent, as likewise amongst the islands of the

Greek archipelago, mauj^ of which are almost unexplored by the naturalist.

 --g. Birds of Southern Russia and the Caucasus. Though many notices of the

birds of Southern Russia have appeared in the * Bulletin ' of the Society of Natu-

ralists of Moscow, I am not aware of any complete account of them having been

issued. D6midoff, in the third volume of his ' Voyage dans la Russie meridionale'

(.39), gives a list of the birds of what he calls the " Faune Pontique ;" but his

original observations are somewhat meagre. Eichwald's 'Fauna Caspio-Caucasica'

(71) and M^mStri^s's Catalogue of the Zoology of the Caucasus (38) should also be

consulted, although both are rather out of date. An excellent zoologist, Hr.

Gustav Radde, is now resident at Tiflis                                                                                                                                                                                          but I do not think he has yet prepared
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

any general account of the birds of the Caucasus, where there must "be certainly

much of interest, as is proved by the discovery of the remarkable Grouse, allied to

--our Black Grouse, which has just been described by M. Taczanowskif.
   h. Birds of Gei-muny and Central Europe. Local lists of the birds of the various

states of Central Europe, and their principal divisions, are very numerous ; and
there are also many manuals and memoirs on the same subject. But .1. A. Nau-

mann's excellent ' Vcigel Deutschlands ' (73), commenced in 1822, with its sup-

plements, is still, I believe, quite unsuperseded as a standard book of reference on

Central-European Ornithology. It was generally understood that Prof. Blasius, at

the time of his lamented death, had a work on the birds of his native country in

preparation                                              but unfortunately this was never hnished                                                                                                                                                                                          or it would have proved to
                                                      ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

be, no doubt, of first-rate excellence. In no other country, liowever, ex£ept oiu- own,

is Ornithology so much cultivated as in Germany. Two societies emulate each other

in their pursuit of this science                                                                                                                                        and two special journals (74, 75) are devoted to its
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

progress. There is no lack, therefore, of recent information upon the birds of every

part of Germany, although this has to be fished out of journals and periodicals o'f

different sorts, instead of being put together (as we should rather wish to see it) in

some general work.

 --i. Birds of Scandinaina and Northern Europe. In Scandinavia also there is no dearth

of diligent observers of birds, as of every other class of animals. The Bird volume

of Nilsson's Scandinavian Fauna (40) was published in 1858, and is still worthy

of careful study. But the more recent works of Collett upon the Birds of Norway

in German (76) and in English (77) should be consulted, as also Sundevall'a

' Svenska Foglarna ' (78), unfortunately not quite finished at the time of his de-

cease, and von AVright and Palmen's 'Finlands Foglar' (79). Several memoirs

have also recently appeared upon the birds of the extreme north, which have

--always attracted great interest among ornithologists. Amongst these, special at-

tention may be called to : v. Ileuglin's account of the birds of Nova Zenibla, first

published in Cabanis's Journal for 1872 (80), and afterwards enlarged and revised

in the second volume of his 'Reiseunach dem Nordpolarmeer ;' to Prof. Newton's

essay on the birds of Iceland, in Mr. Baring-Gould's * Iceland, its Scenes and

--Sagas ' (81) ; and, lastly, to Messrs. Alston and Brown's narrative of their adven-

tures among the birds of Archangel (82) a little-explored district, and one of

much promise, to which one of these active explorers has returned this year.

                                            C. European Herpetology.

   In this field of research there is not so much of recent work to record as among
the birds ; but Dr. E. Schreiber's ' Herpetologia Europcea,' which has just ap-
peared (83), marks an important epoch in this branch of science, since there was
previously no good work of reference upon the Reptiles and Batrachians of Europe.
l)r. Schreiber's work is drawn up upon the same plan as Blasius's well-known
' Sfiugethiere Europa's,' and forms a most convenient handbook. The list of pub-

lished works and memoirs on the same subject prefaced to it renders it imnecessary

Dr. Schreiber is not acquainted with it, I must also call special attention to Dr.

Strauch's excellent memoir on the Serpents of the Russian Empire (84), recently
published in the Memoirs of the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg, which is as

important for the European as for the Asiatic part of the Russian dominions. As

regards our native Herpetological fauna also, I may point out that the last edition

of Bell's    British                                     Reptiles'  (85),                                                                                               published  in  18.30, reqiures considerable revision

           ^

to bring it up to our present standard of knowledge, and that it is much to bo

desired that a new edition should be undertaken. Let me ventm-e to suggest that

Mr. Van Voorst should communicate with Dr. Giinther tipon this subject. In the

meanwhile ' Om- Reptiles,' by M. C. Cooke (8G), may be used as a correct as well

as popular guide to this branch of our fauna.

                                            D. European Ichthyology.

  I am not aware of the existence of any special work on European Ichthyology
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but C. Th. v. Siebold published in 1863 a volume on the Freshwater Fishes of
Central Europe (87), which forms a usefid guide to the Piscifiiuna of the principal
European river-basins. For the fishes of the Atlantic which visit the British

coasts we have the third edition of Yarrell's ' British Fishes,' edited by the lato

Sir John Richardson (88), which was published in 1859. Now that Dr.'Giinther's

great general work on Fishes has been completed, this portion of Mr. Van V'oorst's
excellent series would be also much benefited by revision and rearrangement

                                                                                                      8*

according to Dr. Giinther's modern system and nomenclature. As a cheaper
and more popular work we may also refer to Couch's 'British Fishes,' in four
volumes (89), of which the Last was issued iu 18G-5. In this book the figures are

coloured.

   Prof. Blanchard issued in 1866 a volume of the Freshwater-FLshes of France
(90), which, however, does not hear so high a character a's Siebold's work above

referred to. For our knowledge of the fishes of Spain and Portugal we are chiefly
indebted to Steindachner's memoirs in the Sitzungsberichte of the ^^ienna Academy

(91), and to F. de Brito Capello's papers in the Journal of Sciences of Lisbon (92).
Of those of Italy, Prof. Canestrini has lately published a revised list with short
specific characters, as a section of the work called ' Italia ' already referred to (9-3).
Those interested in the fishes of the Black Sea and adjoining river-basins should
consult the ichthyological portion of Demidoft's ' Voyage danslaRussie m<5ridionale,'

entitled " Pisces Fauna3 Ponticse." I am not acquainted with any other important

recent memoirs on the Ichthyological faunas of the different European states

which it is necessary to refer to until we come to Scandinavia, where Malmgren
published in 1863 an excellent essay upon the Fishes of Finland, which was sub-
sequently translated into German (94) *. As regards the Fishes of Spitzbergen and
Nova Zembla, Heuglin's Synopsis of them in the second volume of his already
quoted ' Reisen nach dem Nordpolarmeer ' is the most recent authority, though it
Is principally founded upon the labom-s of Loven and Thorell, and of the naturalists

of the Swedish expeditions of 1861 and 1864.

                                 3. The Siberian Subregion.

   When I call to mind the numerous scientific expeditions sent by the Russians

into different parts of their recent acquisitions in Northern Asia, and turn over the
pages of the excellent and instructive works in which the results of these expedi-

tions have been given to the world, I must own to a feeling of indignation at the
manner in which such matters are usually dealt with by the Government of this

coimtry. In the first place, in order to get such an expedition sent out at all,

great exertions and special influence are necessarj'. The Ireasury must be memo-

rialized, the Chancellor of the Exchequer besought, and the Admiitilty petitioned,
before any grant of money can be sanctioned for the purpose; and even then it is

too often bestowed in a niggardly and grudging way. When the expedition returns,

similar applications have to be made in order to get the results worked out and
properly published ; and these are in some cases altogether rejected, so that the
money already spent upon collecting becomes virtually thrown awaJ^ In Russia,
although the nation may be less awake to the claims of science than in this country,
the Government is certainly more so ; and it is to the scientific men attached to
the Government expeditions that we are indebted for nearly all the knowledge we
possess of the fauna of Northern Asia. Of the more important reports of the
more recent of these expeditions I will say a few words.

    Middendorft-s ' Sibirische Reise ' (95), published in 1847-67, gives an account of
the fauna of the extreme north and east of Siberia. The second volume of the zoolo-
 gical section is entu'ely devoted to the ]\Ianimals, Birds, aud Reptiles, and gives

full details concerning the structure and habits of the species met with. Of Von
 Schrenck's ' Amur-Reisen ' (96), a volume published in 18.59 contains a complete
memoir on the Mammals and Birds of tlie newly acquired district traversed by the
 Amoor, lying to the south of that investigated by Hr. v. Middendorft'. Lastly, two
volumes of Radde's ' Reisen in dem Siiden v. Ost-Sibirien ' (97), published in 1862
and 1863, render more perfect our knowledge of the Mammals and Birds of South-
 eastern Siberia. Hr. Radde's chief observations were made in Transbaikalia ; but

 he incorporates the knowledge accumulated by his predecessors in the surrovmding
 distiicts, and goes deeply into general results.

     Dr. A. V. Middendor£f''s ' Isepiptesen Russlands ' (98) should also be consulted

 by those who wish to understand the migration of birds in Siberia, or indeed

                             4. The Mantchubian Subeegion.

   Of this district, which embraces the country lying south of the Amoor and the
"·reater part of Northern China, down perhaps to the great river Yang-tsze, we have,

besides the Russian works lastly spoken otj two principal sources of information.
The first of these consists in the researches of Mr. Kobert Svdnhoe, of H.M. Chinese
Consular Service, one of the most industrious and successful exploring naturalists

that have ever lived, who is well known to many of my brother Members here pre-

sent. Mr. Swinhoe's memoirs and papers on Chinese zoolog)' are very numerous
but his last revised list of the Birds of China (99) Avill be found in the Zoological

Society's ' Proceedings ' for 1871. Pere Armand David, a worthy rival of our

Consul, has likewise contributed in no small degree to our knowledge of the fauna
of Northern China. His journals, containing numerous remarks full of interest, have

lately been published in the ' Nouvelles Archives du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle
de Paris' (100) ; and M. Alphouse Milne-Edwards's recently completed 'Recherches
sur les Manimiferes ' (101) contains a section specially devoted to the Mammals of
Northern China, which is mainly based on Pere David's researches. I shall, how-
ever, have again occasion to mention the discoveries of both Mr. Swinhoe and M.

David in a subsequent portion of this address.

                      5, The Japanese Subregion.

Temminck and Schlegel's ' Faima Japonica ' (102) has long been our standard

authority upon thezoology of Japan ; and not much has been done of late years to
perfect it, except as regards the Birds. On this branch of our subject some very

good articles have been published in 'The Ibis ' by Capt. Blakiston (103, 104), based

upon his researches in Hakodadi ; by Mr. Whitely (105), who was for some time

resident along with Capt. Blakiston at the same port ; and by Mr. Swinhoe (106).

Reference should also be made to the second volume of Commodore Perry's * Nar-

rative  of  the U.S.  Expedition  to  Japan  in  1852-54                                           (107), wherein  will be found
                                                                                                '

articles on the Birds collected, by Cassin, and on the Fishes, by Brevoort.

                               6. The Tartabian SubbegiojS'.

   Into the great desert-region of Central Asia, hitherto almost zoologically unknown,
exceptfrom Eversmann's ' Reise nach Buchara ' (108), which contains a short natural-
history appendix, excursions have recently been made from two opposite quarters.
The advancing tide of Russian conquest from the north, accompanied, as usual, by
its scientific corps, has ah-eady made us well acquainted with the zoology of

Turkestan. IMi-. SevertzofF has vmfortunately yielded to the unphilosophical spirit
of nationality whicli has of late years attained such a monstrous development, and
published his ' Turkestanskie Jevotnie,' or review of the distribution of animal life

m Turkestan (109), in his native Russian. But a translation and reproduction of

the portion relating to the Birds has ah-eady appeared in German (110) ; and an
abstract of it in English is now being given to the world by Mr. Dresser in ' The

Ibis' (111).

   From the south the peacefid embassies of this country to Yarkand have led
naturalists into the fringe of the same zoological district. Of the first of these
expeditions we have an excellent account as regards the birds by Mr. A. O.
Hume, forming the second part of Henderson's ' Lahore to Yarkand (112). Sir
D. Forsyth's second expedition to Yarkand and Kashgar was accompanied by
Dr. Ferdinand Stoliczka, one of the most accomplished and energetic members of
the stafl' of the Indian Geological Sm-vey, whose life was miserably sacrificed
to the hardships encountered on the return. Of this last expedition we have as

yet only incomplete accounts *, but may, I trust, look forward to the publica-
tion of an equally interesting volume on the zoological results. The Ichthyological

part of the collections has, I believe, been intrusted to Dr. F. Day to work out

in this country.

9J, KBPOBX-- 1875.

                                 7. The Persian Subbegion.

   Of the Persian or " Mediterraneo-Persic " Siibregion, as Mr. Elwes prefers to call
it*, which maybe held to embrace European Turkey, Palestine, and Persia, our
knovs'ledge was until recently very limited, and even up to the present day remains
very imperfect, considering the proximity of the district to Europe, and the many
interesting features which it presents. As regards Palestine, Canon Tristram's
energetic researches have done much to remove what has long been a scandal to
biblical scholars as well as to naturalists. His long-promised ' Synopsis of the
Flora and Fauna of Palestine,' however, is not yet issued by the Ray Society, and
we must conseqiiently be content with Mr. Tristram's papers on the Birds of the
Holy Land in ' The Ibis ' (115) and in the ' Proceedings ' of the Zoological Society
(116) and Dr. Giinther's article upon the Reptiles and Fishes collected by Mr.
Tristram (117), until the finished work appears. Of Asia Minor and Armenia it
maybe said that we are miserably ignorant, Tchihatcheff's desultory accoimt of its
Natural History in his ' Asie Mineure' (118) being almost the only authority we

--have to refer to. Thirty years ago the Zoological Society had two excellent cor-

respondents at Erzeroom Messrs. Dickson and Ross ; and it is a great misfortune
that no continuous account was ever prepared of the line collections which they
 sent home t.

   As regards Persia we may hope very shortly to be much more favourably situ-
ated. Mr. W. T. Blanford and Major St. John have recentlj' made large zoological

 collections in various parts of that coimtry, particularly of birds ; and it is generally

 imderstood that the report of the Persian Boundary Expedition will contain a

 complete account of the zoology of Persia from Mr. Blanford's accomplished pen.

Hitherto we have had to rely on De Filippi'a ' Viaggio in Persia' (119) and other

 fragmentary sources of information.

                      II. THE ETHIOPIAN REGION.

   This Region I shall speak of, for convenience' sake, under the following si.\ sub-

divisions :

1. Western Africa, from the Senegal to the Congo.
2. South-western Africa, or Angola and Benguela.
3. Sotdh Africa, i. e. the Cape colouj' and adjoining districts.
4. South-eastern Africa, from the Portuguese possessions up to the Somali coast.
5. North-eastern Africa, including Abyssinia, Nubia^ and Egypt.

6. Arabia.

                                  1. WESTEnN Afhica.

The Mammals of Western Africa are certainly not so well known as they should

be ; and there is no one work which gives an accoimt of them, except Temminck's

' Esquisses Zoologiques sur la cote de Guinee ' (1), which is devoted to the collec-

tions transmitted to Leyden by Pel, a most energetic and successful Dutch explorer.

On the Mammals of Gaboon, Pucherau's article in the French 'Archives duMuseum

(2), and Du Ohaillu's travels (3) and the literature connected therewith, should be

consulted (4, 5, G).  ·

The Birds of Western Afiica, on the contrary, have attracted much attention

from^ European naturalists since the time when Swainson published his ' Birds of

Western Africa ' (7). This work, however, has been quite superseded by Hartlaub'a

classical ' System der Ornithologie Westafrica's ' (8), published in 1857. Since

that period many memoirs and papers have appeared on the birds of various parts

of this district, principally by Cassin, of Philadelphia, Dr. Finsch, of Bremen, and

Mr. R. B. Sharpe, of the British Museum, who has paid special attention to the

African Ornis, and is understood to be preparing a general work on it.

For information on the Reptiles and Fishes of West Africa we must refer to

Ang. DumMl's memoir (9) in the tenth volume of the 'Archives du Museum

d'iiistoire Naturelle,' fomided on the collections in the Paris Museum.

                                       2. SotJTH-WESTEEN AFRICA.

   Tlie Portuguese colonies of Angola and Benguela, which seem to belong to a
zoological subregion distinct from both that of West Africa and that of the Cape,
were until i^cently almost unexplored. Within these last few ypai-s, however,
Prof. Barboza du Bocage has acquired extensive series of specimens in nearly every
department of natural history from these countries for the Lisbon Museum, and
has published several important memoirs on the subject (10), which he vrill pro-
bably ultimately incorporate into a general work. Mr. J. J. Monteiro has also sent
to this country collections of Mammals and Birds, which have formed the subject

of several papers (11, 12).

                                       3. Southern Aebica.

   Sir Andrew Smith's ' Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa ' (13) consti-
tute four solid quarto volumes, devoted to the new and rare vertebrates met with
during that energetic traveller's many explorations of the Cape colony and the

adjoining districts, and supplementing LevaUlant's celebrated 'Oiseaux d'Afrique'

(14). But there is no perfect list of the Cape fauna given in Sir Andrew
Smith's work ; and therefore Mr. Layard's ' Bh-ds of South Africa ' (15), though
not very completely elaborated, was a most acceptable and convenient work
to the ornithologist. Still more agreeable will it be to witness the completion
of the new and enlarged edition of Mr. Layard's little volume, which Mr. Sharpe

has undertaken (IG), and of which he has just issued the first part. Mr. Sharpe

will, however, I trust, pardon me for remarking that he has cut the synonymy

of the species rather short in his pages; it is hard to expect every South-
African colonist to have at his side the British-Museum Catalogue of Birds, to
which he always refers us. The omission of generic and family characters is also

much to be regretted in a work of this kind. Another modern and much-to-be-
recommended bird-book belonging to this subregion is Mr. J. H. Gurney's ' Birds of

Damara-land ' (17), founded on the extensive collections of the late C. J. Andersson.

No less than 428 species of birds were obtained by that indefatigable collector ; and

the task of editing his field-notes has been well performed by Mr. Gurney.

                           4. Soutii-eastebn Africa.

Our knowledge of the fauna of Mozambique is chiefly due to the scientific visit

made to that country by Dr. W. Peters, of Beriin, in 1842 and the following years.

The volume of this distinguished naturalist's ' Naturwissenschaftliche Eeise nach
Mossambique ' (18) on the Mammals was published in 1852, that on the Fishes in
1864, The delay in the issue of the portions relating to the Eeptiles and Bu-ds is

much to be regretted, more especially when we consider the high standard of the

work, although diagnoses of the new species discovered in these groups (19, 20)
have been long since published ; and I am sure I am expressing the sentiments of

naturalists in general when I say that 1 hope to see the series shortly completed.
Proceeding further north along the African coast, we come to Zanzibar, where an
excellent ichthyologist. Consul Playfair, was lately resident. The ' Fishes of Zan-
zibar,' by Giiuther and Playfair (21), founded on the extensive collections made
bj the latter, was published in 1866, and gives an account of above 500 species, and

many excellent figm-es.    whole  East- African  coast,  from  Cape  ^ , ».    ^   nMn-ozam-

bique, has been elaborately worked out by Drs. Fiusch and Hartlaub. The results

ai-e contained in these authors' 'Vogel Ost-Afrika's ' (22), foi-ming the fourth

volume of the unfortunate Baron Cari Clans von der Decken's ' Reisen in Ost-

Afrika.' Full details as to previous authorities on the subject are given in this

excellent work ; so that it is not necessary to allude to them.

As regards the Mammals of this part of Africa, however, it is expedient to say a

few words. Our knowledge of this class of animals is, as regards the coast opposite
Zanzibar and the country surrounding the great lakes of the interior, mainly com-

prised in. the fragmentary collections of Speke and Grant, of which an accoimt has

been published in the Zoological Society's ' Proceedings ' (23), and in the few speci-

 mens transmitted by Dr. Kirk from Zanzibar*. There is no doubt, however, that
 much remains to be done here ; and I believe there is at the present moment no finer
 field for zoological discoverv available than this district, where we know that animal
 life in every variety is still abundant, and excellent sport can be obtained to add a
 zest to scientific investigation. The Fishes of the great lakes of Tanganyika and
 the Victoria and Albert Nyanza are likewise utterly unknown ; and their investiga-
tion would be a subject of the greatest interest. Of those of the more southern
 Nyassa Lake, a few specimens were obtained by Dr. Kirk (24).

                                     5. NORTH-EASTEEN AtEICA.

    For many years Ruppell's 'Atlas' (25) and 'Neue Wirbelthiere ' (26), and, as

 regards birds, his ' Systematische Uebersicht ' (27), remained our standard works
 of reference upon the zoology of North-eastern Africa. The recent completion of
 Th. von Heuglin's ' Ornithologie Nordost-Afrika's ' (28) has superseded Ruppell's
volumes for general use ; and no more valuable piece of work for ornithologists has
been accomplished of late years than the reduction of the multitudinous observa-
tions and records of this well-known traveller and naturalist into a uniform series.

Von Heuglin's work, however, concerns mainly Upper Nubia, Abyssinia, and the

wide territory drained by the confluents of the Upper Nile. For Egypt and the
Lower Nile a more handy volume is Capt. Shelley's 'Birds of Egypt' (29), pub-
lished in 1872, which will be found specially acceptable to the tourist on the Nile.
Nor must I forget to mention Mr. Blanford's interesting volume on the Geology
and Zoology of Abyssinia (30), which contains an account of the specimens of ver-
tebrates collected and observed during his companionship with the Abyssinian
Expedition. Mr. Jesse's birds, collected on the same occasion, were examined by
Dr. Finsch, and the result given to the world in a memoir published in the Zoolo-

gical Society's ' Transactions ' (31).

  A good revision of the Mammal-fauna of North-east Africa is much to be

desired. Meanwhile Fitzinger's list of v. Heuglin's collections (32), and the latter

author's own account of them in his Travels on the White Nile (33), may be

consulted.

   The Appendix to Mr. Petherick's Travels in Central Africa contains a complete
memou- on the Fishes of the Nile-basin, by Dr. Giinther (34); while those of the Red

Sea have lately formed the subject of study by Dr. Klunzinger, who has published

an essay upon them at Vienna (35).

                                                     6. Arabia.

   Of Arabia, as might have been expected, we know but little, zoologically or
otherwise. But little, it may be said, can be expected to be found there, looking
to the general aspect of the country. Still it would be of interest to know what
that little is. At present the only district that has beeu visited by natui-alists is
the peninsula of Sinai ; and of this oiir knowledge is by no means complete. Hemp-
rich and Ehi-enberg's unfinished ' Symbolae Physicse ' (36) was for many years our
sole authority. More recently Mr. Wyatt has published an article in ' The Ibis '
upon the birds of the Sinaitic peninsula (37). Let me suggest to some of the
olficers who are stationed idle at Aden that an account of the animals to be met
with in that part of Arabia would be of gi-eat value, and would give them much

useful and interesting occupation. I have been more than once told that there is

nothing whatever to be found there ; but this I am slow to believe. Any one with
a good pair of eyes and a taste for collecting might certainly do much good to

science by passing a few months at Aden, and making exciu-sions into that part of

" Arabia Felix." In Heipetology, especially, new discoveries may be expected.

II a. THE LEMURIAN SUBREGION.

  --This aberrant portion of the Ethiopian Fauna I will speak of under two heads,

namely ;

1. Madayascm:  2. Mascarene Islands.

    To our knowledge of the extraordinary fauna of " Lemuria," as I have elsewhere
proposed to call Madagascar and its islands * great additions have been recently

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,

made hut it is manifest that ^ladagascar is by no means 3et worked outf. Dr.
                                   ;

Ilartlaub's ' Ornithologischer Beitrag zur Fauna Madagascar's ' (38) was the first
attempt at a resume of tlie remarkable Avifauna of this part of the world. Since its
issue two Dutch naturalists, Pollen and Van Dam, have visited Madagascar, and
forwarded rich collections to the Leyden Museum. Of these the Mammals and
Birds have been worked out by I'rofessor Schlegel and Mr. Pollen, and the results
published in a well-illustrated volume entitled ' Recherches sur la Faune de Mada-
gascar.' This has been since followed by an accompanying account of the Fishes,
and treatise on the Fisheries, hy Messrs. Bleeker and Pollen (39). Following upon
the footsteps of these naturalists, a French explorer, Alfred Grandidier, has since
visited the interior of Madagascar, and in his turn has reaped a gTand harvest, of
which some of the results have already been given to the public (40). But we are
promised to have these set before us in a much more extended and complete form,
in a work now in progress, in which M. Grandidier has obtained the efficient assist-
ance of M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards. There still remain to be spoken of the dis-
coveries recently made by an English collector in Madagascar, Mr. A. Crossley.
Mr. Crossley's birds have been worked out by Mr. Sharpe in several papers pub-
lished from time to time hy the Zoological Society (41) ; while Dr. Gunther has
described several new and remarkable Mammals from the same source (42).

                                 2. The 3Iascabejie Islands.

   The Fauna of Bourhon, Mauritius, and Rodriguez forms an appendage to that
of Madagascar, and merits careful study. Our knowledge of these islands, since
the recent investigation of Rodriguez by the naturalists of the Transit-of-Venus

Expedition, is tolerably complete, hut requires to he put together, as it consists
of fragments dispersed over various journals and periodicals. I trust that Mr.

Edward Newton, who has had so many opportunities of acquiring information on

this subject during his Colonial Secretaryship at Mauritius, and has so well used

these opportunities, may shortly have leisiire to devote to this task. His labours
to recover the skeleton of Pezopkaps, in which, I am pleased to think, he was aided
by a grant from this Association, are well known, as is likewise the excellent me-
moir, by himself and Prof. Newton (43), in which the result of his labom*s was
"·iven to the world. Nor must I omit to mention Prof. Owen's dissertations on

the fellow extinct bird of Mauritius, recently published by the Zoological Society

(44, 45).

   As regards the Recent Ornithology of these islands, we have nothing later to refer

to than Hartlaub's little work on Madagascar, noticed above (38), which includes
what was then known of the Avifauna of the Mascarenes.

   The neighbouring group of the Seychelles was visited by Mr. Edward Newton in

A1867, and several new and most interesting species of hirds ohtained there. com-

!lete account of the ornitJiology of these islands was given by Mr. Newton in ' The
 bis ' for 1867 (46). Since that period Dr. E. P. Wright, formerly an active member
of this Association, has made a scientific excursion to the Seychelles, with the view,
as was generally understood, of j)reparing a complete monograph of the fauna and
flora of these interesting islands. It is much to be regi'etted that this very

desirable purpose has not yet been accomplished.

                          m. THE INDIAN REGION.

   Of the extensive and varied Indian Region I will now proceed to say some-

thing, under the suhjoined heads :

For British India Dr. Jerdon's well-known series of zoological handbooks was in-

tended to supi^ly a long-standing want; and it is a great misfortune that his untinndy

death has interfered with theii- completion. The three volumes on the Birds were

finished in 1864 (1), and the one on the Mammals (2) in 18G7. Of the volume on

the Reptiles and Batrachians a portion, I believe, was actually in type at the time of

his  decease                                                  but of  the Fishes  no  part, so far as I                                                                                                                                                                   know, was so much advanced.
                                         ;

For the Reptiles, therefore, we must for the present refer to Dr. Giinther's ' Reptiles

of British India' (3), published by the Ray Society in 1864; indeed, as regcxrds

India, any future account of these animals must, in any cjise, be founded upon the

basis of that excellent and conscientious work. Mr. Theobald's Catalogue of the

Reptiles in the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (4) should be also con-

sulted. For the Indian Fishes generally there is at present no one authority,

though Dr. Day, author of the ' Fishes of Malabar ' (5) and of numerous other-

papers, is understood to have in preparation a general work on this subject, which

his office of Inspector-General of Indian Fisheries has given him excellent oppor-

tunities of studying. Complete lists of both the freshwater and marine species of

India are given in the appendices to Dr. Day's two ' Reports on the Fisheries of

India and Burmah ' (6 & 7), published in India in 1873.

   But although our wants as regards the Indian Vertebrates will probably be sup-
plied in this way, it would be much more satisfactory if the Indian Government

would select a successor to Dr. Jerdon, and place under his control the necessaiy

means for the preparation of a series of zoological handbooks for India. There is

no reason why Botany should be more favoured than Zoology in this matter ; and I

believe it is only the greater energy of the botanists that in this, as in other cases,

has given them the start. New editions of Dr. Jerdon's ' Mammals ' and ' Birds ' arc

both necessary to bring our knowledge up to date                                                                                                                                                                                                                          and the original editions are long
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

since out of print. There can be no question as to the great impetus to the study

of Natural History in India that has already followed on the pubhcation of these

handbooks                                                     and it will be a great misfortime to science if our Indian rulers fail                                                                                                                                      to
                                                           ;

continue the good work. They have only to select a competent editor for the series,

and to place the necessary funds temporarily at his disposal. The sale of the worlcs

will in the end more than recoup all the necessary expenses.

Amongst more recent contributions to our knowledge of Indian Ornitholog}-, which,

under the influence above refeiTed to, have been especially numerous, I can now only

stop to call attention to a few. Mr. Allan Hume, C.B., has been specially active, and

has published numerous papers .in his queerly-titled periodical ' Stray Feathers

(8), which is exclusively devoted to Indian Ornithology. Amongst them the arti-

cles on the bii'ds of Scinde (9) and those of Upper Pegu (lOj areof special interest.

Mr. Holdswgrth's most useful " Synopsis of the Birds of Ceylon," lately published

in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological Societj^' (11), is also of great value, more

especially as Cejdon was omitted from the scope of Dr. Jerdon's work. Nor must

I onrit to mention Major Godwin-Austen's series of papers (12) on the Ornithology

of the newly-explored districts on the north-eastern frontier, which contain so

much of novelty and instruction.

As regards the Testudinata of India, we may shortly expect a complete account

of them fi'om Dr. John Anderson, who has devoted much time and toil to their

study. His magnificent series of di-awings of these animals, from living specimens,

I have had the pleasure of                                            inspecting                                                  and I trust sincerely that some means may
                                                                                                                               ;

be found of reproducing them for publication. Such a wovk would vastly increase

our knowledge of this very difficult group of animals.

                             2. Centbal and Southebn China.

   In speaking of Norllaorn Cliiua I have introduced the names of tho two great
modern zoological discoverers in China, ]\Ii'. Robert Swinhoe and M. le Pere David.
Mr. Swinhoe's article on the Mammals of China, recently published in tho
Zoological Society's Proceedings (13), gives a complete list of the species known to
him to occur south of the Yangtsze. It includes those of the great island of For-
mosa, which is essentially part of China, although it possesses some endemic
species, and which was a complete terra incognita to naturalists before Mr. Swin-
hoe's happy selection as the first British Vice-Consul in 18G1. Mr. Swinhoe's last

revised Catalogue of the Birds of China, published in 1871, has been already referred

to. He is now at home, unfortunately in ill health, but is by- no means idle on his
bed of sickness, and has in contemplation, and, I may say, in actual preparation, a

complete work on Chinese Ornithology, for which he has secured the cooperation of
one of our most competent natiu'alists.

   The still more remarkable discoveries of Pere David have revealed to us the ex-
istence on the western outskirts of China, or rather on the border-lauds between
China and Tibet, of a fiiuna hitherto quite unknown to us, and apparently a pen-
dant of the Himalayan hill-fauna first investigated by Hodgson. In his recently
completed ' Rocherches sur les Mammiferes,' already referred to, M. Alphonse
Milne-Edwards has given us a complete account of M. David's wonderful dis-
coveries among the Mammals of this district. M. David's Birds were worked out
by the late Jules VoiTeaux, and the novelties described in the ' Nouvelles Archives
(14) ; but no complete account of them has yet been issued. In Herpetology, I
believe, M. David lias also made some remarkable discoveries, amongst which, not

tho least, assm'edly, is that of a second species of gigantic Salamander* in the
mountain-streams of Moupin.

3. Burmah, Siam, and Cochin.

   I speak of these ancient kingdoms, which occupy the main part of the great pe-

ninsula of South-eastern Asia, principally to express my surprise at how little we

yet Icnow of them. There are several good correspondents of the Jardin des Plantes in

the French colony of Saigon, who have, I believe, transmitted a considerable number

of specimens to the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle ; but beyond the descriptions of a

certain number of novelties f we have as yet received no accoimt of them. The

two philosophic Kings of Siam appear not yet to have tm-ned their attention to

biological discovery, although there is certainly much to be done in the interior of

that State, with which the late M. Mouhot, had his life been spared, would probably

have made us better acquainted. As it happens we have only one published me-

moir (15) upon the results which this unfortimate naturalist achieved.

   Lower Burmah now forms part of British India, and will be doubtless well

explored. As regards Burmah proper and the Shan-states, om: Indian legislators

appointed a most efficient naturalist to accompany the Yunan Expedition of 18G8

(16), but, when he returned, refused or neglected to provide him;with the facilities

to work out and publish his results. I rejoice, however, to learn that this error has

been to a certain extent remedied, and that Dr. Anderson has now in preparation

a connected accoimt of his Yunan discoveries, which is to be issued by the Linnean
ASociety in their ' Transactions.'
                                    separate publication of these results, however,

would not have involved much additional expense, and would have been more

worthy of the Government which sent out tho Expedition.

                                    4. Malay Peninsula.

   The Malay peninsula belongs unquestionably to the same Subfauna as Sumatra.
Its zoology "is tolerably well known to us fi'om numerous collections that havfe
reached this country, but a modern revision of all the classes of Vertebrates is much
to be desired. About twenty years ago, Dr. Cantor, of the East-Indian Medical
Service, published catalogues of the Mammals (17), Reptiles (18), and Fishes (19)

 of Malacca in tlie Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. To oLlain a know-
 ledge of its birds we must refer to the papers of Eyton (20), Wallace (21), and

 various other ornithological writers.

                            4 a. Andaman AND NicoBAB Islands.

    The two gToups of islands in the Bay of Bengal have of late years attracted con-
 siderable attention from naturalists. Port Blair, in the Andaxnan Islands, having
 hecome the seat of an Indian penal settlement, has received visits from several
 excellent Indian workers who have made extensive collections, especially in Orni-
thology. The most recent authorities upon the birds of the Andaman Islands are
Lord Walden (22), who has worked out the series forwarded to him by Lieut.
 Wardlaw Eamsay, and Mr. Vincent Ball, who has published in ' Stray Feathers ' a
complete list of all the birds known to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar crouvs

 (23).

                                          6. East-Indian Islands.

   Up to a recent period the standard authority on the fauna of the East-Ind ian Islands

was the great Dutchwork on the zoology of the foreign possessions of the Netherlands
Government (24), based upon the vast collections formed by Macklot, Miiller, and
other naturalists, and transmitted to the Leyden Museum. This has been supple-
mented of late years by several works and memoirs of Dr. Schlegel, the eminent
Director of that establishment and in particular by his ' Musee des Pays-Bas '
(25), which contains an account of that magnificent collection drawn up in a

series of monographic catalogues. Up to this time, however, Dr. Schlegel has

only treated of the class of birds, though at the present moment, I believC; he is
engaged on a revision of Quadi'umana. To the class of Fishes, and especially to the
Fishes of the Islands and Seas in the East Indies, another Dutch naturalist, Dr. P.
P. Bleeker, has for many years devoted great attention. His memoirs and papers
on the Ichthj'ology and Herpetology of the various islands and settlements are far
too numerous to mention. But his ' Atlas Ichthyologique,' his principal work on the
Fishes of the Indian Seas (26), is one of gi-eat importance, and claims a special
notice as embracing the results of the life-work of one of the most energetic and

laborious of living naturalists.

   The travels of our countryman, Mr. Wallace, in the Malay Archipelago are
well known to the general public from his instructive and entertaining narrative
(27), and to zoologists from the large collections which he made in every branch

of natural history. It is a misfortune that no general account of the latter has ever
been prepared. But special articles on the birds of the Sula group to the east of
Celebes (28), on those of Bom-u (29), and on those of the islands of Timor, Flores,

and Lombock (30), will be found in the Zoological Society's ' Proceedings,' besides
other ornithological papers of Mr. Wallace refening more or less to this district.

   Of the Island of Celebes we have acquired more intimate knowledge from the
researches of Dr. A. B. Meyer, and from two excellent memoirs on its Ornithology,
prepared by Lord Walden (31, 32). The adjacent territory of Borneo has likewise

not escaped the attention of recent writers, an accomplished Italian author. Dr.

Salvadori, having made it the subject of a special ornithological essay (33). For
the animals of Java and Sumatra we have, unfortunately, no such recent authoritv,
but must refer primarily in the one case to Ilorsfield's Zoological Eesearches (34),
and in the other to Sir Stamford RafBes's Catalogue (35), supplementing in each case
the deficiency by reference to various more recent) books and memoirs. The fact is,
that before we can attain precise notions as to the real zoological relations of these
great islands, we require a much more complete research into their different faunas,
and special monographic essays upon them. So there is certainly no lack of useful

mwork remaining for the zoologist this quarter.

                                  6. Philippine Archipelago.

   In spite of the visits of Cuming, and more recently of Semper (30) and Jagor,
there has been until very lately great want of a work for reference on the Vertebrates
of the Philippine archipelago. This deficiency has been partly supplied by the
                                                                        --

excellent essay published by Lord Walden in the ' Transactions ' of the Zoological

Society, upon' the Birds of the Philippines (37). Although based upon the collec-
tions of Dr. A. B. Meyer, this memoir contains a r(5sume of all that is yet known

upon the subject. It likewise points out the deficiencies in our present information,

which, I need hardly add, are many and numerous.

That our knowledge of the Mammal-faima of the Philippines is also by no means

myperfect, will be sufficiently manifest when I recall to  hearers the fact that there

is now breeding in the Zoological Society's Gardens a very distinct species of Deer *,

quite unknown to all our Museums, which is undoubtedly endemic in one of the

Philippine Islands. There is much want of more information on this subject, as

also on the Reptiles and Fishes, although Dr. Peters has lately made us acquainted

with many novelties from Jagor's researches in these branches (38-40).

                         IV. THE NEAROTIC REGION.

  This part of my subject will be most conveniently treated of under two heads

                   --1. NoHh America doum to Mexico,

                                           2. Greenland,

leaviJig Mexico to be spoken of as a whole under the Neotropical Region, although

part of it undoubtedly belongs to the Nearctic.

                                      1. North America.

 --a. Mammals. The latest revision of the Mammals of North America is still that

of Prof. Baird, contained in the Reports on the Zoology of the Pacific-Railway

routes, published by the War Department of the U. S. in 1857 (1). I understand,
however, that Dr. Elliott Coues is now engaged on a more perfect work, which will

embrace the results of the large additions since made to our knowledge of this subj ect.
The marine Mammals are not included in Prof. Baird's revision ; and under this

--head I may notice two important works recently issued : Dr. Allen's memoir on

the Eared Seals (2), which specially treats of the North-Pacific species; and Capt.

Scammon's volume on the marine Mammals of the North-western coasts of North

America (3), which contains a mass of information relative to the little-known

Cetaceans of the North Pacific. On the Bats of North America Dr. Allen has pub-

lished a special essay in the 'Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections' for 18G4 (4).

   Prior to the issue of these works Audubon and Bachman's ' Quadrupeds of North

--America ' (5), published at New York in 1852, was the best book of reference.
   b. Birds of North America. The American Ornithologists have been specially

active of late years. Up to about 20 years ago, the recognized authorities upon

the Birds of the United States were Wilson (6), Aiidubon (7), Bonaparte (8),
and Nuttall (9). In 1850 Cassin's ' Illustrations ' (10), chiefly devoted to the species
then recently discovered in Texas, California, and Oregon, appeared. In 1858 the
joint work of Messrs. Baird, Cassin, and Lawrence, on the Birds of North America
(11), forming part of the ' Pacific-Railway Routes,' was issued. This was repub-
lished with additions as a separate work in 1860 (12) in two volumes, and still
forms an excellent book of reference on American Birds. The List of autho-
rities given at the end of the letterpress will be found extremely useful for those

who require a guide to the literature of American Ornithologj'. But even this bids

fair to be superseded by the more recent publications of our energetic fellow natu-
ralists. In the first place, three volumes of a ' History of North-American Birds,'
illustrated by plates and numerous woodcuts, by Messrs. Baird, Brewer, and Ridg-

way (13), were issued last year ; and two more volumes to complete the work will
soon be ready. Then for those who require a handy book for reference nothing can

be more convenient than Dr. Coues's 'Key' (14), in one vohime, published in
 1872. The same energetic naturalist has also lately issued a Handbook of the
Ornithology of the North-west (15), containing an account of the birds met with
in the region drained by the Missouri and its tributaries, amongst which he has had
such long personal experience. Nor must I conclude the list without mentioning

                              * Cervus alfredi, Sclater, P. Z. S. 1«70, p. 381, pi. xxviii.
--103 REPORT 18/5.

Mr. D. G. Elliot'a ' Birds of North America ' (IG), -whicii contains life-sized illus-

trations of many rare and previously xmfigured species, and Cooper's ' Birds of Cali-

fornia ' (17), devoted to an account of the birds of the Pacitic coast-region, which
has been edited by Prof. Baird from the late Mr. Cooper's MSS. Of the last-named
work, however, only the first volume is yet published. It will be thus seen that

we have ample means of acquiring the most recent information on the birds of the

Nearctic Region                                                                               and in fact in no  part of the world, except Europe  itself, is  our
                                                                                           ;

knowledge of the endemic Avifauna so nearly approaching towards completion.

  --c. Meptilcs and Batrachians of North America. Holbrook's ' North American Rep-

tiles,' in five quarto volumes, published at Philadelphia in 1842-4 (18), contains

coloured figures of all the North-American Reptiles and Batrachians known to the

Aauthor, and is a trustworthy work. large amoimt of information has been acquired

since that period, and published in the various " Railroad Reports" and periodicals by

Hallowell, Baird, Cope, and others. In 1853 Messrs. Baird and Girard published a

catalogue of North-American Serpents (19); and Prof. Agassiz devoted the
fir.st volume of his 'Contributions' (20) mainly to the Testudiuata of North

America. Prof. Biird tells me that Prof. Cope is now engaged in printing a
new catalogue of the Reptiles and Batrachians of North America, which will

contain an enumeration of all the species and an account of their geographical

distribution.

  --d. Fishes of North America. On the Fishes of North America there is up to the

present time no one authority, and the inquirer must refer to the various works of

Cope (21), Agassiz (22), and Girard (23) for information. This, aided by the
copious references in Dr. Giinther's well-known Catalogue (24), hewill have little dif-
ficulty in obtaining, so far as it is available. But the "History of American Fishes"

is still to be written ; and I have no doubt that our energetic bretliren of the United

States will before long bring it to pass.

                                                                                              2. Greenland.

Of Greenland, which is undoubtedly part of the Nearctic Region, I have made a

separate section, in order to call special attention to the * Manual ' for the use of

the Ai'ctic Expedition of 1 875, prepared under the direction of the Ai-ctic Committee
Aof the Royal Society (2-)).
                                                                                              resum(5 of all that is yet known of the biology of

Greenland is included in this volume. I may call siaecial attention to the article

on the Birds by Prof. Newton, and on the Fi.shes by Dr. Liitken, both prepared

specially for this work. I am sure you will all join with me in thanking the present

Government for sending out this new Expedition so fully prepared in every way,

and in hoping that large additions may be made to the store of information already

accumulated in the ' Manual.'

                        V. THE NEOTROPICAL REGION.

   The Neotropical Region is, I suppose, on the whole the richest in animal life of
any of the principal divisions of the earth's surface*. Much work has been done in
it as I'egards every branch of zoology of late years ; and I must confine myself to
noticing the most recent and most important of the contributions to this branclr of

knowledge.
   I believe the following to be altogether the most natural subdivisions of this Region,

which are nearly as they are set forth in Hr. v. Pelzeln's ' Ornithology of Brazil.'

   1. The Central-American Suhref/ion, from Southern Mexico to Panama.
   2. The Andean or Columhiati Subrer/ion, from Trinidad and Venezuela, along the

      chain of the Andes, through Columbia, Ecuador, and Pern, down to Bolivia.
   3. The Amazonian Subrcr/ion, embracing the whole watershed of the Orinoco

      and Amazons up to the hills, and including also the highlands of Guiana.

  A* general sketch of the Mammal-life of this Region is given in my article on the
AMammals of South America, in the 'Quarterly Journal of Science' for 18G.5 (1).

systematic list of all the species of birds of the Neotropical Region is given in Sclater

and Salvin's ' Nomenclator Avium Neotropicalium,' London, 1873 (2).

Besides these we have :

G. The Galapagos, which, whether or not they can he assigned to any other Suh-
   region, must be spoken of separately.

                          1. The Central iXjviEEiCAN Sueregion

was, up to twenty years ago, very little k-nown, hut has recently heen explored in

nearly every part, and is perhaps now more nearly worked out than any other of
tho above-mentioned Subregions. There is, however, as yet no complete work on

the zoology of any portion of it ; and the discoveries of Sallt?, Boucard, de Saussure,
aud Sumic'hrast in Mexico, of Salvin in Guatemala, of v. Frantzius and Ilottman in
Costa Rica, of Bridges and Arce in Veragua, and of M'Leaunan in Panama, together

with those of numerous other collectors, are spread abroad among the scientitic
periodicals of Em'ope and America. Even of Mexican zoology, long as it has been
more or less known, we have no general account. To meution all these memoirs
in detail * would be impossible within the limits of this address; but I will say a

few words about the more important of them that have lately appeared.
   The French are now publishiug a worlc on the results of their scientific expedition

to Mexico during the short-lived Empire. Three parts on the- Reptiles, by llumeril
and Bocourt, were issued in 1870 ; and a part on the fishes, by Vaillant and Bocoxu-t,

has recently appeared (35).

  A paper on the Mammals of Costa Rica has lately l^ecn published by v. Frantzius

in Wiegmann's Archiv (36). Unfortunately, 4t seems to have been drawn up mainly
from notes, without reference to the specimens in the Berlin Museum, but neverthe-

less contains much that is useful and of interest.
   Dr. Giinther's admirable memoir of the Fishes of Central America, published in

the Zoological Society's Transactions in 1869 (37), is based upon the collections

made by Capt. Dow in various pai-ts of the coast, and by Messrs. Sah-in and God-

man in the freshwater lakes of the highlands of Guatemala and in other localities.

Its value in relation to om- general knowledge of the fishes of this portion of

America, heretofore so imperfectly Imown, can hardly be overestimated.

   As regards the Birds of Central America, it is much to be regretted that we have
at present no one authority to refer to. The collection of Messrs. Salvin and Godman

embraces very large series from different parts of this region, and together with those

of my collection, wherein are the types of the species described in my own papers,

woidi afford abundant materials for such a task. Mr. Salvin and I have often

formed plans on this subject ; and I trust we may before long see the results of them.

A similai- memoir on the Mammals of Central America is likewise of pressing

necessity for the better rmderstanding of the Neotropical Mammal-fauna. There
are considerable materials available for this purpose in the collections sent by Sahin

and Arce to the British Museum ; aud I hope that some naturalist may shortly be

indiiced to undertake this task.

   * Some of the more important are M. de Saussure's papers on the Mammals of

Mexico in the 'Kevue Zoologique' for 1800 (3), sixteen papers by myself on the birds of

--104 REPORT 1875.

2. The Andean or Ooltjmbian Subbegion.

Of this extensive subregion, which traverses six or seven different States, there is

likewise no one zoological account ; but I may mention some of the principal works

lately issued that beai- upon the subject. Leotaud's ' Birds of Trinidad' (38) give

us an account of the ornithology of that island, which forms a kind of appendage

to this subregion ; and Dr. Finsch has more recently published (39) a supplemen-

tary notice on the same subject. Of Venezuela, Columbia, and Ecuador there are

only scattered memoirs in various periodicals on the numerous collections that

have of late years been made in those countries to be referred to. Several

--excellent collectors are now, or lately have been, resident in these republics Herr

Goring and Mr. Spence in Venezuela*, Mr. Salmon in Antioquia, Professor

--Jameson and Mr. Fraser in Ecuador t whose labours have vastly added to our

knowledge of the zoology of these districts. When we come to Peru, we have

Tschudi's ' Fauna Peruana ' (55) to refer to, which, though unsatisfactory in exe-

Howcution, contains much of value J.  far from being exhausted is the rich fauna

of the Peruvian Andes, is sufticiently manifest fi-om the wonderful discoA'eries

lately made by Jelski in the district east of Lima, which was in fact that princi-

pally investigated by Tscliudi. Of these, M. Taczanowski has lately given an account,

as regards the birds, in the Zoological Society's 'Proceedings' (60) ; and Dr. Peters

has published several notices of the more remarkable Mammals and Ileptiles(61-62).

Further south, in Bolivia, our leading authority is still the zoological portion of

D'Orbigny's ' Voyage dans I'Amerique M^ridionale ' (63). This rich and most in-

teresting district lias,at is true, been visited by several collectors since D'Orbigny's

time; but the results of their journeys have never been published in a connected

form, though many of their novelties have been described. Bolivia, I do not

doubt, still contains many new and extraordinary creatures hid in tlie recesses of its

mountain-valleys ; and there is no part of South America which I should sooner

suggest as a promising locality for the zoological collector,

                                3. The Amazonian Subregion.

   On Guiana, where the Amazonian fauna seems to have had its origin, we have a

standard work in Schomburgk's ' Eeisen,' the third volume of which, containing the
Fauna, was drawn up by the Naturalists of the Berlin Museum (64). For the
valley of the Amazons itself, the volumes of Spix and Martius (65), though

--not very accurate, and rather out of date, must still be referred to as likewise

the Zoology of Casteluau's ' Expedition dans I'Amerique du Sud ' (66), for the
natm-al history of the Peruvian confluents. As regards the Birds, however, we
have several more recent authorities. In 1873 Mr. Salvin and I published in the

Zoological Society's ' Proceedings ' a r^sumd of the papei-s treating of Mr. E. Bartlett's
and Mr. John Hauxwell's rich ornithological collections on the Huallaga, Ucayali,

and other localities in Eastern Peru (67-74). In 1867 we communicated to the same
Society an account of Mr. Wallace's collection of birds made near Para (75),

and took occasion to deduce therefrom some general ideas as to the relations of the
Avifauna of the Lower Amazons.

   As regards the valleys of the two great confluents of the Amazons, the Rio Ma-

deira on the right bank, and the llio Negi-o on the left bank of the mighty river, our
knowledge of these Avifaunas is mainly due to the researches of Johann Natterer

--one of the most successful and energetic zoological collectors that ever lived of

whose discoveries in ornithology a complete account has lately been published

by Hr. A. v. Pelzeln, of Vienna (76). It is much to be wislied that a similar
resume of Natterer's discoveries and collections of Mammals, in which Class his

investigations were of hardly less importance, coidd be given to the world ; and I

trust Herr v. Pelzeln will forgive me if I press this subject on his attention.
   The Fishes of the Amazons and its couflueuts are many and various, and fully

deserve a special luonogi-aph. The late Professor Agas.siz made his well-known

expedition up the Amazons in 1865, with the particular object of studying its fishes,
and amassed enormous collections of specimens for this purpose*. Whether (as
other naturalists have hinted) Professor Agassiz's estimate of the number of new
and undescribed species contained in his collections was exaggerated or not is
at present uncertain, as the specimens unfortunately lie unstudied in the Museum

of Compai'ative Zoology at Cambridge, Mass. It is a thousand pities this state of
things should continue ; and I venture to suggest to the great Professor's numerous
friends and admirers in the United States that no more appropriate tribute to his

memory could be raised than the publication of a Monograph of Amazonian Fishes

based on these collections f.

                           4. The South-Brazilian Sdbregion.

   This subregion, which embraces the wood-region of S.E. Brazil and adjoining
districts, and contains in nearly every branch of zoology a set of species and genera

allied to but separable from those of the Amazonian Subregion, has been much fre-

quented by European naturalists. Its productions are consequently tolerably well
known, though there is even here still very much to be done. Bm-meister's

--' Systematische Uebersicht ' (77) and ' ErlJiuterungen ' (78) may be referred to for

information on its Mammals and Birds likewise Prince Maximilian of Neu-Wied's

'Beiti'jige' (79), which, although of old standing in point of date, is still of great

value. The late Dr. Otto Wucherer, a German physician resident at Bahia, paid
much attention to the Reptiles of that disti-ict, and has written an account of its
Ophidians, which will be found in the Zoological Society's 'Proceedings ' (80).

   Hr. Hensel has also recently published in Wiegmann's 'Ai'chiv ' valuable memoirs
on Mammals and other Vertebrates collected in South Brazil (81, 82), which
should be referred to. Prof. Reinhardt has lately completed an excellent account
of the Avifauna of the Campos of Brazil, based on his own collections and those

of Dr. D. W. Limd (8.3) ; and Hr. v. Berlepsch has treated of the Birds of Santa

Cathai'ina (84). These are all most useful contributions to our knowledge of
this Subregion. But it is melancholy to think that although a (soi-disant) highly
civilized European race has occupied the Brazilian Empire so long, and has

introduced railways, steamboats, and many other of the appliances of modern
Europe, there has never, so far as I know, been produced amongst them any one
single memoir worthy of mention on the teeming variety of animal life that

everjTvhere surrounds their dwellings.

   For information on the animals of Paraguay we must still refer to the writings
of Don Felix de Azara (85), and to Dr. Hartlaub's reduction of his Spanish terms to
scientific nomenclature (80). As regards the Mammals, there is also the more recent
work of Rengger (87). But modern information about this part of the South-
Brazilian Subregion would be very desirable.

                           6. The Patagonian Subregion.

   For the zoology of the Argentine Republic, which forms the northern portion of

this subregion, the best work of reference is the second volume of Dr. Burmeister's
' La Plata-Reise ' (88), which contains a complete synopsis of the Vertebrates.

Dr. Burmeister, who is now resident at Buenos Ayres as Du-ector of the Public
Museum of that city, has lately devoted himself to the study of the extinct Mammal-

fauna, and specially to that of the Glyptodont Armadillos, of which he has lately

completed a splendidly illustrated Monograph (89). He has likewise been the

chief adviser of the Government in their plans for recognizing the University of

Cordova, which will ultimately no doubt do much for the cause of Natural science

in the Argentine Republic. Mr. W. H. Hudson, of Buenos Apes, has long studied

the birds and other animals of that country, and deserves honourable mention in a

country where so few of the native-born citizens pursue science. His bii'd-coUections

   * Spe ' Travels in Brazil,' by Prof, and Mrs. Louis Agassiz : Boston, 1868.

   t Mr. Alexander Agassiz informs me that tliese collections are not so entirely unworked
as I had supposed when tliis .address was read. Dr. Steindachner has been through them ;
and Mr. Putnam has announced a " Catalogue of the Agassiz Collection of Fishes " as

preparing for pubUcation,

have been worked out by Mr. Salvin and myself (90-92) ; and Mr. Hudson has like-
wise published a series of interesting notices on the habits of the species (0.3-100 ).

   The 'Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle' (101) contains much information
concerning the animals of La Plata, Patagonia, and Chili. The " Mammals " by
AVaterhouse, the " Birds " by Gould and G. R. Gray, the " Fishes " by Jenyns, and

the " Reptiles " by Bell, illustrated with notes and observations of Mr. Darwin, will
ever remain among the leading authorities on the animals of this part of America.

On the Rio Negro of Patagonia, where Mr. Darwin made considerable collections,
we have a more recent authority in Mr. W. H. Hudson, whose series of birds from

this district was examined by myself in 1872 (102).
   Dr. R. O. Cunningham has recently followed on the footsteps of Mr. Dar^^^n in

Patagonia, and, besides his journal of travels, has published notes on the animals
met with, in the Liunean Society's ' Transactions' (103). Mr. Salvin and I have
given an account of his ornithological collections in several papers in ' The Ibis '

(104).

   As regards the Falkland Islands, two excellent collectors and observers--Capt.

--Packe and Capt. Abbott have of late years been stationed there, and have pro-

vided the means of our becoming well acquainted with the native birds. Their
collections have been examined by Mr. Gould and myself (105, lOG) ; and Capt.
Abbott has furnished many valuable notes on their contents (107).

   Lastly, as regards Chili, we have Gay's somewhat pretentious ' Fauna Cliilena,'
forming the zoological portion of his ' Historia Fisica y Politica de Chile.' The
volume on the Mammals and Bhds was compiled at Paris by Desmm-s, and that on
the Reptiles and Fishes by Guichenot ; but thev are not very trustworthy. The
German naturalists of the National Museum of Santiago, Philippi and Laudbeck,
have of late years published in Wiegmann's ' Archiv ' many memoii's on the zoology

of the Chilian Republic, of which I have given a list in a paper on the Birds of Chili

in the Zoological Society's ' Proceedings ' for 1867 (108 ). More recently Messrs.

Philippi and Landbeck have published a catalogue of Chilian birds in the ' Anales

de la Universidad de Chile ' (109). But Mr. E. C. Reed, C.M.Z.S., who is likewise
attached to the museum of Santiago, writes me word that he is now engaged in

preparing for publication a complete revision of the Vertebrates of the Republic,

which will no doubt give us still better information on this subject.

6. Galapagos.

Until recently our knowledge of the very singulai' fauna of the Galapagos was

mainly based upon Mr. Darwin's researches, as published in the ' Zoology of the

Beagle,' above referred to. Recently, however, Mr. Salvin and I have described some

new species of birds from these islands from Dr. Habel's collection (110) ; and Prof.

Sundevall has published an accoimt of the birds collected there during the voyage

of the Swedish frigate 'Eugenie' in 1852 (111). Mr. Salvin has likewise pre-

pared and read before the Zoological Society a complete ]\Iemoir on the Orni-

thology of the Galapagoan Archipelago, which will shortly be printed in the

Society's ' Transactions.' Much interest has also been recently manifested con-

cerning the gigantic Tortoises of the Galapagos, which Dr. Giinther has reason to

believe belong to several species, each restricted to a separate island*. Indeed I

am much pleased to hear that the Lords of the Admiraltj', incited by Dr. Giinther's

requests, have despatched H.M.S. ' Tenedos ' of the Pacific squadi-on from Panama

to the Galapagos, for the express purpose of capturing and bringing to England

Wespecimens of the Tortoises of each of tlie islands.  may therefore hope to be

shortly more accitrately informed upon this most interesting subject.

                     Va. THE ANTILLEAN SUBREGION.

  --The study of the fauna of the West-India Islands presents problems to us of the

greatest interest : first, on account of the relics of an ancient and primitive fauna
which are foimd there, as indicated by the presence of such types as Solenodon,

Dultis, and Starnonnas ; and, secondly, from the many instances of representative

species replacing each oilier in the different islands. Much, it is true, has been
done towards the working-out of Antillean faunas of late years ; but much more
remains to be done ; and indeed it is scandalous that there should be many islands

under the British rule of the Zoology of which we are altogether unacquainted.
The greater activity of our Botanical fellow-labourers has supplied us with a handy

volume of the Botany of these islands* ; and it is by no means creditable to the.

Zoologists to remain so far behind in this as in other cases already alluded to.

Within the compass of the present address it would not be possible for me to

enumerate all our authorities upon Antillean zoology ; but I will mention some of
the principal works of reference under the following heads :

1. The Bahamas.  I 4. Haiti.
                              5. Porto Rico.
2. Cuba.                       6. Tlie Lesser Antilles.
3. Jamaica,
                 \

                                                  1. Tlie Bahamas.

   The late Dr. Bryant has published, in the ' Boston Journal of Natural History,-
several articles upon the Birds of the Bahamas, where he passed more than one
winter (112). These islands, however, merit much more minute investigation
than has as yet been bestowed upon them.

                 2. Cuba.

Ramon de la Sagra's ' Historia Fisicay Politica de Cuba ' (113), and Lembeye's

' Aves de la Isla de Cuba ' (114), were up to a recent period oin* chief authorities

upon Cuban zoology. But Cuba has long had the advantage of the residence

within it of an excellent naturalist, Don Juan Gundlach, who has laboured hard

Wetowards the more complete investigation of its remarkable zoology.  are indebted

to him for collecting the specimens upon which Dr. Cabanis based his revision of

Cuban Ornithology, published in the ' Journal fiir Ornithologie ' (115), as also for

a tabular list of Cuban Birds, published in the same joimial for 1861 (116), and for

--several supplements thereto for the more recent reviews of the Mammals and
--Birds of the island, published in the first volume of Poey's ' Repertorio ' and for

many other contributions to the natural histoiy of Cuba. This last-named work

(117), as also the previous ' Memorias sobre la historia natiu'al de la Isla de Cuba' of

the same author (118), contain a number of valuable contributions to our knowledge

of the rich fauna of this island, and should be carefidly studied by those who are

anxious to become acquainted with the peculiarities of the Cuban faima.

                 3. Jamaica.

Mr. Gosse's meritorious work on the Birds of Jamaica (119), and his 'Naturalist's

Sojourn ' (120), are still the main source of our information on the fine island of
AJamaica, and very little has been done since his time.
                                                         young English naturalist,

Mr. W. Osburn, made some good collections in Jamaica in 1860, of which the

Mammals were worked out by Mr. Tomes (121), and the Birds by myself (122). Mr.

W. T. March has also more recently sent good series of the birds of the island to

America ; and Prof Baird has edited his excellent notes on them (123). I must not

lose the opportunity of calling special attention to the Seals of the Antilles

(Monachus tropicaUs and. Ci/siophora aiiti/larum of Gray), of which, so far as I

know, the only specimens existing are the imperfect remains in the British Museum

brought home by Mr. Gosse. More knowledge about these animals (if there be

really more than one of them) would be very desirable.

                 4. Haiti.

   Of this large island very little more is known as regards its zoology than was tlio
case in the days of Buffou and Vieillot. Of its Birds alone we have a recent account
in a paper which I prepared in 1857, upon M. Salle's collection (124), and in a
more recent memoir tb-awn up by the late Dr. Bryant, and published in the ' Pro-

ceedings ' of the Boston Society of Natural History (125).

   Nearly the same story liolds good of this Spanish island, of which our only

--recent news relates to the Birds, and consists of two papers one by Mr. E. C.

Taylor in ' The Ibis/ for 1864 (126), and the other by the late Dr. Bryant, in the
journal above mentioned (127).

                                                6. The Lesser Antilles.

   As I remarked above, every one of the numerous islands, from Porto Hico
down to Trinidad, requires thorough examination. It is indeed strange that no one
has yet been found to undertake this interesting task, which might easily be per-
formed by excm-sions during the winter months of a few succeeding j^ears.

   As regards the Ornithology of these islands, the subjoined summary of what we
really know and do not know is mainly taken from a paper on the Birds of Santa

--Lucia, which I read before the Zoological Society of London in 1871.
    1. The Virgin Islands. Of these islands we may, I think, assume that we have

 a fair acquaintance with the birds of St. Thomas, the most frequently visited of the

 group, and the halting-place of the West-Indian Mail-steamers. Mr. Riise, who
 was long resident here, collected and forwarded to Europe many specimens,

 some of which were described by myself*, and others are spoken of by Prof.
 Newton in a letter published in 'the Ibis' for 1860, p. 307. Mr. Riise's
 series of skins is now, I believe, at Copenhagen. Frequent allusions to the birds
 of St. Thomas are also made by Messrs. Newton in their memoir of the birds of
 St. Croix, mentioned below. In the ' Proceedings of the Academj' of Natural
 Sciences of Philadelphia ' for 1860 (128), Mr. Cassin has given an account of a
 collection of bu-ds made in St. Thomas by Mi-. Robert Swift, and presented to the
 Academy ; twenty-seven species are enumerated.

     Quite at the extreme east of the Virgin Islands, and lying between them and the
 St.-Bartholomew group, is the little islet of Sombrero, " a naked rock about seven
 eighths of a mile long, twenty to forty feet abo^'e the level of the sea, and from a
 few rods to about one third of a mile in width." Although "there is no vegeta-
 tion whatever in the island over two feet high," and it would seem a most unlikely

 place for birds, Mr. A. A. Julien, a correspondent of Mr. Lawrence of New York,

  succeeded in collecting on it specimens of no less than thu-ty-five species, the
  names of which, together with Mr. Julieu's notes thereupon, are recorded by Mr.

 Lawrence in the eighth volume of the ' Annals of the Lyceum of Natm'al History

 of New York '(129).

     The remaining islands of the Virgin gTOup are, I believe, most strictly entitled
  to their name so far as Ornithology is concerned ; for no collector on record has ever
  polluted their virgin soil. Prof. Newton (Ibis, 1860, p. 307) just alludes to some

 --birds from St. John iu the possession of Mr. Riise.
     2. St. Croix. On the birds of this island we have an excellent article by Messrs.

  A. and E. Newton, published in the first volume of ' The Ibis ',t (130 j. This memoir,
  being foimded on the collections and personal observations of the distinguished
  authors themselves, and hai-ing been worked up after a careful examination of
  their specimens in England, aud with minute attention to preceding authorities,

  forms by far the most complete account we possess of the ornithology of any one

  of the Lesser Antilles. It, however, of course requires to be supplemented by
  additional observations, many points having been necessarily left imdetermined
  and it is much to be regretted that no one seems to have siuce paid the slightest

   attention to the subject.

   --3. AnguiUa, St. Martin, and St. Bartholomew. Of this gTOup of islands St.

  Bartholomew aloue has, as far as I know, been explored ornithologically, and that
   within a very recent period. In the Royal Swedish Academy's * Proceedings ' for
   1869 will be found an excellent article (131), by the veteran ornithologist Prof.
   Sundevall, on the birds of this island, founded on a collection made by Ur. A. von
   Goes. The species enumerated are forty-seven iu number.

--4. Barbuda. Of this British island I believe I am correct in saying that nothing

whatever is known of its ornithology, or of any other branch of its natural history.

 --5. St. Christopher and Kevis, to which may be added the adjacent smaller islands

St. Eustatkins and Saba. Of these islands also our ornithological knoAvledge is of the

most fragmentary description. Mr. T. J. Cottle was, I believe, formerly resident

in Nevis, and sent a few birds thence to the British Museum in 1839. Amongst

these were the specimens of the Humming-birds of that island, which are men-
tioned by Mr. Gould in his well-known work. Of the remainder of this group of

islands we know absolutely nothing.

 --C. Antigua. Of this tine British island, I regret to say, nothing whatever is

known as regards its ornithology. Amongst the many thousands of American

                                                  excellent French naturalist,

Dr. I'Hermiuier, was for many years resident as physician in the island of Guade-

loupe. Unfortimately, Dr. ITIermiuier never carried into execution the plan which

I believe he contemplated, of publishing an account of the birds of that island.

lie sent, however, a certain number of specimens to Paris and to the late Baron de

Lafresnaye, to whom we are indebted for the only article ever published on the

--birds of Guadeloupe (132), or of the adjacent islands.
   9. Dominica. Dominica is one of the few of the Caribbean islands that has had

the advantage of a visit from an active English ornithologist. Although INIr. E. C.

Taylor only passed a fortnight in this island in 1863, and had many other matters
to attend to, he nevertheless contrived to preserve specimens of many birds of very

great interest, of which · he has given us an accoimt in one of his articles on the

birds of the West Indies, published in 'The Ibis' for 1864 (126). It cannot be

supposed, however, that the birds of this wild and beaxitiful island can have been

exhausted in so short a space of time, even by the energetic efforts of our well-

known fellow-labom'er.

 --10. Martiiiiqite. This island is one of the few belonging to the Lesser Antilles

in which birdskins are occasionally collected by the residents, and find their way

into the hands of the Parisian dealers. There are also a certain number of speci-

mens from Martinique in the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in the Jardin des Plantes,

which I have had an opportunity of examining ; but, beyond the vague notices

given by Vieillot in his ' Oiseaux de I'Am^rique Septentrionale,' I am not aware

of any publication relating specially to the ornithology of this island. Mr. E. C.

Taylor passed a fortnight in Martinique in 1863, and has recorded his notes
upon the species of birds which he met with in the article which I have

mentioned above ; but these were only few in number. The International

Exhibition in 1862 contained, in the department devoted to the products of the

French colonies, a small series of the birds of Martinique, exhibited by M.
Belanger, Director of the Botanical Garden of St. PieiTe in that island * (133).

This is all the published information I have been able to find concerning the

--bu'ds of Martinique f.
   11. aS"^. Lucia. Of this island I gave an account of what is known of the birds
in a paper published in the Zoological Society's ' Proceedings ' for 1871, based upon
a collection kindly forwarded to me by the JRev. J. E. Semper (134). Mr. Semj)er
subsequently commimicated some interesting notes on the habits of the species

--(135).
   12. St. Vincent. St. Vincent was formerly the residence of an energetic and

most observant naturalist, the Rev. Lansdown Guilding, F.L.S., well-known to

the first founders of the Zoological Society of London, who, however, unfortunately

died at an early age in this island without having carried out his plans for a ' Fauna

of the West Indies.'   Mr. Guilding paid most attention to the invertebrate animals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

burgk's well-known worli on that island (136). This contains (p. 681) a list of

the birds met with, accompanied by some few remarks. It does not, however,

appear that birds attracted much of the author's attention ; and more copious notes

would be highly desirable.

W.15. Tobago, I believe, belongs zoologically to Trinidad. Sir  .Tardine has

given us an account of its ornithology from Mr. Kirk's collections (137).

                      VI. THE AUSTRALIAN REGION.

   Of the Australian Region I will speak in the following Subdi\ision3 :

                                    1. Australia and Tasmania.
                                   2. Paima and the Pajntan Islands.
                                      3. The Solomon Islands.

                                   1. Australia and Tasmania.

  Tliat we Iniow more of the fauna of Australia than of other English colonies in

different parts of the world is certain ; but no thanks are due from us for this
knowledge either to the Imperial or to any of tlie Colonial Governments. The
unassisted enterprise of a private individual has produced the two splendid works

iipon the Mammals and Birds of Australia which we all turn to with pleasure
whenever reference is required to a member of these two classes of Australian
animals. Mr. Gould's ' Mammals of Australia ' was completed in 1863 (1). Since

tliat period the little additional information received respecting the terrestrial

Mammals of Australia has been chiefly furnished by Mr. Krefft of the Australian
Museum, Sydney, in various papers and memoii's. Mr. Kreift has also written the
letterpress to some large illustrations of the ' Mammals of Australia/ by Miss
H. Scott and Mrs. II. Forde (2), in which a short account of all the described
species is given. On the marine Mammals, which were scarcely touched upon by

Mr. Gould, we have a treatise by Mr. A. W. Scott (3) published at Sydney in

1873, which contains a good deal of useful information concerning the Seals and
Whales of the Southern Hemisphere t-

   The magniflcent series of seven volumes of Mr. Gould's 'Birds of Australia' (4)
was finislied in 1848. In 1869 a supplementary volume was issued, containing
similar full-sized illustrations of about 80 species. In 186-5 Mr. Gould reprinted
in a quarto form, with additions and corrections, tlie letterpress of his great work,
and published it under the title of a ' Handbook to the Birds of Australia ' (5).
This makes a convenient work for general reference. Of two Colonial attempts
to rival Mr. Goidd's series I cannot speak with much praise. Neither Mr. Diggles's
' Ornithology of Australia ' (6) nor Mr. HaUey's proposed ' Monograph of the
 Australian^ Parrots ' (7) are fa,r advanced towards conclusion ; indeed ol the last-
mentioned work I have seen but one number.

    Several large collections of birds have been made in the peninsula of Cape York
 and adjoining districts of Nortliern Queensland of late years ; and it is a misfortune
 for science that we have had no complete account of them. One of the largest of
 these, however, made by Mr. J. T. Cockerell, has luckily fallen into the hands of
 Messrs. Salvin and Godman, and will, I trust, be turned to better uses than the
 filling of glass cases and the ornamentation of ladies' hats.

    It seems to me that there is still much to be done even in Birds in Northern

 Australia ; and I cannot help thinking that Port Darwin, the northern extremity

   A* short note on a small collection of birds from Barbadoes was also published by

 mc in the P. Z. S. 1874, p. 174 (138).
    t A general view of the Mammal-fanna of Australia is given in an article which I pub-

 lislied in the ' Quarterly Journal of Science' for 1865, p. 213.

of the trans-contineutal Telegraph, would bo an excellent station lor a collecting
naturalist, and one where many novelties, both zoological and botanical, would
certainly be met Avith.

   On the Snakes of Australia we have an excellent work, published in 18G9, by Mr.
Gerard Kreft't (8), one of the few really working Australian naturalists, who, how-
ever, it appears, is not appreciated by the Trustees of the Sydney Museum as he

deserves to be. Mr. Krent during his long residence in Sydney, has become well

acquainted with the Ophidians of the Colony and has devoted special attention to

them, 80 that he has the advantage of practical as well as scientific acquaintance

with his subject. The late Dr. Gray has written many papers on the Tortoises and
Lizards of Australia. Of the latter, we have to thank Dr. Giinther for a complete
monogi-aphic list just published in one of the newly issued numbers of the 'Voyage
of the Erebus and Tenor ' (9). Most of the plates of this work were also issued

in 1867 bv Dr. Gray in his Fasciculus of the Lizards of Australia and New

Zealand (10).

   For information on the Fishes of Australia reference must be made to the
Ichthyological portion of the ' Zoology of the Erebus and Terror,' by Sir John
Ilichardson (0), and to the same author's numerous papers oa Australian Fishes
iu the ' Annals of Natural History ' and ' Transactions ' and ' Proceedings ' of the
Zoological Society of London (11-15). The Count F. de Casteluau, who seems to

be almost the only working Ichthj-ologist in Australia, has recently published in

the ' Proceedings of the Zoological and Acclimatization Society of Victoria ' several
papers on the Fishes of the Melbourne Fish-market and of other parts of Australia,

which include a complete synopsis of the known Austi-alian species (16-24).

                                      2. Paptja and its Islands.

  I believe that my paper upon the Mammals and Birds of New Guinea, published

by the Linnean Society in 1858 (25), was the first attempt to put together the
scattered fragments of om- knowledge of this subject. In 1859 a British-Museum
Catalogue by Dr. J. E. and Mr. G. R. Gray (26), "gave a resume of the then known

members of the same two classes belonging to New Guinea and the Aru Islands,

and included notices of all Mr. Wallace's discoveries. In 1862 Mr. Wallace gave

descriptions of the now species discovered subsequently to his return by his
assistant, Mr. Allen (27). In 1865 Dr. Finsch published at Bremen an excellent
little essay called ' Neu-Guinea und seine Bewohner' (28), in which is given a
complete accoimt of om" then state of knowledge of the subject. But within these
last ten years still more serious efforts have been made by naturalists of several
nations to penetrate this terra incognita. Two emissaries of the Leyden Museum
(Bernstein and v. Rosenberg) have sent home full series of zoological spoils to
that establishment, and have discovered a host of novelties. Of these the Birds

have been described by Prof. Schlegel in his ' Observations Zoologiques' (29). An

intrepid Italian traveller, Signor L. M. d'Albertis, made a still further advance,
when in September 1872 he accomplished the first ascent of the Arfak mountains *,
and discovered the splendid Bird of Paradise and other new species which I described
in 1873 (.30). Quickly following on his footsteps Dr. A. B. Meyer penetrated still
further into the unknown interior, and reaped the abundant harvest of which he
has given us an account in six papers lately published at Vienna (31-.36). Dr.
Meyer has now become Director of the Museum of Dresden, and is no doubt
occupied in the further elaboration of his rich materials. In the meanwhile some
accomplished Italian naturalists are engaged on the collections of D'Albertis and
his quondam companion Beccari. Count Salvadori, who is at work on the birds,

will take the opportunity of preparing a complete account of the Ornithology of

Papua and its islands, similar to that of Borneo, of which I have already spoken.
The Marquis Giacomo Doria has already published one excellent paper on the

Reptiles of Amboina and the K^ Islands collected by his compatriot Beccari (37),
and is preparing other memoirs on the Mammals and Reptiles of New Guinea

and the Ai-oo Islands obtained by D'Albertis.

  Dr. Meyer has lately given an account of his Herpetological discoveries in New

                                                * See ' Nature,' vol. viii. p. 501.

112 REPORT 1875.

 Guinea, whicli comprehend several new and most interesting forms, in a memoir
 read before the Academy of Berlin (38) ; and Dr. Bleeker some years ago gave a

 list of the Eeptiles obtained by v. Rosenberg in that island, and enumerated the
Papuan Reptiles then kno"mi to him (39).

    All these expeditions, however, have been directed towards the western penin-

sula of New Guinea, which alone is yet in any way explored by naturalists. Of the

greater south-eastern portion of the island we have as yet very little information.

A Cassowary * and a Kangaroo t, brought away by the ' Basilisk ' from the

southern coast, both proved to be new to science, as did likewise a Paradise-bird
obtained in the same district by M. d'Albertis J. This is sufficient to give us an

idea of what we may expect to find when the interior of this part of New Guinea
is explored. And I may take this opportunity of mentioning that a most active

and energetic traveller is perhaps at this very moment at work there. M. L. SJ.
d'Albertis, of whose previous labours I have just spoken, returned to the East last
autumn. Letters received from him by his Italian friends in June last state that
he had at the time of writing already succeeded in reaching Yule Island near

Mously Bay on the S.E. coast of New Guinea, and proposed to establish his head-

quarters there for expeditions into the interior.

          3. New Ireland, New Bbitain, and the Solomon Islands.

    I devote a few words specially to these islands because they are easy of access
from Sydney, and because their productions are of particular interest, belonging, as
they do, to the Papuan and not to the Polynesian faima. I have put together what

is known of the birds of the Solomon's group in a paper read before the Zoological

Society in 1869 (40). Seeing tlie interesting resvdts obtained from the examination
of one small jar of birds collected here by an unscientific person, there can be little
doubt of the value of what would be discovered on the more complete investigation

of the group. As regards New Ireland and New Britain, we have but scattered

notices to refer to. The last-named island is, we know, the home of a peculiar

Cassowary {Casuarms hennettt).

  A list of the fishes of the Solomon Islands is given by Dr. Gunther in Mr.

Brenchley's ' Cruise of the Cm-a^oa ' (41), which I shall allude to again presently.

                          VII. THE PACIFIC REGION.

   Of this Region, where Mammals (except a few Bats) are altogetlier absent, and

Birds are the predominant form of Vertebrate life, I will say a few final words rmder
three heads :

             1. Neio Zealand, \ 2. Polynesia. \ 3. The Sandwich Islands.

                                   1. New Zealand.

   In New Zealand, of all our Colonies, most attention has lately been devoted to

natural history, and several excellent natm-alists are laboming hard and well ; I

need only mention the names of 'Dr. Hector, Dr. Haast, Capt. F. W. Hutton, and

Mr. Bidler. The commendable plan of affiliating the various local Societies

to one Central Institute has resulted in the production of an excellent scientific
Jom-nal, already in its sixth volume, which contains a mass of most interesting-
papers on the fauna and flora of the Colony (1). To refer to these memoirs in
detail is quite unnecessary ; but it is obvious, on turning over the pages of the

volumes of the ' Transactions of the New-Zealand Institute,' how great are the
exertions now being made to perfect our knowledge of the natm-al products, both

recent and extinct, of our antipodean Colony.

  Mr. W. L. Buller's beautiful volume on the Ornithology of New Zealand, finished

in 1873 (2), is likewise a most creditable production both to the author and to

lliose wlio have supported and promoted his undertaking. Few, indeed, are the
Colonies that can boast of a simdar piece of work !

   In 1842 the late Sir John Eichardsou presented to this Association a special re-

port on the Ichthyology of New Zealand (3) ; but much advance has, of course,

been made since that period.

  The Lizards of New Zealand have been recently enumerated along with those of

Australia in Dr. Giinther's memoir above referred to.

2. Polynesia.

Great additions have recently been made to our knowledge of the natural pro-

ductions of the Polynesian Islands by the travellers and naturalists employed by the

brothers Godeflroy of Hamburg. These gentlemen not only have extensive col-
lections made, but also trouble themselves to get them properly worked out The

excellent volume on the Ornithology of the Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga Islands pub-

lished in 1867 by Drs. Finch and Hartlaub (4), is based entirely upon materials thus

obtained, as are likewise the many capital memoirs which fill the parts of the Illus-

--trated quarto ' Jom-nal des Museum Godeffi'oy ' (5) a journal replete with informa-

tion upon the geography, ethnogi-aphy and natural history of Polynesia. Amongst

these memoirs I must call special attention to Dr. Giinther's 'Fische der Stidsee'

(6), foimded upon Mr. Andi-ew Garrett's splendid collection of fishes and of draw-
Weings of them coloured after life, of which three parts are already issued.
                                                                              have

now for the first time almost, in this country, the opportunity of becoming acquainted

with the exceeding beauty of the tropical fishes in life

   The late Mr. Julius Brenchley's account of his cruise in H.M.S. ' Cm'a9oa ' among

the South-sea Islands (7), pulilished in 1873, contains an appendix of " Natural-
History Notices," illustrated by figures of remarkable specimens obtained on the

occasion. Of these the part relating to the Birds is by the late Mr. G. R. Gray, and

those concerning the Reptiles and Fishes by Dr. Gunther.

                                 3. The Sandwich Islands.

   The Sandwich Islands stand apart zoologically as geographically from the rest of
Polynesia, and merit more special attention than has yet been bestowed upon them.
Of their Birds, which form the most prominent part of their Vertebrate fauna, Mr.
Dole has given a " Synopsis " in the ' Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural
History ' (8). In noticing this paper in ' The Ibis ' for 1871, I have introduced
some supplementary remai'ks (9) upon the general aspect of the Avifauna.

In concluding this Addi-ess, which has extended, I regret to say, to a much

greater length than I anticipated when I selected the subject of it, I wish to endea-

vour to impress upon natiu'alists the paramount importance of locality.

In the study of distribution more probably than in any other direction, if perhaps

we except embryology, wiU be ultimately fovmd the key to the now much vexed

question of the Origin of Species. The past generation of naturalists coidd not

Aunderstand the value of locality.  Museum was regarded as a collection of ciu'i-

osities; and so long as the objects were there it little mattered in their eyes whence

they came. The consequence is that all oiu- older collections, and even, I regret to

say, our National Museum itself, are filled with specimens utterly without a

history attached to them, unless it be that they were purchased of a certain dealer

in a certain year. Even in the present generation it is only the more advanced and

enlightened thinkers that really imderstand the importance of locality. It is with

the hope of impressing the value of locality and distribution more firmly upon you

that I have devoted this address not to the general progi-ess of biology, but to the

present state of our knowledge of the Geographical Distribution of the Vertehrata.

       Anatomy and Phtsioloqt.

        Address to the Department of Anatomy and Physloloriy

By Professor Cleland, M.D., F.R.S., Vice-President of the Section.

   I shall not venture to occupy the time of the Section with any rSsutne of the

work done in Anatomy and Physiology during the past year, as such information

is readily accessible in the pages of journals and year-books. I shall content myself
with making some comments on the condition of Anatomy at the present time in a

few important particulars.

   I had intended to speak also of some subjects connected with Physiology ; but I

find that I cannot do so without lengthening my remarks to a greater extent than

might be desirable. I shall be content, therefore, so far as that science is concerned,

to mention that, although Experimental Physiology is probably less cultivated in

this country than in any other in wliich Biology is studied, it has been practically

decided by Parliament that it is quite time to put some check on investigation in

that direction ; for, as every one knows, a Royal Commission has been appointed

to inquii'e into vivisection. In the scientific world all are agreed, whatever

opinions may prevail in other sections of the commimity, that the man who would

wantonly inflict pain on a brute beast is himself a brute, and deserving to be

roughly handled ; and because there is no difference of opinion on that subject, and

because no experimental science can well prosper if one man is to judge for another

what experiments are justifiable to institute or to repeat, or are likely to give im-

portant results, I do deplore the clamour which well-meaning persons have raised,

and regret that it has been so far yielded to.

In Anatomy the most important progress in recent years has been made in those

departments which abut most closely on Physiology, namely, the microscopy of the

tissues and development. The whole conception of the nutrition of the body has

become altered in comparatively recent years by the additions to our knowledge of

the nucleated corpuscles, which are the living elements of which it is composed

and principally by the recognition of the secondary nature of cell-walls, the close

connexion or even continuity of the nerves with other textures, and the identity of

the white coi-puscles of the blood with amoeboid or undifferentiated corpuscles out-

side the vessels. The origin of every living corpuscle from corpuscles preexisting

is no longer difficult to imagine, but may, I incline to think, be almost looked on

as proved. The history of each may be traced back through conjugated germs to

the corpuscles of preceding generations in uninterrupted succession, and the pedigi-ee

of the structural elements is seen to differ in no way from that of individual plants
or animals. It is true, indeed, that no absolute proof exists that new li-siug cor-

puscles originating by mere deposit are not added to the others ; but the evidence
aoainst such a thing taking place is exactly of the same description as that which

exists against spontaneous generation of independent organisms, namely, that things
previously unexplained by the theory of parentage are explained now, while, on
the other hand, there is no sufficient evidence of the origin of life by any other

mode.                       _.

The advance of Plistology in recent years is owing in part to the facility of ob-

taining good microscopes at moderate prices having brought the study within the

reach of a great and increasing crowd of observers. At first the progress of His-

tology was influenced by the steps of improvement in the manufactiure of micro-

scopes ; but now, for a number of years back, we have been in possession of

instruments thoroughly suited for the investigation of tissues ; and I think it will

be generally admitted that the highest powers which have been manufactured are

not those which have advanced discovery most, or are most likely, in the present
Westate of science, to yield the richest hai-vest.
                                                    appear to be more dependent

now on new methods of preparation. Thus, if we go back for a considerable

number of years, we cannot but remember what a valuable addition glycerine

proved when it came first into use, and what a harvest of discovery followed the

introduction of chromic acid. More recently, the methods of transparent injec-

tion, of preparing sections by imbedding, the freezing of tissues, the use of carmine

and other pigments for staining, the resort to metallic depositions by the use of
osmic acid, silver and gold, and a variety of other additions to our means of pre-
paration have produced results of an astonishing kind, which have changed the
whole aspect ot histology from that which it wore when I myself first took an

interest in the subject.

  Leaving Histology, I shall devote the rest of my remarks to the morphology of
the Vertebrata. Here I am less disposed to indulge a gratidatory vein. No doubt

within the last dozen years we have had work to be grateful for. Worthy of a

prominent place in this, as in other depai'tments of anatomy, is the encyclopfedic

work, the ' Le9ons ' of JNIilue-Edwards, invaluable as a treasury of reference to all

future observers ; while the memoirs of Gegenbaur on the carpus, on the shoulder-
girdle, and on the skulls of Selachian fishes, and Kitchen Parker's memoirs devoted

to mature forms, may be taken as examples that morphological problems suggested
by adult comparative anatomy have not lost their attraction to men capable of
elaborate original research. And I the more willingly select the names of these

two writers, because on one subject on which they have written, the shoulder-

girdle, I am compelled to difier from their conclusions and to adhere rather to those

of Oweu, so far as the determination of the difierent elements in fishes is concerned

and by stating this (although the subject cannot be now discussed) I am enabled

to illustrate that the appreciation of the value of elaborate and painstaking work is
a matter totally distinct from agreement vnth the conclusions which may be arrived
at in the investigation of complicated problems, although wisdom and penetration
as to these must ever command admiration.

   But when one looks back on the times of Meckel and Cuvier, and on the activity

inspired by the speculations of the much-abused Oken, the writings of Geofii-oy
8t.-IIilaire, the less abstrusely speculative part of the works of Ct. C. Cams, and
the careful monographs of many minor writers ; when one reflects on the splendid

grasp of Johannes Midler, and thinks of the healthy enthusiasm created in this
country for a number of years by Owen's ' Archetype and Homologies of the Ver-
tebrate Skeleton,' and then contemplates the state of vertebrate morphology at the

present moment, it seems to me that its homological problems and questions of
theoretical interest do not attract so much attention as they did, or as they deserve.

    There can be no doubt that a great and curious influence has been exercised on

morphology by the rise of the doctrine of the origin of species by natural selection.
Attention has been thereby directed strongly for a number of years to varieties

and probably it is to this doctrine that we owe the larger number of observations
made on variations of muscles, nerves, and other structures. Particularly elaborate

have been the records of muscular variations, very praiseworthy, interesting to the
recorders, very dry to most other people, and hitherto, so far as I know, bari'en

cnouo'h of any general conclusions. So much the more credit is due to those

who have worked steadily in faith that beauty will emerge to gild their results

some day.
   But the doctrine of Natural Selection has had a further effect in anatomical

study, aiding the reaction against the search for internal laws or plans regulating

the "evolution of structures, and directing attention to the modifying influences of

external agencies. This effect has happened naturally enough, but it has been far

from just ; rather is it a pendulum-like swing to another extreme from what had

previously been indulged in. The doctrine of natural selection starts with the

recoo'uition of an internal formative force which is hereditary ; and in the develop-

ment of the doctrine, the limits of hereditary resemblance have been greatly studied;

and further, it will be observed that one of the fundamentals of the doctrine is,

that the formative force alters its character gi-aduallj' and permanently when traced

Nowfrom generation to generation in great tracts of time.  I am not going to enter

on a threadbare discussion of the origin of species in this company ; suffice it to

sav that, while the existence and extensive operation of such a thing as natural

selection seems to have been convincingly proved, it is a very different thing to

allege that it has been the sole, or even the principal agent in producing the evolu-

tions of living forms on the face of the earth. So far as Anatomy is concerned, it

is a secondary matter whether the link between the members of the evolving hosts

of life have been genetic or not. But I wish to point out that, even pushing the
--136 REPORT 1875.
                                                                                                                                                                                     ,

Darwinian theory to the utmost possible extreme, the action of external agents

infers the existence of something acted on ; and the less directly they act, the more

Weimportance must be given to the hereditary or internal element.                                                                                                                             are there-

fore presented with a formative force, which exhibited itself in very simple trains

of phenomena in the first beginnings of life, and now is manifested in governing the
Wecomplex growth of the highest forms.
                                                                   are set face to face with that formative

force, and are obliged to admit its inherent capability of changing its action ; and
that being the case, is it more of an assumption to declare that the changes are all

accidental and made permanent by accident of external circumstance, or to con-

sider that it has been the law proper to this force to have been adequate to raise

--forms, however liable to modification by external circumstances to raise them, I

say, from the simple to the complex, acting through generations on the face of the

earth, precisely as it acts in the evolution of a single egg into an adult individual ?
This is that formative force which has been elaborately shown by Mr. Darwin, in
launching his theory of " pangenesis," not only to be conveyed through whole or-
ganisms and their seed, but to pervade at all times the minutest particles of each

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and I merely direct attention to the fact that its extension over the whole history
of life on the globe must be granted, and ask if, in the range of forms which furnish

at the present day an imperfect key to the ages which are past, there is not exhi-

bited a development comparable, in its progression to definite goals, with what is

shown in the life of a single plant or animal. For my own part, I am fully con-

vinced of a unity of plan running through animal forms, and reaching, so far as the

main line is concerned, its completion in the human body. I confess that I think

that there is evidence that animal life has reached its preordained climax in

humanity ; and I cannot think it likely that, as myriads of years roll on, descendants

differing in toto from man will be developed. To argue the subject would be to

enter on the largest subjects of morphological anatomy, and on speculations on

which agreement could not be expected. Even, however, in the nature of the

variations in the human race there seems to be some evidence that the progress of

evolution is to be traced from man, not to other animal forms yet to appear, but,

through his psychical nature, into the land of the unseen. Those variations, keep-

ing out of view differences of bulk and stature, which appear to have some relation

to geogi-aphical position, are principally to be found in the head, the part of the body

most closely connected with the development and expression of the mental cha-

racter                          and I may mention that when, some  years                                                                                                                ago,  my attention was directed
                             ;

to the variations of the skull, the only part whose variations in difierent races I have

had opportunity of studying with any degree of minuteness, I became satisfied that

in uncivilized races there might be distinguished skulls which had undergone here-

ditary degeneration, others which had reached the most advanced development

possible for them, and a third set, notably the Kaffirs, with large capabilities for
improvement in the future. Indeed it is beyond doubt that there is a limit for
each type of humanity beyond which it cannot pass in the improvement of the
physical organization necessary for mental action*.

   There are also some curious indications in human structure of the formative force

neariug the end of its j ourney. In the details of the skeletons of other animals one sees
the greatest precision of form ; but there are various exceptions to this neatness of finish
in the skeleton of man, and they are found in parts speciallj' modified in connexion
with the peculiarities of his development, and not requiring exactness of shape forphy-
siological pui-poses ; while, on the other hand, physiognomical moidd and nicety of
various physiological adaptations are found in perfection. Look at the variations
in the breast-bone, especially at its lower extremity, which is never shapely, as it

  --* I aUude to the circumstances that under the influence of civilization the length of

the base of the skull does not increase, but positively decreases ; that the proportion of the
extent of the arcli to the base has strict hmits ; that the curvature of the base in some un-
civilized races falls slightly short of the normal ; that in others it transcends the normal
by a pecidiar process of degeneration between the sphenoid and ethmoid ; and that increased
capacity of the cranial cavity in the progress of civilization is obtained almost entirely by
increase of breadth and by the rounding out of those flat surfaces above and below the

is in the lower auiuials. Look at the coccygeal A-ertebroe ; they are the most irre-
gular structures imaginable. Even in the .sacrum and in the rest of the column the

amount of variation iiniis no parallel in other animals. In the skull, except in some

of the lowest forms of humanity, the dorsiun selUe is a ragged, warty, deformed, and

irregular structure, and it never exhibits the elegance and finish seen in other ani-

mals. The curvature of the skull and shortening of its base, which have gradually

increased in the ascending series of forms, have reached a degree which cannot be

exceeded ; and the nasal cavity is so elongated vertically, that in the higher races

nature seems scarcely able to bridge the gap from the cribriform plate to the palate,

and produces such a set of unsj^mmetrical and ruggeil performances as is quite pecu-

liar to man ; and to the human anatomist many other examples of similar pheno-
mena will occur.

   Questions of homology are matters which must be ever present in the study of

--structure, as distinct from function both the correspondence of parts in one species

to those in others, and the relations of one part to another in the same animal ; and

perhaps I shall best direct attention to the changes of opinion on morphological

subjects iu this country during the last twenty-five years by referring shortly to the

--liomological writings of three eminent anatomists Professors Owen, Goodsir, and

Huxley.

For the first time in English literature the great problems of this description

were dealt with in Professor Owen's work already referred to, published in IBiS
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and it is uimecessary to say that, notwithstanding the presence of unquestionable

errors of theory, that work was a most valuable and important contribution to

science. The faults in its general scope were j ustly and quietly corrected by Good-
sir at the Meeting of this Association iu 185(5 in three papers, one of them highly

elaborate ; and in these he showed that the morphology of vertebrate animals could

not be correctly studied while reference was made exclusively to the skeleton. He

showed the necessity of attending to all the evidence in trying to exhibit the under-

lying laws of structure, and especially of having constant regard to the teachings of

embryology. Among the matters of detail which he set right it may be mentioned

that he exposed the unteuability of Professor Owen's theorj' of the connexion of the

shoulder-girdle with the occipital bone, and pointed out that the limbs were not

appendages of single segments corresponding with individual vertebras. Referring

to the development of the hand and foot, he showed the importance of observing

the plane in which they first appear, and that the thumb and great toe are originally

turned toward the head, the little finger and little toe toward the caudal end of the

vertebral column. But he probably went too far in trj'ing to make out an exact

correspondence of individual digits with individual vertebral segments, failing to

appreciate that the segmentation originally so distinct in the primordial vertebra

--becomes altered as the surface of the body is approached a truth illustrated in the

vertebral columns of the plagiostomatous fishes, iu the muscle-segmeuts over the

head in the pleuronectids, and in the interspinal bones bearing the dorsal and anal

fin-rays of numbers of fishes, but, so far as I know, not hitherto sufficiently appre-

ciated by any anatomist.

Goodsir also exploded, one would have thought for ever, the erroneous theory of

the correspondence of the mammalian tympanic plate with the quadrate bone of

birds and the suspensorium of fishes, directing attention to the neglected but just

appreciation by St.-Hilaire of the homological importance of the ossicles of the ear,

and to the embryological work of Meckel and Heichert. But undoubtedly he fell

into great mistakes of his own in matters of detail connected with the exceedingly

diificult question of the correspondence of the bones of the skull, the principal of

these probably being an unfortunate notion that the f/reat frontal of fishes was a

bone which disappeared from the skulls of mammals, a notion which spread its

influence over his determination of a number of other elements, and introduced a

confusion which made his paper on the skull hard to understand.

In 1858 I'rofessor Huxley delivered his Croonian Lecture on the vertebrate

skull, and in 1863 his lectures at the Royal College of Surgeons on the same sub-

ject. He profited by the wisdom of Goodsir, and studied tlie works of Rathko,

Reichert, and other embryologists. But, rightly or wrongly, he took a step further

than Goodsir. He assumed from the first that the homologies of adult structures

could be determined by development, and that by that study alone could they be

finally demonstrated. As regards the skull, the constitution of which always

remains the central study of the vertebrate skeleton, his writings marked the intro-

duction of a period of revulsion against not only the systems of serial homologies

previously suggested, but even against any attempt by the study of the varieties of

adult forms to set them right. Mr. Huxley has added materially to the previously

existing number of interpretations as to what elements correspond in different

animals, and in doing so has found it necessary to make various additions to the

alreadj' troubled nomenclature. Those who consider these changes correct will of

com-se see in them a prospect of simplicity to future students ; but to those Avho,

like myself, have never been able to agree with them, they are naturally a source

of sorrow. Among the changes referred to may be mentioned the theory of the

" jieriotic bones." That theory I venture to think a very imfortunate one, intro-

ducing a derangement of relations as wide spread as did Goodsir's theory of the

frontal bone. And do not think me presumptuous in saying so, seeing that this

theory is in antagonism with the identifications of every anatomist preceding its

distinguished originator, not excepting Cuvier and Owen ; nor is it easy to dis-

cover what evidence it has to support it ngainst the previouisly received decision

of Cuvier as to the external occipital and inastoid of fishes. A^'ithout entering into

tlie full evidence of the subject; it may be stated that, so far as this theory affects

the alisphenoid in the skull of the fish, it must be given up, and the determination of

Professor Owen must be reverted to, when it is considered that in the carp the third

and fourth nerves pierce what that anatomist terms the orhitosphenoid, the bone which

is alisphenoid according to the theory which terms the alisphenoid of Owen the

Aprootic.  proof still more striking is furnished by Malaptertirus and other Silurids,

in which the bone in question is pierced by the optic nerve. That being the case,

the prootic theorj' will be seen to have arisen partly from giving too much impor-

tance to centres of ossification, and partly from considering the nerve-passage iu

front of the main bar of the alisphenoid of Owen as corresponding with t\\Q fora7nen

Aovale of man rather than with the foramen rotimdam and sphenoidal fissure.

spiculum, however, separatino;' the second from the third division of the fifth nerve,

and having therefore the precise relations of the mammalian alisphenoid, does exist

in the carp and other fishes. But in reptiles Professor Huxley's determination of

the alisphenoid is right, and Professor Owen's clearly wrong ; for in the crocodile

the alisphenoid of Huxley and others is perforated by the sixth nerve, so that it

cannot liave any claim to be called orbitosphenoid. I must, however, maintain against

Prof. Huxley's view Prof. Owen's determination of the nasal in fishes, notwith-

standing that Prof. Owen has failed to appreciate the exact relation of that bone

to the nasals of mammals, and has thereby laid his position open to attack. The

arguments on that point Prof Huxley was good enough to lay before the public

fourteen years ago, by kindly reading for me before the Royal Society a paper

which subsequently appeared in its 'Transactions;' and I am not aware that any

one has since attempted to controvert them.

I shall not trouble you further with such matters of detail ; but it will be clear

from wliat has been said that the beginner in comparative anatomy must at

the present day find himself at the outset, in the most important part of his osteo-

logical studies, faced with a diversity of opinion and confusion of nomenclature

sufficient to produce much difficulty and to have a repelling effect on many minds.

Such difficulties might well be encoimtered with enthusiasm wliere a belief existed

that behind them lay a scheme of order and beauty; but not many will spend time

investigating such intricate details if they doubt the interest of the general con-

clusions likely to be reached by mastering them. On this accoimt it is a gi-eat pity

that the scepticism generated partly by the difficulties of the subject, and partly by

reaction from the dogmatism of the admirers of Oken, does too frequently dis-

courage the investigation of the serial homologies of the parts entering into the

segments of the skull, and the detei-mination of the nature and number of those

segments. It is a pity that so much clamour has been made for a number of years

against the expression " vertebral theory of the skull," because fighting against

words is but stupid warfare at the best, and because all that was really meant, and

that could be justly stated, could have been brought into prominence without ob-

jectingto a time-honoured phrase. It is questionable if any one who ever used the

convenient term " vertebral theory " meant to indicate more than a certain com-

munity of plan on which were built the segments of the skull ns well as those of

the spinal column ; that, in fact, the two constituted one complete chain, of which
the first few segments were so different from the rest that, till Okeu pointed the

fact out, it was not recognized that thej' were segments lying in lineal continuitj^

--with the rest. But the matter has recently stood thus : that to some minds, in the

imperfect state of our knowledge, one thing seemed essential to a segment compa-

raWe with the    rest, and   to  tohtihse,rtshsatomtehtehoibnjgecetlosressteoetmheedprherqausiesi"tev;eratnebdratlhethoedodiiyty"

of the position  of affairs  is

have been as crotchet}^ in setting up imaginary essentials to a segment as their

neighbours. On the one side we were taught to expect certain definite osseous

elements in each segment, to which definite names were given ; while, on the other,
in opposition schemes, centres of ossification have been built on as matters of pri-

mary consequence, altliough a glance at the modifications in the vertebral column

proper might convince any one that they are things of the very slightest impor-

tance morphologically. Also those who have objected to speaking of cranial ver-

tebras have put great importance on the point at which the chorda dorsalis termi-

nates, although it has been long known that in one animal the chorda dorsalis runs

right on to the front, that in others it fails to enter the skull at all, while in the

majority it passes for a cei-tain distance into the base. Johannes Miiller, on such

grounds, concluded, thirty years ago, that the presence of chorda dorsalis was not

necessary to constitute a cranial vertebra ; and there seems no reason to doubt that

he was right. Looldng at the early embryo, the cerebro-spiual axis is seen to be

one continuous sti-ucture ; and the walls of the canal containing it are likewise mani-

festly continuous, not at fii'st distinguishable into a spinal and a cranial portion.

Looking at the adult condition, in the higher classes tlie vertebrae of the tail are

seen dwindling into mere bodies developed round the chorda dorsali,'^, and giving

off' rudimentary processes without separate centres of ossification, while towards

the head the bodies diminish and the arches enlarge ; and in the skull the chorda,
round which the bodies in the rest of the column are developed, comes to an end,

and the neural fvrches are enormously enlarged and have additional centres of ossi-

fication, precisely as in the mammalian thorax costal centres of ossification are

foimd which do not exist in the costal elements of cervical vertebrte. It would

therefore be quite as justifiable to object to the term vertebra as applied to a joint

of the tail because it has no kimince, or none with separate centres of ossification,

as to object to its applicability to segments of the skull because the chorda is ab-

sent, or the osseous elements difterent in number from those found usu.ally in the

segments of the trunk.

However, it is gi-atifjang to observe that among the most recent additions to

morphological anatomy there is a highly suggestive paper by Professor Huxley,

appearing in the Royal Society's ' Proceedings ' for December last, and entitled

" Preliminary Notes upon the Brain and Skull of Amphioxits lanccolatus" in whicli

the learned Professor, who has for many years been the most determined opponent

to the mention of cranial vertehrre, declares, so far as I can apprehend his meaning,

that the region of the head represents no less than fourteen segments, all of which

ho terms protovoiebree in Amphioxus. This determination of correspondences is

made the more remarkable by being followed up with a suggestion that the nume-

rous protovertebrfe lying in front of the fom-teenth in Amphioxus are represented

only by muscles and nerves in the higher vertebrates.

I hail this paper as being practically at la=t an ample acknowledgment that

there is no escape from admitting the correspondence of the region of the head with

the segments of the trunk : but the details of the new theory scarcely seem con-

vincing ; andll might have prefen-ed to leave its discussion to others, were it not
that the notions which it opens up are far too important to allow it to be passed

over in any account of the present state of opinion on the subject of vertclirate

morphology. The argument in this new theory runs thus : that the palate-curtain

of Amphioxus is homologous with that of the lamprey, and that the palate-curtain

of the lamprey is attached below the ear ; th.at therefore all the seven segments

seen in front of the palate-curtain of Amphioxus are represented nv parts in front

                                                                                                                   "11*
--140 REPORT 1875.

of the ear in the lamprey and the other Vertebrata. Again, the branchial arches of

the higher Vertebrata arc assumed to be of the nature of ribs, and in none of the Ver-

tebrata next above Amphioxus " are there more than seven pairs of branchial arches,

so that not more than eight myotomes (and consequently pro to vertebrse) of ^?h-

2)hio.vus, in addition to those already mentioned, can be reckoned as the equivalents

of the parachordal region of the skull in the liigher vertebrates." Every thing,

observe, depends on the segment to which the palate-curtain oi Amplnoxus belongs.

Now I have already' pointed out to you that the segmentation of the vertebrate

body is not perfect ; and there is no method by which the alimentary canal, of

which the mouth and palate are the first part, can be divided into segments cor-

responding with the cerebro-spinal nerves. Most certainly we cannot judge that a

portion of a viscus belongs to a particular segment from its lying underneath some

other structure in definite relation, like the ear, to the cerebro-spinal system ; for

then should we be obliged to grant that one half or more of the heart belongs to

segments in front of the ear, since it is undoubtedly so situated in a chick of the

thirty-sixth hour. But the branchial arches are in front of the heart, and, accord-

ing to the theory which we are considering, are behind the ear ; thus the principle

assumed in the starting-point of the theory is taken away.

Again, it is important to observe that the branchial skeletal arches cannot be

ribs, for they lie internal to the primary circles of the vascular system formed by

the branchial arteries and veins, while the ribs are superficial to both heart and

aorta. If the ribs are represented at all in the branchial apparatus (and I doubt it

very much), it is by the cartilages superficial to the gills in sharks, rays, and dog-

fishes                              and it would seem impossible for any one who has dissected thera to doubt
                                 ;

that those cartilages are homologous with the branchial skeleton of the lamprey,

which they somewhat resemble. In fact if the external and internal branchial

openings of the lamprey be enlarged, its gills are reduced to a form similar to those

of the shark.

There is notliing in this, however, which interfei-es seriously with the proposed

theory of the skull. It is merely a point in the argument which I have thought

right to clear. More important it is to remark that, on the supposition that

numerous protovertebrae are represented in tlie region of the head, there are most

serious difficulties interfering with tlie idea that they are, as Professor Huxley
states, " represented only by muscles and nerves in the higher Vertebrata," and that

there is any correspondence between " the oculo-motor, pathetic, trigeminal, and

abducens nerves with the mitscles of the eye and jaws" and the regular nerves and

muscle-segments of the fore part o? Ami)hioxus. Even in the lamprey the eye-

balls are supplied with muscles similar to those to whicli, in other vertebrates, "the

oculo-motor, pathetic, and abducens are distributed ; and I find in the large species

that, notwithstanding this, the series of regular muscle-segments is continued over

the head, not indeed in the same way as in Mi.vine, but in a highly instructive and

cm'ious manner. The five foremost muscle-segments have their upper extremities

attached considerably in front of the nasal opening by a short tendon, which

touches its fellow in the middle line ; and extending thence in an outward and
backward direction fhey pass behind the eyeballs, the first two running in front

of the first gill-pouch, and the, third lying over it. Therefore, in this instance, as

surely as the nostril is in front of tlie eye, so surely the upper extremities of these

muscle-segments are shifted forwards out of their morphological place, probably in

connexion with the great protrusion of the jaws for the physiological pui-pose of

forming a sucker. There is no escape from granting this shifting, even were it

possible to believe that the eyeball coidd be further forward than the nostril ; for

while the fifth nuiscle-segment can be traced in front of the nostril, the sixth

occupies the interspace between the skull and fii-st vertebra, so that if the muscle-

segments are taken as a ^de, the whole skull, forward to the nostril, belongs to

one intersegmental space, a view which is clearly absm'd. The succeeding inter-

muscular septa correspond each with a cartilaginous vertebral arch ; and it is

interesting to observe that the branchial cartilages are not placed one for each

septum, like the fibrous representatives of ribs detectable within the septa ; for the
second cartilage is opposite the sixth sejitum, the third opposite the ninth, the

fourth opposite the eleventh, the fifth opposite the thirteenth, and the sixth and
TKANSACTIONS Ol' THE SKCTIOXS.                                    141

scvciitli opposite the fourteentli and fifteenth septa ; and this is one reason for
douhtiug that even these superlicial branchial cartihiges, though attached to the

vertebral column, are to be regarded as libs.

" It may be noticed as a wholesome symptom in anatomical speculation, that the
new theory which has led to these remarks is founded on arguments drawn alto-

gether from comparison of different species, and not from embryology, a very

remarkable circumstance as coming from one who so lately as last autumn reite-

rated in this Section his slowness to believe in reasonings founded on adult forms,

and even on " later development." The wisest know so little, that humanity must

be consent to gather information from every possible soiu-ce, and leave no set of

ascertained facts out of view in attempting to arrive at generalizations. If we had
before us all the adult anatomy of every species that ever lived on the earth, we
should only then have the record completed from which to frame a full system of
morphology ; and as matters stand we must translate embryological phenomena

with the aid of the series of adult forms, as well as translate the teachings of the

adult series with the aid of embryology. ·

  Falling back on my proposition, that the segments of the vertebrate body are

nowhere complete, and that segmentation at one depth may exist to a gi-eater ex-
tent than at another, I may mention certain embryological phenomena in the brain,

which have received too little attention, and which to some extent warrant belief
in a larger number of segments in the head than is usually admitted ; although I

do not see that they are necessarily at variance with that theory of seven segments
in every ossified sl-iull which I indicated in 18C>2. In the chick, in the middle of

the seciand day of hatching, already is the third cerebral vesicle divided into a

series of five parts, separated by slight constrictions, the first part larger-than those
which succeed, and the last part narrowing to the spinal cord. The auditory

vesicle lies opposite the constriction between the fourth and fifth parts. At the

end of the second day and dm-ing the third, these divisions assume dimensions

which give them a general appearance exceedingly similar in profile to the proto-
vertebrie of the neck. In the following day they exhibit a more complex appear-

ance, and after that the first compartment alone remains distinct as cerebellum,

while the divisions between the others disappear in the thickening of the cerebral

walls. In their first two stages, Mr. Huxley, whom I have already referred to so

often, has figured these crenations, but he has not, so far as I know, described

them.

   I may also direct attention to another embryological point, to which I referred
last year at Belfast as a probability. I speak now from observation. That which

is termed tlie first cerebral vesicle in the early part of the second day of hatching
of the chick, is an undifferentiated region of the brain from whicTi a number of
parts emerge successively from behind forwards. As early as the thirty-sixth hoiu*
the optic nerves can be traced, separated from the rest of the vesicle by distinct
elevations of the floor of the brain, reaching inwards to the constriction between

the first and second vesicles : and as early as this date the first trace of bifidity of
-- mythe brain in front may be discerned that bifidity which, to
                                                                  thinking, is only

one of several instances of longitudinal fission in the fore part of the head, the
trabeculse presenting another instance of the same thing, and the cleft between the

maxillary lobe and the part of the head above it a third ; while in the muscular

svstem such longitudinal cleavage or fission is common even in the trunk. In a
chick of the third or fourth day, when rendered very transparent, the optic nerves

can be seen extending from beneath the front of the optic lobes ; while in front of
the optic lobes there are placed in series from behind forwards a posterior division
of the first vesicle, an anterior division, the cerebral hemispheres, and the olfactory
lobes. Thus there is a large supply of material presented in the brain for the study
of segmentation ; the difficulty to be overcome by future inquiry and careful col-
lation of all available facts is to determine the value of the parts placed one in

front of another.

   Perhaps I have occupied time too long with matters involving a large amount
of technical detail ; but I trust that I may have, in some measure, illustrated that

both in aim and in accomplished work Anatomy is no mere collection of discon-
nected facts, no mere handmaid of the physician and surgeon, nor even of Phy-

sequences of phenomena, to take the highest place among the sciences as a guide

to PhUosopliy. One cannot help noticing the increased importance now given to

Natm-al-History studies as a part of education ; and it is worth while to note that

--it is most of all in Anatomy and Physiology that the close comrexions of matter

with mind are brought under review, Physiology exhibiting the relations of our
own mental being to our bodies, and Anatomy revealing a body of organized Nature,

   The people of Bristol do well to rally round their Medical School. They do well

to furnish it mth buildings suitable for the prosecution of all the Natural-History

studies which adhere to medical education ; and they do well to join with that
school a complete College of literature and science. Let us hope that they will
make it worthy of so wealthy and historic a city. But if they \^dll have their
medical school the success which in so flourishing a locality public enthusiasm

may well make it, and if they will have it aid as well as be aided by a school of
general education, let them follow the system latterly adopted in Oxford and

Cambridge, long carried out in the Universities of Scotland, and recognized, though

not in all instances sufficiently provided for, in Ireland. I^et Anatomy, human

and comparative, receive its place as an important and fundamental science. Let

thorough and adequate provision be made for its being taught as a science ; and
see that it do not, as in too many medical schools which shall be nameless, dege-

Address to the Department of Antliropology , By Geokre E,olle3ton, M.D.,

    F.B.S., F.S.A., Linacre Professor of Anatomy and Physioloyy, Oxford,

     Vice-President of the Section.

   Some few weeks ago Mr. James Pai-ker, of Oxford, invited me to visit your Somer-

setshu-e caves, in the company of the Warwickshire Natm-alists' and Ai'chaBologists'

rield Club. It struck me that I should do well, as I was to preside over the An-

 thropological Department at this British-Association Meeting, if I tried to learn as

much as I could of the relics and of the sm-roundings of the Prehistoric inhabitants

 of your neighbourhood ; and for this, as well as for other reasons, I gladly accepted
 the invitation. During that pleasant midsummer excursion I was more than once
 impressed with the similarity which its incidents bore to those of the undertaking in

 which we are now engaged, and, indeed, to those of the study ofAnthropology generally.

 First, the oi'ganization of the expedition had entailed some considerable amount
 of labour upon those who had charged themselves with that duty ; and, secondly,
 a thorough exploration of the recesses and sinuosities of the several caves which we
 explored devolved upon us not only a good deal of exertion, but even some slight
 amount of risk ; for the passages and galleries along which we worked our way were
 sometimes low and narrow, often steep, and nearly always slippery. Thirdly, the
 outline of the regions explored bore quite ditiereut aspects accordingly as we lighted
 them up or had them lit up for us in one or in another of several ditferent ways.

    If in any segment of these caves the outside daylight could anyhow find a zigzag
 way down some shaft into the interior, that segment wore a general aspect more
 comfortable to the eye, and so to the mind, than others not so illuminated. These
 latter regions again varied greatly inter se, according to the various artificial means
 employed for lighting them up. The means ordinarilj' used for this end made their
 outlines look a little colder and harder than the reality itself, cold and hard though
 this was ; whilst under certain other modes of illumination employed (it is true, only
 occasionally, and for purposes of efl'ect, not ex necessitate) (he self-same outlines
 looked somewhat Im-id. But, howsoever produced and howsoever afl'ectiug us, the
 light was light nevertheless, and, on the whole, we preferred it a good deal to the
 darkness. It is never well to press a metaphor too far nor too closely ; so I will

now lay aside my parable, though it admits of some further exteusion, and tako up

the actual business of the Department.

   It may be well to lay before the Department, first of all, the titles of a fewof the
principal subjects upon which we have papers prepared for us ; and after, or indeed

during the enumeration of these specimens of what will prove, I can assure you, a

very valuable series of nremoirs, we can proceed, as will be uatm-ally suggested, to

those general considerations with which it is customary to open the transactions of

such assemblages as ours.

   First among our contributors I must mention the President of the Loudon An-
thropological Institute, in which Institute the Ethnological Society of 1844 and
the Anthropological Societv of 1863 are imited. Colonel Lane Fox has told us
(Archffiologia, xlii. p. 45,1869) that it was whilst serving on the Subcommittee of

Small Arms in 1851 that he had his attention di-awn to the principle of continuity

by obser^-ing the very slow gradations of progi-ess that were taking place atthat
time iu the military weapons of our own country. Out of those labours of his on
that Subcommittee other benefits have arisen to the country at large, of which it is

not my province to speak. What I have to speak of is his suggestion, put out with

greater definiteness in his invaluable Lecture on Primitive Warfare, delivered be-

fore the United-Service Institution, June 5, 18G8 (p. 15), to the effect that hisfind at
Cissbury furnishes the links which were wanting to connect the Palasolithic with

the Neolithic Celt types. Su- John Lubbock* and Mr. Evans t have told us that
they do not see their wav towards accepting this view : and Mr, James Geikie,
who holds that the palteolithic deposits are of preglacial and interglacial age, is

almost necessitated, e.v hypothosi, to repudiate any such transition. He does so

(pp. 436-438 of his work on the Great Ice Age) in language which shows us that
Colonel Lane Fox's lecture just referred to, with its diagram No. 1 (pruited, it is
true, for private circulation), could not have met his eye. Colonel Lane Fox's

paper will relate to further explorations carried on at Cissbury during the present
vear by a Committee of the Anthropological Institute with the kind permission of
Major "Wisden, the owner of the soil. It will raise n-iore than one large question

for us to address om'selves to. I shall, when Colonel Lane Fox's paper comes before
the Department, contribute towards its discussion by showing a number of flints
from Cissbury, given me by my friend Mr. Ballard, of Broadwater.

    Mr. Peugelly will, on Monday, give us an account of the " Anthropological Dis-
coveries iu'kent's Cavern." A'more interesting subject will not often have been

treated in a more interesting manner.

   Polynesia and Australasia generally have always been an interesting field for the
anthropologist. Our recent acquisition of Fiji makes it doubly interesting to us

just now ; and a flood of literature has burst forth upon us to meet that interest.

    Professor Dr. Carl E. Meiuicke is to be heartily congi-atulated on having, in the
present year, brought out a work on the islands of the Pacific (' Die Inselnder
Stillen Oceans, eine geograpliische Monographie.' Erster Theil, Melanesien und Neu-
seeland. Leipzig, 1875), iu which he can, with not unbecoming pride, say that he
is still working upon the same principles which guided him nearly fifty years ago
in the composition of his works on the continent of Australia and the South-Sea

races. Though I possess Professor Meinicke's works, I am not as yet entirely in

possession of all his views ; but so far as I can see, they are well worthy of atten-
tion. I do not hesitate, however, at all in saying that the most important contri-
bution to the ethnology of Polynesia which has been made recently is the article
on that subject in the 'Contemporary Review ' for February 1873, by the Pev. S.

Whitmee, of Samoa. And I may say that I am not without hopes that we shall be

favoured with some papers upon the ethnology, anthropology, and future prospects
of the Polynesian race by other persons eminently qualified to spealc upon the sub-
iect, as having spent many vears usefully among them, and on the spot. I observe

that writers who have little respect for most things else, and by no means too much

for themselves, speak still with something like appreciation of the work dor.e in
those regions by the London Missionary Society ; and we here shall value highly

any papei-s which we may be favoured w'ith from men who have had such long and

such favourable opportunities for forming opinions on matters which touch at once

our national and our scientific responsibilities.

    What question can be of closer concernment than that of the possibility of rescu-

ing the inhabitants of Polynesia from that gi-adual sliding into extinction -which

some writers appear to acqiuesce in as the natural fate of such races. As a text for

our discussions upon tliis subject, I will here quote to the Department a passage

--from the continuation of Waltz's 'Anthropologic' by Dr. Gerland the author,

be it remembered, of a special Monograph upon the Causes of the Decrease and

D^dng-out of Native Eaces, which appeared in 18G8 ('Ueber das Aussterben der

Naturvolker,' Leipzig), and has been often referred to by writers on anthropology

since that year, and is referred to by himself in the passage I now lay before you.

It runs thus (' Anihropologie der Natm-volker,' von Dr. Theodor Waitz, fortgesetzt

von Dr. Georg Gerland, 1872, vol. ii. pp. 512, 513) :

   " The decrease of the Polynesian populations is not now going on as fast as it was

in the first half                                                     of  the  century                                                                                       it has in some localities entirely ceased, whilst in
                                                                                                                           ;

others the indigenous population is actually on the increase*. From this it is clear

that the causes for that disappearance of the native races which we discussed at

length in the little book above referred to, are now less or no longer operative.

For, on the one hand, the natives have adapted themselves more to the influences

of  civilization                                                      they are  not  so                                                                                      amenable  as  they were  at    first  to  the  action of
                                                                   ;

diseases, although we still from time to time have instances to the contrary' at the

present moment (see, for example, Ev. Miss. Mag. 1867, p. 300, Cheever, 295) [or,

Fiji]                      they have become more able to                                                                                                                     respond       to  the efforts  to  raise  their mental

and moral status than they were; and, with the advance of civilization, they have

begun to avail themselves more of the remedial agencies which it brings with it.
On the other hand, we cannot ignore the fact that the Europeans themselves, in
spite of many important exceptions, have iievertheless done a very gi'eat deal for the

natives, and are always doing more and more for them. Whilst" in this matter the

English Government deserves great praise, and whilst Sir George Grey has done

more for the Polynesians than almost any other man, the missionaries nevertheless

stand in the very first rank amongst the" benefactors of these races, with their un-

wearied selfp«acrificing activity                                                                                                                                            and Eussel (' Polynesia,' Edinb., 1840) is entirely
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

right in saying that all the progress which the Polynesians have made was really

set on foot bv;^ the missionaries. They have had the gi-eatest influence upon the

civilization of the natives ; they have taken their part and protected them when

they could                                                    they have further      given them the                                                                                        fast  foothold,  the new fresh object,

motive, and meaning for their whole existence, of which they stood so muclu in

need. The Polynesians have often declared to the missionaries, ' If you had not
come, we should have perished ;' and they would have perished if their country had

not been so discovered. The resources of their physical life were exhausted ; and
they had none of the moral nor ideal support for the needs of their spiritual nature
which they stood so urgently in need of, as they had already attained a grade of

culture too high to allow of their living without some support of that kind. It is

true that extraneous circumsiances have often, especially in the outset, brought

about their conversion-- as, for example, the authority of their chiefs, the force of
example, as also, on the other hand, the occurrence of misfortune, great mortality,

the loss of a battle, after which they wished to make the experiment of worshipping

a new god (Russel, pp. 386, 390). And it is also true that the missionaries have in-

tioduced them to an exceedingly bigotled and often little-elevated form of Christi-

anity                      but even this has                                    been a fortunate circumstance;                                                                                        for  just the comprehensi-

of the native races. Mr. Murray, having spent forty years in Polynesia, has the best possible

right to be heard upon it.

bility, the plain appeal to the senses, of this new religion took hold of the imagination
of these races, and they could take hold of it with their understanding ; and how-

soever it may have been put before them, it was immeasurably above the level of
heathenism, and considerably above that of Mahommedanism. Whatever the
dogmas taught were, the ethics of Christianity were taught with them ; and in

most cases the missionaries gave, at the same time, in their lives striking examples

of the value of those ethics ; and the fact of their mauitenauce and exemplification
was the main thing.''

Mr. Bagehot has been quoted by Mr. Darwin, in his ' Descent of Man,' ed. 1,

vol. i. p. '239, ed. 2, p. 182, as saying that " it is a curious fact that savages did not

formerly waste away before the classical nations, as they do now before the modern

civilized nations ; had they done so the old moralists would have mused over the

event ; but there is no lament in any writer of that period over the perishing bar-

barians." On reading this for the first, and indeed for a second time, I was much

impressed with its beauty and originality ; but beauty and originality do not im-

press men permanently unless they be coupled with certain other qualities. And I

wish to remark upon this statement, first, that it is exceedingly unsafe to argue

from the silence of any writer, ancient or modern, to the non-existence of the non-

mentioned thing. I do not recollect any mention in the ancient writers of Stone-

henge, nor can I call to mind at this moment any catalogue of the vocabidaries of

the Cimbri and Teutones, of the Ligures and Iberians, with whom the ancients were

brought into prolonged contact. These little omissions are much to be regretted, as,

if they had been filled up, a great many very interesting problems would thus have
been settled for us which we have not as yet settled for oiu-selves. But these omis-
sions do not justify us in thmkiug that Stonehenge is an erection of post-Roman

times, nor in holding that any of the strauge races mentioned were devoid of a

language. But, secondly, what we know of the classical nations dates from a time
when the " merciless bronze " had beg-un to give way to the " dark gleaming " steel.

But long before the displacement of bronze weapons by iron ones, the bronze had

had abundant time to displace both stone weapons and the people who used them.
And it is plain enough to suggest that one reason why the old moralists did not

muse over the disappearance of the aboriginal races lies in the fact that these races
had neither a contemporary Homer to sing their history, nor an Evans to interpret

their weapons after their extinction. The actual Homeric poems deal with a region

thickly peopled and long subdued by a Greek-speaking metal-using race. Rhodes

and Crete were as dift'erent then from what Fiji and New Guinea are now, as Me-

rion and Idomeneus are from Thakombau and Rauparahu. But, thirdly, let us ask,

as the philosophers did with regard to the fish and its weight in and out of the

bucket of water. Are the facts about which we are to inquu-e really facts? Now I

am not going to plunge into the excm'suses appended to editions of Herodotus, nor
to discuss the history of the Minyffi, or of any other race of which we know as

little. But I will just quote a few verses from a beautiful passage in Job which

appear to me to give as exact a description of a barbarous race perishing and out-

cast, as could be given now by a poetical observer in Australia or California.

Speaking of such a race the poet says :

" For want and famine they were solitary, fleeing into the wilderness in former

Whotime desolate and waste.  cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots

for their meat. They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as

after a thief ;) To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the

rocks.  Among the bushes they brayed under the nettles they were gathered to-
                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

gether. They were children of fools, yea, children of base men ; they were viler

th.an the earth" (Job, chap. xxx. ver. 3-8).

   I opine that these unhappy .savages must have "wasted away" under these con-

ditions, and that there is no need, with such actual vera; canssa at hand, to postu-

late the working of any " mysterious " agency, any inscrutable poisonous action " of

the breath of" civilization. What is mysterious to me is not civilization, but the

fact that people who are in relation with it do not act up to its behests. And what

is the mystery to me is not how an epidemic can, when introduced amongst helpless

Polynesians, work havoc, but how it is that epidemics should be allowed to do so

Wehere in England from time to time.         are but some four years away from the last

 small-pox epidemic, of the management, or rather mismanagement, of which I had

myself some little opportunity of taking stock ; and what we saw then in England

renders it a little superfluous to search for recondite causes to account for depopula-

tion in coimtries without Local Boards. You owe much in Bristol to your able, en-
ergetic, and eminently successful officer of health, Dr. David Davies. I hope he may

favour us with his views upon this very interesting subject, and may, knowing, as

he well does, how much energy and knowledge are rec[uired for the reduction of a
rate of mortality, tell us how much wickedness, perversity, and ignorance are neces-

sary for increasiiag such a rate, whether in Great or in Greater Britain. I think that
he will tell us that what is mysterious is not the power of the principles of action

I have just mentioned, but the toleration of them. Such, at least, are my views*.

  We have several philological papers promised us. Amongst them will be one

by the Rev. John Earle, who is linown to you in this neighbourhood as living near
Bath, and who is known to people not so pleasantly situated on the earth's surface
as you are, as the author of a Handbook of the English tongue. I shall, as he will be

present hereafter to speak on philology, spare myself and you the trouble of any
remarks on that truly natural science, observing merely that Dr. Farrar t and Pro-
fessor Hackel X are both agreed upon one point, namely that the adoption of natiual-
history metliods by the students of languages has opened up for them a fresh career
of importance and interest and usefidness.

    Somersetshire is not without its historian ; and the possibility of his coming reu-

der.s it unad\dsable for me to say any thing now as to the relation of histoiy to our

subject upon the present occasion. If, however, the Department can find time to

listen to me a second time, I shall be glad to read a short paper myself upon this

very subject, mainly in the hope of getting Mr. Freeman to speak upon it also.

   I come now (perhaps I should have come before) to the consideration of the sub-
ject of craniology and craniography. Of the value of the entu-ety of the physical

history of a race there is no question ; but two very widely opposed views exist as
to the value of skull -measuring to the ethnographer. According to the views of one
school, craniography and ethuogi'aphy are all but convertible terms ; another set

of teachers insist upon the great width of the limits within which normal human
crania from one and the same race may oscillate, and upon the small value which,
imder such circumstances, we can attach to differences expressed in tenths of inches
or even of centimeti-es. As usual, the ti-uth will not be found to lie in either ex-
treme view. For the proper performance of a craniogi-aphic estimation, two ^ery
different processes are necessary : one is the carrying out and recording a number of

measurements ; the other is the artistic appreciation of the general impressions as to
contour and type which the survey of a series of skulls produce upon one. I have
often thought that the v/orli: of conducting an examination for a scholarship or

--fellowship is very similarly 'dependent, when it is properly carried out, upon the

employment of two methods one being the system of marking, the other that of
getting a general impression as to the power of the several candidates ; and I would

    * Since I wrote as 'above, we have received the news of the miu-der of Commodore
Goodeuough at Santa Cruz. Commodore Goodenough was one of those persons to have
met whom makes a man feel himself distinctly the better for his interviews and inter-

course. He was not only a typical representative of what is called " Armed Science," he
not only possessed the eye to watch and the arm to strike, happilj' so common in our two

services, but he added to all this a cultivation and refinement duly set forth and typified
by manners which were

                                                               " not idle but the fruit

                                     Of loyal nature and of noble mind."

   It is indeed a "puzzling world," as it has been forcibly phrased, in which such a man
loses his life, and wc lose liis power for good, through the act of what Wordsworth calls

                       A" savage, loathsome, vengeful, and impure."

Still Corfe Castle is near enough to Bristol to prevent us from forgetting tliat we oui--
selves were once as treacherous and murderous as the modern Papuans, and that less than
900 years ago. If we have improved, there is hope for them.

wish to be understood to mean by this illustration not only that the two lines

of inquiry are both dependent upon the combination and counterchecking of two
different methods, but also that their results, like the results of some other Immau

investigations, must not bo always, eveu though they maybe sometimes, considered

to be free from all and any need for qualification. Persons like M. Broca and Pro-

fessor Aeby, who have carried out the most extensive series of measm-ements, are

not the persons who express themselves in the strongest language as to cranio-

graphy being the universal solvent in ethnography or anthropology. Aeby, for

example, in his ' Schadelformen der Meuschen imd der Alien,' 18G7, p. Gl, says :
" Aus dem gesagteu geht hervor, dass die Stellung der Anthropologic gegeuiiber

den Schadelformen eiue ausserordentlich schwierige ist ;" and the perpetual contra-

diction of the results of the skuU-measm-ements carried out by others, which his paper

(published in last year's ' Archiv fiir Authropologie,' pp. 12, 14, 20) abounds iu,

furnishes a practical comuientarj^ upon the just quoted words. And Broca's words

--are especially worth quoting, from the ' Bulletin de la SociettS d'Anthropologie de

Paris,' Nov. G, 1873, p. 824 : " Dans I'etat actuel de nos connaissances la cranio-

logie ne pent avoir la pretention de voler de ses propres ailes, et de substituer sea

diagnostics aux notions fournies par I'ethnologie et par I'archeologie."

   I would venture to say that the way iu which a person with the command of a

considerable number of skulls procured from some one district iu modern times, or

from some one kind of tumulus or sepulchre in prehistoric times, would naturally

address himself to the work of arranging them in a museum, furnishes us with a

concrete illustration of the true limits of craniography. I say ''a person with the

command of a considerable number of skulls ;" for, valuable as a single skull may

be, and often is, as furnishing the missing link in a gradational series, one or two
skulls by themselves do not justify us (except in rare instances, which I will here-

inafter specify) iu predicating any thing as to their nationality. Greater rashness has

never been shown, eveu in a realm of science in which rashness has only recently

been proceeded against under an Alien Act, than iu certain speculations as to the im-

migration of races into various corners of the world, based upon the casual disco-

very iu such places of single skulls, which skulls were identified, on the ground of

their individual characters, as having belonged to races shown on no other evidence

to have ever set foot there.

It is, of course, possible enough for a skilled craniographer to be right in referring

even a  single  skull to some particular nationality                                                                                                                                                                an Australian or an Eskimo, or
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

an Audamauese might be so referred with some confidence ; but all such successes

should bo recorded with the reservation suggested by the words, uhi cormn qui
periencnt ? and by the English line, " the many fail, the one succeeds." They are

the shots which have hit, and have been recorded. But if it is unsafe to base

craniographer thus fortunate casts his eye over the entire series, and selects from

it one or more which correspond to one of the gi-eat types based by Retzius not

merely upon consideration of proportionate lengths and breadths, but also upon

the artistic considerations of type, curve, aud contour. He measures the skulls

thus selected, and so furnishes himself with a check which even the most practised

eye cannot safely dispense with. He then proceeds to satisfy himself as to whether

the entire series is referable to one alone of the two great tyjiical forms of

Brachycephaly or Dolichocephaly, or whether both types are represented in it,
and if so, in what proportions and with what admixture of intermediate forms.

"With a number of Peruvian, or, indeed, of Western American skulls generallj-, of
Australian, of Tasmanian, of Eskimo, of Veddah, of Andamaneso crania before him,

the craniographer would nearly alwaj-s, setting aside a few abuormally aberrant

(which are frequently morbid) specimens, refer them all to one single type *.

   * It is not by any means entirely correct to say that there is no variety observable
among races living in isolated savage purify. The good people of Baden who, when they
first saw them, said all the Bashkirs in a regiment brought up to the Rhine iu 1813 by the*
Russians were as like to each other as twins, found, in the course of a few weeks, that
they coidd distinguish them readily and sharply enough (see Eeker, ' Crania Germaniip

Matters would he very different wlien the craiiiographer came to deal t^'itll a

mixed race like our own, or like the population of (Switzerland, the investigation

into the craniology of which has resulted in the production of the invaluable

' Crania Helvetica ' of His and Riitimeyer. At once, upon the first inspection of

a series of crania, or, indeed, of heads, from such a race, it is evident that some are

referable to one, some to another, of one, two, or three typical forms, and tliat a

residue remains whose existence and character is perhaps explained and expressed

--by calling- them " Mischformen." Then arises a most interesting question Has the

result of intercrossing been such as to give a preponderance to these " Miscii-

formen?" or has it not rather been such as in the ultimate resort, whilst still

testified to by the presence of intermediating and interconnecting links, to have

left the originally distinct forms still in something like their original independence,

and in the possession of an unoverwhelmed numerical representation ? The latter

of these two alternative possibilities is certainly often to be seen realized within

the limits of a modern so-called "English" or so-called "British" family; and

His has laid this down as being the result of the investigations above-mentioned

into the Ethnology of Switzerland. At the same time it is of cardinal importance

to note that His has recorded, though only in a footnote, that the skulls which

combine tlie characters of his two best-defined types, the " Sion-Typus " to wit,

and the " Diseutis-Typus," in the " Mischform " Avhich he calls " bion-Disentis

Mischlinge," are the most capacious of the entire series of the " Crania Helvetica,"

exceeding, not by their maximum onlj', but by their average capacity also, the

corresponding capacities of every one of the pure Swiss types *. Intercrossing,

therefore, is an agency which in one set of cases may operate in the way of

enhancing individual evolution, whilst in another it so divides its influence as to

allow of the maintenance of two types in their distinctness. Both these results are

of equal biological, the latter is of preeminent archreological interest. Retzius t
was of opinion, and, with a few qualifications, I tliiuk, more recent Swedish

Ethnologists would agree, that the modern dolichocephalic Swedisli cranium was

very closely affined to, if not an exact reproduction of the Swedish cranium of the

Stone Period                                                               and "S^irchow J  holds that the modern brachycephalic Danish skull is
                                                                        ;

similarly related to the Danish skull of the same period. There can be no doubt

that the Swedish cranium is very closely similar indeed to the Anglo-Saxon ; and
tlie skulls which still conform to that type amongst us will be by most men supposed

to be the legitimate representatives of the followers of Hengest and Horsa, just as

the modern Swedes, wnose counti-y has been less subjected to disturbing agencies,

must be held to be the lineal descendants of the original occupiers of their soil.

I am inclined to think that the permanence of the brachycephalic stock and type

in Denmark has also its bearing upon the Ethnography of this country. In the

Eound-Barrow or Bronze Period in this country, sub-spheroidal crania (that is to

say, crania of a totally different shape and type from those which are found in

exclusive possession of the older and longer Barrows) are found in great abundance,

sometimes, as in the South, in exclusive possession of the sepulchre, sometimes iu

company, as in the North, with skulls of tlie older type. The skulls are often

strikingly like those of the same type from the Danish tumuli. On this coinci-

dence I should not stake much, were it not confirmed by other indications. And

foremost amongst these indications I should place the fact of the " Tree-interments,"

as they have been called (interments, that is, in coffins made out of the trunk of a

tree), of this country, and of Denmark, being bo closely alike. The well-known

Mr. Bates, practised in the discrimination of zoological differences, express themselves
as struck rather with the amovmt of unlikeness than with that of likeness which prevails
amongst savage tribes of the greatest simplicity of life and the most entire freedom from
crossing with other races. But these observations relate to the living heads, not to the

skulls.

mouoxylic coffin from Gristliorpe contained, together with other relics closely

similar to the relics founil at Treenhoi, in South Jutland, in a similar coffin, a skull

which, as I can testify from a cast given me by my friend Mr. H. S.llarland,

might very well pass for that of a brachycephalic Dane of the Neolithic period.

Canon Greeuwell discovered a similar monoxylic coffin at Slripton, in Yorkshire

--and two others have been recorded from the same county one from the neigh-

bourhood of Driffield, the other from that of Thornborough. Evidence, again, is
drawn fi-om Col. Lane Fox's opinion that the earthworks which form such striking
objects for inquiry here and there on the East-Riding Wolds must, considering
that tlie art of war has been the same in its broad features in all ages, have

been thrown up by an invading force advancing from the east coast. Now we

do know that England was not only made Euo;land by immigration from that
corner or angle where the Cimbric Peninsula joins the main land, but that long
after that change of her name this country was successfully invaded from that
Peninsula itself. And what Swegen and Cnut did some four hundred and fifty

years after the time of Ilengist and Horsa, it is not unreasonable to suppose other

warriors and. other tribes from the same locality may have done perhaps twice or
thrice as many centuries further back in time than the Saxon Conquest. The
huge proportions of the Cimbri, Teutones, and Ambrones are just what the skeletons
of 'the British Round-Barrow folk enable us now to reproduce for omselves. It is
much to be regretted that from the vast slaughters of Aqute Sextia; and Vercellffi,

no relics have been preserved which might have enabled us to say whether Boiorix
and his companions had the cephalic proportions of Neolithic Danes, or those very

diffiirent contours which we are familiar with from Saxon gi-aves throughout
England, and from the so-called "Danes' graves " of Yorkshire. Whatever might

be the result of such a discovery and such a comparison, I think it would in
neither event justify the application of the term " Kymi-ic " to the particular form

of skull to which Retzius and Broca have assigned it.

    Some years ago I noticed the absence of the brachycephalic British type of skull

from an extensive series of Romano-British skulls which had come into my hands;
and subsequently to my doing this, Canon Greenwell pointed out to me that such

skulls as we had from late Keltic cemeteries, belonging to the comparatively

 short period which elapsed between the end of the Bronze Period and the estab-

lishment of Roman rule in Great Britain, seemed to have reverted mostly to the

 priJe-Bronze dolichocephalic type. This latter type, the " kumbecephalic type '' of

 Professor Daniel Wilson, manifests a singular vitality, as the late and much

--lamented Professor Phillips pointed out long ago at a Meeting of this Association

 held at Swansea the dark -haired variety, which is very ordinarily the longer-

 lieaded and the shorter-statured variety of our countrymen, being represented in very

 groat abimdauce in those regions of England which can be shown, by irrefragable

 and multifold evidence, to have been most thoroughly permeated, imbibed, and

 metamorphosed by the infusion of Saxons and Danes, in the districts, to wit, of

 Derby, Leicester, Stamford, and Loughborough. IIow, and in what way, this type

 of man, one to which some of the most valuable men now bearing the name of
 Englishman, which they once abhorred, belong, has contrived to reassert itself, we
 may, if I am rightly informed, hear some discussion in this department. Before
 leaving this part of my subject I would say that the Danish type of head still sur-

 vives amongst us ; but it is to my thinking not by any means so common, at least in

 the Midland counties, as the dark-haired type of which we have j ust been speaking.
 And I would add that I hope I may find that the views which I have here hinted

 at will be found to be in accord with the extensive researches of Dr. Beddoe, a

 gentleman who worthily represents and upholds the interests of Anthropology in
 this city, the city of Prichard, and who is considered to be more or less dis-
 qualified for occupying the post which I now hold, mainly from the fact that he

 has occupied it before, and that the rules of the British Association, like the laws

 of Eno-land, have more or less of an abhorrence of perpetuities.

    The largest result which craniometry and cubage of skulls have attained is,

 my --to thinldiig, the demonstration of the following facts, viz. : first, that the

 cubical contents of many skulls from the earliest sepultures from which we have

 any skulls at all, are larger considerably than the average cubical contents of
--150 REPORT 1875.

modern European skulls ; and secondly, that the female skulls of those times did

not contrast to that disadvantage with the skuUs of their male contemporaries

which the average female skulls of modern days do, when subjected to a similar

comparison *. Dr. Thurnam demonstrated the former of these facts, as regards

the skulls from the Long and the Round Barrows of Wiltshire, in the Memoirs of

the London Anthropological Society for I860 ; and the names of Les Eyzies and
Cro-Magnon, and of the Caverne de I'Homme JMort, to which we may add that of

Solutre, remind us that the first of these facts has been confirmed, and the second

both indicated and abundantly commented upon by M. Broca.
   The impression which these facts make upon one, when one first comes to realize

them, is closely similar to that which is made by the first realization to the mind of

the existence of a subtropical Flora in Greenland in Miocene times. All our antici-

pations are precisely reversed, and in each case by a weight of demonstration

equivalent to such a work ; there is no possibility in either case of any mistake
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

a!ul we acknowledge that all that we had expected is absent, and that where we

had looked for poverty aud pinching there we come upon luxurious and exuberant

growth. The comparisons we draw in either case between the past and the present

are not wholly to the advantnge of the latter : still such are the facts. Philologists

will thank me for reminding them of Mr. Chauucy AVrighfs brilliant suggestions

that the large relative size of brain to body which distinguishes, aud always, so far

as we know, has distinguished the human species as compared with the species most

nearly related to it, may be explained by the psychological tenet that the smallest
proficiency in the faculty of language may " require more brain power than the

greatest in any other direction," aud that " we do not Jiuow and have no means

of knowing what is the quantity of intellectual power as measured by brains wliich

even the simplest use of language reqvdres " t-

And for the explanation of the preeminently large size of the brains of these

omparticular representatives of  species, the tenants of prehistoric sepulchres, wo

have to bear in mind, first, that they were, as the smalluer;s of their nimibers and

the largeness of the tumuli lodging them may be taken to prove, the chiefs of their

tribes; and, secondly, that modern savages have been known, and prehistoric

savages may therefore be supposed, to have occasionally elected their chiefs to their

chieftainships upon gronuds furnished by their superior fitness for such posts--that

is to sav, for their superior energy aud ability. Some persons may find it difllcidt

to belieVe this, though such facts are deposed to by most tlioroughly trustworthy
travellers, such as Baron Osten Sacken (referred to by Von Baer, in the Report of

the famous Anthropological Congress at Gottingen in 18G1, p. 22). And they

--may object to accepting it, for, among other reasons, this reason to wit, that

Jlr. Galton has shown us in his ' Slen of Science, their Nature and Nm-ture,' p. 98,
that men of great energy aud activity (that is to say, just the very men fitted to act

as leaders of and to commend themselves to savages)! ha-^e ordinnrly smaller-sized

heads than men possessed of intellectual power dissociated from those qualities.
   The objection I specif}-, as well as those which I allude to, may have too nmch

weight assigned to them ; but we cau waive this discussion and put our feet on

firm ground when we say that in all savage communities the chiefs have a larger

--share of food and other comforts, such as there are in savage life, and have con-

sequently better and larger frames or, as the Rev. S. A^'hitmee puts it (/. c), when
observing on the fact as noticed by him in Polynesia, a more " portly bearing."

This (which, as the size of the brain increases witliin certain proportions with the

increase of the size of the body, is a material fact in eveiy sense) has been testified

   * The subequality of the male and female skulls in the less civilized of modem races

was pointed out as long ago as 1845, by Eetzius in Miiller's ' Archiv,' p. 89, and was com-
mented upon by Huschke, of Jena, in his 'Schadel, Hirn uiid Scele,' pj). 48-51, in 1854.

   t The biblio'gi'apher will thank me also for poiutiiig out to him that the important

paper in the 'North-American Eevicw,' for October, for 1870, p. 295, frcm which I

have just quoted, has actually escaped the wonderfully exhaustive research of Dr. 8eid-

litz (see his ' Darwin'sclie Tbeorie,' 1875).

   t An interesting and instructive story in illustration of the kind of qualities which
do recommend a man to savages, is told us by Sir Bartle Frere in his pamphlet,

to by a uuiltitude of other observers, and is, to luy mind, one of tlie most dis-

tiuctive mai'ks of savagery as opposed to civilization. It is only iu times of

civilization that men of the puny stature of Tydeiis or Agesilaus are allowed their

proper place in the niauagemeut of affairs. And men of such physical size,

coupled with such mental calibre, may take comfort, if they need it, from the

jiirely quantitative consideration, that large as are the individual slaills from pre-

I-listoric graves, and high, too, as is the average obtained from a number of them, it

has ne\'ertheles3 not been shown that the largest individual skulls of those days were

larger than, or,  indeed, as  large as  the  best  skulls  of our  own  days                         whilst the
                                                                                                  ;

high average capacity which the former series shows is readily explicable by the

very obvious consideration that the poorer specimens of humanity, if allowed to live

at all in those days, were, at any rate, when dead not allowed sepulture in the

"tombs of the kings," from which nearly exclusively we obtain our prehistoric

crania. M. Broca* has given us yet further ground for retaining our self-com-

placency by showing, from his extensive series of measurements of the crania from

successive epochs in Parisian burial-places, that the average capacity has gone on

steadily increasing.

   It may be suggested that a large brain, as calculated by the cubage of the skull,
may nevertheless have been a comparatively lowly organized one, from having its

molecular constitution qualitatively inferior "from the nemoglia being developed to
the disadvantage of the neuriue, or from having its convolutions few and simple,

and being thus poorer in the aggregate mass of its grey vesicular matter. It is
perhaps, impossible to dispose absolutely of either of these suggestions. But, as re-

gards the tirst, it seems to me to be exceedingly improbable that such could have

been the case. For in cases where an overgTowth of neuroglia has given the brain
increase of bullc without giving it increase of its true nervous elements, the Scotch
proverb, " Muckle brain, little wit" applies; and the relatively inferior intelligence

of the owners of such brains as seen nowadays may, on the principle of continuity,
be supposed to have attached to the owners of such brains in former times. But
those times were times of a severer struggle for existence than even the present ; and
inferior intelligences, and specially the inferior quickness and readiness observable

iu such cases, it may well be supposed, would have fared worse then than now.

There is, however, no need for this supposition ; for, as a matter of fact, the brain-
case of brains so hypertrophied t has a very readily recognizable shape of its own,
and this shape is not the shape of the Cro-Magnon skidl, nor indeed of any of the

Prehistoric skulls with which I am acquainted.
   As regards the second suggestion, to the effect that a large braiucase may have

contained a brain the convolutions of which were simple, broad, and coarse, and

which made up by consequence a sheet of grey matter of less square area than that
made up in a brain of similar size but of more complex and slenderer convolu-
tions, I have to say that it is possible this may have been the case, but that it seems
to me by no means lilcely. Very large skulls are sometimes found amongst collec-
tions purporting to have come from very savage or degraded races ; such a skull

may be seen in the London College of Surgeons with a label, '' 5357 D. Bushman,
G. Williams. Presented by Sir John Lubbock ;" and, from what Professor
Marshall and Gratiolet have taught us as to other Bushman brains, smaller, it is
true, in size, we may be inclined to thinlc that the brain which this large skull once
contained may nevertheless have been much simpler in its convolutions than a

European brain of similar size would be. This skull, however, is an isolated

instance of such proportions amongst Bushman skulls, so far, at least, as I have

been able to discover ; whilst the skulls of Prehistoric times, though not invariably,
Aare yet most ordinarily large skulls.
                                             large brain with coarse convolutions puts

its possessor at a disadvantage in the struggle for existence, as its greater size is not

compensated by greater dynamical activity ; and hence I should be slow to explain

Memoires, vol. i. p. 348, 1871.

  t I may, perhaps, be allowed to express here my surprise at the statement made by Messrs.

Wilks and xMoxon, in their very valuable Pathological Anatomy, pp. 217, 218, to the effect

that they have not met with such cases of Cerebral Hypertrophy. They were common
enough at the Children's Hospital iu Great Ormond Street when I was attaclied to it.

the large size of ancient skulls by suggesting that they contained brains of this

negative character. And I am glad to see that M. Broca is emphatically of this

--opinion, and that, after a judicious statement of the whole case, he expresses himself

thus (Revue d'Anthropologie, ii. 1, 38) : " Rien ne permet done de supposer que

les rapports de la masse encephalique avec I'intelligence fussent autres chez eux que

chez nous."

It is by a reference to the greater severity of the struggle for existence and to tlie

lesser degree to which the principle of division of labour was carried out in olden

days that M. Broca, in his paper on the Caverne de I'Homme Mort just quoted

from, explains the fact of the subequality of the skulls in the two sexes. This is

an adequate explanation of the facts ; but to the facts as already stated, I can add

from my own experience the fact that though the female skulls of Prehistoric times

are often, they are not always equal, or nearly, to those of the male sex of those

times                         and, secondly,  that  whatever  the  relative size  of the head, the limbs  and
                           ;

trunk of the female portion of those tribes were, as is still the case with modern

savages, very usually disproportionately smaller than those of the male. This is

readily enough explicable by a reference to the operations of causes exemplifica-

tions of the working of which are unhappily not far to seek now, and may be

found in any detail you please in those anthropologically interesting (however

otherwise unpleasant) documents, the Police Reports.

  Having before my mind the liability we are all under fallaciously to content

om-selves with recording the shots which hit, I must not omit to say that one at

least of the more recently propounded doctrines in Craniology does not seem to me

to be firmly established. This is the doctrine of " occipital dolichocephaly " being

a characteristic of the lower races of modern days and of Prehistoric races as com-

pared with modern civilized races. I have not been able to convince myself by my

own measurements of the tenability of this position and I observe that Ihering
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

has expressed himself to the same effect, appending his measurements in proof of

his statements in his paper, " Zur Reform der Craniometrie," published in the

' Zeitschrift flir Ethnologic ' for 187.3. The careful and extensive measurements of
Aeby * and Weisbacli t have shown that the occipital region enjoys wider limits of

oscillation than either of the other divisions of the cranial vault. I have some regret

in saying this, partly because writers on such subj ects as "Literature and Dogma" have

already made use of the phrase, "occipitally dolichocephalic," as if it represented one

of the permanent acquisitions of science ; and I say it with even more regret, as it

concerns the deservedly honom'ed names of Gratiolet and of Broca, to whom Anthro-
pology owes so much. What is true in the doctrine relates, among other things, to

what is matter of common observation as to the fore part of the head rather than to any

thing which is really constant in the back part of the skull. This matter of com-

mon observation is to the effect that when the ear is " well forward " in the head,

Nowwe do ill to augur well of the intelligence of its owner.                      the fore part of the

brain is irrigated by the carotid arteries, which, though smaller in calibre during

the first years of life, during which the brain so nearly attains its full size, than they

are in the adult, are nevertheless relatively large even in those early days, and are

both absolutely, and relatively to the brain which they have to nourish, much larger

than the vertebral arteries, which feed its posterior lobes. It is easy therefore to

see that a brain in which the fore part supplied by the carotids has been stinted of

due supplies of food, or however stunted in growth, is a brain the entire length and

breadth of which is likely to be ill-nourished. As I have never seen reason to believe

in any cerebral localization which was not explicable by a reference to vascular irri-

fation, it was with much pleivsure that I read the remarks of Messrs. Wilks and

loxon in their recently published ' Pathological Anatomy,' pp. 207, 208, as to the in-

dications furnished by the distribution of the Pacchionian bodies as to differences

existing in the blood-cun-ents on the back and those on the fore part of the brain.

These remarks are the more valuable, as mere hydraulics, Professor Clifton assures

me, would not have so clearly pointed out what the physiological upgrowths seem

to indicate. Anj' increase, again, in the length of the posterior cerebral arteries is

pro tunto a disadvantage to the parts they feed. If the blood-cun-ent, as these

facts seem to show, is slower iu tlie posterior lobes of the braiu, it is, upon

purely phj'sical principles of eudosuiosis aud exosiuosis, plain that these seg-

ments of the brain aro less efficiout organs for the mind to work with; aud

here agiin "occipital dolichocephaly " would have a justification, though one

founded on the facts of the nutrition of the brain-colls, not on the proportions of

the braincase. In many (but not iu all) parts of Continental Europe, agaiu, the

epithet "longheaded " would not have the laudatory connotation which, thanks to

our Saxon blood, and in spite of the existence amongst us of other varieties of

dolichocephaly, it still retains here. Aud the brachycephalic head which, abroad*

at least, is ordinarily a more capacious one, and carried on more vigorous shoulders

and by more vigorous owners altogether, than the dolichocephalic, strikes a man

who has been used to live amongst dolichocephali by nothing more forcibly,

when he first comes to take notice of it, than by the nearness of its external ear to

the back of the head ; and this may be said to constitute an artistic occipital
brachycephalism. But this does not imply that the con-s-erse condition is to be

found conversely correlated, nor does it justify the use of the phi-ase " occipital

dolichocephaly " in any etymological, nor even in any ethnographical sense.

I shall now content myself, as far as craniology is concerned, b}- an enumeration of

some at least of the various recent memoirs upon the subject which appear to me to
be of preeminent value. And foremost amongst these I will mention Professor

Cleland's long and elaborate scientitic aud artistic paper on the Variations of the

Human Skull, which appeared iu the Philosophical Transactions for 1809. Next I

wiU name Eckers admu-able, though shorter, memoir on Cranial Curvature, which

appeared iu the ' Archiv fiir Anthropologie,' a jom-nal already owing much to his

labours, iu the j'ear 1871. Aeby's writings I have already referred to, and Ihering's,

to be found in recent numbers of the 'Archiv fiii- Anthropologic' and the

'Zeitschiift fiir Ethnologic,' deserve yom- notice. Professor BischofTs paper on

the Mutual Relations of the horizontal circumference of the Skidl and of its con-

tents to each other and to the weight of the Brain, has not, as I think, obtained the

notice which it deserves. It is to be found in the Proceedings of the Royal

Society of Mimich for 1864, the same year which witnessed the publication of

the now constantly quoted ' Crania Helvetica,' of Professors His and Riitimeyer.

Some of the most important results coutaiued in this work, and much important

matter besides, was made available to the exclusively English reader by Professor

Huxley, two years later, in the ' Prehistoric Remains of Caithness.' I have made

a list, perhaps not an exhaustive one, but containiug some dozen memou-s by Dr.

Beddoe, and having read them or nearly all of them, I can with a very safe con-

science recommend you all to do the like. I can say nearly the same as regards

Broca and Virchow, adding that the former of these two savans has set the other

two with whom I have coupled him an excellent example, by collecting and pub-

lishing his papers in consecutive volumes.

   But I should forget not only what is due to the place in which I am speaking,
but what is due to the subject I am here concerned with, if in speaking of its

literatin-e, I omitted the name of your own townsman, Prichard. He lias been

called, and, I think, justly, the " father of modern Anthropology." I am but put-

ting the same thing in other words, aud adding something more specific to it,
when I compare his works to those of Gibbon and Thirlwall, and sslj that they

have attained and seem likely to maintain permanently a position and importance

commensurate with that of the "stately aud undecaying"' productions of those

great English Historians. Subsequently to the first appearance of those histories

other works have appeared by other authors, who have dealt in them with the

same periods of time. I have no wish to depreciate those works ; their authors

have not rarely rectified a slip and corrected an error into which their great prede-

cessors had fallen. Nay, more, the later comers have by no means neglected to

avail themselves of the advantages which the increase of knowledge and the vast

Eolitical experience of the last thirty years have put at their disposal, and they
  ave thus occasionally had opportunities of showing more of the true proportions

and relations of even gi-eat events and catastrophes ; still the older works retain a

lasting value, and will remain as solid testimonies to English intellect and English

capacity for large undertakings as long as our now rapidly extending language and

literature live. The same may be most truthfully said of Prichard's ' Researches
into the Physical History of Mankind.' An increase of knowledge may supply us

with fresh and with stronger arguments than he could command for some of the

great conclusions for which he contended ; such, notably, has been the case in the
question (though " question " it can no longer be called) of the Unity of the human

species ; and by the employment of the philosophy of continuity and the doctrine

of evolution, with which the world was not made acquainted till more than ten

years after Prichard's death, many a weaker man than he has been enabled to bind

into more readily manageable burdens the vast collections of facts with which he

--had to deal. Still his works remain, massive, impressive, enduring much as the

headlands along our southern coast stand out in the distance in their own grand

outlines, whilst a close and minute inspection is necessary for the discernment of

the forts and fosses added to them, indeed dug out of their substance in recent

times. If we consider what the condition of the subject was when Piichard

addressed himself to it, we shall be the better qualitied to take and make an esti-

 mate  of  his  merits.  This Prichard has himself described to us, in a passage to be

.

found in the preface to the third volume of the third edition of the ' Physical

History,' published in the year 1841, and reminding one forcibly of a similar

iitterance of Aristotle's, at the end of one of his logical treatises (Soph. Elench.

cap. xxxiv. G). These are his words :

" No other writer has surveyed the same field, or any great part of it, from a

similar point of view. . . . The lucubrations of Herder and other diffuse writers of

the same description, while some of them possess a merit of their own, are not con-

cerned in the same design, or directed towards the same scope. Their object is to

--portray national character as resulting from combined influences physical, moral,

and political. They abound in generalizations, often in the speculative flights of a

discursive fancy, and afford little or no aid for the close induction from facts, which

is the aim of the present work. Nor have these inquiries often come within the

view of writers on GeogTaphy, though the history of the globe is, very incomplete

Awithout that of its human inhabitants."   generation has scarcely passed away

since these words were published in 1841 ; we are living in 1875 yet what a change
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

has been effected in the condition of Anthropological literature ! The existence of

such a dignified quarterly as the ' Archiv fiir Anthropologic,' bearing on its titlepage

in alphabetical order the honoured names of V. Baer, of Desor, of Ecker, of Hellwald,

of His, of Lindenschmidt, of Luca3, of Riitimeyer, of Schaafhausen, of Semper, of

Virchow, of Vogt, and of Welcker, is in itself perhaps the most striking evidence

of the advance made in this time, as being the most distinctly ponderable and in

every sense the largest Anthropological publication of the day.

Ai-chgeology, which but a short time back was studied in a'way which admirably

qualified its devotees for being called "connoisseurs," but which scarcely qualified

them for being called men of Science, has by its alliance with Natural History

and its adoption of Natural-History methods, and its availing itself of the light

afforded by the great Natural-History principles just alluded to, entered on a

new career. There is, as regards Natural History, Anatomy, and Pathology,

nothing left to be desired for the conjoint scheme represented by the periodical just

mentioned, where we have V. Baer for the first and Virchow for the last, and* the

other names specified for the rest of these subjects ;· whilst Archajology, the other

party in the alliance, is very adequately represented by Lindenschmidt alone. But
when I recollect that Prichard published a work ' On the Eastern Origin of the Celtic

Nations ' ten years before the volume of ' Researches,' from which I have just quoted,
and that this work has been spoken of as the work " which has made the greatest

advance in Comparative Philology during the present century," I cannot but feel

that the Redaction of the 'Archiv fiir Anthropologic ' have not as yet learnt all that

may be learnt from the Bristol Ethnologist ; and they would do well to add to the

very strong staff" represented on their titlepage the name of some one, or the names
of more than one comparative philologist. This the Berlin 'Zeitschrift ' has done.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                             155

A'athi'opologj to some of the prevalent errors of the day, I should he glad to be

allowed to say a few words. The most important lesson as regards the future (I do

not say tlie immediate future) which the modern study of Human Progress (for such
all men who think, except the Duke of Argyll, are now agreed is the study of An-

thropology) teaches is the folly and impossibility of attempting to break abruptly

with the past. This principle is now enforced with persistent iteration from many

Anthropological platforms; and I cannot but think it might adveintageously be

substituted in certain portfolios for the older maxim, " Whatever is certainly new is
certainly ftilse," a maxim which seems at tirst sight somewhat like it, but which, as

being based on pure ignorance of the past and teaching only distrust of the future,

is really quite different from it. I am not sure that Prichard ever put forward the

former'of these two doctrines, though it is just the doctrine which would have
commended itself to his large philosophical, many-sided, well-balanced judgment.

--He died in 1848 the very year which perhaps, of all save one in history, and that

one the year 1793 (a year in" which he was yet a child), showed in the most palpable
way the absurdity of attempting to make civilization by pattern, and of hoping to
produce a wholesome future in any other way than that of evolution from the past.

   What have been called the senile, what could equally well have been called the

cynical Ethics of Pessimism, had not in Prichard's time found any advocates in
this country ; indeed, so far as I have observed, they are of a more recent importa-
tion than riiost other modern heresies. I do not deny that at times it is possible to

give way to certain pressing temptations to think that we are living in a certainly

deteriorated and a surely deteriorating age, and that it is hopeless and useless to

set up, or look up to, aspirations or ideals. When, for example, we take stock of the
avidity with which we have, all of us, within the last twelve months read the me-
moirs of a man whom one of his reviewers has called a " high-toned aristocrat,"
but whom I should call by quite another set of epithets, we may think that we are
not, after all, so much the better for the 3000 years which separate us from the time
when it was considered foid play for a man to enact the part of a familiar friend,

to eat of another man's bread, and then to lay great wait for him. Or can we, in these
days, bear the contrast to this miserable spectacle of mean treachery and paltiy
disloyalty, which is forced upon us in the same history by the conduct of the chi-
valrous son of Zeruiah, who, when he bad fought against Rabbah and taken the

citv of waters, sent for his king who had tarried in Jerusalem, lest that city should
thenceforward bear the name, not of David, but of Joab ? Or again, as I have
been asked, have we got very far above the level of sentiment and sympathy

which Helen, an unimpeachable witness, tells us the Trojan Hector had attained

to and manifested in his treatment of her,

                              " With tender feeling and with gentle words " ?

Would the utterances of any modern epic poet have so surely brought tears into

the eyes of the noble-hearted boy depicted by Mr. Hughes, as the passage of Homer

just alluded to, and characterized by liim " as the most touching thing in Homer,

perhaps in all profane poetry put together " ? What answer can be made to all

this by those who maintain that the old times were not better than these, who

maintain the docti-ine of Progress, and hold that man has been graduiilly improving

from the earliest times, and may be expected to go on thus advancing in the future ?

--An answer based upon the employment of simple scientific method, and upon the

observance of a very simple scientiiic rule upon, to wit, the simple method of taking

averages, and the simple rule of enumerating all the circumstances of the case.

Noble actions, when we come to coimt them up, were not, after all, so very common

in the olden times ; and side by side %vith them there existed, and indeed flourished,
intertwined with them, practices which the moral senseof all civilized nations has now

definitely repudiated. It is a disagreeable task, that of learning the whole truth ; but

it is imfair to draw dark conclusions as to the futm'e, based on evidence di-awn from an
Aexclusive contemplation of the bright side of the past.
                                                          French work, published

only last year, was recommended to me recently by an eminent scholar as containing
a good account of the intellect uxl and moral condition of the Romans imder the

Empire. I liave the boolc, but have not been able to liud in it any mention of the

gladiatorial shows, though one might have thought the words Panem et Circenses
                                                                                                12*

might have suggested that those exhibitions entered as factors of some importance

into the formation of the Roman character. It is impossible to go beyond that in

the way of looking only at the bright side of things. Still -we ourselves have

less difficulty in recollecting that there were 300 Spartans sacrificed to the law-

abiding instincts of their race at Thermopylae, than in producing, when asked for

them, the numbers of Helots whom Spartan policy massacred in cold blood

not so many years after, or those of the Melians and Mitylenseans whom the

polished and cultivated Athenians butchered in the same way, and about the same

whomtime, with as little or far less justification for doing so. Homer,  I have

above quoted, lived, it is true, some centuries earlier, but living even then he might

have spared more than the five words contained in a single line (176 of ' Iliad' xxiii.)

to express reprobation for the slaughter of the twelve Trojan youths at the pyre of

Patroclus. The Romans could applaud Terence's line, " Homo sum, humani nihil

a me alienum puto ;" but it did not strike them till the time of Seneca that these

noble words were incompatible with the existence of gladiatorial shows, nor till

the time of Honorius did they legally abolish those abominations. Mutinies and

rebellions are not altogether free from unpleasant incidents even in our days ; but

the execution of 6000 captives from a Servile war, in the way that Crassus executed

his prisoners after the final defeat of Spartacus, viz. by the slow torture of cru-

cifixion, is, owing to the advance of civilization, no longer a possibility. If the

road from Capua to Rome witnessed this colossal atrocity, there are still preserved

for us in its near neighbourhood the remains of Herculaneum and Pompeii to show

us what foul broad-daylight exuberance could be allowed by the public conscience

of the time of Titus and Agricola to that other form which sits " hard by Hate."

The man who in those days contributed his factor to the formation of a better

{(ublic opinion, did so at much greater risk than any of us can incur now by the

ike line of action. Much of what was most cruel, much of what was most foul

in the daily life of the time, had, M. Gaston Boissier notwithstanding, the sanction

of their state religion and the indorsement of their Statesmen and Emperors to

support it. There was no public press in other lands to appeal to from the falsified

verdicts of a sophisticated or a terrorized community. Though then as now,

" Mankind were one in spirit,"

freedom of intercommunication was non-existent ; no one could have added to the
words j ust quoted from Lowell their complemental words,

                                           " And an instinct bears along,
                " Sound the earth's electric circle the swift flash of right or wrong.''

  --The solidarity of nations had not, perhaps could not have been dreamt of the

physical prerequisites for that, as for many another non-physical good, being

wanting.

   Under all these disadvantages men were still found who were capable of aspi-

ration, of hope for, and of love of better things ; and by constant striving after their

own ideal, they helped in securing for us the very really improved material, mental,
and moral positions which we enjoy. What they did before, we have to do for
those who will come after us.

    General Hemarls on the Geological Structure and Flora of the Mascarene

                        Islands. By I. Batlet Balfour, D.Sc.

   The geological structure of the principal islands of the Mascarene group, viz.
Bourbon, Mauritius, and Rodriguez, was briefly described. These islands are all
of volcanic origin, the rock being chiefly a very dark compact basalt. Each island,

however, has not been altogether formed at one period. This fact is particularly
well illustrated in Bourbon, where the N.AV. portion is of more ancient date than
the S.E., in which latter part there exists at present an active volcano. Consequent
on this difference of age the rocks are of a diflerent character ; and this has a corre-
sponding effect upon the vegetation of the two districts. These differences are
such as characterize the flora of a dry as opposed to a moist region.

   The type of the Mascarene flora was shown to be Indian, although the islands
are nearer to the African continent than to India ; and the comparative absence of
endemic types was indicated.

    After detailing several facts regarding resemblances betwixt the floras of the
islands, and a brief reference to their fauna existing and extinct, the author indi-
cated the bearings of the geological structure and of the flora upon the question of
the separate origin of the islands, or of their being merely fragments of a preexisting
continent which also embraced Madagascar and the Seychelles.

        On an Abnormality of Primxila vulgaris with Interpetaline Lobes.
                              By Prof. A. Dickson, M.D.

   The abnormal flowers exhibited were collected in 1874 at Pitlochrie, Perthshire,
by the late Professor Inglis, of Aberdeen. The peculiarity consists in the develop-
ment of five narrow petaloid segments, which alternate with the lobes of the corolla.

These are not organs simply adherent to the inner surface of the corolla-tube like
" epipetalous " stamens, but their bases form a continuous sheet of tissue with the

petals. At first sight the abnormality appears to resemble the " doubling " of the

primrose often seen in cultivation. In the ordinary double primrose, however, the
additional petaloid lobes are metamorphosed stamens, and are opposite to (not
alternate with) the lobes of the corolla. In the abnormality exhibited the super-
added petaloid pieces are simply interpetaline lobes analogous to the intersepaline

lobes of Nemophila, Campanula medium, &c. One of the most interesting points
connected with this is that in the order Primulaceee we have a genus, Soldanella, in
which interpetaline lobes occvir. In S. montana, for example, the limb of the
corolla exhibits five broader lobes, which are trifid, and five nan-ower ones, which
are entire. The five trifid lobes represent the petals proper, while the five entire
ones are interpetaline lobes. In the monstrous Primula we have thus an abnor-
mality imitating, so to speak, the normal condition of an allied genus.

On a Monstrosity in Saxifraga stellaris. By Prof. A. Dickson, M.D.

The plant from which the specimens exhibited were obtained was found bv

Dr. A. P. Aitken, of Edinburgh, in July last, on Ben Challum near Tyndrum. It

had three flowering stems, which about their middle exhibited a few scattered

nan-ow bracts with what appear to be viviparous buds in their axils. Each of

these stems is terminated by a monstrous flower, with somewhat numerous sepals

in several series.  Petals absent ;  stamens about as many as the sepals                                                                                                                                                                        and a vast

not unfrequently found terminating the inflorescence of Digitalis purpurea, where

we have a multiplication of the parts of the floral envelopes and andrcecium, and a

pistil composed often of several whorls of cai-pels.

    On a Variety of Poljpodium vulgare. By Prof. "W. E. M^Nab, M.D.

   Dr. M'^Nab exhibited and described an abnormal frond of the common polypody
{Polyjiodhmi vidgare) which had been given him by Captain Jones, of Pembroke

Koad, Clifton, Bristol, and in whose magnificent collection the plant producing it
was grown. The plant had been gathered in a wild state by Captain Jones, and
bas been cultivated by him for some time. The leaf was about nine inches long,

and may be briefly described as a combination of the variety camhricum and the
typical "form. The basal pinna was bipinnatifid, the segments of the first order being
so deeply cut as to be pinnatipartite. The first lower pinnule (left) of the basal
pinna was divided like the main portion of the pinna. The second pinna (right)

was similarly divided, but larger than the first, the first lower pinnule being very
much divided. The third pinna (left) was pinnatipartite, with pinnatifid divisions

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and this pinna, unlike the first and second, had the basal pinnule very small. The
fourth pinna (right) is below almost undivided, like normal P. ridgare, but with the
upper two thirds divided. The next pinna is on the right side and is normal ; there
is a space on the opposite side caused by the displacement of the fifth pinna (left),
which is exceedingly small and undivided. The seventh pinna (right) is normal.
The seventh and ninth pinnoe are close together and much divided, the eighth
(right), which is normal, being succeeded by a series of normal pinnte. The upper

part of the leaf is covered with sporangia, while the lower abnormal portion is not
fertile. Another leaf was shown which was entirely bipinnatifid.

   In these lea-ses the normal basifugal and apical mode of growth was observable.
The pinnse at the base assumed somewhat the form of the upper part ; and it was
evident that long-continued growth, apical and basifugal, had taken place, in the
lower pinnules, the greater portion of which were tender and delicate, and showed
a marked contrast in texture to the upper fertile part of the leaf.

   Hofmeister has shown that the branching of fern-leaves is dichotomous, the right
and left fork-branches being alternately developed as a pinnule, and a sympodium
or false axis produced by the other branches. In Tohjimdhnn rulgare a single
central pseudaxis is produced, while in the abnormal form just described the lower
pinuEe become sympodially developed ; and in two cases the first pinnule of each
has a well-marked sympodial development.

            On a Variety of Eubus. By Prof. W. R. M*-Nab, M.D.

   This Rtihts was discovered by Captain Jones, of Clifton, in the neighbourhood of
Bristol. It is a variety with very narrow leaves, not unlike the fern-leaved beech.
The leaves are trifoliate, the terminal leaflet being the largest, the two lateral
ones very small and poorly developed.

   This fungus was one of four found growing on the ground in the interior of an
old hollow pollard-ash, in the grounds of the Earl of Egmont at Nork, near
Epsom, in Surrey, from which place Clavaria ardenia (Sow., pi. 215) also dates its
name. It was found by the exhibitor on December 12, 1872, and had not, he
was told, been met with for several years. The soil in the tree was very light

sandy mould scratched up by rabbits. The largest specimen was 12 inches in

height, and its pileiform volva 2J- inches across the top ; the whole was covered

with brown dust-like spores. The pileiform volva was on the exterior covered

with raised reticulations with pieces of the exterior volva adhering to it ; and on
the inner side next the stem it was smooth and of a paler colour, somewha"t

whitish.

The stem was rough and fibrous, of a woody nature, and slightly attenuated

upwai'ds ; it was buried 3 or 4 inches in the soil. At its base were the remains

or the lower part of the volva. All the plants were quite dry and covered very

thickly with the brown spores.

The largest specimen is in- the possession of Mr. Worthington G. Smith, who,

appreciating the rarity of the plant, has had it mounted under a glass, in the same

manner as a picture. The next best is deposited in the Museum at Kew, where it

receives the full benefit of the sun, which has, as might be expected, taken nearly

all the colour out of it. The Rev. M. J. Berkeley has the third specimen, and the

one exhibited has since been given to Mr. C. E. Broome for his herbarium. This

latter specimen was growing on the outside of the tree, out of which, through a

hole in the base, some of the soil had been scratched. It had not grown as well

as the others, which were straight, well-grown specimens, but was much twisted

and deformed. Every year since the finder has examined the spot, with the hope

of meeting with more specimens, but with as yet no result ; and last year the old

tree was cut down, being dead, so that the chance of obtaining more is considerably

lessened.

He has tried, as yet with no success, to raise the fungus artificially, by planting

some of the spores in a pot covered with a bell-glass and kept darlc in a warm

moist atmosphere, the soil consisting of a mixture of debris from an old ash mixed

with silver sand. An account of one of the specimens found, with figures, micro-

scopical structure, &c., was written by Mr. Worthington G. Smith in the ' Gardeners'

Chronicle ' of August 16, 1873 ; and a very good colom-ed drawing of it is to be seen

amongst Mr. W. G. Smith's collection of fungi di'awings in the British Museum

also in Sowerby's ' English Fungi,' t. 390, there is a drawing of the specimen.

    On some Fossil Seeds from tJie Lower Carboniferous Beds of Lancashire.
                          By Prof, W. C. Williamson, F.R.S.

   M. Adolphe Brongniart has recently described a number of fossil seeds obtained
by M. Cyril Grand Eury from the silicified Carboniferous deposits of St. Etienne,
in France. Some of these exhibited a remarkable cavity at the apex of each ortho-
tropous seed, enclosed within the testa and separating the latter structure from the
nucleus. This cavity appeared to M. Brongniart to have received into its interior
160 REPORT---1875.

the pollen-brains, since he found within it, in several instances, small foreign

hodies which bore a close resemblance to true pollen-grains. The author has dis-

covered seven similar though distinct species of seeds in the lower Coal-measures of

Lancashire and Burntisland. These seeds he described in detail. The most striking

of tliem is one to which he has assigned the name of Lagenostoma oviformis. This

is a small suboval seed, containing an almost spherical nucleus. Its external

covering consists of a hard dense cellular testa. This has had an opening in it

corresponding to the exostome of an ordinaiy seed, and which constituted the orifice

of a flask-shaped cavity, having a short narrow neck, and the base of which rested

in its normal state upon the upper extremity of the nucleus. This " lagenostome,"

as the author proposes to designate the cavity, is bounded by a bottle-shaped

membrane composed of a single layer of short prosenchymatous cells, and contained

a central mass of small delicate parenchymatous cells, which appear to have entirely

tilled the cavity when the seed existed as an o\Tjle. This lagenostome is enclosed

within a second and denser membrane, also composed of prosenchymatous cells,

but of larger size than those constituting the membrane of the lagenostome. The

outer investment hangs down from the inner margin of the micropyle like a fes-

tooned tent, and becomes merged at its lower margin, as is also the case with the

lagenostnmal membrane, with a verj' especial membrane enclosing the nucleus.
On making transverse sections of this part of the seed, the tent-like membrane just

described is seen to exhibit ten crenated curves, the concavities of which are

directed outwards. Between these conca'S'ities and the external testa a delicate but

large-celled parenchyma seems to have formed a feeble bond of union between the

two, whilst in the centre of the circle of which each crenulation is a portion is a

black speck, which has either formed an intercellular canal or a pillar of cellular

tissue more dense than that surrounding it. The crenulated curves referred to have

coiTesponded with the undulation in the wall of the lagenostome. In two examples

the interior of the latter organ contained several small bodies in close contact with

the nucleus, and which exhibited every appearance of being pollen-grains. The

nucleus itself is enclosed in a thin special membrane, full of small angular spaces,

which look as if they had been occupied by crystals.

To a second similar, yet very distinct seed, the author has assigned the name of

Physostoma eler/ans. In it the apical extremity of the nucleus contracts into a

mammillated projection, which appears to be pushed up into the base of the lageno-

stome, which thus looks like a bladder half full of fluid resting upon and overhanging

the end of a soda-water bottle. In this seed the lagenostome and nucleus are

further enclosed in a special uniform prosenchymatous layer of some thickness, and

which in all probability was again invested by some exotesta that is not preserved

in tlie solitary seed of this species hitherto met with.

Another species of seed the author designates Cmiostoina ; and a fourth, of a some-

what similar type, was obtained from Burntisland.

  A fifth species constitutes a very distinct type, having a dense parenchymatous

--exotesta, which has obviously been like that of the Salkhuria i. e. capable of

drying and shrinking, and thus giving to the section of it an irregular outline. To this

seed the author gives the name of Mnlaaitesta oblotiffa. Some remarkably tine speci-
mens of Cardiocarpon were also 'shown, exhibiting a central subconical nucleus,

each lateral margin of which swelled out into a rounded and prominent moulding.

This was enclosed by a delicate cellular endotesta and a much denser exotesta, both

of which were prolonged superiorly into a long slender beak-like appendage con-

Ataining the micropyle.                                                                                                 remarkable featiu'e of this seed was the large size of the

cells of the nuclear parenchyma. Like the Triffonocarpon, to some peculiarities in

the structure of which the author directed attention, all these seeds have obviously

been gymnospermous                                                                                                      and, from a recent communication  presented by M. Brong-
                                                                                                                     ;

niart to the Academy of Paris, there is reason to believe that all the seeds possessing

a lagenostome may have been Cycadean.

                        By Philip P. Carpenter, B.A., Ph.D.

   The writer showed that there were two parallel groups, the articulated or perfect
Chitons, and the non-articulated or inipert'ect Chitons. Each of these were natu-
rally divided again into regular and irregular forms, and these again into family,
generic, and subgeneric series. The palteozoic Chitons were all imperfect, and
culminated in the Carboniferous period ; very few are now living. The neozoic
epochs gradually developed perfect Chitons, which culminate at the present time.
The vrriter sought information as to unusual forms, recent or fossil.

On the Nervous and Generative Systems of the Crinoidea.

 On the Occurrence of Moa-hones in New Zealand. By Dr. H"ector, F.R.S.

On the Glassijication and Affinities of the Itotifera. By C. T. Hudson, LL.D.

   The author commenced by discussing Ehrenberg's classification of the Rotifera,
and showed by the help of illustrations and diagrams that its fundamental principles
were erroneous, for it was based on a supposed structure of the trochal disks which
really did not exist, on a forced interpretation of the term "lorica," and on the
presence, absence, and number of certain red spots, wJiich Ehrenberg always took
for granted to be ej'es, but which were not always so ; moreover, those that really
were eyes were often present in the young animal, but invisible in the adult.

    Ehrenberg's symmetrical system erred in both directions. It brought together

widely dissimilar forms, and separated those that were intimately connected. The
rival systems of Leydig and Dujardin were then discussed, and dismissed as inferior
to Ehrenberg's ; though it was pointed out that each naturalist had contributed a

--happy idea in making his unsuccessful attempt the former having brought into

f)rominence the great value of the foot as a characteristic for classification, and the
 after having hit upon the excellent notion of dividing the Rotifera into orders
according to their means of locomotion.

   Dr. Hudson then proceeded to re-classify the Rotifera according to a system of
his own, in which he availed himself of the labours of Ehrenberg, Leydig, Gosse,
&c., and arranged the creatures by means of their nervous, nutritive, and vascular

systems.

   The true position of the Rotifera was then discussed. It had long been disputed
whether they should be placed among the Vermes, or whether they should be
ranked as very hun\ble members of the Arthropoda. Leydig and Gosse had alwaj's
maintained the latter opinion, while the former was upheld by Cohn, Vogt, Huxley,
&c., and followed by the majority of modern naturalists. The various arguments
against the alliance of the Rotifera with the Arthropoda were severally met, and

--it was shown how recent discoveries had tended to lessen their value notably

that of PedaKon mirum, the six-legged rotifer, discovered by the author in a pond
near Clifton four years ago.

   Professor Huxley's reasons for considering the Rotifera to be permanent forms
of Echinoderm-larvae were then discussed. The Professor had asserted that the
Rotifera were in their forms divisible into two great groups, that, as far as it
was known, the one was monoecious and the other dioecious, and that a corre-
sponding division of form and sexual arrangements existed among the Echinoderms
in their larval state. " It is this circumstance," says the Professor, " which seems

to me 10 throw so clear a light upon the position of the Rotifera in the animal

series .... and hence I do not hesitate to draw "the conclusion that the Rotifera
are the permanent forms of Echinoderm-larvse."

   Dr. Hudson pointed out that his own discoveries had destroyed this argument,
for he had found the male forms of both groups.

   It was shown how closely Pedalion resembled one of the Entomostracous
larvae, and how it was connected by other aberrant rotifers with those of the

ordinary type ; and the conclusion was drawn that, if the Rotifera were arranged
according "to their complexity of structure, it wovdd be found that at the lower end
of the scale they would, through the PMlodines, be allied to the worms, and would
then form a gradually ascending series till at its upper end, through Pedalion, they
would be linked on to the Entomostraca.

       On certain Neglected Suhjects of Ornithological Investigation*.
               B^j Alfbed Newton, 3LA., F.R.S., V.-P.Z.S., Sfc.

To the author it seemed that ornithologists have of late been getting into certain

well-worn ruts to the abandonment of other tracks which equally deserve travelling

--upon. He has recently had to " take stock " of our ornithological knowledge, and

finds that the result on the whole is gratifying some branches of the study having

received much encouragement since the new views of Evolution were promulgated,
but others have remained in statu quo anti. Among the former are the Ditteren-

tiation of Species and Geogi-aphical Distribution ; but Developmental Osteology
(the department of science which in this country Prof Parker nas made his own)
still remains one in which the plenteous harvest has but few reapers, and is

earnestly recommended to young ornithologists. Descriptive Anatomy has fair
prospects ; and Fossil Ornithology receives as much attention in Britain as can be

expected from the scarcity of ornitholites ; but Pterylography is still far too little

thought of.

The greatest falling off" appears to be in Observational Ornithology, owing to the

out-of-door ornithologists trying each to find out every thing for himself, instead of

starting from the discoveries of our predecessors. The want of progress is most

plainly shown by observations on Migration, which are of exactly the same kind
as in Gilbert White's time, though there was then a special object now not needed.

No tabulation of such as have been made has been attempted, except by Von

Middendorff" (Die Isepiptesen Russlands. St. Petersburg : 1855) ; and consequently

what may come of it cannot be said. Partial migration, which is most likely to

reveal the cause of birds' movements, is still much neglected ; and no one in this

coimtry has tried to show the routes by which they migrate, a subject last year

ably treated by Palm^n (Om Foglarnes tiyttningsvagar. Helsingfors: 1874). The

step in advance taken by Knox more than twenty years ago has hardly been

maintained by other British observers, and thus very little has been done since

WeWhite's time.  cannot guess at the faculty by means of which migration is so

Weunerringly perfoi-med.  have no observed facts to tn-ge against Von Midden-

dorff" 's hypothesis, wild as it seems, that birds may be aware of the position of the

magnetic poles, so as to steer their course accordingly ; while Palmen's supposition

as to " experience " aifording a key to the mystery is insufficient; for experience
can only mean a recognition of landmarks, which is impossible in the case of birds

which travel by night or cross at one stretch 1000 miles of land or sea.
   The so-called " Laws of Plumage " have also been almost entirely neglected of

late.  Incidental remarks on Moulting are found here  and there                                        but no connected

series of observations on the subject generally, which might be profitably investi-

gated by those who have constant access to zoological gardens, while those who

keep tame birds might also afford efficient aid.

   The period of Incubation is a subject on which, with but very few exceptions,

we are quite ignorant. When it diners in two species so nearly allied as the
Pheasant and the Barndoor-fowl, we may be sure that some important cause exists

which has hitherto escaped us ; and the eff'ects, if any, of atmospheric temperature
on the development of the chick are equally imknown. Under 200 species breed

and with respect to foreign birds our ignorance is still more profound.

   The author stated that he might easily extend his remarks to other heads, but

perhaps this was enough. He looked rather to those who had not yet adopted any

special branch of research to prosecute the inquiries he recommended than to

ornithologists of experience who were occupied in their own line, though he

doubted not they would countenance the view he took.

angle of 45P,- the microscope to be placed horizontally. If used for drawing
(instead of the ordinary camera lucida ), the reflected image was received on a

inside or a thick cloth. For photographic purposes an ordinary photographic
camera was arranged, with a hole in the base instead of the end to receive the
microscope tube, the plate-holder being in a horizontal position. The exposure re-
quired for wet collodion plates, even with high powers, was stated to be very short.

In 1870-73 M. Wurtz, the Dean of the Ecole de M^decine in Paris, presented to

the French Academy of Science two important papers by M. F. Papillon. In those

papers it was shown that the phosphate of lime in bone is capable of being replaced

to a considerable extent by the phosphates of strontia, alumina, and magnesia. The

first experiments of M. PapiUon were commenced on Monday, September 6th,

1869. He took a young pigeon, shut it up in a cage, and fed it with wheat rolled

into a fine paste, and mixed with some phosphate of strontia and a solution of

chlorides, carbonates, sulphates, and nitrates of potash in the proportion of 1 _2

gramme to  the  litre of  distilled water                                                          a small quantity of hydrochloric acid was

   On the 16tli September, 1869, a white rat, six days old, was treated daily with

a decigramme of phosphate of alumina in a litre of distilled water, with rice and

Agluten. On the 29th November, 1809, the rat died suddenly of convulsions.

post mortem examination showed inflammation of the intestines, attributed to the
mechanical effect of nodules of phosphate of alumina. The rat was boiled in dis-
tilled water, and then boned. The bone-ash contained :

same conditions, except that in place of phosphate of alumina, phosphate of mag-
nesia was administered. This rat was killed on the 25th November, 1869, appa-
rently quite healthy. The bone-ash was found to contain :

There were only inappreciable traces of magnesia in the bones of the chicken

killed at the moment of its birth. The bones of all these animals had preserved

their ordinary aspect and physiological properties, and there was no disturbance of

the normal functions of the system. Bone-ash, as is known, consists of phosphate

of lime, with about two per cent, of phosphate of magnesia, and more or less car-

bonate of lime. The full importance of these experiments does not seem to have

been fully appreciated. It is not only shown that the food which is eaten afl'ects

the composition of the bones, but that mineral matter in dilute solution is capable

of being assimilated. The experiments are in fact experiments on different kinds
of artificial drinking-waters, and illustrate how profoundly the bodies of animals

are influenced by the mineral constituents of the water which they drink. They

seem to show that the effect of altering the composition of the water-supply of a

community might involve questions of vast importance to the organic structure of

the human body, if the very composition of our bones is affected by the quality of

the water. If the water contains lime, lime may be taken up, and would appear as

phosphate of lime in the bones ;  if stroutia, as phosphate of  strontia                                      if magnesia,
                                                                                                           ;

as phosphate of magnesia. If by any combination of circumstances these salts

should be deficient, the bones would be imperfectly supplied with mineral matter.

It is said that such instances have occurred in Holland in districts where the inha-

bitants can only obtain rain-water for drinking-purposes. This fact, probably com-

bined with an absence of lime in their food, occasions a softening and distortion of

the bones of the body. By vai-ying a water-supply it might be possible to alter

the physical organization of a population, and in future ages, from the examina-

tion ot the bones of bygone generations, the character of the water they were in the

habit of drinking might possibly be deduced. So much attention is now directed

to organic impurity in drinking-water (a defect which can be completely remedied

by careful filtration), that the inorganic impurities have been almost overlooked,

although there are numerous instances where serious consequences have arisen

from the incautious use of deep-spring waters. Some time ago at Hendon, in

Middlesex, an artesian well was bored to supply the water necessarj' for some
                                                                  --

valuable horses which were being reared there. The water was bright looking,

pleasant to the taste, and quite free from any organic impurity ; the foals, however,

who drank the water soon died, and the whole stud were seriously affected with

diarrhoea. Professor Way, one of the Royal Commissioners on Water Supply,

analyzed the water, and it was foimd to contain sulphates of magnesia and soda in

considerable quantity. On discontinuing the use of the water the disease was
Aarrested.
            similar case occurred at Rugby ; but in that instance human beings

were the sufferers. The water from an artesian well free from organic impurity

was hailed with satisfaction at its brightness: the community, however, were

attacked with diarrhoea, caused by the sulphate of magnesia or Epsom salts present

in the water, and the supply had to be discontinued, as there is no known method

of freeing the water fi'om sulphates. The opinions of some leading authorities on

Awater-supply have imdergone considerable modification recently.  few years ago

Dr. Frankland returned all solid matters in water as impurities in the analyses he

made. The author was therefore much surprised to hear him recommend as a

supply to a district containing 14,000 inhabitants a water proved by analysis to

contain 12^ grains of anhydrous sulphate of magnesia per gallon, equal to 25 grains

per gallon of Epsom salts. This evidence was given last session before a Com-

mittee of the House of Commons. Dr. Frankland stated that it was absurd to sav

that a water containing such a quantity of Epsom salts could be objectionable from

a dietetic point of view. Fortunately for the health of the people the Parliamen-

tary Conmiittee refused to allow the district to be supplied with the Epsom-salt

solution. The water of St. Ann's Well, at Buxton, the slight purgative quality of

which is considered one of its merits, contains an amount of magnesia equal to
13 gi'ains of Epsom salts per gallon. It is known that goitre and other throat and

glandular affections, and even idiocy, have been attributed to inorganic salts in
Wedrinking-water.
                   know that the human system is easily deranged by a change

in the drinking-water. The spa and chalybeate waters at the favourite places of

resort have been renowned for ages for their medicinal virtues. If the entire

organic structures of the human body are liable to alteration when excess of mineral

matter is introduced into the system, it is essential that health-seekers at these

medicinal springs should place themselves under medical supervision. And one of

the first considerations in the inauguration of a water-supply should be to ensure a

--perfect freedom from excess of any mineral except those comparatively harmless

ingredients chloride of sodium and carbonate of lime.

                               On the Origin of the Lymphatics.
                 By Drs. Geoe&e and Frances Elizabeth Hoggan.

   Our knowledge of the intimate structure of the lymphatic system commences
with Von Recklinghausen, the discoverer of the beautiful silver method of staining
tissues. As it was impossible to speak in a short paper of the" nature of the lym-
phatic radicles in all tissues and in all classes of the Vertebrata, the authors exhibited
drawings carefully executed, by the aid of the camera lucida, of the following :

       1. Lymphatics and their radicles in the voluntary muscles of mammals.
       2. Lymphatics and their radicles in the involuntary muscles of Batrachians,
       .3. Lymphatics and their radicles in the skin of fishes.
      4. The development of lymphatic vessels in the embryo.
      6. The development of lymphatic radicles at all ages.

   The development c.f the lymphatic radicles is simply that of fixed connective
tissue. The gradual development of embryonic cells into permanent connective
tissue was described by means of drawings, which showed the distinct multinuclear,
protoplasmic, embryonic cells in the early embryo, forming the first stages of the
cells of a basement membrane. The embryonic cells place themselves in position,

grow larger, till each nucleus is able to separate with its own particle of proto-

plasm to form an independent, although irregularly shaped fiat cell, the so-called
branched or lymphatic cell of the gi-ound substance ; in other words, the connective-

tissue cell of a basement membrane. The varieties of form which these cells now
assume are unlimited. At one spot in the same preparation the authors can see
them pressing together to form the flat and irregularly hexagonal or round cells of
the endothelium from (and lying upon) the cells of the basement membrane. At
another place they have seen them elongating into fibrous tissues, such as are seen

in the skin or in the wall-tissue of an ovarian cyst. When several months ago they

discovered that, after rubbing epi- or endothelium off' the surface, and ti-eating the
thus exposed surface with silver, there were presented to notice the cells of lym-
phatic ground substance, they (having verified this on several structures) supposed
they had discovered that basement membranes were really lymphatic membranes.

Belbre, however, they had canied their investigation much further, they found that
Dr. Debove, of the College of France, had a few months before anived at the same
conclusion in regard to the basement membrane of the epithelium of the respiratory
and alimentary tracts, and that Dr. Slavianski had done the same in the case of tlie
lining of the Graafian follicle. They had, however, discovered that the basement
membrane under the human epidermis had the same significance, which Debove
had only suggested as probable, but had been unable to demonstrate. While con-

tinuing their investigations, they found, after stripping this thin layer or supposed

basement membrane from the inside of the wall of an ovarian cyst, an identical
structure underneath and the same process could be often repeated with always

                                                                                                                     ;

the same result. Thus they were led to see that, these several sheets being identical
with each other and with basement membrane, the so-called lymphatic ground

substance was formed of the cells of connective tissue, of which basement mem-
brane was itself composed. But just as the cells of basement membrane have
been called lymphatic cells, so were the cells of these different layers quite as much

lymphatic cells ; and found as they are in all tissues, they constitute the radicles of
the lymphatic sj'stem. The shape and position assumed by these cells depend on
the form of the tissue proper of the organ in which they are found ; separating the
tissues proper from each other, while they are largely connected between them-

selves, they form nutrient channels, by means of which the tissues proper may

supply themselves from the liquid pabulum which passes along the chains of these
connective-tissue cells or lymphatic radicles.

   The lymphatic circulation begins in this manner. The branched cells whicli we

 see depicted in the drawings of all careful observers as lying alongside of the capil-
laries and forming the tunica adventitia of small vessels form, the authors believe,
 the proximal points of the nutrient lymphatic system to the blood- vascular system.

From these proximal cells the liquid pabulum is passed on into other similar cells,

 A\'ith which they have innumerable anastomoses; and the process thus continued
 through innumerable intricate networks of anastomosing lymphatic radicles or

 connective-tissue cells, we have, finally, a joining of these cells with lymphatic
 capillaries or small sinuses, carrj'ing the now effete liquid pabulum (now called

 Ivmph) into the trunks of the lymphatic system and thence into the blood.
  " The authors believe that, as the seat of nutrition has been formerly removed from
 the smaller blood-vessels into the capillaries, so must we now further renio%e it from
 the capillaries into the network of anastomosing connective-tissue cells or lymphatic
 radicles. Nor is this hypothesis of nutrition connected with or depending on an
 hypothetical position or condition of the cells themselves. The authors have

 traced the cells of the tunica adventitia of a vein until they joined together in
 opening into a small lymphatic vessel ; but it is from the drawings of others that
 they prefer to prove this arrangement. Take, for instance, some of Klein's beautiful

 plates in his monograph on the lymphatics ; we thei-e see, in his drawing No. -34,

 the branched cells extending by anastomoses amongst themselves, between the
  smaller vessels of the blood and lymphatic systems.

     Upon the more or less permeable or channelled condition of those cells the

  autliors did not dilate, although they pointed out that the well-known hollowing

 out of these branched cells to form new capillaries at the blood-vascular end is pro-
 bably only the result of a demand for an excessive supply of liquid pabulum from

the tissues nearer the lymphatic eud of the chain, the cells at either end being
capable of forming a blood or lymphatic vessel, by the process of hollowing out so

often described by histologists, as the necessity of the case may demand.
   They next considered the development of lymphatic vessels in the embryo. Dr.

Klein, in his work already quoted, draws and describes the formation of endothe-

--lium by vacuolation of cells that is, cells becoming hollow and greatly enlarged,

and their wall subsequently becoming divided off into numerous endothelial jells.

He further predicts that it may subsequently be found, from the arrange ments of

these vacuoles in relation to each other, as seen by him in natural and induced in-
flammation, that they may ultimately open into each other, and thus form 13'mphatic

--channels. This very natural prediction of his the authors have seen fulfilled not,

however, in inflammatory conditions, but in the embryo itself They have observed
this process in its different stages, from the commencement of the formation of a
vacuole to the j unction of two or three fully formed vacuoles with each other and
with the termination of an already formed lymphatic channel. While, however,
they agree with his description of the process of formation of vacuoles in many cases,

they do not consider it to be invariably applicable. In other cases it appears

to consist of a cii'cular hollowing or sinking down of the basement membrane from
the surface endothelium, the linmg cells being formed by multiplication and com-
pression of the cells of the basement membrane, thus forming a pavement of cells
for the lymphatic sinus. This mode of development of lymphatic vessels the

authors do not consider as general, but applicable only to such conditions of exces-
sive vital stimulation as are found in the embryo and during inflammation, the
 ordinary process of such formation being similar to the same in blood-vessels
namely, a gradual enlargement of a lymphatic radicle by distention and addi-
tion of other cells, as the necessity for enlargement shows itself, until a com-

paratively large lymphatic channel is formed.

     On the Preservation of the Bodies of the larger Aninuds for Dissection.
                                    By F. Greenwood.

   Although many suggestions have been made and methods described for the pre-

servation of animal carcases for dissection, yet few seem to have been carried out
in practice, at any rate so far as regards the larger animals. In the case of the

ordinary subjects of veterinary anatomy, the abundant supply renders any attempt
at long preservation needless, as a whole subject can well De sacrificed for the sake
of some special region or organ.

   But when some uncommon but bulky specimen falls into the way of an ana-
tomist, he must either content himself with a veiy cursory examination of the
general disposition of the parts, or select some special points for investigation, and
leave the rest. He must, besides, be prepared to devote all his time to the work,

or the opportunity is lost.

   The latter consideration, in the case of those who can only devote their leisure

or a portion of their time to such work, frequently prevents any attempt to pro-
secute what might be most interesting researches. Nevertheless tolerably easy

and simple means may be indicated by which a body can be preserved indefinitely
in a state tit for dissection, so that the work may be either pursued or laid aside as

circumstances determine.

   It has been suggested that, as we have been tolerably successful in dealing with

the carcase of a young elephant from last winter until now, some account of the

mode of procedure may be of interest to those who have a taste for such work.
   The animal was purchased by the Council of the Leeds Philosophical and

Literary Society, and most liberally handed over to their Curator, to be dealt with
as he considered best ; and it is owing to the facilities freely furnished by them
that the work has Ijeen continued.

   The animal, which died about the 13th of December, was received on the 16th,

iu a very fresh condition, owing to the cold weather which set in about that time.
It was deposited in an open yard, but the next day a light wooden shed was
erected over it. At this time the possibility of making a detailed and leisurely dis-
section was not contemplated. The dissector only hoped to make out a few of the
principal points of interest ; so that the first steps of the dissection were not so
exact or well arranged as they would otherwise have been. The abdomen was
opened, and the stomach, liver, spleen, and intestines were removed. The hide
being wanted for the purpose of tanning, the carcase had to be flayed, not without
some injm'Y to the superficial structures. At this time the cold was very intense,
and the work of dissection consequently both paiuful and laborious, crystals of ice

forming under the knife.
   However, the work was continued, as the possibility of a sudden change in the

weather, and consequent speedy decomposition of the carcase, was kept in mind,

the elephant having the reputation of being especially prone to rapid putrescence

after death.

   The pectoral and axillary regions of the left side were dissected, and the front

and left side of the neck.

   At this time nothing was done to preseiTe the body -with the exception of

sprinkling it with spirit, which was found to facilitate the dissection by preventing
the rapid freezing of the exposed parts, which was annoying. Tiie cloths with

which it was covered were also wetted wdth spirit.

   Finding that progress was very slow, and perhaps also entering more into the
work than at first, it occurred to us to try the effect of the arsenical solution which

is used in the School of Medicine to preserve subjects for the usual period of dis-

section, hoping to delay the progress of decomposition for a time.

  We therefore inserted pipes into the abdominal aorta, and injected a quantity

of the fluid both upwards and downwards. It ran very freely, and penetrated tlie

most distant parts, although a good deal escaped from various points. With the

view of better preserving the brain, a quantity of methylated spirit was injected

by the carotid artery.
   Finding that the subject seemed to keep very well, and the great desirability of

a detailed and careful dissection becoming more and more apparent, the possibility

of a permanent presei-vation of the portions of the carcase began to be considered.

  We have for some time been in the habit of preserving such things as dissected

limbs, which have been injected with the preservative solution, for considerable

periods, by keeping them in a closed box with a little spirit sprinkled over them

occasionally, so as to keep up a spirituous atmosphere in the box.

AThis plan it was decided to adopt with the elephant.  large box was prepared,

and ultimately a second, lined with lead and with closely fitting lids.

Each fore limb, when separated, was again injected with the fluid and after-

wards with dilute spirit; and the Lujection, sometnnes with one solution and some-
times with the other, was repeated several times at intervals of a few days. The
parts were covered with cloths wetted with spirit, and laid in the box. The hind
limbs were kept attached to the pelvis, and were treated in the same way. The
head was at fu-st immersed in dilute spirit, and kept in a tub by itself. The viscera

were preserved, as usual, in fluid.

  From this time, which was about the middle of January, until now the parts

have remained perfectly sweet, sound, and natural in appearance, the muscles re-

taining their natural colour-, and the other tissues fuUy maintaining their distinc-
tive characters. The brain, however, was found not to be well preserved, though
the cerebellum and medulla oblongata were tolerably perfect. This, however, was
not examined until after six months had elapsed.

Owing to various causes, the dissection has been going on very slowly and with

repeated short interruptions ; but the part under dissection has been simply roUed

in a cloth which is kept moist by wetting it with dilute spirit, the use of the spirit

being rather to prevent the water from producing too great flabbiness and mould

Athan du-ectly to preserve the part.  dilute solution of a mixture of carbolic acid,

glycerine, and methylated spirit is also ^ery useful to wet the cloths with, as it is
highly antiseptic ; and in the summer an outer covering of Mackintosh cloth has

been found convenient to check evaporation.
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                     1C9

    If not kept wetted the parts soon dry up, and are apt to become covered with a

whitish effloresceuce, which is difficult to remove.

   I am inclined to attribute the success in great measure to the repeated injections,

a few days interval being allowed between each ; thus the tissues had time to be-
come thoroughly impregnated with the fluid ; and it is to that, rather than to the

special virtues of the solution, that the result is due.

   It is thus apparent that a tolerably bulky animal may be preserved for dissection

at leisure with a moderate amount of trouble and expense--all that is needed
beyond the necessary anatomical knowledge and instruments being a sufficient
quantity of tlie arsenical fluid (which is quite cheap), a gallon or two of methylated
spirit, and a tolerably well-closed box or case in which to deposit the subject.

  Bearinr/s of " the Conservation of Force" on Life. By P. Hallett, M.A.

   The object of this paper is to consider the modern theory of the conservation of
force in connexion with the phenomena of life.

   The autlior holds that these phenomena do not conform to it, but that they
rather indicate that life, considered as a natural cause, whatever the nature or
essence of that cause may be, has within itself a power of self-propagation and
renewal. Though it borrows its materials from the physical universe, it confers on
them the vital powers, both general and specific, that they possess through

organization.

On som; new Researches on the Anatomy of the Shin. By Dr.MARTTW,

   The object of this communication was to make known some facts in the ana-

tomical structure and growth of the cuticular layer of the skin. In a recent

paper the author had described this with reference to disease, and he now had to

confirm the view which those appearances led him to predict as holding good for

ordinary and healthy epithelium also.

  Twelve years ago Max Schultze observed that the lowest of the cells forming, in
many layers, the cuticle were often covered with spines (" Stachel ") or grooves

(" Riss "'). His brother confirmed this in fishes, and other observers had done so in

many diseases of the skin. The subject attracted little notice, and had scarcely
even now reached our English text-books.

   It was in endeavoming to make out the real nature of so strange a structure that
the author, by employment of imusually thin sections, staining, and the highest
available powers of the microscope, had discovered that the cells which appeared
" spinous or " echinate " when isolated from their connexion, if they could be at

any time seen in single layers, were simply united together by delicate bands.
These are so constantly seen broken across that they assume the form of tubercles
or " prickles." As repeated observation confii'med this, the name " conjoined
epithelium" had been proposed for this form or stage in cell-life as here

exhibited.

   These observations, of which drawings were engraved in the Number of the

Monthly Microscopical Journal of the present month, were made on cancer of the

skin, in which the cells fortunately become monstrous.

Now the author was in a position to say that the "conjoined" epithelium was

also to be found in (1) human skin, (2) the front of the eye in the pig, (3) the lips
of at least one fish {Zeus faher). The sturgeon was just now under investigation.

The difficulty of making the structure clear in a healthy animal cuticle was

The interest of the subject lies in this direction. All the cells of which living

things at any moment consist were produced by division of a parent, either into

two equal parts (fissiparous) or by budding off a small bit (gemmiparous). Epithe-

lial cells gi-ow so too ; and in " conjoined " epithelium we, so to say, catch the division

process lingering on. Many cells divide like an hour-glass ; but here the points

are very numerous. Protoplasm, of which cells at first consist, varies constantly

in form, as the amoeba, or the white-blood cell. While alive in a formative sense

it moves. The old outer firm wall or shell of " matter " which forms around cells,

and which we call cell-wall, has ceased to have this formative life, whatever

--functional powers it has. Cells of many striking shapes are foimd in the organic

world star-shaped, spindle-shaped, caudate, and so on. In the early discoveries

of cell-growth (soon after Schwann, 1836), innumerable mysterious vital powers

were attributed to cells, amongst which was that of projecting processes, long

wandering arms pervading intercellular tissue or other structures. As the author

had endeavoured to show some years ago, the form of the cell is almost invariably

the result of ordinary force. It is a form which the cell is forced to take, by

dragging out of points at which it was in the act of dividing. This idea is now

Aa familiar one, and the conjoined epithelium a good illustration.  fresh subject

for investigation would be ithose cases in which cells are covered with ciliary pro-

cesses, probably from splitting of hardened and formed outer materials.

This is a very large ossuary in the crj^pt of a church. There is a sort of tradi-

Ation that the bones are those of men slain in some battle; but it is unworthy of
notice.  few of the skulls were brought away three or four years ago by Sir

William Grove, and restored to their place after being measured and described by

Prof. Busk. Dr. Beddoe examined a different set of skulls, which he took in-

discriminately from the heaps, only rejecting those which were clearly feminine.
The average leng-tli of fifteen was 7-313 inches, the average maximum breadth

6-757 inches, the average index of breadth 78-7, vaiyingfrom 72 to 87. The index

of height was probably low. The average capacity of ten (measured with rape-

seed and Busk's choremometer) was 1366-5 cubic centimetres, equal to a weight of

45-G oz. for the true brain-substance, reckoning the sp. gi-. at 1040, and allowing

4-5 oz. for the membranes and blood. This is a very low brain-weight, below even

that of Dr. Boyd's series of paupers and lunatics.

         Rlialdomancy and Behmancy. By A. W. Bttceund, M.A.I.

   In this paper the author endeavours to show :
_ 1st. From personal observation that Rhabdomancy is still practised in England
in certain localities, and that it is a survival of a very ancient superstition ori-
ginatin^m the use of rods as symbols of power.

   2nd. That the staff as a sceptre was probably a later form of the horn, which was
thus used in very early prehistoric times, and in that character adorned the

heads of gods.

3rd. That from this Use of rods or horns arose ft veneration for them as possessing
mtne inherent power of healing disease and even of restoring life. Hence their use

by magicians all ages and countries, the chief ihstrtmients employed by them
being a ring and n staff and a bifurcated .stick.                   '

   4th. That these symbols conjoined are found in Egyptian, Assyrian, and Peruvian

sculptures, and may be traced in some of the stone circles of Britain, and in the

shape of Irish brooches or fibulae.

   6th. That from the belief in the magical powers of rods perhaps arose tree-

worship, or at least such veneration for trees as is observable of the oaks of
Dordona and of the Druids, the ash of Scandinavia, and, for some imexplained
reason, more particularly of the hazel.

   6th. That Eelomancy or Divination by marked arrows, said to be of Scythic

origin, was practised in Babylon, Judfca, and Arabia, and that traces of it may still

be found in folk tales of Russia and Siberia.

   7th. That the mode of using these arrows had a strong resemblance to the very
ancient custom of casting lots, common to all peoples, ancient and modern, the
" Plwiting Treow " of tlie Anglo-Saxons being still used by the Hottentots.

   8th. That the invention of lots and dice as well as that of the divining-rod is

ascribed to Hermes or Mercurj^ identified with the Woden of the north and by

some writers with the Indian Buddha.

   9tli. That a strong resemblance exists between the implements of magic and
the ancient alphabets, also the reputed invention of the same god or gods.

   10th. That many of the signs or letters forming the Archaic-Phoenician alphabet
are found in the rock-sculptures of Peru, thus adding one more to the many proofs

of "a communication existing between the hemispheres in prehistoric times.
    11th. That the arts of magic and divination were not of Aryan origin, but a

remnant of that Turanian or pre-Aryan faith which once overspread the world.
   12th. That this is proved by their present existence among aboriginal non-

Aryan races, and may perhaps even be used as a test of race ; so that those who in
Somerset and Cornwall are said to possess the power of divination by the rod, may

possibly have some remote affinity with the aboriginal inhabitants of Britain,

           By Colonel Caeeington, LL.D.

        On Frelnstoric Culture in India and Africa. By HtdE CiaSke,

    Calling attention to the author's philological investigations as to the evidence of
the successive migration and distribution of languages in Asia, Africa, North,
Central, and South America, and in some casqs in Australia, he proceeded to give
the result of later special investigations as to the commuiiity of culture in.

India and Africa. For this purpose Koelle's African vocabularies were used,

with those of Dr. W. W. Hunter, Col. Dalton, and Sir G. Campbell for India, but

excluding the Tibetan, Dravidian, and Sanskrit. Thus the materials were chiefly
derived from Bodo, Dhimal, Kooch, Garo, Savara, Miri, Naga, Karen, Kami, and
Kol, races which certainly had exercised no influences of commerce or civiliza-
tion in Africa within the historic period. Besides weapon-names elsewhere
referred to. Town, Canoe or Boat, Tree, and Leaf show a community. The

author then showed how the Indian words for salt were reproduced in Africa, as :

Naga, wiflfae; Miri, abi; Kol, buhmr/; Kooch, «hw; Keimi,maloi; Bodo, /lara; Savara,

GJusi; Karen, ithah; ondi, sabbar. The facts he held to prove that the earliest

savages had made themselves acquainted with the properties of salt, and carried
this knowledge with them throughout the world in their migrations. The names
of the domestic animals are recognizable ; but those for elephant seem to show,
as might be expected from geological testimony, that this animal being then most
widely distributed was well distinguished. The philology of the aboriginal
languages of India could only be eflfectually studied from those of Africa ; and the
author suggests that it would be a gi-eat advantage if some of the missionaries of
the two regions could interchange stations.

     Furilier Note on PreMstoric Names of Weapons. By Hyde Clarke.

   This was in continuation of a note laid before the British Association in 1873,
showing, in connexion with the distribution of weapons, tliat there was a com-
munity of aboriginal names in the prehistoric epoch as there is now. The author
stated that these results were confirmed since then, and since the publication of
his ' Researches in Prehistoric Comparative Philology,' by the examination and
classification of a larger body of facts. The names for arrow, dart, spear, sword,

knife, and axe were found to present common forms in Asia, Africa, Australia,
North America, Central America, and South America. The philological facts
show a series of influences, so far as Australia is concerned, operating from the

Old World. In conformity with Col. Lane Fox's conclusions, the names for the
hoe and other tools are found to be allied with those of weapons, showing that the
same instrument was used for tool and weapon.

          On the Himalayan Origin of the Magyar and Fin Languages.

                                    By Hyde Clarke.

   The author pointed out the relations of numerous languages in High Asia to the
Ugrian, and remarked that the affinities of Magyar and Fin were strongest for the

languages of East Nepaul. Among the Himalayan Ugriau were to be found
Magyar and Hung ; and the author suggested these as being connected with the

invasion of liungary. To harmonize the facts as to the connexion with this event
of the Lesghians, Avars, and Khunzag of Caucasia, Mr. Hyde Clarke treated the
chiefs as Lesghians (Vasco Kelarian) and the people as mostly Ugrian.

         On the Ethnography of Scotland. By the Rev. J. Earle.

--l._ Aspect. That the Norwegians are like the Scotch in appearance and in several

particulars of life is an ordinary and oft-repeated observation ; but what gives this

popular rem.ark its value is this, that it is confirmed by the authority of the

scientific observer. Early this year the author asked Dr. Beddoe whether he

thought that the comparison of the Scotch to the Norwegians had any thing sub-

stantial in it ; and the speedy result of that question was that he showed him a

collection of large photographs which he had lately received from Dahknann, the

eminent Norwegian artist, as specimens of the various types in Norway; and

--almost all of them were, in his opinion, to be met with in Scotland.
   2. History. The Landnama states that the north of Scotland Avas conquered by

Norsemen. Tlie biographical and romantic Sagas present it as a habit of the

Norsemen, when tired of home, to " harry west. The condition of Lincolnshire

as compared with Denmark confirms the truth of this ; and we may safely conclude
that Scotland received those who left the south of Norway. From the more

iioi-therly fiords the outgoers occupied the Hebrides, which they called the Southern

Isles (in their speech "Sundreyjar," a word which still lives on in the title of " Sodor

and Man "). The Saxon Chronicle under 924 gives the composition of the popula-

--tion of Northumbria, which included the Lothians, in these terms " ge Englisce,

Wege Denisce, ge Northmen."  know that many points of the west coast down

Ato the Lake-district were occupied by Scandinavians.  passage quoted from

Burton (History of Scotland) expressed that Norse superstitions lingered in Scot-

--land down to a very recent date.
   3. Language. In the Scots language the most conspicuous and striking features

are Norse ; and this fact may now be considered placed beyond question by the admi-

rable dictionary of Mgfusson, which every one with a moderate philological train-

Aing can consult for himself. list of words was given which strike our English sense

as curious ; and yet we, in thus j udging of the Scots dialect, are using as a standard
a language (English) which is itself deeply impregnated with Danish. Again, it is

not just those words which seem most conspicuous that constitute the strongest

evidence of the Norwegian element in Scotland. Such words as hairn, gar, greet

(=weep), ken, lax, spcer, speak for themselves; but such an auxiliary as maun

roally merits deeper attention. So of otlier little words, and especially the pre-

position til.

  --4. Summary. Our Danish and Norsk districts are the meeting-ground of the

two great divisions of Gothdom, the Teutonic and Scandinavian. In England the
Danisli deposit has been much diluted, though spots there are, like Cleveland (so

well described in Mr. Atkinson's 'Glossary'), where it is still in good preservation.
The political line between Scotland and England protected North Britain from a
like dilution, and made a place for the maturation of a language unparalleled iu its

own peculiar beauty, and especially as an instrument of lyric poetry.

    On the Orif/inal Localities of tJie Races forming the present Poindation of
                             India. By Sir Walter Elliot.

   The object of this paper is to show that the Hindus, although exhibiting many
varieties of form and feature, were all referable to a common type, diftering essen-

tiall}' from the Aryan, and equally distinct from a Mongolian and Negrito source.
This normal character was deduced from Professor Huxley's Australoid type of
mankind, the original seat of which was to be sought in Central Asia, whence from
time to time, and often at distinct intervals, hordes have migrated into Hindustan,
some through the passes of the Eastern Himalayas, others, as the later Dravidians,
from the N.W., antecedent to the Aryan immigration. Later arrivals dispossessed
earlier occupants, reducing them to slavery or amalgamating more or less intimately
with them, but never losing the normal physical features of the race. Even the

Aryans, when they came iu contact with the despised Dasyus and Nishadas (or
monkey- and goat-faced tribes, as they contemptuously called them), could not
help intermingling with them in some degree, both in the ordinary and inevitable
com-se of sexual intercourse, and also by proselytism arising out of the relative cir-
cumstances in which they foimd themselves, aa their own writings show.

 Notice of a neiu Code of International Symbols for use on Prehistoric Maps*.

   The system has been devised by a Committee appointed last year at the Congress
of Prehistoric Anthropology and Archseology at Stockholm. The symbols are
simple, and intended to denote the occurrence of dolmens, tumuli, and other objects
of archfcological interest, but are also susceptible of being made compoimd, so as to
denote the particular character and even the approximate age of any monument.

On the Origin of the South-Sea Islanders. By the Rev, "Wtatt W. Gill, B.A.

   Mr. Alfred Wallace, iuhis admirable work on ' The Malay Archipelago ' (p. 593,
4th edit.), has advanced the theory that the Polynesians are descended from a race
which once overspread a vast submerged southern continent. As the land gra-
dually sank, a few of the aborigines may have escaped to the tops of the loftiest
mountains, around which subsequently coral reefs formed. Admitting that
" Polynesia is preemineutly an area of subsidence, and its great widespread groups

174       ·      EEPORT-- 1875.

of coral reefs may mark out the position of former continents and islands," the

author still thinks Mr. Wallace's inference to be unwarranted ; forj

1. Supposing that human beings inhabited this great southern continent at the

period of the subsidence, and that a Temnant escaped, the author believes that human

life could not under such circumstances be sustained for any considerable time, as

usually there is nothing edible on the tops of the Pacific mountains save berries,

to say nothing of the difficulty, in most cases, of obtaining water.

2. The theory is utterly opposed to the native accounts of their own origin,

which all point to the north-west.

3. The spread of the race can be accounted for on the basis of historical facts.

In 1862 the author saw on Manua an open boat, which had accidentally drifted from

AMoorea, a distance of 1250 miles, and no life lost.  few months later on in the

same year Elikana and his friends drifted in a canoe from Manibiki to Nukuraaeae,

in the Ellice group (lying N.W. of Samoa), a distance of some 1.360 miles. Half

the party on board perished from want of food and water. In both these instances

Athe drifting was fr-om east to west, before the trade-winds.    far more remarkable

event occurred in January 1858, during the prevalence of the tcesterly winds, when

a numerous family of natives drifted from Fakaofo, in the Union group, north of

Samoa, to Nassau Island, thence to Palmerston's Island, and finally to Mangaia,

altogether a distance of 1250 mUes in a south-easterly direction.

4. The colour, hair, general physiognomy, habits, character, and especially the

language of the Polynesians, indicate a Malay origin. This cannot be accidental.

It would be easy to give a long list of words identical or nearly so in Malay and

Polynesian. The author believes that long ages ago the progenitors of the present

race entered the Pacific from the south-eastern fork of New Guinea, but were

driven to the eastward by the fierce Negi'ito race. The greatest distance from land

to land, as they proceed eastward, would be from Samoa to the Hervey group,

about 706 miles, which has been successfully traversed by natives in their fi-agile

barks within the author's own observation.

Some Traditions of the Hervey Islanders. By the Eev. "W. "Wtatt Gill, B.A.

   The classical word in the dialect of the Hervey group for " nether-world " is
" Ayaiki." The universe is conceived of as the hollow of a vast cocoa-nut shell, in

the interior of which are many lands, the abode of gods and imhappy ghosts. Near

the top of this vast shell, on the outside, are located their island homes. Rising

one above another into immensity are at least ten separate heavens. Origin-

ally mankind and the natives of Avaiki interchanged visits through the opening

atthe top, which is now closed on accoimt of the ceaseless depredations of the

fairies.

The esoteric doctrine of the priests was, that souls leave the body ere breath has

Aquite gone, and travel on to the edge of a cliff facing the setting sun.  large

wave now approaches the base of the cliff, and a gigantic bua-tree covered with

fragrant blossoms springs up fi-om Avaiki to receive on its limbs human spirits,
who are mysteriously impelled to cluster on its far-spreading branches. 'When at

length the mystic tree is covered with ghosts it goes down with its living freight

to nether-world. These unhappy ghosts are caught in a net, nearly drowned in a
neighbom-ing stream, and then emptied out, shivering and terrified, in the presence

of ugly Miru, mistress of the invisible world. Each newcomer to the shades is

Im'ed to drink a bowl of "kava" {Piper mythistimm), becomes stupified, and is then

cooked and eaten by the hag Miru and her companions.

Such was believed to be the inevitable fate of cowards and of all who died a
Anatural death.
                 nobler fate awaited warrior-spfrits ; their pleasant home was in

the azure sky. In the month of August, when the coral-ti-ee is in blossom, they

Aassemble at the edge of a clilF overlooking the marae of the war-god.    mountain
now springs up at their feet ; the road to its summit is built of the clubs, spears, and

stones with which they met their fate. They ascend with pleasure, and from the

top leap mto the expanse, where they float about as specks. Covered with garlands

of sweet-scented flowers, they spend their time in dancing the war-dance and in

reciting oyer and over again the brave deeds performed in life.

   The practical result of this faith was to breed contempt for violent death, and to
nourish a race of warriors who (like oui-selves) despised bush-fighting.

  On the Recent Discovery of a Stone Implement in the Bnch-earth of Erith,
                          Kent*. Bij Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.R.S.

 ^The implement exhibited was a flint flake of vei-y regular form, inches long

and 2 inches broad, notched at the edges apparently from use. It had a small fossil
Echinus at the broader end. It was picked up in the brick-earth pits at Erith, in
the ancient valley of tlie Thames ; but as it was found among the flints and other
rubbish thrown aside by the workmen, it is impossible to say whether it came from
the same beds that furnish the remains of the mammoth, rhinoceros, lion, &c., or

from some higher and more recent stratum.

                                             T'he Wedclas of Ceylon.

            By Berteam F. Haetshoene, of the Ceylon Civil Service.

   The writer, after briefly referring to the accounts given by previous authors of

this remarkable race, detailed the results of his personal observation of their habits,
physiology, and language, dividing the whole tribe into the two classes of Jungle

Weddas and Village Weddas. The former have retained more distinctly than the

latter the essential characteristics of their autochthonous condition, still depending
for their chief means of subsistence upon their bows and arrows, and passing their
lives in the vast forests in the eastern part of Ceylon without any dwelling-places

or system of cultivation.

   Their skill in the use of the bow and the strength of theii- left arm was to be
noticed, as well as the absence of any stone or flint implements among them. The

influence of the civilized Tamil and Sinhalese races contiguous to the district which
they inhabit has only in a very slight degree made itself felt ; and their state of
barbarism is indicated by the practice of producing fii-e by means of rubbing two
sticks together, as well as by an almost entire absence of clothing, and the custom
which they observe of habitually refraining from any sort of ablution whatever.

   The copies of photogi-aphs exhibited showed them to possess features of no unin-
telligent type ; but they wear an expression of extreme imhappiness, and one of their

chief peculiarities is that they never laugh. It is probable that this circumstance

is due to psychological causes rather than to any physical conformation.

   Their intellectual capacity is extremely slight, and their power of memory de-
fective. They ai-e utterly unable to count; nor does their language contain any

words to denote the numerals ; and it is singular that, whilst their moral notions
lead them to regard theft or lying or the striking of another as an inconceivable
wrong, they are devoid of any form of rehgion, and also, apparently, of any religious

sentiment, except in so far as that may be inferred from their practice of ofieiing a

sacrifice to the spirit of one of their fellows immediately after his decease, their
idea of a future state being limited to the belief that they become devils after
death, not, however, in the sense of the Buddhist theory of metempsychosis, but

simply as one final and in-esistible transformation.
   The analysis of their language and of their songs or folk-lore was reserved by the

author for a subsequent occasion ; but he observed that their vocabulary largely
consisted of words derived directly from the Sinhalese, and others indicated an
aflinity with Pali and Sanskrit, whilst there remained a considerable residue of
doubtful origin. There is, however, an absence of any distinctly Dravidian ele-
ment, and the language appears to bear no resemblance to that spoken by the
Yakkas of Nipal. The author, after adverting to the danger of insisting too

strongly upon the inferences which may be drawn from Imguistic evidence in the

determination of ethnological questions, drew attention to the interesting circum-
stance that the Weddas are the only savage race in existence speaking an Aryan

 language.

Note on the supposed lost Language and Antiquity of the Kirghiz, or Buruts.

   By EoBEET MicHELL, F.B.G.S., F.S.S., and Member of the Imperial Russian

    Geographiccd Society.

This people, which formerly dwelt in the country of the Upper Yenissei, now

occupies the valleys of the Thian-shau range, where, it seems, still more ancient

representatives of the race dwelt before those of the Upper Yenissei, driven (in the

17th century) by the second series of Mongol Altyn Khans, and finally by Russian

Cossacks, shifted their habitations. But while the Kirghiz of the Thian-shan are

alluded to by Chinese chroniclers of the 13th century, those of the Yenissei, or
Ulu-kem river, are spoken of in Chinese chronicles of the 5th century, where it

would appear, from a casual allusion to Kirghiz slaves among the Tukiii, in the

narrative of Zemarchus's mission to Disobul, they were at that time a vanquished

nationality. By the Chinese these Kirghiz are traced back two centuries n.c.

These Kirghiz,_anciently called Hakas, were overcome by the Tu-kiu or Turks, a

race quite distinct from the Hakas, who are supposed to be an Aryan people.
Their language is now Turk, and veiT few traces of their origin have as yet been

discovered                                           but it is not  impossible                              that  philological  inquiries  may  yet lead to a

discovery of many roots in the languages of the Finns and other tribes of that

family of the lost language, the Kirghiz or ancient Hakas.

   Language is often a deceptive guide to the determination of primitive stock.
Yet it cannot be but that a once numerous and powerful people, at one time speak-

ing a language of their own, have left in those that have superseded it evidences of
an earlier form of speech. In the language of the Tongouts in Ordos there are

sounds exactly similar to those uttered by the Finns, Laplanders, Savoyards, &c.,

quite distinct from those in the Tm-k tongue, albeit these last-named people are
considered the Turk race. The author considers that a study of the symbols

which are in common use in the far East in place of written characters' would

probably afford some assistance on the spot to the philological student and serve
to throw some light upon tlie past. Joubert, Abel Remusat, Castrea, and others

may be referred to on this subject ; and there are said to be caverns in the Sayan

mountain-passes where some ancient people deposited their records and relics,
which have never been found or even searched for from the Russian side of the
country. It is to be remembered that the so-called Kirghiz of the Steppes of
North-western Asia have no affinities whatever with the Kirghiz here alluded to.

These, now nearly all Russian subjects, do not know the name, and are really
Kaisaks (Cossacks), roaming houseless waifs, and they are Turks. The Kirghiz
proper are now few in number, and are fast dying out, succumbing to the Cauca-

sians, probably the descendants of this very ancient people.

Oti the Localities from whence the Gold and Tin of the Ancients were derived.

                  By Charles P. Groom Napier, F.G.S., M.A.I.

   The author said tin was known from historic evidence at least 1500 j-ears b.c.

Ho quoted Strabo with reference to the Phoenicians can-ying on traffic for tin from
Ciades and Bochart, who deduced the term Britain from liarab anac, the land or

field of tin. From the Phojnician inscriptions recently published in the journals
of the London Anthropological Societies and Institute, as having been found in
Brazil and Sumatra, he thought there was an early Phosuician intercourse with

these countries, and that metals might have been derived from them. Bochaii
thought Ophir might be in Peru. The author thought Ophir was a general name

for a gold-producing country. He reviewed the various theories with reference to

                A new Pai'aqraph in Early English History,

                           By Dr. T. Nicholas, M.A., F.G.S.

   The author brought forward evidence, not before presented, to the effect that

the letter to Aetius the Roman Consul, ascribed by Gildas to the Britons of

Britain, and beginning, " The groans of the Britons," meant in reality a message to
the same effect sent to the same consul and in the same year by the Armoricans
who were even at that early date (a.d. 447) often called Britanni, and their

country Britannia (Bretagne). He quoted, in proof of his position, more especiallv

from the life of St. Germanus by Constantius, found in the 'Acta Sanctorum'
establishing from this contemporary document the reality of such a messao-e to
Aetius from the Armoricans in the year of his third Consulship (a.d. 447)"^ the
date of the pretended " letter " given by Gildas. The coincidence was so striking
as infallibly to suggest a blunder or a fraud on the part of Gildas, who was writ-
ing more than a century after the events, and, according to his own confession
without the aid of any British documents to supply him with facts, but from
foreign hearsay and obscure tradition. Whether Gildas was the victim of im-
posture, or himself played the impostor, and applied to his countrymen the Britons
what in reality belonged to the Britanni of Armorica, he is in either case equally
unworthy of credence as an authority in early English history.

   In this paper the parallel evidence of various celebrated anthropologists, shown
in their discoveries, and the arguments deduced from such discoveries by men of
the highest scientific acquirements, were brought to bear upon the occupants of
178 iiEPOiiT-- 1875.

caverns in the west of Europe, from North Britain to Gibraltar, for the purpose
of showing a similarity of race in the people occupying the sea-board of nearly the
whole of that part of Europe bounded by the Atlantic Ocean. The discoveries by
the author not only agreed with the authorities, but showed reasonable groimd
for supposing that the race of cave occupants known as dolichocephali inhabited

as far north as some of the extreme portions of North Britain. And as from a

subsequent joint occupancy it was apparent that an invading force in Britain, pro-
bably the Cymiy, had possessed themselves of the abodes and dwellings of these
people, it was probable that the Oymry had occupied territory a good deal further
north than was shown by INIi'. Skene and other writers on that subject. It would
seem, moreover, as a residt, that the occupants of the Mendip Hills would originally
have been of that race. This being so, the manner and customs of the early
inhabitants of the Mendip Hills would approximate to those of the dolichocephalic
occupants of Iberia and other western countries. In all such districts were found
dolmens and chambered tombs, which appeared to have succeeded as places of in-

terment, if not of residence (or, as the author considered, of both), to the natural

caverns occupied by the earlier generations of this people. The interments, even
when ui connexion with those of the brachycephali, a more powerful and invading
race, agreed in manner and accompaniments, including coarse pottery, bones of
animals, and neolithic implements. But a prominent feature, hitherto unnoticed,
to which the author drew attention, was the construction or an-angemeut of works
sepulchral and othei'wise in forms and devices simulating animal outlines ; those
on the Meadips at Blackdown, Priddy, Beacon Batch, and other places, as well as
those at Beacon hill near Maesbury, consist in each case of a series of mounds

arranged in studied positions representing veiy beautiful alternating curves, pre-

cisely analogous to the positions that would be assumed by vast serpents of similar
dimensions. The vast, stupendous, and terrible appeared the predominant charac-
teristic of such devices ; and it was noticeable that in all cases of such constructions,
and, so far as he had been able to investigate personally, in all places of such cave
occupancy also, the artificial emblems followed on some one or other natural simula-
tion, which had either suggested the idea directly, or led to its adoption in a some-
what varied form. That the simulations of animal forms which were to be found
upon the Mendip Hills, as well as elsewhere along the Atlantic districts, were con-
structed to represent deities, he thought there could be no doubt ; and as such simu-
lations appeared to be the result of uatui'al suggestion, he assumed that such natural
simulations would have been among the previous objects of worship of the people.

    In the first, he pointed out that there was no reasonable grounds for doubling

the native traditions, as these had been found uniformly the same in all parts of
the three islands, and, as in other matters, the people had proved themselves to
be thoroughly trustworthy.

  In the second, lie showed that overwhelming e\adence demonstrated that the Xew-

Zealanders were one race, the few exceptions noticeable not being of any real
moment.

In the third, he proved by a careful examination of the chief Polynesian dialects,

the Maori, the Tonga, the Hawaii (Sandwich), the Tahiti (Otaheite), and the
Samoan (Navigator's Islands), that all these peoples must once have had a com-

mon origin, the difference between the existing dialects being hardly as much as

between that of Yorkshire and Somersetshire at the present day, and by no means

as great as those between the popular dialects of Venice and Naples. The author

--had no doubt that they all came at some remote period from Central Asia in
other words, were Turanians

On the Predatory Races of Asia and Europe ; a Chapter in Morals.
                  By C. SiANiLAUD Wake, V.-P.L.A.S.

Notwithstanding the practice by peoples such as the Afghans, the Bedouins, the

Slavonians of Southern Europe, and the ancient peoples of North-western Eixrope,

classed together by the author as "predatory," of the right of blood-revenge, such

peoples are not without certain important moral characteristics. Among all of them

that right has come to be usually given up in return for a compensation, pecuniary

or otherwise, fixed by arbitration or by the person iinjm-ed or his relations. More-

over, although towards strangers their conduct is governed by no sense of moral

obligation, yet as between themselves the ordinary rides of the moral law required

for the internal peace and prosperity of the state are recognized. In general con-

duct the predatory peoples show a great superiority over less cultured races. The

practice of hospitality has become a virtue and a sacred tie of friendship. Marriage

has ceased to be a matter of mere bargain and sale, and woman has become the

wife instead pf the slave of her husband. The whole character of the predatory

peoples has, indeed, acqim-ed a higher moral tone. Partly owing to the influence

accjuired by woman and her power of moulding the character of her children, but

chiefly owing to the recognition of the true position of the father as the head of

the family, in substitution for the primitive notion of relationship to the clan

through the mother, the feeling of "manliness" is developed to a great degree.

This was noticeable in the character of the ancient Germans and Scandinavians

no less than in that of the modern predatory peoples of Asia. With them " man-

liness " springs from an intense self-consciousness, and it shows its influence in the

dignity, self-control, and magnanimity for which those peoples are distinguished.

Those characteristics are accompanied by a sense of personal honour which is essen-

tial to a true idea of moral obligation                                                                                                                                             although moral strength rather than  moral
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Wegoodness is the special attribute of the predatory peoples.                                                                                                                                   see the same thing

among the ancient Eomans, who possessed the quality of " manliness " in a high

degree. This quality was to them the sum of all morality, to which, indeed, they

gave the name of " virtue," meaning strength, as applied to conduct. The " virtue"
of the Romans and of the ancient peoples of Europe was thus originally the same

quality, and it possessed with each the possibility of acquiring a true ethical sense.

              Tlie Cycle of Development. By Hoddek M. Wesxeopp.

   The object of the author is to trace and bring into prominence the cycle of
development, an invariable law which, in his opinion, presides over all that has
growth and progress, in man and in natm-e. All progress and growth is in suc-

--cessive stages, which form a cycle, the stages proceeding in an ascending scale and

in a descending scale those in the ascending scale being rise, progress, matuiity

aEOGEAPHY.

Address by Licut.-Gcneral E. Steachet, B.E., C.S.L, F.R.S., President of

                                                               the Section.

In accordance witli the practice followed for some years past by the Presidents

of the Sections of the British Association, I propose, before proceeding with our

ordinary business, to ofler for j^our consideration some observations relative to the

branch of knowledge with which this Section is more specially concerned.

  My predecessors in this Chair have, in their opening addresses, viewed Geo-

graphy in many various lights. Some have drawn attention to recent geographical

discoveries of interest, or to the gradual progi-ess of geogi-aphical knowledge over

the earth generally, or in particular regions. Others have spoken of the value of

geogi-aphical Iniowledge in the ordinary aii'airs of men, or in some of the special

branches of those affairs, and of the means of extending such knowledge. Other

addresses again have dwelt on the practical influence produced by the geogi-aphical

features and conditions of the various parts of the earth on the p.'ist history and

present state of the several sections of tiie human race^ the formation of kingdoms,

the growth of industry and commerce, and the spread of civilization.

   The judicious character of that part of our organization which leads to yearly
changes among those who preside over our meetings, and does not attempt authorita-

tively to prescribe the dii-ection of om* discussions, will no doubt be generally recog-

nized. It has the obvious advantage, amongst others, of ensuring that none of the

multifarious claims to attention of the several branches of science shall be made

unduly prominent, and of giving opportunity for viewing the subjects which from

time to time come before the Association in fresh aspects by various minds.

  Follovsdng, then, a somewhat different path from those who have gone before

me in treating of Geography, I propose to speak of the physical causes which have

impressed on our planet the present outlines and forms of its surface, have brought

about its present conditions of climate, and have led to the development and distri-

bution of the living beings found upon it.

myIn selecting this subject for  opening remarks, I have been not a little in-

fluenced by a consideration of the present state of geogi-aphical knowledge, and of

the probable future of geographical investigation. It is plain that the field for

mere topographical exploration is already greatly limited, and that it is continually

becoming more restricted. Although no doubt much remains to be done in

obtaining detailed maps of large tracts of the earth's surface, yet there is but com-

paratively a very small area vdth the essential features of which we are not now fairly
well acquainted. Day by day our maps become more complete, and vdth our greatly

improved means of communication the knowledge of distant countries is constantly
enlarged and more widely diffused. Somewhat in the same proportion the demands

for more exact information become more pressing. The necessary consequence is

an increased tendency to give to geographical investigations a more strictly scien-

tific direction. In proof of this. I may instance the fact that the two British naval
expeditions now being carried on, that of the Challenger and that of the Arctic

seas, have been organized almost entirely for general scientific research, and com-

paratively little for topographical discovery. Narratives of travels, which not many

years ago might have been accepted as valuable contributions to our then less

perfect knowledge, would now perhaps be regarded as superficial and insufficient.

In short the standard of knowledge of travellers and writers on Geography must

be raised to meet the increased requirements of the time.

Other influences are at work tending to the same residt. The great advance made

in all branches of natural science limits more and more closely the facilities for

original research, and draws the observer of natm-e into more and more special

studies, while it renders the acquisition by any individual of the highest standard

of knowledge in more than one or two special subjects comparatively difficult and

rare. At the same time the mutual interdependence of all natural phenomena daily

becomes more apparent ; and it is of ever-increasing importance that there shall be

some among the cultivators of natural knowledge who specially direct their atten-

tion to the general relations existing among all tlio forces and pliononiena of nature.
In some important branches of such subjects, it is only through study of the local
physical conditions of vai-ious parts of the earth's surface and the complicated phe-
nomena to which they give rise, that sound conclusions can be established ; and

this study constitutes Physical or Scientific Geogi-aphy. It is very necessary to

bear in mind that a large portion of the phenomena dealt with by the sciences
of observation relates to the earth as a whole in contradistinction to the substances
of which it is formed, and can only be correctly appreciated in connexion with the
terrestrial or geographical conditions of the place where they occur. On the one
hand therefore, while the proper prosecution of the study of Physical Geography
requires a sound Icnowledge of the researches and conclusions of students in the
special branches of science, on the other success is not attainable in the special
branches without suitable apprehension of geographical facts. For these reasons it

appears to me that the general progi-ess of science will involve the study of Geo-

graphy in a more scientific spirit, and with a clearer conception of its true function,
which is that of obtaining accurate notions of the manner in which the forces of
nature have brought about the varied conditions characterizing the surface of the

planet which we inhabit.

    In its broadest sense Science is organized knowledge, and its methods consist of

the observation and classification of the phenomena of which" we become conscious

through our senses, and the investigation of the causes of which these are the effects.
The first step in Geography, as in all other sciences, is the observation and descrip-
tion of the phenomena with which it is concerned ; the next is to classify and coni-
fare this empirical collection of facts, and to investigate their antecedent causes,

  t is in the first branch of the study that most progress has been made, and to it
indeed the notion of Geography is still popularly limited. The other branch is
commonly spoken of as Physical Geography, but it is more correctly the science

 of Geogi-aphy.

    The progi'ess of Geography has thus advanced from first rough ideas of relative
 distance between neighbom-ing places, to correct views of the earth's form, precise
 determinations of position, and accurate delineations of the surface. The first im-

 pressions of the ditferences observed between distant countries were at length cor-
 rected by the perception of similarities no less real. The characteristics of the great
 regions of polar cold and equatorial heat, of the sea and land, of the mountains
 and plains, were appreciated ; and the local variations of season and climate, of wind
 and rain, were more or less fully ascertained. Later, the distribution of plants and
 animals, their occurrence in groups of peculiar structure in various regions, and the
 circumstances under which such groups vary from place to place gave rise to fresh

 conceptions. Along with these facts were observed the peculiarities of the races

-- --of men their physical form, languages, customs, and history exhibiting on the

 one hand striking diflferences in difierent countries, but on the other often con-

 nected by a strong stamp of similarity over large areas.

    By the gradual accumulation and classification of such knowledge the scientific

 conception of geographical unity and continuity was at length formed, and the con-

  clusion established that while each different part of the earth's surface has its special

 characteristics, all animate and inanimate nature constitutes one general system,

  and that the particular features of each region are due to the operation of universal
 laws acting under varying local conditions. It is upon such a conception that is

 now brought to bear the doctrine, very generally accepted by the naturalists of our
 own country, that each successive phase of the earth's history, for an indefinite

  period of time, has been derived from that which preceded it, under the operation

 of the forces of nature as we now find them ; and that, so far as observation justifies

  the adoption of any conclusions on such subjects, no change has ever taken place in

  those forces or iu the properties of matter. This doctrine is commonly spoken of
  as the doctrine of evolution, and it is to its application to Geography that I wish to

  direct your attention.

    I desire here to remark that in what I am about to say, I altogether leave

  on one side all questions relating to the origin of matter, and of the so-called forces of
  natm-e which give rise to the properties of matter. In the present state of know-

  ledge such subjects are, I conceive, beyond the legitimate field of physical science,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

182 REPORT--1875.

wliich is limited to discussions directly arising on facts within the reach of obser-
vation, or on reasonings based on such facts. It is a necessary condition of the
progress of knowledge that the line between what properly is or is not within the

reach of human intelligence is ill defined, and that opinions will vary as to where it
should be drawn ; for it is the avowed and successful aim of science to keep this
line constantly shifting by pushing it forward ; many of the efforts made to do this

are no doubt founded in error, but all are deserving of respect that are imdertaken

honestly.

   The conception of evolution is essentially that of a passage to the state of
things which observation shows us to exist now, from some preceding state
of things. Applied to Geography, that is to say to the present condition of
the earth as a whole, it leads up to the conclusion that the existing outlines of sea
and land have been caused by modifications of pre-existing oceans and continents,
brought about by the operation of forces which are still in action, and which have

--acted from the most remote past of which we can conceive ; that all the successive

forms of the surface, the depressions occupied by the waters, and the elevations

--constituting mountain- chains, are due to these same forces ; that these have been

set up, fu-st, by the secidar loss of heat which accompanied the oi'iginal cooling of the
globe, and second, by the annual or daily gain and loss of heat received from
the sun acting on the matter of which the earth and its atmosphere are composed
that all variations of climate are dependent on differences in the condition of the
siu^face ; that the distribution of life on the earth, and the vast varieties of its forms,
are consequences of contemporaneous or antecedent changes of the forms of the surface

and climate ; and thus that our planet as we now find it is the result of modifi-

cations gradually brought about in its successive stages, by the necessary action of
the matter out of which it has been formed, imder the influence of the matter
which is external to it.

   I shall state briefly the grounds on which these conclusions are based.
   So far as concerns the inorganic fabric of the earth, that view of its past history

which is based on the principle of the persistence of all the forces of nature, may
be said to be now universally adopted. This teaches that the almost infinite variety
of natural phenomena arises from new combinations of old forms of matter, imder
the action of new combinations of old forms of force. Its recognition has, however,

been comparatively recent, and is in a great measure due to the teachings of that

eminent geologist, the late Sir Charles Lyell, whom we have lost during the past

year.

   When we look back by the help of geological science to the more remote past,

through the epochs immediately preceding our own, we find evidence of marine

-- --animals which lived, were reproduced, and died, posssessed of organs proving

that they were under the influence of the heat and light of the sun ; of seas whose
waves rose before the winds, breaking down cliffs, and forming beaches of boidders
and pebbles ; of tides and ciu-rents spreading out banks of sand and mud, on which
are left the impress of the ripple of the water, of drops of rain, and of the trade of

animals ; and all these appearances are precisely similar to those we observe at the
present day as the result of forces which we see actually in operation. Every suc-
cessive stage, as we recede in the past history of the earth, teaches the same lesson.
The forces which are now at work, whether in degi-ading the surface by the action

of seas, rivers, or frosts, and in transporting its fragments into the sea, or in recon-
stituting the land by raising beds laid out in the depth of the ocean, are traced by
similar effects as having continued in action from the earliest times.

   Thus pushing back om- inquuies we at last reach the point where the apparent
cessation of teiTcstrial conditions such as now exist requires us to consider the

relation in which our planet stands to other bodies in celestial space ; and vast
though the gulf be that separates us from these, science has been able to bridge it.

By means of specti'oscopic analysis it has been established that the constituent

 elements of the sim and other heavenly bodies are substantially the same as those
 of the earth. The examination of the meteorites which have fallen on the eartli
 from the interplanetary spaces shows that they also contain nothicg foreign to
 the constituents of the earth. The inference seems legitimate, coiToborated as it is
 by the manifest physical connexion between the sim and the planetary bodies
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  183

circulating around it, that the whole solar system is formed of the same descrip-
tions of matter, and subject to the same general physical laws. These conclu-
sions further support the supposition that the earth and other planets have been
formed by the aggi-egatiou of matter once diflhsed in space around the smi ; that
the first consequence of this aggi'egation was to develop intense heat in the con-
solidating masses; that the heat thus generated in the terrestrial sphere was
subsequently lost by radiation ; and that the surface cooled and became a solid

crust, leaving a central nucleus of much higher temperature within. The earth's
surface appears now to have reached a temperature which is virtually fixed, and

on which the gain of heat from the sun is, on the whole, just compensated by the

loss by radiation into suri'ouuding space.
   Such a conception of the earliest stage of the earth's existence is commonly

accepted, as in accordance with observed facts. It leads to the conclusion that the
hollows on the surface of the globe occupied by the ocean, and the great areas of
di'y land, were original irregularities of form caused by unequal contraction ; and
that the mountains were coi-rugations, often accompanied by ruptures, caused by

the strains developed in the external crust by the force of central attraction exerted
during cooling, and were not due to forces directly acting upwards generated in
the interior by gases or otherwise. It has recently been very ably ai'gued by Mr.
Mallet that the phenomena of volcanic heat are likewise consequences of extreme
pressm-es in the external crust, set up in a similar manner, and are not derived from

the central heated nucleus.

   There may be some difficulty in conceiving how forces can have been thus

developed sufficient to have produced the gigantic changes which have occmTed
in the distribution of land and water over immense areas, aud in the elevation

of the bottoms of former seas so that they now fomi the summits of the highest

mountains, and to have effected such changes within the very latest geological

epoch. These difficulties in great measure arise from not employing correct

standards of space and time in relation to the phenomena. Vast though the gi'eatest

heights of our moimtains and depths of om* seas may be, and enormous though
the masses which have been put into motion, when viewed according to a human

standard, they are insignificant in relation to the globe as a whole. Such heights
and depths (about 6 miles) on a sphere of 10 feet in diameter would be repre-
 sented on a true scale by elevations and depressions of less than the tenth part of
 an inch, and the average elevation of the whole of the dry land (about 1000 feet)
 above the mean level of the siu'face would hardly amount to the thickness of an ordi-
 nary sheet of paper. The forces developed by the changes of the temperature of the
 earth as a whole must be proportionate to its dimensions ; and the results of their

 action on the sm'face in causing elevations, contortions, or disruptions of the strata,
 cannot be commensurable with those produced by forces having the intensities, or
 by strains in bodies of the dimensions, with which om- ordinary experience is con-

  versant.

    The difficulty in respect to the vast extent of past time is perhaps less gi'eat, the
 conception being one with which most persons are now more or less familiar. But I
 would remind you, that great though the changes in human affairs have been since
 the most remote epochs of which we have records in monuments or history, there

 is nothing to indicate that within this period has occun-ed any appreciable modifi-
. cation of the main outlines of land and sea, or of the conditions of climate, or of
 the general characters of living creatures ; and that the distance that separates us

 from those days is as nothing when compared to the remoteness of past geological
 ages. No useful approach has yet been made to a numerical estimate ofthe diu-a-
 tion even of that portion of geological time which is nearest to us ; and we can say
 little more than that the earth's past history extends over himdi'cds of thousand's

  or millions of years.

    The solid nucleus of the earth with its atmosphere, as we now find them, may

 thus be regarded as exhibiting the residual phenomena which have resulted on its

  attaining a condition of practical equilibrium, the more active process ol
  aggregation having ceased, and the combination of its elements into the various
  solid, liquid, or gaseous matters found on or near the surface having been completed.

  During its passage to its present state many wonderful changes must have taken

place, including the condensation of tlie ocean, which must have long continued in
a state of ebullition, or bordering on it, surrounded by an atmosphere densely
charged with watery vapour. Apart from the movements in its solid crust caused
by the general cooling and contraction of the earth, the higher temperature
due to its earlier condition hardly enters directly into any of the considerations
that arise in connexion with its present climate, or with the changes during past
time which are of most interest to us ; for the conditions of climate and temperature
at present, as well as in the period during which the existence of life is indicated
by the presence of fossil remains, and which have affected the production and distri-
bution of organized beings, are dependent on other causes, to a consideration of

which I now proceed.
   The natm-al phenomena relating to the atmosphere are often exti-emely

complicated and difficult of explanation; and meteorology is the least ad-

vanced of the branches of physical science. But sufficient is known to indicate,

without possible doubt, that the primary causes of the great series of pheno-
mena, included under the general term climate, are the action and reaction of the
mechanical and chemical forces set in operation by the sun's heat, varied from
time to time and from place to place, by the influence of the position of the earth
in its orbit, of its revolution on its axis, of geographical position, elevation above
the sea-level, and condition of the surface, and by the great mobility of the
atmosphere and the ocean.

   The intimate connexion between climate and local geographical conditions is
everywhere apparent ; nothing is more striking than the great differences between
neighbouring places where the effective local conditions are not alike, which
often far surpass the contrasts attending the widest separation possible on the globe.
Three or four miles of vertical height produce effects almost equal to those of
transfer from the equator to the poles. The distribution of the great seas and con-

-- --tinents give rise to periodical winds the trades and monsoons which main-

tain their general characteristics over wide areas, but present almost infinite
local modifications whether of season, direction, or force. The direction of the coasts
and their greater or less continuity greatly influence the flow of the currents of the
ocean ; and tlie.se, with the periodical winds, tend on the one hand to equalize the
temperature of the whole sm-face of the earth, aud on the other to cause surprising
variations withiu a limited area. Ranges of mountains, and their position in
relation to the periodical or rain-bearing winds, are of primary importance in con-
trolling the movements of the lower strata of the atmosphere, in which, owing to
the laws of elastic gases, the great mass of the air and watery vapour are concen-

trated. By their presence they may either constitute a barrier across which no

rain can pass, or determine the fall of torrents of rain around them. Their absence

or then- unfavom-able position, by removing the causes of condensation, may lead to

the neighbouring tracts becoming rainless deserts.
    The difficulties that arise in accounting for the phenomena of climate on the

earth as it now is, are naturally increased when the attempt is made to explain
what is shown by geological evidence to have happened in past ages. The dis-

position has not been wanting to get over these last difficulties by invoking supposed
changes in the sources of terrestrial heat, or in the conditions under which heat has
been received by the earth, for which there is no justification in fact, in a manner
similar to that in which violent departures from the observed com-se of natm-e have
been assumed to account for some of the analogous mechanical difficulties.

   Among the most perplexing of such climatal problems are those involved in the

former extension of glacial action of various sorts over areas which could hardly have
been subject to it under existing terrestrial and solar conditions; and in the dis-
covery, conversely, of indications of far higher temperatm-es at certain places than
seems compatible with their high latitudes; and in the alternations of such
extreme conditions. The true solution of these questions has apparently been
found in the recognition of the disturbing effects of the varying eccentricity of the
earth's orbit, which, though inappreciable in the comparatively few years to which

the afiau'S of men are limited, become of great importance iu the vastly increased
period brought into consideration when dealing with the history of the earth. The

changes of eccentricity of the orbit are not of a natm-e to cause appreciable differences

in the meau temperature either of the eai-th generally or of the two hemispheres ; but

they may, wlieu combined -with changes of the direction of the eai'th's axis caused

by the precession of tlie equinoxes and nutation, lead to exaggeration of the
extremes of heat and cold, or to their diminution ; and this would appeal- to sup-

ply the means of explaining the observed facts, though doubtless the detailed ap-

plication of the conception will long continue to give rise to discussions. Rii-.
(Jroll, in his book entitled ' Climate and Time,' has recently brought together with

much research all that can now be said on this subject; and the general correctness

of that part of his conclusions which refers to the periodical occm-rence of epochs
of gi-eatly increased winter cold and summer heat in one hemisphere, combined

with a more equable climate in the other, appears to me to be fully established.

   These are the considerations which are held to prove that the inorganic

--structure of the globe through all its successive stages the earth beneath our

feet, with its varied surface of land and sea, mountain and plain, and with its at-

--mosphere which distributes heat and moistm-e over that surface, has been evolved

as the necessary result of the original aggi-egation of matter at some extremely re-
mote period, and of the subsequent modification of that matter in condition and

form under the exclusive operation of invariable physical forces.

   From these investigations we carry on the inquiry to the li'sdng creatures found
upon the earth ; what are their relations one to another, and what to the inorganic

world with which they are associated ?
   This inquiry first du'ected to the present time, and thence carried backwards as

far as possible into the past, proves that there is one general sj'stem of life,

vegetable and animal, which is coextensive with the earth as it now is, and as it
has been in all the successive stages of which we obtain a knowledge by geolo-
gical research. The phenomena of life, as thus ascertained, are included in the
organization of living creatm-es, and their distribution in time and place. The
common bond that subsists between all vegetables and animals is testified by the

identity of the ultimate elements of which they are composed. These elements are
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with a few others in comparatively small
quantities; the v^hole of the materials of all living things being found among

those that compose the inorganic portion of the earth.
   The close relation existing between the least specialized animals and plants,

and between these and organic matter not having life, and even with inorganic

matter, is indicated by the difficulty that arises in determining the nature of the

distinctions between them. Among the more highly developed members of the two

great branches of living creatures, the well-known similarities of structure observed
in the various groups indicate a connexion between proximate forms which was

long seen to be akin to that derived through descent from a common ancestor by

ordinary generation.

   The facts of distribution show that certain forms are associated in certain
areas, and that as we pass from one such area to another the forms of life
change also. The general assemblages of living creatm-es in neighbouring countries
easily accessible to one another, and having similar climates, resemble one
another ; and much in the same way, as the distance between areas increases, or

their mutual accessibilit}' diminishes, or the conditions of climate differ, the like-
ness of the forms within them becomes continually less apparent. The plants and
animals existing at any time in any locality tend constantly to diffiise themselves
around that local centre, this tendency being controlled by the conditions of
climate, &c. of the surrounding area, so that imder certain unfavourable conditions

diffusion ceases.

The possibilities of life are further seen to be everywhere directly influenced by

all external conditions, such as those of climate, including temperatm-e, humidit}',

and wind ;  of  the length of the  seasons and  days and  nights                            of  the character of
                                                                                         ;

the surface whether it be laud or water, and whether it be covered by vegetation

or otherwise ; of the natm-e of the soil ; of tlie presence of other living creatures,

and many more. The abundance of forms of life in different ai-eas (as distinguished

from number of individuals) is also found to vary greatly, and to be related to the

accessibility of such areas to immigration from without ; to the existence, within

or near the areas, of localities offering considerable variations of the condidc ns that

cliiefly aifect life ; and to the local climate and conditions being compatible with

such immigration.

   For the explanation of these and other phenomena of organization and distri-
bution, the only direct evidence that observation can supply is that derived from

the mode of propagation of creatures now living ; and no other mode is known

than that which takes place by ordinary generation, through descent from parent

to offspring.

   It was left for the genius of Darwin to point out how the com-se of nature

as it now acts in the reproduction of living creatures, is sufficient for the inter-
pretation of what had previously been incomprehensible in these matters. He

showed how propagation by descent operates subject to the occurrence of certain

small variations in the offspring, and that the preservation of some of these
varieties to the exclusion of others follows as a necessary consequence when

the external conditions are more suitable to the preserved forms than to those lost.

The operation of these causes he called Natural Selection. Prolonged over a gi'eat

extent of time it supplies the long-sought key to the complex system of forms

either now living on the earth, or the remains of which are foimd in the fossil

state, and explains the relations among them, and the manner in which their

distribution has taken place in time and space.

Thus we are brought to the conclusion that the directing forces which have been

efficient in developing the existing forms of life from those which went before

them, are those same successive external conditions, including both the forms of

land and sea and the character of the climate, which have already been showxi

to arise from the gi-adual modification of the material fabric of the globe as it

slowly attained to its present state. In each succeeding epoch, and in each

separate locality, the forms preserved and handed on to the future were deter-

mined  by  the  general conditions  of  siu-face at  the  time  and place                                          and  the
                                                                                                                ;

aggi'egate of successive sets of conditions over the whole eirth's sm-face has

determined the entire series of forms which have existed in the past and have

siu-vived till now.

   As we recede from the present into the past, it necessarily follows, as a

consequence of the ultimate f'ailm-e of all evidence as to the conditions of the past,
that positive testimony of the conformity of the facts with the principle of evo-

lution gradually diminishes, and at length ceases. In the same way positive evi-

dence of the continuity of action of all the physical forces of nature eventually fails.

But inasmuch as the e-vddence, so far as it can be procured, supports the belief in this
continuity of action, and as we have no experience of the contrary being possible,
the only justifiable conclusion is, that the production of life must have been going
on as we now Iniow it, without any intermission, from the time of its first appear-

ance on the earth.
   These considerations manifestly afford no sort of clue to the origin of life. They

only serve to take us back to a very remote epoch, when the living creatures
differed greatly in detail from those of the present time, but had such resem-
blances to them as to justify the conclusion that the essence of life then was the
same as now ; and through that epoch into an imlmown anterior period, during
which the possibility of life, as we understand it, began, and from which has
emerged, in a way that we cannot comprehend, matter with its properties, bound
together by what we call the elementary physical forces. There seems to be no
foundation in any observed fact for suggesting that the wonderful property which

we call life appertains to the combinations of elementary substances in association

with which it is exclusively foimd, otherwise than as all other properties appertain
to the particular forms or combinations of matter with which they are associated.

It is no more possible to say how originated or operates the tendency of some sorts

of matter to take the form of vapours, or fluids, or solid bodies, in all their various
shapes, or for the various sorts of matter to attract one another or combine, than it

is to explain the origin in certain forms of matter of the property we call life, or the
mode of its action. For the present, at least, we must be content to accept such
facts as the foundation of positive knowledge, and from them to rise to the appre-

hension of the means by which nature has reached its present state, and is ad-

vancing into an unknown futnre.

These conceptions of the relations of animal and vegetable forms to the earth

in its successive stages- lead to views of the significance of type (i. e. the general

system of structm-e running through various groups of organized beings) very

different from those under -which it -was held to be an indication of some occult

power dii-ectiug the successive appearance of li\'iug creatm-es on the earth. In the

light of evolution, type is nothmg more than the direction given to the actual

development of life by the sm-foce-conditions of the earth, which have supplied the

forces that controlled the course of the successive generations leading from the past

to the present. There is no indication of any inherent or pre-arranged disposition

towards the development of life in any particular direction. It would rather

appear that the actual face of natin-e is the result of a succession of apparently

trivial incidents,which by some very slight alteration of local circimistances might

often, it would seem, have been tm-ned in a difterent direction. Some otherwise

unimportant difference in the constitution or sequence of the substrata at any

locality might have determined the elevation of mountains where a hollow filled

by the sea was actually formed, and thereby the whole of the climatal and other

conditions of a large area would have been changed, and an entirely different

impulse given to the development of life locally, which might have impressed a
now character on the whole face of nature.

   But further, all that we see or know to have existed upon the earth has been

controlled to its most minute details by the original constitution of the matter

which was dra-wn together to form oiu- planet. The actual character of all in-

organic substances, as of all living creatm-es, is only consistent witli the actual

constitution and proportions of the various substances of which the earth is com-

posed. Other proportions than the actual ones in the constituents of the atmo-

sphere would have required an entirely different organization in all air-breathing

animals, and probably in all plants. With any considerable difference in the quan-

tity of water either in the sea or distributed as vapour, vast changes in the consti-

tution of living creatures must have been involved. Without oxygen, hydrogen,

nitrogen, or carbon, what we term life would have been impossible. But such

.speculations need not be extended.

The substances of wliich the earth is now composed are identical with those of

which it has always been made up ; so far as is known it has lost nothing and has
gained nothing, except what has been added in extremely minute quantities by the

fall of meteorites. All that is or ever has been upon the earth is part of the earth,

has sprung from the earth, is sustained by the earth, and returns to the earth ; taking
back thither what it withdrew, making good the materials on which life depends,

without which it would cease, and which are destined again to enter into new forms,

and contribute to the ever onward flow of the great current of existence.

   The progress of knowledge has removed all doubt as to the relation in which the

human race stands to this great stream of life. It is now established that man
existed on the earth at a period vastly anterior to any of which we have records in
history or otherwise. He was the contemporary of many extinct mammalia at a
time when the outlines of laud and sea, and the conditions of climate over large

parts of the earth, were wholly difterent from what they now are, and our race has

been advancing towards its present condition during a series of ages for the extent

of which ordinary conceptions of time afford no suitable measure. These facts

have, in recent years, given a difterent direction to opinion as to the manner in

which the great groups of mauldnd have become distributed over the areas where

thej"^ are now found ; and difficulties once considered insuperable become soluble
when regarded in couuexion with those great alterations of the outlines of land

and sea which ai'e shown to have beeu going on up to the very latest geological
periods. The ancient monuments of Egypt, which take us back perhaps 7000
years from the present time, indicate that when they were erected the neighboiuing

countries were in a condition of civilization not very greatly difterent from that

which existed when they fell imder the dominion of the Romans or Mahometans

hardlj' 1500 years ago ; and the progress of the population towards that condition
can hardly be accounted for otherwise than by prolonged gradual transformations

going back to times so far distant as to require a geological rather than an histori-

cal standard of reckoning,

Man, in short, takes liis place with the rest of the animate world, in the advan-

cing front of which he occupies so conspicuous a position. *Yet for this position he

is indebted not to any exclusive powers of his own, but to the wonderful compelling

forces of nature which have lifted him entirely without his knowledge, and almost

without his participation, so far above the animals of whom he is still one, though

the only one able to see or consider what he is.

For the social habits essential to his progress, which he possessed even in his

most primitive state, man is withoiit question dependent on his ancestors, as

he is for his form and other physical peculiarities. In his advance to civiliza-

tion he was insensibly forced, by the pressure of external circumstances, through

the more savage condition, in which his life was that of the hunter, first

to pastoral and then to agricultural occupations. The requirements of a popula-

tion gradually increasing in numbers could only be met hy a supply of food

more regular and more abundant than could be provided by the chase. But

the possibility of the change from the hunter to the shepherd or herdsman rested on

the antecedent existence of animals suited to supply man with food, having gre-

garious habits, and fitted for domestication, such as sheep, goats, and horned cattle

for their support the social grasses were a necessary preliminary, and for the

growth of these in sufficient abundance laud naturally suitable for pasture was re-

Aquired.  fui'ther evasion of man's growing difficulty in obtaining sufficient food

was secured by aid of the cereal grasses, which supplied the means by which agri-

cultiu'e, the outcome of pastoral life, became the chief occupation of more civilized

generations. Lastly, when these increased facilities for providing food were in turn

overtaken by the growth of the population, new power to cope with the recurring

difficulty was gained through the cultivation of mechanical arts and of thought, for

which the needful leism-e was for the first time obtained when the earliest steps of

civilization had removed the necessity for unremitting search after the means of

supporting existence. Then was broken down the chief barrier in the way of

progress, and man was carried forward to the condition in which he now is.

It is impossible not to recognize that the growth of civilization, by aid of its in-

struments, pastoral and agricultural industry, was the residt of the unconscious

adoption of defences supjDlied by what was exterior to man, rather than of any truly

intelligent steps taken with forethought to attain it ; and in these respects man,

in his struggle for existence, has not diflered from the humbler animals or from plants.

Neither can the marvellous vdtimate gi'owth of his knowledge, and his acquisition

of the power of applying to his use all that lies without him, be viewed as differing

in any thing but form or degree from the earlier steps in his advance. The needful

--protection against the foes of his constantly increasing race the legions of hunger

--and disease, infinite in number, ever changing then mode of attack or springing up

in new shapes could only be attained by some fresh adaptation of his organization

to his wants, and this has taken the form of that development of intellect which has

placed all other creatures at his feet and all the powers of nature in his hand.

The picture that I have thus attempted to draw presents to us our earth carrying-

with it, or receiving from the sun or other external bodies, as it travels through

celestial space, all the materials and all the forces by help of which are fashioned
Wewhatever we see upon it.
                            may liken it to a great complex living organism,

having an inert substratum of inorganic matter on which are formed many separate

organized centres of life, but all bound up together by a common law of existence,

each individual part depending on those around it, and on the past condition of the

whole. Science is the study of the relations of the several parts of this

organism one to another, and of the parts to the whole. It is the task of the geo-

grapher to bring together from all places on the earth's surface the materials from

which shall be deduced the scientific conception of nature. Geography supplies the

rough blocks wherewith to build up that grand structure towards the completion of

which science is striving. The traveller, who is the iom'neyman of science, collects

from all quarters of the earth observations of fact, to be submitted to the research of

the student, and to provide the necessary means of verifying the inductions obtained

by study or the hypotheses suggested by it. If, therefore, travellers are to fulfil the

duties put upon them by the division of scientific labour, they must maintain

their Imowledge of the several branches of science at such a standard as will

enable them thoroughly to apprehend what are the present requirements of

science, and the classes of fact on which fresh observation must be brought to

bear to secure its advance. Nor does this involve any impracticable course of

study. Such knowledge as will fit a traveller for usefully participating in the

progi'ess of science is now placed within the reach of every one. The lustre

of that energy and self-devotion which characterize the better class of explorers

enable them to bring away from distant regions enlarged conceptions of other

Howmatters besides mere distance and direction.  great is the value to science

testified by the labours of many living natm-alists. In our days this is especially

true ; and I appeal to all who desire to promote the progress of geographical science

the vigour and physical powers that so mucli conduce to success in such pursvuts.

On the Physical Geography of iSontJi Africa, and Products and Prospects of
                 the Cape of Good Hope. By J. C. Beown, LL.D.

   The contour of South Africa has been likened to an inverted dinner-plate, on
the rim of which the colonies are situated. It has apparently been upheaved in

a mass. Much of it is covered by bushes of no great height ; but differences of

soil are indicated by other productions. Lignite and coal, copper and gold, rubies
and diamonds are found in difterent localities. Forests appear to have been much
more extensive than now. Corn and wine are produced. At present the inhabi-
tants are to a great extent pastoral ; but this is apparently a temporary and transi-
tional preparation for agriculture, for which are required moisture, labour, capital,
skill, and facilities for the transport of agricultural products at moderate expense.
Labour is being drawn to South Africa by diamonds and gold. Capital is being in-
creased by the investment of money obtained for these ; railways are rapidly extended;

and much water, which might be secured and utilized; at present escapes to the sea.

On tlie late Inundations in France vieived in connexion with Rehoisement

   and Gazonnement on the Alps, Cevennes, and Pyrenees, employed as

  a means of ccctinyuishing and preventing the Formation of Torrents. By

   J. C. Bkown, LL.D.

In 1793 Fabre showed that torrents were attributable to the destruction of forests

on the mountains. In 1841 Sarell showed that torrents appear and disappear as
forests were destroj-ed and reproduced. In 1872 Cezanne showed that this relation

between forests and floods can be traced from preadamitic times to the present.

In accordance with these views, in 1860 arrangements were made by the Govern-

ment for an expenditure of ten million of francs in planting with trees and bushes
and herbage mountain gTOund drained by torrents ; and vrithin ten years torrents

which were most destructive had become placid perennial streams. The Alpine

torrents are occasioned in autumn by storms of rain, and in spring by the melting

of snow. The late inundations were occasioned by a storm of rain causing a melting

of snow, and the substance of both flowing away simultaneously. Had the basins

drained been covered with forests the flood would have been delayed and warnino-

might have been given, and the flood would have been protracted, and it might

have occnn-ed without rising above the level of the river-banks.

The rehoisement of all the bassin de reception of mountain-torrents has been

begun. Previous to the war a million of francs a year were being spent upon the
Awork.
        selection of localities had to be made ; the propriety of the selection made

has never been questioned, and the magnitude of the disaster whicli has occurred

may be considered to justify the expediting of the work at even a greater expendi-

ture than was incurred during the first decade of the operations.

On South- African Torrential Floods viewed in connexion with the late Inun-
   dations in the Valley of the Garonne and its Affluences, and Pleasures
   adopted in France to prevent such Floods. Bij J. C. Beown, LL.D.

   The aridity of South Africa is extreme ; it is attributable primarily to the drain-
age consequent on upheaval, and secondarily to evaporation, promoted by the
destruction of vegetation mainly by fire ; and in so far it is typical of many other
colonized lands. But withal, as is also the case with many of these, there are

frequent occasional floods and very destructive inundations. These are occasioned,
like the autumn torrents in the Alps, by storms of rain. The production of torrents

by these has in many localities been prevented by planting the basin drained by
them with trees and shrubs and herbage. The operation of these in producing
their efi'ect has been ascertained. From this it appears to be reasonable that they
would be also efficacious in regulating the fiow of torrents elsewhere ; and the

losses of life and property reported as consequences of such inundations, warrant a
large expenditm-e as preventive measures, as is incurred in France, to prevent by
such means the occurrence of such inundations as have lately occurred in the

                          On the North-west African Expedition.
                         By General Sir Arthur Cottos-, B.E.

    There are now thirteen or fourteen expeditions, either actually penetrating

 Central Africa or preparing to start, from five or six different countries j all the

 fi'uit of Livingstone's leading.

   Why should a hundi'ed millions of our fellow men be shut out from inter-

 com-se with the civilized races ? And how could a young man propose to himself a

 more worthy enterprise than Mr. M'Kenzie has of bringing Timbuctoo -within easy
 reach of England ?

    The testimony of several witnesses seems conclusive as to a great area between
 the Atlas mountains and the Niger being below the level of the sea, and separated
 from it only by a short space. Its extremity near the sea is about 10 miles wide,
 and covered with a crust of salt. The tribes of the country surrounding this
 depression are stated to be very hospitable and tractable. Tliis direct line of
 commimication -with Timbuctoo was strongly recommended by Mr. Jackson, a
 merchant who resided on the coast many years (60 j'ears ago), and his plans
 were strongly supported by Vasco de Gama and Mr. Willis, formerly Consul at

  Senegambia.
     Such a direct and cheap line of transit would greatly increase the present large

 traffic which is brought from the Mediterranean, the direct line being not only the
  shortest but the healthiest and most free from other difficulties.

     This is the best land-route incomparably ; but the great question is, whether the
 inland sea cannot be restored. The nature and extent of the bar at the mouth of
 what is called the Belta, the level and actual area of the depression, the quantity

 of water flowing into it, &c., are the points now to be ascertained ; also how

  near shelter for shipping is to be found on the coast.

   Another point is the practicability of the Niger for navigation. It is now navi-
gable by steaniera for 500 miles, thence to Timbuctoo 1000, and above that may be

navigable for 500 more.

  A complete line of navigation from the Atlantic by the inland sea, a canal to

the Niger, and down the Niger, in all 2300 miles, woidd open the whole region.
   Mr. M'Kenzie proposes to go first to the coast and ascertain what he can

without penetrating far, then to return and report to the public, and propose
for a thorough exploration of the whole line from the Atlantic to Timbuctoo and

round to the Bight of Benin.

   There are probably twenty millions of people in North-western Africa, many of

whom would be affected by this enterprise.

   The probable ultimate effects of an inland sea on the surrounding country and
on South Europe is not the question at present; but we need information to jus-
tify us in further investigation. If the area is as great as represented, an immense
body of water would be required ; but while it was filling it would be available

so far as the water extended.

   The south side of this depression is a fertile and populous country with two large

towns, dividing the district into three portions of about 300 miles each ; so that

there does not appear any great obstacle to the land carriage.
   The point proposed to be occupied on the coast is at present without any

inhabitants, being south of the kingdom of Morocco, and there appears nothing in
the way of our establishing a depot there.

   The establishment of English missions and commercial depots on this line would
greatly support our operations on the Gold Coast. Both the colonial and foreign

offices have expressed an interest in the undertaking.

   On the ' Challenger's ' Crucial Test of the Wind and Gravitation Theories
       of Oceanic Circulation*. By Jajtes Croll, of H.M. Geol. Survey.

 --North Atlantic. The researches of the ' Challenger ' expedition bring to light

the striking and important fiict that the general surface of the North Atlantic, to
be in equilibrium, must stand at a higher level than that of the ocean at the
equator. In other words, the surface of the Atlantic is lowest at the eqtiatoi-, and

--rises with a gentle slope to well nigh the latitude of England a residt which proves

the physical impossibility, in so fai- as the North Atlantic is concerned, of any
general interchange of equatorial and polar water due to gravitation.

   In order to establish this point a section was taken of the INlid-Atlantic, north
and south, across the equator, viz. that section adopted by Dr. Carpenter as the
one of all others most favom'able to the gi-avitation theory t-

  On looking at this section the author was forcibly struck that, if it was accu-

rately di-awn, the ocean, to be in eqmlibrium, would require to stand at a higher
level in the North Atlantic than at the equator. To determine whether such was
the case or not the temperatm-e-soundings indicated in the section were obtained

--from the Hydi-ographer of the Admiralty. The following Table (p. 192) gives the

soundings in question at three stations the first (A) at latitude 38° N., the second
(B) at latitude 23° N., and the third (C) at the equator.

   On computing the extent to which the three columns A, B, and C are each

expanded by heat, accordipg to Mimcke's Table of the expansion of sea-water for
every degree Fahrenheit, lit was found that column B, to be in equilibrium with

column C (the equatoriaJ»WJiumu), would require to have its siu-face standing

A2 feet 6 inches above the level of column C, and column fully 3 feet 6 inches

above that column. In short, there must be a gradual rise from the equator to
latitude 38° N. of 3^ feet. Professor Hubbard's Table of expansion gives almost
the same result. Difference in salinity of the columns produces scarcely any

sensible effect.

rora ' show iliat the North Pacific is much colder than the North Atlantic, and
tliat the immense stratum of warm water found in the latter is wanting- in the
North Pacific. But as the North Pacific is almost entirely cut off" frona the cold

Arctic basin, its waters, according- to the gravitation theory, instead of being

colder, ought to be much warmer than those of the Atlantic. It is found also
that the North Pacific is actually warmer at latitude 52° than at latitude 43°, a
fact also inconsistent with the gi-avitation theory, but easily explained by the wind

--theory.
   TJie Southern Ocean. The thermal condition of the Southern Ocean, as ascertained
by the ' OhalleDger ' Expedition, appears also in-econcilable with the gravitation
theory. Between the parallels of latitude 65° 42' S. and 50° 1' S. the ocean, with
the exception of a thin stratum at the surface heated by the sun's rays, was found,
down to the depth of about 200 fathoms, to be several degrees colder than the water
underneath. But, according- to the gravitation theory, the colder water should be

underneath.

   The very fact of a mass of water 200 fathoms deep, and extending over 15° of
latitude, remaining above water of 3° or 4° higher temperature, shows how little
influence ditt'erence of temperature has in producing motion. If it had the potency
which some attribute to it, one would suppose that this cold stratum should sink

down and displace the warm water underneath. If difference of density is suffi-
cient to move the water horizontally, surely it must be more than sufficient to

cause it to sink vertically.

  Himalayan Glaciers. By Colonel T. G. Montgomeeie, B.E., F.R.S,, c^-c.

   The author made a brief reference to the general geography of India and
the Himalayas. He pointed out the very great progress which had been made
with the geography of Northern India, the Punjab, &c. since 1842, and more espe-
cialty as to the exploration and survey of the VVestern Himalayas. In order to
illustrate his paper lie exhibited a large map of the Western Himalayas, showing-
the whole of the glaciers and the complete breadth of the Himala3'an sj'stem from
the Punjab to the plains of Eastern Turkistan, near Yarkund. Tlie peaks and
glaciers of this superalpine region were fm-lher illustrated by three large coloured
sketches of portions of the Mustagh and Karakoram mountains, and by a section
taken right through the moimtains, which at this their nan-owest part are 400 miles
in breadth. He pointed out that the glaciers gradually increased in size from east

to west, reaching their greatest development in the Mustagh range, where there
are several glaciers over 20 miles in length, and the Biafo glacier 34 miles in length,
and a great many from 10 to 20 miles in length. From a glance at the map it
could he gathered that these glaciers covered a very large area. Colonel Mont-
gomerie pointed out what a very important feature they formed in the geography
of Asia, not only in a scientific point of view, but in a practical one, as they formed

--a vast natm-al resei-voir, which provided an unfailing supply of water in a tropical

coimtry at a pei-iod when it was most wanted that is, between the spring and the
fall of the summer rains.

   Colonel Montgomerie pointed out that the Himalayan peaks rose to twice the
height of those in the Alps, and that the glaciers were more than fom- times as
long as those in the Alps, the Mer-de-glace (the longest) being hardly 8 miles in
length, while those in the Himalayas were of all lengths up to 34 miles.

To the north-west of China proper lies a broad belt of hilly sandy deserts, 1400

miles in extent from east to west, which from the earliest historical times was a

gathering-ground for the nomads of Inner Asia, whence they could descend on

the populous but defenceless plains beneath, and pour a wave of conquest and

desolation over the fertile provinces of the middle kingdom.

   111 adapted, owing to the poverty of its vegetation, to support a settled popida-

     _

tion, it nevertheless atforded a secure retreat to the robber and marauder, and was

on this account a dangerous country for travellers. The Great Wall, which never

protected China from her enemies, served to mark the limits beyond which civihzed
man could advance no fm-ther ; and if the spirit of the nomad has been subdued

after so man}^ generations of Chinese sway, his native deserts remain unconquered

and invincible as in the days when the Great Wall was built.

The further west the more bleak and desolate is the aspect of nature. The

Great Wall still continues to define the limits of life and culture on the one side,

of death and desolation on the other. Inside the northern bend of the Yellow

River lies the country of Ordos, a sterile region of shifting sands, where many

legends are still preserved of the gi-eat hero Jiughiz-Khan. To the west of the

bend of the Yellow River is a region still more bleak and desolate, at one time the

bed of a large lake ; beyond it are the moujitains which enclose the basin of Lake

Koko-nor, and still fm-ther to the west grand snowy ranges and gradual ascents

towards the uplands of Tibet. These are the regions visited by Colonel Preje-

valsky, which few Em-opeans had ventured to penetrate previously. Marco Polo

only devotes four short chapters of his first book to their description. Hue and

Gabet traversed Southern Mongolia and passed by Koko-nor into Northern Tibet,

but they gave no accm-ate geographical information. Pere Ai-maud David visited

the mountains lying to the north of the great bend of the YeUow River, and made

some interesting botanical researches ; but he would not risk ti-avelling through

Kansu and Koko-nor, at that time distm'bed by the Mahomedau or Dungan insm--

rection, of which our author gives a vivid description ; Ney Elias also travelled

through a part of the country about the same time. For the rest of our informa-

tion we are chiefly indebted to Chinese records, fragments of which have been
collected by Du Halde and Ritter.

Thus Prejevalsky's journey may really be termed a geogTaphical feat, and will

always hold  an  important place in  science                               for, besides his remarkable expedition
                                                                        ;

from Dalai-nor to the Upper Yang-tsze-kiang, which alone would entitle him to

the gratitude of men of science, he also made a march from Alashan to Urga (680

miles) across the Gobi in its widest part, which no one had hitherto attempted.

  A recapitidation of all he has done and of the results obtained in the face of

exti-aordinary difficulties would fill several pages; but as an English edition of his

travels will shortly be published, those interested would do well to refer to it.

                           Exploration of the Aures Mountains.

By Lieut. -Colonel E. L. Platfaie, H.B.M. Consul- General in Algeria.

This part of Algeria lias probably never before been explored by an English

traveller, although lying close to the ordinary diligence-route between Constantino,

or rather between Batna and Bisla'a.

Ptolemy places here his Audon. Procopius and other geographers speak of it as

Aurasion   or 3Ions Aurasius                                                                   but these hardly include the entire district now known
                                                                                            ;

as the Aiu-es Mountains, which may roughly be said to occupy the space between

Batna and Biskra, eastwards towards the Tunisian frontier.

The inhabitants of this region are called Chawi, and are a branch of the Berber

nation, to which the Kabyles also belong.

   Colonel Playfair here ti-aced the early history of this part of Numidia, and

showed how one war of conquest after another had passed over it, and always with

the same effect ; the conquerors in their turn became the conquered, and were
driven for safety to the mountains. Thus the Romans, when driven out by the

Vandals, the Vandals after their defeat by the Byzantines under Behsai-ius, and

--the Byzantines when finally conquered by the Mahommedans all sought and found

a refuge in the Aures Mountains, where they have left on the Chawi the imprint

of their physical and moral character which foui-teen centuries have not been able

to obliterate. Light hair and blue eyes are frequently met with, and the average

of female beauty is even higher than it is in England.

   They observe the 25th of December as a feast, under the name oiMoolid, or the
birth, and keep three days' festival at springtime and harvest. Their language is
full of Latin words ; and they use the ordinary solar instead of the Mohammedan

limar year, the names of the months being almost identical with our own.

   The Aures range is a series of mountains rxmning roughly parallel from N.E. to
S.W., between which flow considerable rivers, of which advantage is taken with

great skill to irrigate the valleys between them.

   The great body of the drainage is from the southern side, where the rivers, after
losing a part of their volume in irrigation, flow into the great marshy basin of

Melghir.

   The most important of these is the Oued Abdi, the hills on either side of which
terminate in the two highest peaks in Algeria, Djebel Chellia on the left and
Djebel Mahmel on the right ; the former 7611 feet high, the latter scarcely lower.

   In the_ plains and valleys considerable quantities of cereals are produced, and

fruit cultivated to a gi-eat extent.

   The inhabitants, unlike the Arabs, dwell in stone houses ; the villages are perched
high up on the sides of the hills, at short distances apart on both sides of the
river ; and the houses are generally so disposed that the roof of one is on a level
with the floor of that above it, to which it actually forms a terrace.

The forests in the Am-es are very valuable, and have hardly yet been worked

they consist of cedar, oak, juniper, Aleppo pine, &c. ; but it is sail to obsen-e here,
as almost everywhere else in Algeria, the scarcity of young trees, which are de-
stEoyed by the sheep and goats almost as soon as the seed germinates, and the
destruction of the old ones by colonies of processional caterpillars, which estabhsh
their nests in the upper branches, and destroy all vegetable life as their ravages

descend.

   The mineral wealth of the Aures is also very gi-eat, though hardly as yet more
than suspected ; in some places abundant indices of copper, lead, and iron were
met with, and in one place what will no doubt prove a valuable mine of mercury

and lead.

One can hardly ride a mile in the Aures without meeting Roman remains of
                                            ----

considerable importance, all testifying to the high state of civilization -which
existed wherever this great people founded colonies.

   But it is principallj' on their northern slopes and in the plains at their base
that those splendid cities existed, the ruins of which now excite the wonder and
admiration of modern travellers. Bruce visited them a century ago, and made a
large number of exquisite drawings of the principal architectural features. These
are now in the possession of his descendant Lady Thurlow, by whose permission
two of his original sketches were exhibited.

   Commencing from Lambessa, a complete chain of these cities extended as far as
Tebessa, their order from west to east Ijeing as follows :

   Lambees (mod. Lambessa), Verecunda (mod. MarJcomia), Thamugas (mod.
Timefiad) , Mascula (mod. Ain Klienchia), Baghaia (mod. Kast Uaghai), and Theveste

(mod. Tebessa).

   The first two of these are well known to travellers. Thamugas was described by

Colonel Playfair in considerable detail. It contains numerous magnificent ruins,
the principal of which are a triumphal arch, theatre, forum, capitol, a Byzantine
fortress, and a Christian chiu'ch. The whole siu-face of the groimdis covered with

fragments of sculpture and inscriptions, many of the latter quite entire, which
prove that the city was fovmded by Hadrian, and colonized by the veterans of the

30th legion Ulpia after its return from the Parthian war.
   Not far fi'om Timegad is the fertile plain of Firis, on the west and south of

which are two moimtains covered with countless numbers of the most interesting
megalithic remains. Their variety is considerable ; but the most ordinary type is
that of a low circular structure, nearly level with the earth at the vipper part of
its base, and varying in height on the opposite side, according to the slope of the
hill, from 3 to 8 feet. The walls are of rough dry masonry, generally about 6 feet
thick ; the diameter is from 15 to 30 feet ; and each contains a central chamber of
irregular shape covered with a single slab of stone. In some places the monuments
are close together ; in others they are separated by a number of tombs of the ordi-
nary dolmenic type, as if the latter were intended for people of less consideration

than those for whom the circular ones were constructed.

   The next city is JMascula, now Ain Khenchla, where an attempt has been made
at European colonization. The position is well chosen from a sanitary and stra-

tegic point of view, but it is rather distant fi'om any place where produce can be

sold.

   The ruins of Kast Baghai are also interesting; they are close to the diligence-
route from Khenchla to Ain Beida. From the latter place to Tebessa is a day's

journey, and here are to be found the finest Roman ruins in the colony. These
consist of the ancient citadel restored by Solomon, the successor of Belisarius, who

lost his life here. The modern city is built within it ; there is a temple of Jupiter
nearly complete, a magnificent quadrifrontal triumphal arch, and the ruins of a

basilica, subsequently converted into a Christian church.

   The paper was accompanied by monthly diagrams, which showed :
   1st. The isobaric lines of mean pressure for each "05 of an inch, together with
arrows showing the prevailing winds and their force.
   2nd. The isothermal lines for every second degree of air-temperatm-e.
   3rd. The isothermal lines for every second degree of sea-temperature, together

temperatiu-e, wind, currents, we.ither, sea, clouds, natural history, earthquakes, &c.

   The diagrams may be said to give the navigator a monthly picture of the dol-
drums, clearly showing him how in some months they are wedge-shaped (as re-
marked by the late Commodore Maiu-y), and enabling him to select the best route

across the equator. They illustrate the action of both air and water when meeting,
as is constantly the case with the two trade-winds, and the cm-rents which they pro-
duce, showing' also how the air as well as water seems to eddy round a point of laud

from which the main stream is running.
    They also illustrate some very sudden changes of temperature in both air and

sea, for Avhich the paper endeavours to account.

    The paper also gives the specific gravity of the currents due to the N.E. and S.E.
trades, as well as that of tlie Guinea current, which indicates that the latter is a

surface back-drift above a colder current.

   The district is the birthplace of many West-Indian hurricanes ; and the place in
which one originated was pointed out on the diagram for August, it having been
afterwards traced to the island of St. Thomas. Besides many other allusions to
remarkable and unsettled weather, the paper tells of fi\"e earthquakes which were
experienced by ships in the district, two in 0° 30' N. and 30° W., three in 1° S.

and 20° W.

   In the course of the paper frequent allusion was made to swells of tlie sea wliich
had overrun by many hundreds of miles the winter gales which caused them, and
seemed to be related" to the rollers experienced at Ascension, St. Helena, and the

West Coast of Africa.
   The motion of upper clouds in relation to the direction of the winds was fre-

quentlj' remarked upon, their motion showing that the wind of one trade passed
above that of the other at their equatorial verge ; and, again, that above the south-
westerly monsoon, which blows to the northward of the equator in certain months,
the clouds very frequently move from the S.E. near the equator, and from the
N.E. when further to the north.

   Several allusions were made to the red dust which falls on ships at certain
seasons, and to the cetacea, land and sea-birds, fish, and insects met with.

   The whole paper may be said to be a resume of a large work about to be published

by the Meteorological Office, which is under the superintendence of the Meteoro-

logical Committee of the lloyal Society, and is published in extenso as a non-official

paper by that Office.

8,496,000 bushels of gi-ain were lauded in Bristol from foreign ports. The portion
of England which may be supplied with grain from Bristol as a centre, extends in
some directions for 100 miles.

   Sugar-refining forms one of the ancient branches of industry both in Bristol and

elsewhere ; its extent may be appreciated from the establishment of Messrs. Finzel

iu this city, where 1200 tons of refined sugar can be turned out in a week,

French fiscal arrangements, however, are not favourable at the present time to

the augmentation of British sugar-refineries; and the subject merits tiie attention of
Members of the Economic Section.

   Part of the French revenue is derived from taxes on spirits, salt, and sugar con-
sumed in France. The duty levied in France on sugar, according to the 'Times' of

the 28th July, 1875, when the sugar is sold for home consumption, equals in amount

the value of the sugar.

  A sugar is prepared by the French beet-root sugar-makers, looking as if it only

contained 80 per cent, of saccharine matter in a given bulk or weight, whilst the

sugar really contains 90 per cent, of saccharine matter. The raw sugar is assessed

at a quality 10 per cent, below the real standard ; and the French sugar-refiner is

debited with a duty according to that assessment, and which is not paid.

   When the sugar is exported, the actual quality of the sugar is taken, the draw-

back is set against the duty, and the refiner is paid the duty thus shown to be due

to him.

  A memorial issued by London sugar refiners shows that in 1873 the quantity of

French refined sugar really produced was at least                 kilos. 174,859JO0O

and the " legal " equivaleut of the refined sugar exported was. . ,, 153,185,000

giving an excess over the " legal " quantity of                   ,, 21,674,000

or about_                                                         cwts.      41.3,000

In 1874 the excess over the "legal" equivalent of the refined sugar rose to

25,413,000 kilos., or about 498,000 cwts.

   In 1873 the duty on that excess was                            francs 15,891,000
and ill 1874                                                         ,, 18,636,000
showing an increase of                                                ,, 2,745,000

or about                                                          £110,000 sterling.

If to this duty on excess, or bounty, amounting in 1874 to 18,800,000 francs per

annum, be added the bounty derived from other sources, such as the '-detaxe " on

"poudres blanches," the total amount of bounty will be easily raised beyond

20,000,000 francs for sugar.

In English money 18,000,000 francs are equal to £720,000, paid by the French

tax-payer to the French sugar-refiner, and with this result: the I'rench sugar-

refiner can sell refined sugar in a foreign market, such as England, below cost

price.

From the ' Statistical Abstract ' it appears that the import of foreign refined

sugar and .sugar-candy into Great Britain in 1871 was             cwt. 1,460,102

and that it had increased, in 1874, to                            ,, 2,717,406

The cheapness of refined sugar in Great Britain has augmented the average of

consumption from 1 lb. a head in 1860 to 8| lbs. a head iu 1874.

   Great Britain possesses commercial friends iu France among the vine-growers of
Bordeaux and Champagne, and the silk-manufacturers of Lyons. These great

industries derive no profit either from a heavy tax on sugar consumed in Fi-ance,

or from a bounty enabling a French sugar-refiner to sell sugar in England below

cost price. The occasion seems favourable for a remonstrance with the Frencli

Government, and for a conference with leading French statesmen connected with

interests independent of beet-root sugar.

Beet-root gi'ows admirably in England ; and the British sugar-refiner may con-

sider the question of extending in this countrj^ a valuable product of home agri-

culture.

To conduct a negotiation with France, a knowledge of the French language

will be requisite for the Commissioners, whether appointed by private individuals

or by the British Goyernment,

It is gratifyinp: to notice that in a recent revision of Bristol charities under the

Endowed Schools' Commissiou, French has a place among educational requirements.

Thus, in Queen Elizabeth's Hospital, now a boarding-school for 150 boys, after the

entrance examination, which comprises reading, easy narrative, vn-iting text-hand,

and the first two niles of arithmetic, a scheme of school instruction is given, con-

taining history and geography, as well as English gi-ammar, composition, and lite-

rature, tlie elements of mathematics and natural science, the elements of French or

Latin, or both, dravdng and class-singing.

  A similar entrance examination is arranged for admission into the Red Maids'

Boarding-school for eighty girls, in Bristol, the income of which amounts to £4378

a year. In this School, instruction is given to girls in history and geography,

English grammar, composition, and literature, the elements of mathematics and

natural science, and of French or Latin, or both, drawing and class-singing, do-

mestic economy, and the laws of health, needlework, and (if the Governors think

fit) telegraphy, or some other branch of science having a bearing on skilled industry

suitable for women.

The examination for admission to the Grammar School is to be graduated accord-

ing to the age of the Candidate, and is never to fall below the following standard

that is to say, reading, writing from dictation, the first two rules of arithmetic, and

the outlines of the geography of England.

The subjects of secidar instruction in the Grammar School are to be as follows :

the Latin and Greek languages and literatures ; the English language and litera-

ture ; arithmetic and mathematics ; history and geography ; natural science and, in
particular, applied mechanics, chemistry, and experimental physics ; French and

German ; drawing ; class singing.

  An annual income of £1793 belongs to the Bristol Grammar School ; and to this

institution, as well as to Queen Elizabeth's Hospital and the Red Maids' School

(all three being iiuder the Bristol Municipal Charity Trustees), an augmentation

has been ananged from various non-educational charities converted into educational

endowments, of a capital sum of £14,.50O.

  New buildings for 400 scholars are to be erected for the Grammar School, inclu-

ding a day- and boarding-school.

Colston's Hospital is a boarding-school for 100 boys, into which no boy is to be

admitted under the age of ten years ; and the scholars are not to remain after they

are fifteen years of age. The examination for the admission of paying scholars

comprises reading easy narrative, wi-iting text-hand, and easy sums in the first two

rules of .arithmetic, and the multiplication-table. The Governors may raise the

minimum standard from time to time if they deem it advantageous for "the School

to do 80.

 --The subjects of secular instruction in Colston's boarding-school are arranged as

follows: reading and spelling, writing, arithmetic, and elementary mathematics;

English grammar,                                                  composition, and literature ;  French  or Latin, or both                                                                   the out-
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

lines of history                                                  geogi-aphy, political and  physical ;  natm'al science ;  drawing and
                                                               ;

vocal music.

There will be two classes of scholars, foundationers and pajing scholars. The

foundationers in the boarding-school must have attended an elementary school

regularly for a year preceding their application. They will be elected in order of

merit, as tested in competitive examination for boys between ten and eleven years

of age in the subjects of Standard IV. (Code 1875), as follows:

" To read with intelligence a few lines of poetry selected by the Inspector, and
      to recite from memory fifty lines of poetry.

" To write eight lines slowly dictated once from a reading-book, and to show
       copy-boolvs in improved small hand.

" Compoimd rules of arithmetic (common weights and measures)."

  A note is appended to the table of standards of examination in the new code of

regulations, according to the ' Minute of the Committee of Council on Education,'
5th April, 1875, respecting the 4th Standard, that the " weights and measures "

taught in public elementary schools should be Avoirdupois weight, long measure,
            ----                                                                                                   --

liquid measures, time-table, square and cubical measures, and any measm-e connected

with the industrial occupation of the district.
    Bristol, from its geographical position, seems especially adapted for ti-ade with

the western part of the continent of Europe, where the metric system of weights

and measures is now universally in use. Through various treaties of commerce

British trade is rapidly increasing with countries employing that simple and
easy mode of calculating measm-es and weights ; and as a permissive Act of Par-

liament of 1864 sanctions the metric system in Great Britain and Ireland, it may

be e5:pedient for the Governors of Colston's boarding-school to consider if some

knowledge of the tables of metric weights and measm-es may not be desirable for

the foimdationers of that venerable institution.

   The competitive examination in Colston's boarding-school is arranged in the
subjects of Standard V. of the Educational Code for boys between eleven and twelve

years of age, as follows :

"Improved reading; and recitation of not less than seventy-five lines of

        poetry.                                                                                                                       Spell-

       ing, grammar, and haudwi-iting to be considered.
"Practice, bills of parcels, and simple proportion."

The examination for admission to Colston's Girls' School is not to fall below the

minimum standard for admission to Colston's Hospital.
   The subjects of secular instruction are to be as follows :-- Reading and spelling,

·wi-iting,  arithmetic  or  elementary  mathematics                                                                English  grammar,  composition,
                                                                                                                ;

and literature; French or Latin, or both; the outlines of history; geography,

political and physical; drawing and vocal music; household management; the

laws of health ; and needlework.
   Besides the endowed schools of Bristol, Clifton College, in the immediate neigh-

bourhood, founded in 1861, comprises 500 boys, in addition to whom there are

45 boys in the preparatory school of that College.

  As soon as the boys of "Clifton College reach the fifth form, they can enter either
on the Classical or on the Modern side ; but those who are not in the College are

required to pass a preliminary examination.
   In Clifton College instruction is given to boys intended for the Royal Military

Academy, Woolwich, or the Indian Civil Engineering College, Cooper's Hill, or

the profession of Civil Engineering ; and a system of education is carried on suitable

for students intended for either Oxford or Cambridge.

   The Cathedi-al of Bristol assists in the establishment of a training College for

the education of superior teachers ; and for this institution the Ecclesiastical Com-

missioners provide a capital sum of £12,000.

An entrance examination is arranged for admission into the Training College,

comprising English grammar and composition, arithmetic, geography, and English
history. Afterwards another examination is held, in which each Candidate is ex-

pected to pass in at least two of the following subjects :

Divinity, English literatul'e, Latin, one modern language, mathematics, and                                                                         I
   one branch of natm-al science.

  No student is to be admitted imtil he has attained the age of 17 j'ears.

   Candidates may, if the Governors think fit, be admitted into the College without
passing the examination for admission, if they are graduates of any imiversity in
the United Kingdom, or if they have passed the senior local examination of either
of the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or the Matriculation Examination of
the University of London, or if they are holders of any scholarship or exhibition

which may be deemed by the Governors an adequate qualification.
   The com-se of general instruction in the Training College has for its main object

to illustrate methods of teaching, and the science and history of education, and to
qualify the Students to become skilled teachers in higher schools. The course

includes

Lectures on the art of teaching
Model lessons given to classes of scholars in the presence of Students
Lessons, from time to time, given by Students to classes of scholars in the pre-

   sence of the I'rincipal or an Assistant Teacher, and imder his tuition.

Once in every year there is an examination of the Students by an Examiner, or

Examiners, appointed for that pm-pose by the Governors, and paid by them, but

otherwise unconnected with the College. The Examiners report in writing to the

(Tovernors on the proficiency of the Students, as shown by tlie result of the exami-

nation, and on the ability which the Students evince in giving lessons to classes,

and in the discipline and management of a school. The Governors are to commu-

nicate the report to the Principal of the College.

Enti-ance fees and tuition fees are determined bj^ the Governors of the College,

the rate for the tuition fees being not less than £20 a year.

The Principal is to receive a stipend of £200 per annum.

Near the top of Paric Street, in this city, is the Eristol Museum and Librarj^, the

Council of which, in 1873, agreed with the Faculty of the Bristol Medical School

to issue a circular setting forth the advantages of a technical college of science in

Bristol for the west of England and South Wales. The Committee formed on this

subject received a communication at an early period from the Master of BiUiol

College, Oxford, suggesting the cooperation of his own College, and probably that of

auotlier Oxford college in the undertaking'.

  A promise on the part of Balliol College and New College, Oxford, was after-

wards given, to assist in the establishment and support of the proposed College by

means of a yearly contribution of £300 each for a period of not less than five years,

on condition of each Oxford college being represented on tho governing bodv of tbe

new institution, of the instruction given being literaiy as well as scientific, and

of the requirements of adult education being specially considered. It was also pro-

vided that, so far as could be arranged, the instruction, other than that of the

^ledical classes, should be open to vs'omen, and that lectm'es should be given on
Ageneral subjects.
                     ready assent to these conditions was accorded by the Com-

mittee who had taken charge of the negotiation.

In June 1874 the Mayor of Bristol presided at a public meeting in Clifton for
Athe College.
               scheme of constitution was prepared, and in 1875 a conference in

fixvour of the College took place in one of the rooms of the Parliamentary palace

in Westminster, attended by influential Members of both Houses of Parliament.

It may be of some value to friends of the Bristol College to hear some particulars

of tlie development of Owens College, Manchester, in which I assisted as one of the

original trustees of that seat of learning. At its origin the Trustees were satisfied

to commence the College in a house with spacious apartments, to which was at-
tached a gymnasium as an exercise-ground for the Students.

   Chemistry and the English language are now especially attractive subjects in
Owens College. Elementary history, Latin, mathematics, and mechanics, with
jurisprudence and physiology, also command much attention among the Students.

   Each Candidate for admission into Owens College usually produces a testimonial

of good character from his last instructor. No person is admitted under the age
of fourteen years ; and those who are under sixteen are required to pass a preliminary

examination in English, arithmetic, and tho elements of Latin.

Periodical examinations are held in each class, and written exercises are given

out. Neglect of these tests of progress disqualifies a Student from competing for

prizes and honours at the end of the session, when a general examination takes
place of all the Students. No certificate of attendance on the class is gi-anted
to a Student who absents himself, without a sufficient reason, from the general

examination.

   Mr. Greenwood, Principal of Owens College, reported in .lune 1874, that there

were in that year 350 Students in the College, of whom 37 were under sixteen

years of age, 117 between sixteen and eighteen, 75 between eighteen and twenty, and

127 above twenty. There were 141 medical Students and 847 evening Students.

The total number was 1344 Students.

Owens   College  is  affiliated  to  the  University                         of London                                      and  Greek  is  no  longer

compulsory in that University on Candidates at the Matriculation exaiuiuation, but
IS ranked at that time as an optional subject, with French and German. Latin is

--compulsory at Matriculation ; and a Student is required also to pass in any two of the

three following languages Greek, French, and German. The remaining subjects
for Mati'iculation comprise mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry, and English

language and histor3^

   It is recommended in Owens College, that if a Student elects to take up Greek,
and either French or German for Matriculation, he should enter for the first year's
Arts course, taking chemistry and one of the modern languages ; and that those
Students who propose to take up both French and German for Matriculation
should enter for the first year's science course, taking Latin and both the modern
languages of France and Germany.

   In Jvme 1873, at the Matriculation Examination of the University of London,
32 Students of Owens College passed ; and 3 Students passed, in January 1874. Of

these 35 Students, 7 were evening Students.
   Students formerly at Owens College have obtained at Oxford a Stowell Civil-Law

Fellowship at University College, a Burdett-Coutts Scholarship in Geology, a

Fellowship at Pembroke College, and a Senior Mathematical University Scholarship,
also an Exhibition and a Scholarship at Exeter College in natural science, and a

Studentship in natural science at Christ Church.

   At Cambridge an Owens-College Student has been rewarded by attaining the
place of eighteenth wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos of 1874 ; and other Owens
CoUege Students have been elected to scholarships at Trinity College, St. John's

College, and Sidney-Sussex College, and to a Sizarship at St. John's College.

   Two Whitworth Scholarships have been gained by Owens-College Students.

   In twenty-one years, from 1853 to 1874, there have been 234 Owens-College Stu-
dents matriculated in the University of London, and 225 have successfully presented
themselves at higher examinations of that LTniversity. During the three years
1871-74 seventy-one have matriculated, and seventy-five have passed the further
examinations of the same University. Principal Greenwood observes that of the
Owens-College Students a large body do not contemplate graduation either in Lon-
don or elsewhere, and are yet in every sense devoted to academic work.

   Prizes and scholarships are awarded to Students in the Medical department of

Owens College and the names of those who pass in universities and professional
                                                                                   ;

colleges are duly recorded in the Owens-College ' Calendar.'

  A College for higher education at Bristol has a right to gather round it an ever-

jncreasiug number of students, and to give an importance to its own certificates

and rewards, which will soon be appreciated as nearly equivalent to degrees in

imiversities.

    Girton CoUege, three miles from Cambridge, affords an instance of lady students
succeeding in the same academical examinations to which Cambridge-University
gentlemen students are admitted. The Cambridge Examiners have kindly allowed
marks to the papers of the lady candidates and one lady student from Girton has

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

recently obtained a few more marks than the highest gentleman student in the
examination for the " pol.," or .ordinary B.A. degree, at Cambridge.

   Ladies who are ambitious of obtaining literary and scientific distinctions, seem to

wish to enter the same examinations for which there are gentlemen candidates ; and
several lady students of Girton CoUege have obtained places corresponding to
 that of Senior Optime in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, and of the second

class in the Cambridge Classical Tripos.
   The Middle-Class School in Cowper Street, London, under Dr. WormeU, has a

 high range of mathematical instruction and the boys are encouraged to construct
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

their own apparatus from simple materials, and to employ themselves in workshops
 recently added to the school. The English language and English histoiy are
 admirably taught in that institution. The senior boys of the sixth form show
 a creditable knowledge of the elements of constitutional law and of political

economy.

    Ireland has of late years increased in prosperity from the more ready transfer of
 landed property in that island. The Irish Commissioners, under the Incumbered-
Estates Act, commenced their sittings in 18495 and in 1868 an act was passed ex-

Aproperties to properties that are unincumbered.                                                                                                                                                                                                       perpetual jmisdiction was

granted to the new tribunal, imder the name of the " Landed-Estates Court." In

1873 the amount of purchase-money for land under this Court was £1,737,222, the

net rental of the laud sold was £86,685, and there were 208 sales.

   All Irish estates, whether incumbered or not, can be sold, or contracted for, or

disposed of, through the medium of the Court, which is also judicially empowered

to declare a title to property, and, by later acts, to sell or lease settled estates.
Small purchasers of land would be benefited by a greater simplification of proce-

dm-e, and a reduction of expense in the professional charges, which are fixed on

a high scale. For instance, parties interested in the purchase of a farm worth

£500 may be required, as a minimum expense, to pay nearly £100 in effecting the

purchase.

Having visited the Landed-Estates Register Office in Boston, Massachusetts, I

can report favourably of the excellent plan of recording transfers of landed property

Ain the New-England States of North America.                                                                                                                                                                                                      book is kept, in which the de-

scription of each estate is preserved, and the mortgages and other claims on the laud

are entered. If a sale is intended, the person proposing to purchase may at once
see the incumbrances on the property, as well as many particulars of importance

respecting the value of the estate. The transfer of property after the sale is didy

registered                                         and the new proprietor thus obtains his                                                                                                                                                        title to the land.

Next year (1870) a meeting of the International Statistical Congress is to be held

in Buda-Pesth, the capital of Hungary. Official statistical representatives of all the

principal governments of Europe, and of the United States of America, attend the

Congress, which also includes delegates from statistical societies of different coun-

tries : it usually meets once every two years.

  When the Congress assembled at Berlin in 1863 (under the presidency of Count
von Eulenberg, Secretary of State for the Home Department in Germany), the

--statistical representatives of Great Britain comprised: Dr. Farr, F.R.S., Superin-

tendent of                                         Statistics in the General Register Office                                                                                                                                                      Mr.  Valpy,  Chief of  the  Sta-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

tistical Department and com returns in the Board of Trade ; Mr. Hammick, Secre-

tary of the General Register Office, and others.

On the 9th September, 1863, Mr. Valpy presented to the Congress the annual

statement and the accounts of the trade and navigation of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, and remarked that the International Congress was cer-
tainly doing good service to all nations. " The periodical meetings," observed Mr.
"S'alpy, "which we are invited to hold in the capital cities, where the Members are

received with such Royal and general kindness, must exercise a great and favour-

able influence upon public opinion in regard to national statistics. The opportunity

aflbrded by the Congress for the meeting of public officers and gentlemen interested

in statistics from so many coxmtries is productive of much advantage. The circle

of om- friends is enlarged ; and, speaking as an official delegate, I can say that our

means of usefulness at home are increased, and our efforts of improvement are
much encouraged, by the cordial personal intercourse between the Members of the

Congress."

   Dr. Farr, at the meeting in Berlin, eidogized the address of II.R.H. the late Prince

Consort, who had presided at the opening of the International Statistical Congress

in London. Dr. Farr mentioned that the labours of the Congress had been described

--in that inaugural address " as connected with the loftiest principles of philosophy',

and directed to the noblest end the good of the people of all nations."

Mr. Hammick thanked Dr. Engel, the Director of the Statistical Department in

Berlin, for his able abridgement of the resolutions and works of the International

Statistical Congress at its previous meetings.

The meeting at Buda-Pesth may have a special interest, as the Convention of

Commerce between Great Britain and the Austro-Hungarian empire is liable to
terminate on the 1st Januarj', 1877, and commercial treaties with various other
European states may also come under consideration, for modification or renewal,

at the same time.

  A valuable work on commercial treaties was published by Mr. Hertslet (formerly

at the Foreign Office) ; and his son, Mr. Edward Hertslet, C.B,, Librarian and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               15*
--204 REPORT 1875.

Iceeper of tlie Papers at tlie Foreign Office, has recently prepared a collection of

treaties, in one tliiu volume, showing how the trade between this country and

Austria is regulated in the present year (1875).

   Mr. E. Plertslet mentions the desire publicly expressed by Austria, Turkey, and
other foreign powers to revise their commercial treaties not only with Great Britain,

but with other states. He shows precisely in his treaties' collection what commer-

cial treaties have been concluded between foreign states, containing clauses con-
ferring more favourable treatment on their respective subjects, on commerce, and
on navigation, than are specially provided for in the English treaties, but the bene-
fits of which concessions are or might be enjoyed by British subjects under the
"most-favoured-nation " clauses of the Englisli treaties.

    If the commercial treaties between different countries are likely to be considered
at the Buda-Pesth International Statistical Congress, a calm and dispassionate

survey of international commercial relations may be anticipated on the part of an

assembly comprising official representatives of high statistical talent from nearly

all civilized nations.

   The Council of the Statistical Society of London nominates a small number of

delegates to attend each Congress ; and the Committee of Section F may perhaps

arrange for some representation of the Section of Economic Science and Statistics
in the Buda-Pesth Meeting of 187G.

   In another department of statistical research, education, the General Committee
of the British Association formerly voted grants, which materially aided educational
inquiries. In 18-36 the Report of a Committee of the INIanchester Statistical Society

(consisting of Messrs. W. K. Greg, W. Langton, and Henry Eomilly), on the state
Fof education in the borough of Liverpool, was presented to Section at Bristol.

The investigation had occupied thirty-one weeks, at a cost to the Society of £9G.
On tlie recommendation of the Sectional Committee in Bristol the sum of £150
was placed at the disposal of a Committee (consisting of Colonel Sykes, afterwards
]M.P. for Aberdeen, Mr. Hallam, and Mr. Porter, Secretary of the Board of Trade)

in furtherance of inquiries into the actual state of Schools in England, considered
merely as to numerical analysis ; and similar grants were bestowed, with a like
object, for several years in this Association.

   Last year, at Belfast, some of the leading Members of the Statistical Section inter-
ested themselves in the restoration of harmony between the masters and the opera-
tives in a strike which was going on at the time of the British- Association Meeting.

A conference was recommended, happily followed by a compromise, and the differ-

ences were satisfactorily arranged.

   At the present Meeting, the Section of Economic Science has various communi-
cations of much interest to be brought forward ; and it gives me pleasure to request
the reading of the first paper, thanking you, at the same time, for your courtesy in

listening to my introductory observations.

On the Need of Systematic Observations on the Physical Characters of Man in
                     Britai'.i. By John Beddoe, 31. D., F.R.S.

   The Vvi'iter endeavoured to show the need for the collection of extensive and

systematic observations on the stature, bulis:, weight, rate of growth, &c. of

mankind in the British Islands. He had already laboured in this field for some
time, but sought for more active cooperation from those interested. He pointed
out how great results had already flowed from Quetelet's researches in this depart-
ment of knowledge, and how the practical bearing of such statistics on factory

legislation, on the recruiting question, &c. might be immediate and considerable.

On (Jtc 21oH(diti/ of Adolescence. By Joun Bedj)OE, M.D., F.E.S.

This p<apcr was founded on Mr. Cbarles Ansell's, jun., Statistics of Upper-Oki-s

Families. According- to Mr. Ausell's tigiu-es, the mortality of upper-class girls, from

1 1 to 17 years of age, decidedly exceeds that of boys, and about 15 and 10 it actually

surpasses, to a notable degree, that of both boys and girls of the lower classes,_as

inferred from the English Life Table. Beyond 17 the upper-class female mortality

recovers itself, and remains very favourable throughout the remainder of life ; while

at the same age (17) the mortality of upper-class boys .suddenly starts up, leaving

below it first the upper-class female and then the lower-class male and female

Acui-ves, and from 19 to 2-5 ranking worst of the four.  comparison of the statistics

of childhood and youth, collected by Mr. W. Bov.'ser, Et^v. J. Hodgson, and others,

confirms Mi-, Ansell's facts. The excess of male upper-class mortality from 17_to

23 may be accounted for by that being the period of university and student life,

of competitive examinations, sometimes of overstrain of mind and body, not unfre-

quently of fatal accidents, more often of dissipation and excess of various kinds.

In the case of the excessive upper-class female mortality from 11 or 12 to 17 or 18,

the connexion with the period of puberty is more obvious; and in relation to this

must be mentioned the aggregate of influences which may be summed up in the

term " school-life," and which afiect nppcr-class but not lower-class girls. The.se

considerations reinforce Sidney Smi'th's arguments against boarding-schools and in

favour of the Scotch daj'-school system of education, at all events for girls during

the age-period in question.

On iJic Deatli-rates of some Hecdth-Eesorts, and specicdly of Clifton.

                      By John Beddoe, M.D., F.R.S.

   The conditions governing the relative mortality of tovv'ns fall under three heads,
of which the second and third cannot be completely divided. These heads are
Natural Climate, Artificial Climate, and Social Conditions, which last includes the
amount and distribution of wealth, the prevailing occupations of the people, the
degree of prevalence of drunkenness and vice, or of the improved habits whicli
generally come with education, the proportions of se.xes and ages in the popula-

tion, the aggregation of individuals into masses, as in foundling hospitals, large

schools, and ban-acks.
    Advantages of the three kinds commonlj' go together : wealth seeks the best

localities and provides itself with the best artificial climate. Towns containing a

large proportion of well-to-do people can fairly be compared, as to their death-rate^,

only among themselves. For selecting such towns for comparison the excess of
young women from 15 to 35 yields on the whole tho best test; and on that prin-

ciple the following Table has been constructed :

Average Rates of Mortality for 1871 and 1872 in Herjistrar-GercraVs Suhdivisimi.

206 REPORT 1875.

   In tlie succeeding- years the death-rate of Clifton has heen smaller ; and even if all
deaths of parishioners occurring elsewhere (in liospitals &c.) are added, the rate
for 1873-74 is but 16-9, and for the last spring quarter 15-4, the zymotic rate being_
1-4 per annum. It is doubtful whether anywhere in England an equal mass of

population can be found yielding so favourable a rate. By Mr. Humphreys's method,

the normal death-rate of Clifton would be 21-8, so that the actual rate is 4-9 below

the calculated one.

      On Agricultural Statistics ami Waste Lands. By William Botly.

   The obj ect of this paper was to show the utility of a better and more correct statis-
tical publication of tlie amount of our cereal, root, grass, and other crops, cattle, sheep,
swine, and horses. The author stated that tlie nations of antiquity, and even Peru
at the present time, were much in advance of Great Britain and Ireland in carrying
out this idea. In treating of waste lands, the total acreage of Great Britain and
Ireland was stated to be 77,500,000, of which, in 1874, there were :

In corn                                                          11,364,834

Root and green crops                                             4,957,683

Flax, hops, bare fallow, clover, and other grasses under rotation. . 7,140,387

Permanent pasture, meadow, and grass, exclusive of moimtain and

heath                                                            23,680,416

It is a most extraordinary fact that out of the total acreage of 77,500,000, there
are no less than 30,356,080 unaccounted for.

   The author suggested the propriety of the legislature offering secure inducement.?

for the cultivation of waste lands.

                 On the WorJciny of the Building Societies Act, 1874.
                  By E. W. Brabrooe:, F.S.A., Barrister-at-Law.

  By this Act the rules of Building Societies are to be transferred from the custody

of the Clerks of the Peace in the several counties to that of the Registrar in London.
The Clerks of the Peace for some counties of importance have not j'et eiiected the
transfer, but the rules of 5157 societies have been received by the Registrar. Of
these, it is probable that about 2000 are still in existence, the others having been,
for the most part, terminating societies whicli had completed the period for which

they were established.
   Every society established after the passing of the Act has, and every society pre-

viously established may have, the privilege of incorporation. As yet, however,
only 300 societies (of which 70 are new ones) have obtained certificates of incor-
poration. The certificate carries with it limitation of liability, and the right to
borrow money to the extent of two thirds of the amount secui'ed to the society by

mortgages from its members.
    The Act provides for tlie making annual retm-ns to the Registrar by every incor-

porated society. Returns have not yet become due from the generality of societies
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

but those of 93 societies (42 incorporated, 51 not) already recorded at the Regis-
tiy-oiiice show a capital from share-subscriptions of £4,015,977, from borrowed

 money of £2,044,287, and from accumulated profit of £230,751, together £6,291,015 ;
 of which there was invested on mortgage £5,961,820, existing in other assets
 £328,918, and a balance deficient in one society of £257. The annual income of
 the 93 societies was £3,819,504.

     On tits Trade and Commerce of ilie City and Port of Bristol.
By Leonaed Brtjton, Secretary to the Bristol Chamber of Commerce.

   The object of the paper was to point out the great advantages which had accrued
to the trade and commerce and the general interests of the city and port of Bristol
by the operations of the Bristol Docks Transfer Act 1848, and the consequent
reductions in the dock dues. The reductions Avere very considerable, amounting to

more than 50 per cent, on an average on vessels, and to about 20 per cent, ou

goods, that is, foreign produce imported.
   Statistics were given of the import trade for 20 years before and 27 years after

the reductions, which showed that, whereas in the first period, under the high dues,

the progressive increase was at the rate of 33 per cent, on an average, dividing the

20 years into two decennial periods, a similar comparison for the 27 years since

the reductions had been at the rate of 66 per cent, decennially.

  A similar comparison with regard to the net rateable value of property within

the municipal limits showed, that whereas the rate of increase before the reduc-
tions in the dock dues (that is, from 1841 to 1851) was 7 per cent., in the first period
after the reductions it was at the rate of 16 per cent., comparing 1861 with 1851,
and in the second period after the reductions it was 41 per cent., comparing 1871

with 1861.
   Taking the extreme points, the foreign import trade of the port had increased

300 per cent., comparing 1848 with 1874; and the net rateable value of property
had been nearlv doubled between 1841 and 1871, viz. from £406,206 in 1841 to

£719,913 in 1871.

   Notwithstanding the reductions, the money receipts for dock dues had increased

50 per cent., and those for town and other port charges paid into the city chest
amounted to three times more in 1874 than in 1847 ; and the city was receiving
upwards of £12,000 more per annum from shipping than the amount of the rate on

the fixed property towards the reductions in the dues.

   Statistics were also given to show to what extent the different branches of the

--foreign import trade had increased since the reductions in the dues, viz. : sugar,

126 per cent. ;  timber,  65 per  cent.                     grain flour, &c., 430 per cent. ;  hides, tallow,
                                                         ;

&c., 142 per cent. ; and other produce, 139 per cent.

 --The paper referred also somewhat in detail to the general advantages which

had resulted to all interests in the city commercial, manufacturing, public im-

provements, docks, and railways, &c., and concluded by paying a tribute of respect

to the late Mr. Robert Bright, an eminent merchant of Bristol, to whom, as the

President of the Bristol Free Port Association from 1846 to 1850, the credit of

this gi-eat change was chiefly due, and by regTetting that the Corporation and the
citizens had not more continuously and more fully carried out the Act of 1848,
which had coufen-ed such great benefits on the city and port of Bristol.

   In reply to a question as to the rate of progress in other ports, statistics were
read of the foreign import trade of the United Kingdom, which showed that it

was increasing about 25 per cent, faster than that of Bristol before 1848, whilst

since 1848 Bristol had recovered that lost ground, and was now keeping equal

pace with the United Kingdom generally.

        --On the Principles of Penal Legislation. Second Paper.

    By John T. Bttet, Chaplain of Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum.

   Blontesquieu laid it down as one proposition in political science, that the monar-
chical governments of Europe were founded upon a principle of honour . Further,
he contended that this principle of honour involved the setting of .'i lew value upon
                           --

208 KEPORT--1875.

life and of a high vahie upon property. This principle was strongly impressed
upon the penal laws, which came down from former times. Assaults and injuries
to the person, and even homicide, were purged by tines, oflences against property
 v\-ere punishable wilh death.

    The elements cf social life have imdergone great changes, and the relative value
of life and of property has been reversed.

    Penal legislation has followed slowly in the wake of these changes, and the

severity of penalties against property has been mitigated.

    The question is raised, whether the changes in penal legislation have been com-
mensurate with the change in the relative value of life and property.

   Two propositions are submitted :

    i. Assaults and injuries to the person are of the nature of offences against life.

   ii. Imprisonment is of the nature of a penalty levied upon human life. It is a
partial confiscation of human life.

    Notwithstanding the recent changes in criminal law, offences against the person,
in large classes of cases, are punished by penalties levied upon property.

    On the other hand, oflences against property are punished by a confiscation of
some portion of human life.

    This paper is limited to the consideration of offences against propeiiy.

  A --summary of the returns given : In the year 1872-7;J the number of sentences

to either imprisonment or penal servitude for offences against property was

 30,G03.

    The average daily prison population of all county and borough prisons, and of the
so-called '' Convict Prisons," was 27,19:j. It is estimated "that of these nearly

 one third are sentenced for offences against properly without violence.
    Thus the result is arrived at, that the protection of property in England and

Wales involves the confiscation of human life to an extent equal to the entire
lives in constant succession of from 8C00 to COOO men, women, and children.

    It is admitted that if the existing method of punishing offences against property
 could be proved by experience to be indisptn.'-ablc, then it ought to be adhered to.
 But unless such evidence could be adduced there is a strong presumption in favour
 of pimishing offences against property by penalties levied upon property, and not
by penalties levied upon human life.

    Experience is strongly in favour of every change which has been effected in
 the direction of more merciful legislation.

    The abolition of capital punishment for oflences against property was a depar-
 ture from the principle of the old law of the extremest kind. Other changes have

 followed. Nevertheless there has been a concurrent decrease of those forms of crime
 the penalties against which have been continuously mitigated.

    There has been at the same time a constant decrease of severity in the sentences
 passed by exercise of the discretionary power vested in judges and magistrates.
 This passing of more lenient sentences is conclusive evidence that in the opinion
 of the judges, and of the whole magistracy of the country, the past changes in the
 law have worked satisfactorily.

    The same general conclusion is supported by the testimony of Mr. Samuel Eed-

 grave in the report for 1858, published in 1859.
    Three cases within the personal knowledge of the writer adduced in illustration.

    The same conclusion corroborated strongly by a return published by the Bank
 of England of the number of forged notes presented for payment before and after

 the abolition of capital punishment.
    It is not contended that the decrease of crime is directly and altogether the result

mof the decrease in the severity of punishment. But the face of all this evidence

 it is contended that the amount of crime is largely detennined by other causal
 influences, and not mainly by the severity of punishment.

    Whatever those other causal influences may bo, no pretension is made that their

 force has been accurately measured. It will be impossible, therefore, to adduce proof

 that the limits of safety have been reached within which crime may be eflectually

 controlled, and punishment be still further mitigated.

    In one way the mitigation of penalties has to some extent contributed to the
 lessening of crime. It has brought the law more into accord with a natural sense
                                                               --

of justice, the condition upon wliich the liealthy and vigorous action of tlio law
depends. This condition -would he yet further fulfilled if ofl'euces against property
were punished, so far as practicable, by penalties levied upon property.

   The mitigatiou of penalties has contributed to the lessening of crime in another

way.
   It was one main argument with the advocates for the abolition of capital punish-

]nent for oilences against property that the disproportionate severity of the penalty

deterred injured persons from prosecuting and juries from convicting. Eut the
eiiectiveness of penal law depends much more upon the certainty of punishment
than upon the severity.

   At the present time many persons are deterred from prosecuting, the punishment
of imprisonment being often felt to be disproportioned to many oflences against

property.

   This paper, and that read by the writer at Belfast, should be considered together.

So)iic Account of tlic liise and Progress of the Sugar Trade in Bristol, 1875.

                             By Henry CnAMBERLAiH-.

   The total consumption of sugar in the United Kingdom in 1874 was 719,'J4-3 tons.

We trace sugar first from China, through Arabia, to Europe and the Canaries, from

the latter imported into Bristol in 152G and earlier. In 150G the cane was talieu to

America, in 1G14 first to Barbadoes, and from thence to other West-India Islands.

Spain had, however, before this a large trade at St. Domingo. Barbadoes first

exported sugar to England in 1G40, and the AVest- India trade continued the prin-

cipal one  until                    1844                       then free labour      of other places  was admitted.  One of our
                                                            ;

Bristol merchant's ancestors obtained estates in Barbadoes about the time of

Cromwell's Protectorate in England, and some remain the family property to this

day, and are still connected with this city. Other large mercantile houses were

established here in the last century, and the import from the West Indies went on
and flourished. From 1844 all kinds of sugar were imported, free and slave labour,

and the duty was gradually removed, imtil in 1874 it was entirely abolished. The

beet-root trade is protected in France, or it coiild not successfully compete with cane-

sugar. In 1832, the year before slave emancipation, the total import trade into

Bristol was 21,229 tons ; in 1843, the year before the admission of free labour,

16,G11  tons                        from that                      time  it rapidly  increased to the large  total of 04,528  tons
                                 ;

in 1872, though 1874 is not so large, being 81,914 tons. These figm-es are from

the Bristol Chamber of Conjuierce accounts. The entire import into England in

1700 was only 10,000 tons. In 1874 we have already seen it exceeded 700,000

tons, a wonderful increase. The future of this great trade is beyond all present

calculation.

   The object of this paper is to direct attention to the important bearing that the
fiu'ther extension of railways in India has upon the welfare of her people and the

development of her resources.
   The author showed :

   1st. That the land is capable of aftbrding sufficient revenue for the general
          purposes of the government of the country and for the judicious develop-
                                         --

      ment of public works, whilst at the same time allowing for the total aboli-
       tion of the taxes on salt and opium.
2ncl. That immediate steps should be taken to cover India with a network of

         railway's.

3rd. That for the construction of the railways and working their traffic a new

       organization is required, as the existing system is not adapted for the
        special requirements of a country like India.

Before proceeding to consider these propositions, the author gave a few statistics

of the Indian empire.

   The total area of country under the administration of the Imperial Government
is 1,558,254 square miles (or 997,282,560 square acres), of which 948,254 square
miles (or 606,882,5(50 square acres) belongs to the British provinces, and about

010,000 square miles (or .390,000,000 square acres) to the native states.

   The population, according to the last census returns, is about 240,000,000, of

which about 193,000,000 belong to the British provinces, and 47,000,000 to the

native states.

   The density of the population in the whole empire is about 154 persons per
square mile ; or if the more important provinces only are taken, which form about
one half of the whole area, the density would be about 234 persons per square
mile ; but in the North-West Provinces the average is 378, in Oude 465, in some
of the Bengal provinces 500 to 573 persons per square mile, whereas in England
the density of the whole population is 422 per square mile.

   In Ireland the density is 166 persons per square mile.
   The Indian railways opened and in course of construction at the commencement
of 1873 were about 7722 miles, or one mile of railway to every 200 square miles
of country, whereas in England there is one mile of railway to every 4j square
miles of country, and in Ireland one mile of railway to every 16^ square miles of

country.

   The "Indian railways, as above, have cost about £97,000,000, or £16,536 per

mile.

The    Irisli  railways have cost  about £16,000 per mile                                                                                                              and by a  curious  coinci-
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

dence the gross receipts per mile per annum on the Indian and Irish railways are

almost identical.

               In India the gross receipts are about £1148 per mile

               In Ireland                1142 ,,

   The total receipts on the Indian railways for the financial year of 1873 were
£6,742,789, the net revenue £3,185,000, which gives a percentage of about SJ
per cent, per annum on the outlay ; or, if the railways had been made, as they
might have been, upon a cheaper and more economical system, or for, say, abovit
£8000 per mile, the percentage upon the outlay would have been 6i per cent, per

annum.
   The gTOSs revenue of the Indian Government for the financial year ending

March 1873 was £50,110,215, or nearly £2,000,000 in excess of the normal

expenditure.

   Of this revenue £44,449,000 were realized as follows :

       From land, and contributions from native States .                                                                                                               £22,000,000
                                                                                                                                                                           6,165,000
       From salt .... c                                                                                                                                                    8,084,000
                                                                                                                                                                           7,600,009
       From opium                  _

       From Customs, Stamps, and Excise

But the cost of collecting the salt and opium duties is about £2,290,612 ; so that
if these two taxes were abolished the amount derived from them, viz. £14,819,000,
would have to be reduced by this sum of £2,290,612, which would leave

£12,528,388 to be provided for.

   Assuming the population of India, as per last census returns, is 240,000,000,
and that every person, including rich and poor, expended upon an average, on their
food and clothing, one penny per day, this would give a sum equal to £365,000,000
per annum ; would not this amount give us approximately the value of the produce

raised ofi"the land per annum 'i For may not the value of tlie exports, amoimting

to about £o5,227,495 per annum, be feiily set off against tbe imports, which

amount to about £31,260,561, and the value of the labour required to convert
the produce of the laud into food and clothing and convey them to the market?

   In this expenditure of £365,000,000 per annum, the author has estimated that

200,000,000 of the population expend only ^d. per day per person.

   Of the 994,130,560 acres belonging to the British states, we cannot estimato

that there are less than 250,000,000 of acres under cultivation, or say about one

fourth of the whole area.

   This may be considered an under-estimate, as Sir George Campbell considers
there is a much larger area of laud under cultivation than this.

   Owing to the depressed condition of the Indian agi-icultural labourers (they

being only half-fed and clothed), the land is nearly everywhere imperfectly culti-

vated. If the condition of the agricultural labourer was improved, we may safely

estimate that the value of the produce of the land oil" the same cultivated area

wotild be increased at least 25 per cent.

   The revenue from the land is derived by certain assessment charges of so much per
acre, which to all intents and purposes is simply an ordinary rent charge ; but
owing to the different and varied forms of land-tenure throughout India created or

endorsed by the Imperial Government, the rent-charges vary considerably and

are based upon no uniform principle.
   In addition to tlie rent-charge there is a special charge made per acre for those

lands which are directly or indirectly benefited by irrigation, and which charges
enable the Government to realize a profit (according to Lord G. Hamilton) of about
5 per cent, upon all the large sums which have been expended upon irrigation works.

   From the imperfect state of land registration, a large area of cultivated land pro-

bably escapes altogether paying any rent to the imperial revenue.

    It seems just and expedient that the revenues of India should be made depen-
dent and should be realized on the produce of the land, and not from the land

itself.

    The revenue would thus increase as the prosperity and wealth of the people
advanced, and there would exist a powerful stimulant to develop and ameliorate

 the condition of the millions of her people.

    Simultaneous!}' with the introduction of raising the revenue from the produce
cf the land, the duties upon salt and opiimi should be abolished.

    If the revenue from the land was to be raised by a charge of one tenth on the
value of the produce, which is the ancient Oriental standard of rent, this value
being estimated, as above, at £365,000,000, the amoimt of this revenue would be
about £36,500,000, and would increase annually as the resources of India were iu-
 creased in value by the extension of railways and spread of ii-rigation works, and
 by the improved pm'chasing power of the people.

    This revenue would show an excess of £16,500,000 per annum over the normal
 expenditiu'e of a financial year like that ending March 1873 ; but this surplus would
 have to be rediiced by £12,528,388, on account of the abolition of the salt and
 opium taxes, leaving still a surplus of about £4,000,000, which surplus would be

 an annually increasing one on account of the progressive value of the land revenues.
    Let us assume that only two thii'ds of the 1,558,254 square miles would be pro-

 vided with railways.

    This area, divided by 20, wiU give us about 50,000 miles of railways that would
 be ultimately wanted in order to give India about half the railway accommodation
 that Ireland has, or about 42,000 miles woidd have to be constructed in addition
 to those already finished and in course of construction dming, say, the next 25

 years.

    If these 42,000 miles of railway are made, as they can be, for about £6000 per
 mile, imder conditions to be hereafter specified, the total cost of these 42,000 miles
 would be £252,000,000, which added to the £100,000,000 approximately already

 expended, gives £352,000,000 as the ultimate capital to be invested in Indian rail-

 ways, an amount equal to about the value of one year's produce of the land
 assuming that the produce is only £305,000,000 ; but it must be remembered that
 of the £252,000,000 to be expended, about £120,000,000 would be expended in
 England in purchase of rails, railway-plant, roUing-stock, freight, and profits.

--212 REPORT 1875.

   The interest upon £352,000,000 at 5 per cent, amounts to £17,600,000 per
annum although we are aware that the required capital could he raised at 4 per

                                   ;

cent., we have allowed 5 per cent, interest, as it offers a premium for private enter-

prise to enihark more readily into Indian railways.
   Assuming the average gross receipts of the whole of the Indian railways

amounted to only one half of the average receipts of the Irish lines, or say to £'572
per mile per annum, or £11 per mile per week, and allowing tlie working expense:',
sav, to be GG per cent, of the gross receipts, the net amount available to meet the
above 17,600,000 would be £0,724,000, leaving a deficiency of £7,870,000.

   The deficiency on account of the guaranteed interest for the year ending March
1875 is £1,428,442, which deducted from the £7,870,000 shows an increased charge
when the works are all completed, say some 25 years hence, of £6,447,558 per
annum. This would be provided for by the surplus of the revenue, which, as
before shown, would in the first year be about £4,000,000, and Avould be increasing

yearlj".

   The author proposed that the same principles which have been found by expe-

rience successful in private industrial enterprises should be applied as far as
possible to those of the State.

   Close personal attention must be given to details, in combination with a capacity
for generalizing those details so as to mould the whole into an effective and com-

plete organization.

   As the author believes it is a first essential for the successful development of

Indian railways that the spirit and enthusiasm of private enterprise should be en-
listed, he suggested that a scheme somewhat similar to the following might be
adopted \\dth advantage. That the railways should be the property of the State,
and the Avorkitg of the trafiic within certain specified limits to be under its supreme

control.

   It will be necessary for obvious reasons that the 42,000 miles of new railways

referred to above should be very approximately located, and, for the sake of con-
venience, divided into three cla.sses.

   The first-class railways should be those which would cost about £5000 per mile.
   The second class those which would cost £6000 per mile.
   The third class those which would cost £8000 per mile.
   The average of the whole to cost about £6000 per mile. The Government would

then proceed to oft'er to approved parties concessions of certain railways on terms
somewhat to the following eftect :

   1st. The land to be provided free of cost.
    2nd. All materials required for the construction and equipment of the railway

           to be imported free of duty, and to be carried at special low rates over the

      mrailways operation,

   urd. That interest at 5 per cent, per annum should be guaranteed on the standard

            cost of the railway.

   4th. The said guarantee of 5 per cent, should come into operation only and when

           certain lengths or sections of a railway have been certified to be completed
           and equipped with rolling-stock in conformity with the concession.
   5th. That the concessionaire would have to work the trafiic of the railway
          subject to certain Government regulations, and maintain it in working
          order to the approval of the Government for a term of, say, 35 years, deter-
          minable by the Government at the end of every seven years.
   6th. The concessionaire would have annually to pay to the Government in
          monthly instalments an amount equal to the Government guarantee of 5
          per cent., after which all the receipts of the traffic would belong to the

             concessionaire.

   7th. That for those railways where the annual net receipts will not cover the
          guaranteed interest after the said railways have been opened and at work for
          three years, then the Government shall allow an abatement off" the annual
          payment, such abatement to be assessed by an approved court of appeal.

   8th. That the concessionaire shall have the power of issuing ordinary shares
          unguaranteed by Government not exceeding, say, £4000 per mile, the Govern-
          ment not to be liable to purchase these ordinary shares at the end of the
                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                   213

          35 j'ears, but the said shares would remain the property of the holders and
          shall participate in all the profits after the guaranteed interest and working
           expenses have been paid.
   It will be readily seen that in the foregoing scheme capitalists in England and
India would bo attracted to embark ^vit]l spirit and energy into Indian railways,
as there exists many important elements for realizing substantial profits in propor-

On the Standard of National Education'^ . By Mrs. Williak Gee v.

The object of this paper is to draw some practical inferences from that on the study

of Education as a Science, read last year at Belfast, the most important of these being

that which forms the title. The definition of education in the former paper, as

the direction given to the development of the human being by the external influ-

ences brought to bear upon him, aiding, arresting, or distorting his growth, which

applies to national as to individual education, will include under that name all

direct instruction and influence, together with the indirect pressure of the social

iitmosphere and general conditions under which we live. It is on this indirect

and apparently uncontrollable social element that a national standard of education

would exercise  the  most powerful influence                                                                                                                  for every nation,  class,  and profes-
                                                                                                                                                           ;

sion, having any vigorous life, has an ideal of what its members should be, whicli

affects each iiuli\-idual in them by a public opinion more potent than any law

Some such ideal of education does indeed exist now in all classes of society, and

creates a standard for each class. The question is, whether it is an adequate one,

judged from a general, not a class, point of view, and whether the scicutific study

of education would not give us one universally applicable and resting on the firm

ground of principle. The scientific view, taking human nature as its basis, makes

that principle the equable development of all the powers and faculties in their due

relation to each other.

To begin with physical training : we have the Greek ideal preserved to us in

their statues, and should adopt it for ours, making our drill, gymnastics, and phy-

sical exercises for both sexes parts of a reall}' scientific physical training, directed

to attain the maximum of strength and grace, and reduce to a minimum wealcness

and deformity. This woidd give importance to the conditions of healthy develop-

ment before and after school-life, and scientific unitj^ to our sanitary legislation,

coordinating every measure to the same end, the improvement of our human

breed, hitherto infinitely less i-egarded tlian that of our cattle.

Passing on to intellectual education, our ideal must include here also not only

development but harmony, the balance of intellectual forces which constitutes

fioimduess of mind and their due subordination to tlie supreme end of intellectual

life, right reasoning, the discernment of the true relations to ourselves and each

other of the objects and persons making up the world in which we live. Hence

the standard of intellectual education should be the formation of a sound judg-

ment, which exercised on common things is no other than common sense, and in

Howthe region of abstract thought is the discovery of truth.                                                                                                                     to attain this

standard by directing all our school teacbing towards it, is a problem the science

of education has still to solve ; for the testimony of examiners of every degree

and for every profession may be appealed to to prove that it is not solved yet,

smd that the development of intelligence producing a high average of reasoning-

power is not the general result of our present methods of teaching.

In the higher education given at the Universities, or wliatever corresponds to

them, knowledge ceases to be a means only, and becomes an aid in itself, but

should lead to another end not less worthy, i.e. culture. This, which is too often

supposed to be mere ornament, has a high educational value by giving a keener

edge to our judgment, and training reason to deal with human probabilities, and to

weigli evidence coloured by human feeling, which physical science does not bring

before it. Assuming, on the authority of Mr. M. Arnold and other competent per-

sons, the notoriety of, at least, very common failure on the part of our scliools and
universities to produce the culture their whole system is directed to attain, it may

be attributed, tirst, to the absence of a high national standard of culture as the

necessary crowning of the educational editice ; and, secondly, to the need of science
to discover and correct the defects in oiu* methods whence it proceeds.

Following the natural order of human development, we come next to moral

education. In the moral as in the intellectual constitution we iind a hierarchy of

powers, and one supreme over the rest. This is conscience, the voice within us

pronouncing on right and wrong, and determining the obligation expressed by

"I ought" and "I ought not." The establishment of this rightful supremacy,

the subjection to it of the desires, afi'ections, passions, making " I will " wait upon

"I ought," is the ideal of moral education. Here we have a recognized standard,

that of Christian morality ; but there is too much evidence to prove that it is not

Howthe practical and eihcient one.   it is to be made efficient, how our moral

teaching is to become as practical as it is universal, and establish the sovereignty

of conscience " de facto" as well as ^'dejure," are questions on which the honour

and prosperity of the country depend ; and where can we find their solution except
in the science of education, which is in fact the applied science of human nature ?

Over the religious element of our nature, potentially the noblest, but also the

root of our worst evils, superstition, fanaticism, and bigotry, education has almost

unbounded power, and it has the highest standard, that of Christ, and an ideal of

divine loveliness in the life of Christ. Many of the causes of the notorious failure

of our religious teaching in producing corresponding results lie outside the scope

of this essay, and the subject is mentioned only to point out that the standards of

intellectual and moral education are most powerful factors in religious education,

and that when we have trained the intellect to form sound judgments and the moral

nature to obey conscience, we shall have laid the best foundation in himian power

for religious training up to the Christian standard.

All that has been said hitherto applies equally to both sexes ; but this paper

would be incomplete without some mention of the standard of education for

women. Practically there is no such standard above that of the elementary

schools, and the whole subject is in a chaotic state, tossed on the horns of con-

flicting opinions between the extremes of absolute dependence on the pleasiu'e and

convenience of men and absolute equality with them. Yet a high standard of

womanly worth and dignity is the very salt of a nation's life, without which it

slowly rots to the core. To the English ideal of the purity and sanctity of home pre-

sided over by the wife and mother, incomplete and inconsistently acted upon as it is,

we owe whatever we have of wholesome social life. But there are signs of a change

for the worse even here ; and considering that the imavowed but real standard held

up to women from their cradle is to please men, and that experience early teaches
them that men as a rule are best pleased by beauty and fasliion, most easily won

by the wiles of coquetry, and most effectually repelled by any independent exer-
cise of thought and judgment, the wonder is that so much goodness, truth, and

sound-heartedness is left among them. Professor Max Miiller, after saying to tlie

writer that the future of England depended on her young mothers, asked, " How

are they to be educated ?" Can there be anj' question in the whole range of

scientific investigation more worthy to occupy our ablest minds, and the solution
of which is more important to the welfare of the nation and the human race ?

Mr. Matthew Arnold has a passage showing the necessity of a nation's action

being inspired by an ideal commanding the respect of the manj', in order to keep

that nation together and give it unity and true greatness. The practical comment

on these words, based not on theory but the history of the decline and fall of

nations, is this: Of all ideals giving a nation unity and greatness, the most powerful

is a high ideal of national character, of what its men and women, its geutlcnien
and gentlewomen should be ; and of all sciences giving us the command over the
forces of nature, the most important is that which will give us command over the

forces of the human heart and mind, and enable us with approximate certainty to

educate the nation up to its ideal.

On Income Fallacies and some of their Consequences. By P. Hallett, M.A.

The object of this paper is to sliow that the word "income" has unequal

nieauings and values in its applications to diiferent sources, and that therefore its

use as a comparative measure either of wealth or taxation without previous correc-

tion must necessarily lead to error. These inequalities arise from the unequal

degrees in which ditl'erent sources are natm'ally reacted on in the production of

incomes, and from the variable manner in which these reactions are recognized by

present modes of assessment. Nominally equal incomes are only really equal

when they leave the things that produce tliem, considered as values, equally
imimpaired, or when they leave them equally restored. £100 of income produced

by a source that remains permanent in value is a very different thing from £100

produced by a som-ce that is consumed in and by the veiy process of its production.

To yield the one may require a capital value of £2000 ; the other may arise from a
value varying from below £2000 down to even less than the £100 of income itself,

simply according to the rate of the source's consum ability. But the two are

called equal incomes, and are treated as equal both in statistics and legislation. To

incomes that leave their sources unimpaired belong the ordinary interest of money

and, with some slight drawback, the rent of land. To those that consume their

sources belong terminable annuities, the royalties of mines, the rent of houses, the

income or wages of laboiu- in its various forms, in all of which the income is

increased at the expense of the som-ce. In the one category the income is a pure

profit on the source's capital value ; in the other, besides piu?e profit, it contains

the repair and redemption-fimds of its capital value, or, in other words, is a mixture

of profit and capital.

Different classes of income thus being of rmequal constitution, their units are

necessarily of unequal denomination, and are therefore, as such, incapable of being

added, subtracted, or of forming comparative ratios. Various fallacies arise from

ignoring these inequalities. (1) In estimating, for example, the National Income,

land-rent, house-rent, industrial and professional incomes, and even common wages,

have all been added together as if the income units of each class were of the same

value; and the incongruous mixture has even been capitalized at pure interest rates

in order to obtain the increment of National Wealth. (2) Again, in estimating the
comparative incidence of General Taxation on different classes of persons or pro-

perty, the same oversight has been committed. Income, according to the ordinary

rule, has been taken as the comparative measm-e of incidence, but the measure not

being of common value in different classes the comparison fails radically. If one

class of incomes pays 11 per cent, of taxation and another class pays 14 per cent.,
but the income unit of the one is of more than double the value of that of the

other, the percentages, without correction, are evidently scientifically worthless

and practically misleading. (3) The same error that thus applies to taxation in

general applies to the special Income-Tax ; and it is indeed probably owing to the
mode in which different denominations of income are officially defined and treated

in the income-tax administration that the preceding fallacies have arisen.

_As these consequences (statistical and legislative) result from a want of unifor-

mity in the idea of income, their true remedy would appear to consist in supplying

this want                                                 and as the want arises from the unequal degrees in which the diiferent
                                                       ;

sources are impaired through production, it would be supplied by restoring this

impairment. iSuch restoration will generally imply a deduction from the incomes

of terminating sources, as at present given, of repair or redemption funds sufficient

to make the capital value of these sources permanent. The soiu-ces being thus

rendered economically permanent the incomes would be permanent also, whilst

their units being of the same denomination might be added, subtracted, or em-

plOTed as comparative measures of taxation without error or injustice.

EIf, using symbols, P be a source's production, its productive expenditure or

consumability, I its true income or profit, then I will be determinable by the
I=P --formula
                                                          E. Income will be thus universally definable as the difference
--between production and its cost the pure excess by production above capital, the

source's pure profit or permanent annual value.

                                         On tlie Progress of the Coal Question.

                                      By Professor W. Stanley Jetons, F.E.S.

The purpose of this paper is to conipcare statistical facts concerning the recent

progress of the output of coal with various predictions and theories which had

been published on the subject in the previous fifteen years. The quantity of coal

raised in the United Tiingdom in the year 1873 amounted to the enormous weight

of 127,000,000 tons, according to the mineral statistics of Mr. Hunt. Professor

Hull, in his valuable work on the English Coal-fields, had questioned the power of
the coal-fields to admit of a much greater drain in any one year than 100,000,003

tons, at which rate he believed the supply would be suflicient for eight centuries.

Facts now entu-ely negative the hypothesis of anj' such fixed limit.
  Sir W. Armstrong, in his Presidential Address of 1863, put forward his cele-

brated calculation, that the produce of coal was advancing by a uniform arithmetic

annual addition of 2^ millions of tons, at which rate the coal in the country, as

then estimated, would last only 212 years. According to this law of increase the

produce in 1873 ou^ht to be 119 millions, which is 8 millions h-ss than the truth,

the increase in the interval being at least 41 millions, instead of 33 millions, as it

would be according to Sir W. Armstrong's method of calculation. The annual

average addition to the output is now nearly 3^ millions of tons, instead of 2f mil-
                                            law
lions                       but  the  true       cannot                            really be  that                                                                                                                           of   arithmetic  increase,  which^  if
                         ;

followed backwards, would lead us to zero about the year 1830.

The true law of increase is that of a geometrical series, with the average annual

ratio of 31 per cent. According to this law, as described in the ' Coal Question'

in 1865 (1st ed. p. 213, 2ud ed. p. 240), it was calculated that the produce of

coal in 1871 would be about 117-9 millions. According to JSL-. Hunt s statistics

it proved to be actually 117,352,028 tons. Ou the same "method of calculation the

produce of 1873 would be about 126-3 millions                                                                                                                                                                                and  the actual quantity raised,    as
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

already stated, exceeds this by about 700,000 tons. In spite of the extraordinary

rise of price of coal in the years 1872 and 1873, the law of geometric increase is
thus remarkably verified.

In the Report of the Royal Commission on Coal some calculations of Mr. Price

Williams are put forward, in which the average consumption (apart fi-om expor-

tation) of coal per head of the population is assumed as rising from 3-9636 tons in

1871, to 4-4200 tons in 1881, 4-5786 tons in 1891, and so on, to a maximum of

4-6526 tons in 1941. But, according to this method, the consumption (not includ-

ing coals exported) of the year 1873 would be nearly millions less than the

truth. Mr. Price Williams believed that the rate of increase of consumption of

coal per head had passed its maximum, and was declining, whereas the most recent

statistics show that between 1869 and 1873 the advance was more than double

that in the interval 1805-69. The whole theory of Mv. Williams rested upon

the assumption that there was a continuous decease in the rate of increase of the
population, whereas his own tables showed that this increase was, in the last

decade (1861-71), 11-736 per cent, compared with 11-197 per cent., that of the

decade 1851-1861.

   It is further pointed out that the remarks of the Commissioners upon the " Coal
Question " proceed from an entire misapprehension of the arguments given in that

book. No one asserted that the production of coal in Great Britain ever would

rise to the higher quantities given by the geometric law of increase. The true
conclusion drawn was, " that 2cc cannot hmc/ maintain our jiresenf rate of increase of

consumption ; that %oe can riever advance to the hir/Jier amounts of consumjition sup-
posed. But this onlij means that the check to our prof/ress must become 2>ercej)tible

within a century from the present time."

In the year 1872 the price of coal rose in many places to a height two or three

times its previous highest amount. This rise was in some respects exceptional, but

was mainly due to tlie increased demand which, in spite of the enormous price,

advanced 5 per cent, per annum. The great increase in the number of collieries

produced by the extraordinary demand, will no doubt render the price more mode-

rate for some time                    to    come                              but  the  coal  famine                                                                                                                             of the  years 1872-73   may be
                                                                           ;

regarded as the first twinge of the scarcity which must come, and it has taught us

that coal has now become the first necessary of life in this kingdom.

On the Value of European Life in India in its Social, Political, and Ec.onomic
  Aspects. By F. J. Mouat, M.D., F.P.C.S., formerly Professor of Medicine

and Medical Jurisprudence in the Medical College of Calcutta, 6fc.

The intention of tins paper is to sliow tliat the high mortality rates which

have heretofore prevailed in India among civil and military lives were not neces-

sarily due to climatic causes or to unavoidable tropical risks, hut were largely

attributable to bad hy<rieuic conditions, imprudence of living, unnecessary or reck-
less exposure, and similar agencies. All of these were shown to be either removable

by sanitary measures or to be so much within the personal control of individuals

as to reduce the inevitable risks to life of residence or service in India to a very
moderate degree above the chances of prolonged existence in more temperate

climates. In support of this view carefully prepared tables were produced of the

deaths and invaliding among the European otiicers of H.M. British forces serving

in India from 18(31-70 inclusive. In these tables proof was aflbrded that in India

diseases of the abdominal organs take the place of the contents of the chest in
(jreat Britain as causing mortality, and that phthisis alone in the latter country
destroyed a larger ratio of persons in the active period of life than cholera, hepatic
disease, and dysentery combined did of Europeans in India ; while from all ordinary

causes and diseases there was no material difference between the casualties of

India and those of England.
   The gi-adual diminution of the death-rate in the English army in India within

the present century from 69 to 15 per thousand, the reduction of the ratio for

civil life in the covenanted services in a similar proportion, and the ascertained

death-rate of carefully selected European railway employes in India, 10 per 1000,

were all shown in their bearings on this great and important question.

The conclusions at which Dr. Mouat arrived were, that in carefully selected lives

of persons of prudent habits, in moderately comfortable circumstances, the risks to

life in India were so little above those of England as to render it perfectly safe to

insure those lives at English rates, which rates are known to be largely in excess of

the estimated and ascertained value of selected lives at home at corresponding ages.

Dr. Mouat also considered briefly the question of the colonization of India by

European settlers.  This he regarded very  much as  a question of  race                    and while
                                                                                        ;

he doubted the possibility of such colonization of tropical plains by the inhabitants

of Northern Europe, he was of opinion that on the Steppes of Central Asia and

the mountain-ranges of Hindostan it woidd be possible to rear as healthy, vigorous,

manly, and intelligent a people as in any country in the world.
   As" a social problem it was of great importance to determine that health and

strength could be maintained in India at no undue risk; as a political question
it had equally important bearings on the large drain upon the manhood of Great
Britain necessary for the maintenance of our Eastern Empire ; and as an economic
question it was scarcely secondaiy in interest, as affording a wide and productive

       On Legislative Protection to the Birds of Europe.

the Eood of Birds as a plea for their legislative protection.

   Having published the paper in the form of a small book, he had received
acknowledgments from members of the Committee in the House of Commons or

Committee in the matter. He therefore wished to urge legislation in foreign

countiies with a view of preventing the diminution of insectivorous birds, especially
which wintered in the south, and maintaining strongly the immense advantage of
protecting birds in the breeding-season as a means of increcasing vastly the value of
agricultural crops, and affirmed that the two years' experience of good crops in
England since the passing of the Act of 1872 was a proof of the correctness of his

statement. With a view of putting this thoroughly to the test, he challenged all
who were willing to join issue with him in the matter, both farmers, gardeners,

landholders, sportsmen, and naturalists, to produce facts and be ready to answer

his statement before the British Association next year. He stated he had had the

thanks, through their ambassador Count Miinster, of the Imperial German Govern-
ment for liis information with reference to legislation in Europe on the matter, and
was therefore anxious that the benefits of following the example of England might
be apparent. The author reviewed the European species with reference to their
economic value, and had in his hand recorded facts for the good of each bird.

       On the Industrial Position of Women as affected by their exclusion
                      from the Suffrage. By A. M. Priestman.

   The industrial resources of a people are best developed when every one exercises

his faculties fully.

   In England the tendency is towards this ideal condition : more men of the
upper ranks are engaged in trade and commerce now than formerly, and fewer men

in the lower ranks are injuriouslj^ overworked. This tendency, however, though
strongly marked amongst men, is not noticeable amongst women. The duties of

mere housekeeping are lighter than when brewing, spinning, &c. were done at
home ; whilst those women who have to work for their bread are increasingly
unable to gain employment, and those who have work are beset year by year with
new drags and difficulties. In some callings higher education is required than used

to be the case, and the educational standard is lower for girls than for boys, so they
cannot compete fairly. Trade-imions forbid their members to take girls as appren-

tices, so women cannot become skilled workers. The laws of the coimtry hamper
and harass women while they leave men free, so that the industrial value of
women's work has sunk so low that in this city of Bristol women may be found

making shirts for 2\d. each.
   The improvement in the industrial value of men's work has always grown out of

certain political conditions. Iudiie»trial proo-ress aud political freedom are so closely

--united that John Bright spoke at a meeting of trade-unions and trade societies in

18G6 and said : " Your duty, your ob\'ious duty, a duty from which you cannot

escape," is to bring all your organization to bear " on the working out of your

political redemption." The homes, the wages, the wealthy unions of enfrancliised

artisans, contrasted with the condition of unenfranchised agricultural labourers,

seeking charity to fly from their tumble-down cottages and hopeless future here

for lands across the sea, bear out the wisdom of his words.

  Why should not working women benefit, as worldng men have done, by the same

means ? It is said that thej' do not stand in need of the suffrage because in all ranks

men and women are so closely connected that the interests of every class of women

are watched over by some men as if identical with their own. The weakness of

this assertion is shown by tlie fact that men make laws for women which men in

the same position of life reject for themselves. The Factory Act of 1874 was

pressed upon the consideration of Mr. Mundella by working men. As a boon for
working women, many of the factory women were very much against it, for they

saw that  less work    meant less food or clothing                                                                                                                                      some                         of them in                                                                                                                        Leeds had  an

interview with the candidates for the representation of the borough, and urged

their views with cogent reasoning ; they were as courteously received as non-electors

usually are. But the folly of electors has more weight in Parliament than the

common sense of the unrepresented. The Factory Act became law, and Parliament

lent itself to one of the worst mistakes of the first Trade-Unions ; for to limit the

wages of men to one standard and to make a hard and fast line for the length of
time women shall work, though different in detail, are one in principle. Women's

wages have already been reduced in many places where the Act applies ; women

lose by the shilling or sixpence taken off their wages, and the country loses by the

lesser jn-oductiveuess of the 392,9^6 hands employed in the manufacture of te.vtile

goods. W'orking women are beginning to be alarmed at the dangers which

threaten them, aud are forming unions for their own protection. At the Trades

Congi-ess in January last, an excellent letter was read from Mrs. Paterson, the

Secretary of a League in London                                                                                                                                                         and the National L^nion of working women sent

upheld it for women ; they said they were acting entirely in the interests of women :
and two delegates said women ought to be prevented from working in some

trades altogether, for the work was not tit for                                                                                                                                         them                         and  added, they took                                                                                                             lower

dissentient (the women's delegate) it was agreed that the Parliamentary Com-

mittee should endeavour to obtain an extension of the Factory Act to other trades

where women are emploved.

Women would not work twelve or fourteen hours a day for a mere pittance if

they could enrn bread more easily, nor follow repulsi^'e callings if lighter trades

were open to them. It is clear that the interests of worldng women are not repre-

sented by the class of men to whom they belong, and that the industrial position

of women is suffering at their hands. The policy is as short-sighted as it is selfish
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;
for if women have  to  live at all they must eat;
                                                                                                                                                                                        and if they are shut out from iudus-

trial pursuits, they must live on the earnings of others, either on money supplied
Adirectly by individuals or indirectly by the State.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     country must lose in wealth

if a number of its inhabitants, who coidd be productive labourers, are made idle bv
force. If women worlced for their own bread, they would spend their monej' again

aud stimulate other trades. Productive industry is in if.self so expansive

that no one can determine the bounds which it shall not pass. In En-^land

where the employers of labour are ever supplementing the toil of the workman by
new inventions, new machinery, there must be room for more labourers if the laws
or the usages of society did not hold them back. The difficulty women find in
getting work is not because there is none in the country to be clone, but because

they are held in by artificial barriers, within which they crowd and jostle and
tread one another down in a terrible struggle to live. If these arbitrary hindrances

were taken away, the industrial efforts of women would find ample and enricliin"-

scope ; to do this, to remove these barriers, they must have their due share in the

Government can afford to forget must not expect to be fairly dealt with by the

is not gi-eater than the loss from waste thoughts prevailing up and down tlie king-

wanting to women.

Address hy Wii-liam Froude, Esq., C.E., 3I.A., F.B.S., President of

                                                          the Section,

Thk addreas of the President of a Section would year by year possess an appro-

priate interest, if it could always consist of an exposition of the progress made dui-ing

the past year in the department of science which the Section embraces. And
many of the addresses to this and other sections have conformed to this pattern

with marlicd success.

But the adequate preparation of an address shaped in this approved mould

would require a range of experience and a grasp of thought such as few possess

and custom has wisely sanctioned a type of address which, though less appropriate

to the occasion, need not be either uninteresting or inapposite. And we, in this

Section, have not to search far for instances in which its President has charmed

and instructed us by a masterful exposition of some single subject in practical

science, or by a timely reminder of the improvident manner in which we deal with

some precious store of natural wealth.

   I must express a hope that it will not be regarded as a conversion of liberty into

licence, if the subject I have chosen obliges me to introduce a further innovation,
and to use diagrams and experiments in order to make my meaning clear.

I propose to treat of certain of the fundamental principles which govern the be-

haviour of fluid, and this with special reference to the resistance of ships. By the
term "resistance" I mean the opposing force which a ship experiences in its pro-

gress through the water.

Considering the immense aggregate amount of power expended in the propulsion

of ships, or, in other words, in overcoming the resistance of ships, I trust you will

look favourably on an attempt to elucidate the causes of this resistance. It is true

that improved results in ship-building have been obtained tlirough accumulated

experience ; but it unfortunately happens that many of the theories by which this
experience is commonly interpreted are interwo^eu with fimdameutal fallacies,

which, passing for principles, lead to mischievous results when again applied

beyond the limits of actual experience.

The resistance experienced by ships is but a branch of the general question of tlie

forces which act on a body moving through a fluid, and has within a compara-
tively recent period been placed in an entirely new light by what is commonly

called the theory of stream-lines.

The theory as a whole involves mathematics of the highest order, reaching alike

mybeyond my ken and                                   purpose ; but I believe that, so far as it concerns the resist-

ance of ships, it can be sufficientlj^ understood without the help of technical mathe-

matics                                  and  I  will  endeavour  to explain  the course which  I  have  myself  found
                                     ;

most conducive to its easy apprehension.

It is convenient to consider tirst the case of a completely submerged body moving

Ain a straight line with imiform speed through an unlimited ocean of fluid.                                     fish

in deep water, a submarine motive torpedo, a sharp-ended sounding-lead while

descending through the water, if moving at imiform speed, are all examples of the

case I am dealing with.

It is a common but erroneous belief that the resistance to its onward motion ex-

perienced by such a body thus moving, originates in an increase of pressure through-

out its head end, and a diminution of pressure throughout its tail end. It is thus

supposed that the entire head end of the body has to keep on exerting pressure to
drive the fluid out of the way, to force a passage for the body, and that the entire

--tail end has to keep on exerting a kind of suction on the fluid to induce it to close

in again that there is, in foct, what is termed plus pressure throughout the head
end of the body and minus pressure or partial vacuum throughout the tail end.

   This is not so ; the resistance to the progress of the body is not due to these
causes. The theory of stream-lines discloses to us the startling but true propo-

sition, that a submerged body, if moving at a uniform speed tlu'ough a perfect

fluid, would encounter no resistance whatever. By a perfect fluid, I mean a fluid

which is free from viscosity, or quasi-solidity, and in which no ixiction is caused
by the sliding of the particles ol the fluid past one another, or past the surface of

the body.

   The property which I describe as " quasi-solidity " must not be confused with
that which persons have in their minds when they use the term " solid water."

When people in this sense speak of water as being " solid," they refer to the sen-

mtion of solidity experienced on striking the water-surface with the hand, or to
the reaction encountered by an oar-blade or propeller. "What I mean by "quasi-

solidity," is the sort of stifl'ness which is conspicuous in tar or liquid mud ; and this

property undoubtedly exists in water, though in a very small degree. But the sen-
sation of solid reaction which is encountered by the hand or the oar-blade is not
in any way due to this property, but to the ineHia of the water : it is in eflect this
inertia which is erroneously termed solidity ; and this inertia is possessed by the
perfect fluid with which we are going to deal, as fully as by water. Nevertheless

it is true, as I am presently going to show you, that the perfect fluid would ofier

no resistance to a submerged body moving through it at a steady speed. It will be
seen that the apparent contradiction in terms which I have just advanced is cleared
up by the circumstance, that in the one case we are dealing with steady motion,
and in the other case with the initiation or gi-owth of motion.

   In the case of a completely submerged body in the midst of an ocean of perfect

fluid, unlimited in every direction, I need hardly argue that it is immaterial

whether we consider the body as moving imiformly through the ocean of fluid, or
the ocean of fluid as moving uniformly past the body.

   The proposition that the motion of a body through a perfect fluid is unresisted,
or, what is the same thing, that the motion of a perfect fluid past a body has
no tendency to push it in the direction in which the fluid is flowing, is a novel
one to many persons ; and to such it must seem exti-emely startling. It arises from
a general principle of fluid motion, which I shfill presently put before you in detail
namely, that to cause a perfect fluid to change its condition of flow in any manner

whatever, and ultimately to return to its original condition of flow, does not require,
nay, does not admit of, the expenditure of any power, whether the fluid be caused
to flow in a cuin'ed path, as it must do in order to get round a stationary body
which stands in its way, or to flow with altered speed, as it must do in order
to get through the local contraction of channel which the presence of the sta-

tionary body practically creates. Power, it may indeed be said, is first expended, and

force exerted, to communicate certain motions to the fluid ; but that same power
will ultimately be given back, and the force counterbalanced, when the fluid yields
up the motion which has been communicated to it, and returns to its original con-

dition.

   I shall commence by illustrating the action on a small scale by fluid flowing
through variously shaped pipes ; and I must premise that in the greater part of
what I shall have to say, I shall not require to take account of absolute nydro-
static pressures. The flow of water through pipes is uninfluenced by the absolute

pressure of the water.

   I will begin with a very simple case, wliich I will treat in some detail, and

which will serve to show the nature of the argument I am about to submit to you.

   Suppose a rigid pipe of uniform sectional area, of the form shown in fig. 1

(Plate IX.), something like the form of the water-line of a vessel.

A B D EThe portions B, C, D,  are supposed to be equal in length, and of

Ethe same curvature, the pipe terminating at in exactly the same straight line in

which it commenced at A, so that its figure is perfectly symmetric on either side

of C, the middle point of its length.

   Let us now assume that the pipe has a stream of perfect fluid running through

Ait from towards E, and that the pipe is free to move bodily endways.

   It is not unnatural to assume at first sight that the tendency of the fluid would

-- Abe to push the pipe forward, in virtue of the opposing surfaces offered by the bends

in it that both the divergence between and C from the original line at A, and

the return between C and E to that line at E, would place parts of the interior

surface of the pipe in some manner in opposition to the stream or flow, and that the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                 223

flow thus obstructed would drive the pipe forward ; but if we endeavour to build
up these supposed causes in detail we iind the reasoning to be illusory.

I will now trace the results which can be established by correct reasoning.

The surface being assumed to be smooth, the fluid, being a perfect fluid, can

exercise no di"ag by friction or otherwise on the side of the pipe in the direction

of its length, and in fact can exercise no force on the side of the pipe, except
ANow Bat right angles to it.
the fluid flowing round the curve from to will, no

doubt, have to be deflected from its course, and, by what is commonly known as

centrifugal action, will press against the outer side of the curve, and this with a

determinable force. The magnitude and direction of this force at each portion of

Athe curve of the pipe between and B are represented by the small arrows marked
A/; and the aggregate of these forces between and B is represented by the larger

arrow marked G. B EIn the same way the forces acting on the pai-ts 0, C D, and 1)

are indicated by the arrows H, I, and J ; and as the conditions imder which the fluid

passes along each of the successive parts of the pipe <ire precisely alike, it follows

that the four forces are exactly- equal, and, as shown by the arrows in the diagram,

they exactl}"^ neutralize one another in virtue of their respective directions ; and

Atherefore the whole pipe from to E, considered as a rigid single structure, is

subject to no disturbing force by reason of the fluid running through it.

   Though this conclusion that the pipe is not pushed endways may appear on

reflection so obvious as to have scarcely needed elaborate proof, I hope that it has

not seemed needless, even though tedious, to follow somewhat in detail the forces

that act, and which are, under the assumed conditions, the only forces that act, on

a symmetrical pipe such as I have supposed.

Having shown that in the case of this special symmetrically curved pipe the

flow of a perfect fluid through it does not tend to push it endways, I will now pro-

ceed to show that this is also the case whatever may be the outline of the pipe,

provided that its beginning and end are in the same straight line.

Assume a pipe bent, and its ends joined so as to foriii a complete circular ring, and

the fluid within it running with velocity roimd the circle. This fluid, by centri-

fugal force, exercises a uniform outward pressure on every part of the uniform

cui've and this is the only force the fluid can exert. This pressure tends to tear
                                 ;

the ring asunder, and causes a uniform longitudinal tension on. each part of the

ring, in the same manner as the pressure within a cylindrical boiler makes a luii-

forni tension on the shell of the boiler.

Now, in the case of fluid running round within lings of various diameter, just

as in the case of railway trains running round curves of various diameter, if the

velocity along the curve remain the same, the outward pressure on each part of the

circumference is less, in proportion as the diameter becomes greater ; but the cir-

cumferential tension of the pipe is in direct proportion to the pressure and to the

diameter ; and since the pressure has been shown to be inversely as the diameter,

the tension for a given velocity will be the same, whatever be the diameter.

Thus, if we take a ring of doubled diameter, if the velocity is luichanged, the

outward pressure per lineal inch will be halved ; but this halved pressure, acting

with the doubled diameter, will give the same circumferential tension.

  Now this longitudinal tension is the same at every part of the ring ; and if we cut

out a piece of the ring, and supply the longitudinal tension at the ends of the piece,

by attaching two straight pipes to it tangentially (see Plate IX. fig. 2), and if we

maintain the flow of the fluid through it, the curved portion of the pipe will be under

just the same strains as when it formed part of the complete ring. It will be subject

merely to a longitudinal tension ; and if the pipe thus fonned be flexible, and fas-

tened at the ends, the flow of fluid through it will not tend to disturb it in any

waj'. Whatever be the diameter of the ring out of which the piece is assumed to be

cut, and whatever be the length of the segment cut out of it, we have seen that the

longitudinal tension will be the same if the fluid be moving at the same velocity
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         j

so that, if we piece together any number of such bends of any lengtlis and any

curvatures to form a pipe of any shape, such pipe, if flexible and listened at the

ends (see fig. 3), will not be disturbed b}' the flow of fluid through it ; and the

equilibrium of each portion and of the whole of the combined pipe will be satisfied

by a uniform tension along it,

                                                                    17*

Further, if the two ends of the pipe are in the same straight line, pointing away

from one another (sse Plate IX. tig. 4), since the tensions on the ends of the pipe
are equal and opposite, the flow of the fluid through it does not tend to push it

bodily endways*.

  This is the point which it was my object to prove; but in the course of this

proof there has incidentally appeared the further proposition, that a flexible, tor-

tuous pipe, if fastened at the ends, will not tend to be disturbed in any way by the
flow of fluid through it. This proposition may to some persons seem at first sight to

be so paradoxical as to cast some doubt on the validity of the reasoning which has

been used ; but the proposition is nevertheless true, as can be proved by a closely

analogous experiment, as follows :

Imagine the ends of the flexible tortuous pipe to be joined so as to form a closed

figure (see fig. 5), there will then be no need for the imaginary fastenings at the
ends, since each end will supply the fastening to the other. Then substitute for

the fluid flowing round the circuit of the pipe, a flexible chain, running in the same

path. In this case the centrifugal forces of the chain running in its curved path are

similar to those of the fluid flowing in the pipe ; and the longitudinal tension of the

chain represents in every relevant particular the longitudinal tension on tbe pipe.

As a simple form of this experiment, if a chain be set rotating at a very high

velocity over a pulley in tlie manner shown in fig. 6, it will be seen that the cen-

trifugal forces do  not tend to disturb the path of the ruiming  cliain                        and indeed,
                                                                                            ;

the velocity being extremely' great, the forces, in fact, tend to preserve the path of

the chain in opposition to any disturbing cause. On the other hand, if by sufli-

cient force we disturb it from its path, it tends to retain the new figure which has

been thus imposed upon it (see fig. 7).

  The apparatus with which I am about to verify this proposition has been lent to
me by Sir W. Thomson. It is one which he has used on many occasions for the

same purpose and I must add that the proposition in his hands has fori7icd the
                                                                            ;

basis of conclusions incomparably deeper and more important than those to which

I am now directing your attention.
   You observe, the cham when at rest hangs, in the ordinary catenary form, from

a large pulley with a very wide-moutlied groove and mounted in a frame which is

secured to the ceiling. By a simple arrangement of multiplying bauds the pidley

is driven at a high speed, carrying the chain round by the frictional adhesion of

its upper semi-circumference. "\A'hen at its highest speed the chain travels about

40 per second.

The idea that the chain when thus put in motion will be disturbed by its centri-

fugal force from the shape it holds while at rest, must point to one of two con-

clusions ; either (1) the chain will tend to open out into a complete circle, or (2)

it wiU on the contrary tend to stretch itself at its lower bend to a curvature of

infinite sharpness.

   But you oDserve that no tendency to eitlier change of form appears. On the

contrarj', the chain, instead of taking spontaneously any new form in virtue of its

centrifugal force, has plainly assumed a condition imder which it is with difficulty

disturbed, alike from its existing form, or from any other v/hich I communicate to

it by violently striking it. Such blows locally indent it almost as they would bend

a bar of lead.

In spite, however, of this quasi-rigidity which its velocity has imparted to it, it

does, if left to itself, slowly assume, as you perceive, a curious little contortion,
both as it approaches and as it recedes from the lower bend of the catenary ; and it

is both interesting and instructive to trace the cause of the deformalion.

I have ah'cady explained that the speed of the chain subjects it throughout to

longitudinal tension. Speaking quantitatively, the tension is equal to the weight

--of a length of the chain twice the height due to the velocity. This is ; and this,

=as the speed is about 40 feet per second, =-77^-  50 feet, or with this chain about

14 lbs.

  Now in travelling- through the lower bend of tlie catenary, the chain passes from

being nearly straight, to being sharplj' curved and immediately straightened again

and this change of form involves a continued pivoting of link within link, the fric-
tion being called into action by the tension which presses the surfaces together.
Each link thus in succession resists this pivoting with a definite force, and the
resistance, in effect, converts what appears to be a perfectly flexible combination

into one possessing a tangible degree of stiffness ; and the oblique attitude assumed
by the chain as it approaches the bend, and the slight back turn whicli it assumes

as it emerges from the bend, are alike consequences of this factitious stiffiiess.

    For, in virtue of gi-avity, the rimning chain, like the chain at rest, tends always
to maintain the original catenaiy ; and in virtue of its speed of rotation, it seeks to

maintain (not preferentially the catenary, but) whatever form it for the moment
possesses. Hence its departure from the true catenary was, as you saw, gi-adual.
But when the figure of equilibrium is once attained, the persistency of form im-

parted by velocity, serves to maintain this figme as indifferently as any other.
Hence the figure is that Iti which equilibrium subsists between tlie force of gravity

seeking to restore the catenary, and the factitious stifihess resisting the necessity
of bending and unbending.

   The slowness with which the form is assumed, and its steady persistency when
once assumed, alike boar witness to the truth of the proposition which it is the

object of the experiment to verify.

   The stream of fluid in the tortuous flexible pipe would behave in a strictly

analogous manner.

  myIt might at first sight appear that I have now the materials for the proof of

chief proposition, the assertion of the unresisted progress of a submerged body ; for
such a body might be assumed to be surrounded-by a system of imaginary pipes, as
shown in Plate IX. fig. 8; and each of these pipes being in equilibrium endways, that
is to say, the flow of fluid through it not tending in the aggregate to move it endways,
neither, it might be said, would the flow of fluid tend to move the submerged body

endways. But this reasoning would not be sound. The pipes we have hitherto been

considering have been of imiform sectional area throughout their length, an assump-
tion which has been necessary to the treatment pursued, as the velocity has in each

case been assumed to be uniform throughout the pipe. The section of the pipe may
have been square, circular, trapezoidal, or any other form ; but the area of the sectic n

has been assumed to be the same throughout the length of the pipe.
   But pipes of uniform sectional area do not truly represent the flow of a fluid past

a submerged body. I shall presently ask you to consider the fluid as floVing past
the body through a system of imaginary pipes; but to render the assumption ad-
missible, the sides of the imaginary pipes must not be so placed as to interfere with

the established course of the fluid, whatever that may be; in other words, if, for
the sake of illustrating the behaviour of the fluid, we assume that it is divided into
streams or filaments flowing through imaginary pipes, we must accept such a form

for those imaginary pipes that their sides exactly follow the path of the adjacent
particles of fluid.

  Now such a rule may, and probably will, requhe the imaginary pipes to be of

varying- sectional area throughout their length. Therefore, before we can apply

the analogy of the flow of fluid through pipes to the flow of a fluid past a sub-
merged body, it is necessary to consider the behaviour of fluid in pipes of varying

sectional area.

   It is, I think-, a very common but erroneous impression, that a fluid in a pipe

exercises, in the case of its meeting a contraction (see fig. 9), an excess of pressure
against the entire converging siu-face which it meets, and that, conversely, as it
enters an enlargement (see fig. 10) a relief of pressure is experienced by the entire

diverging siu-face of the pipe. Further it is commonly assumed that, when passing

through a contraction (see fig. 11), there is in the narrow neck an excess of pres-
sure due to the squeezing together of the fluid at that point.

    These impressions are in no respect con-ect ; the pressure at the smallest part of
the pipe is, in fact, less than that at any other point, and vice versd.

   If a fluid be flowing along a pipe which has a contraction in it (see fig. 12),

Bthe forward velocity of the fluid at must be greater than that at A, in the pro-
                                                                                      ;;

226 REPORT--1875.

B Aportion in whicli the sectional area of the pipe at is less than that at ; and
A Btherefore while passing from to the forward velocity of the fluid is being

increased. This increase of velocity implies the existence of a force acting in the

direction of the motion ; that is to say, each particle which is receiving an increase

of forward velocity must have a greater fluid pressure behind it than in front of it

for no other condition will cause that increase of forward velocity. Hence a par-

ticle of fluid, at each stage of its progress along the tapering contraction, is passing

from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure, so that there must be

a greater pressure in the larger part of the pipe than in the smaller, and a diminution

of pressure at each point corresponding ·with the diminution of sectional area ; and

this difference of pressure must be such as to supply the force necessary to establish

the additional forward velocity required at each point of the passage of the fluid

through the contraction. Consequently, difi'erences of pressure at different points

in the pipe depend simply upon the velocities at those points, or, in other words,

on the relative sectional areas of the pipe at those points*.

It is simple to apply the same line of reasoning to the converse case of an enlarge-

ment. Here the velocity of the particles is being reduced through precisely the

same series of changes, but in an opposite order. The fluid in the larger part of

the pipe moves more slowly than that in the smaller, so that, as it advances into the

enlargement, its forward velocity is being checked ; and this check implies the ex-

istence of a force acting in a direction opposite to the motion of the fluid, and each

particle being thus retarded must therefore have a greater fluid pressure in front of it

than behind it ; thus a particle of fluid at eacli stage of its progress along a tapering

enlargement of a pipe is passing from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher

pressure. As is well known, the force requfred to produce a given change of velocity

is the same, whether the change be an increase or a decrease. Hence, in the case of

an enlargement of a pipe, as in the case of a contraction, the changes of velocity

can be satisfied only by changes of pressm-e, and the law for such change of pres-

sure will be the same, mutatis mutandis.

In a pipe in which there is a contraction and a subsequent enlargement to the

same diameter as before (see fig. 11), since the diflerences of pressure at difierent
points depend on the diflerences of sectional area at those points, by a law

which is exactly the same in an enlarging as in a contracting pipe, any points

which have the same sectional area will have the same pressures, the pressm-es

at the larger areas being larger, and those at the smaller areas smaller.

Precisely the same result will follow in the case of an enlargement followed by

a contraction (see Plate IX. fig. 13)t.

This proposition can be illustrated by experiments performed with water.

   Figs. 14, 15, show certain pipes, the one a contraction followed by an enlarge-
ment, and the other an enlargement followed by a contraction. At certain points

in each pipe, vertical gauge-glasses are connected, the water-levels in which

  E PIn fig. 14 the sectional areas at and are equal to one another. Those at

K Eand are likewise equal to one another, but are smaller than those at and P.

The area at I is the smallest of all. Now, if the water were a perfect fluid, the
H Kpressures P Q and E D would be equal, and would be greater than
H K NC and                                                                 and N.

              would also be equal to one another, and woidd be themselves greater

than I J.

The results shown in fig. 15 are similar in land, equal pressures corresponding to

equal areas.

As water is not a perfect fluid, some of the pressure at each successive point is

lost in friction; and this growing defect in pressure is indicated in the successive

gauge-glasses in the manner shown in figs. 10, 17.
   As the pressure of the perfect fluid in the pipe at any point depends upon the

sectional area at that point, it follows that the amounts of the pressures are inde-

pendent of tlie distance, as measured along the pipe, in which the area of the pipe

alters ; so that if in the pipe shown in Plate IX. fig. 18 the areas at all the points

Bmarked A. are equal, if also the areas at all the points marked ai-e equal, and so

Aalso with those at and D, then the pressures at all the points will be the same,

Bthe pressures at all the points will be the same, and so with those at and D.

    Since, then, the pressure at each point depends on the sectional area at that

point and on that only, it is easy to see that the variations in pressure due to the

now, are not such as can cause any total endways force on the pipe, provided its

sectional area at each end is the same.

ABTake the pipe shown in fig. 19. The conical portion of pipe  presents

the same area of surface effective for endways pressure as does the conical

portion HI, only in opposite directions. They are both subject to the same pres-

sure, being that appropriate to their effective mean diameter J. Consequently

the endwaj's pressures on these portions are equal and opposite and neutralize one

another. Precisely in the same way it may be seen that the endways pressures

on B C, D, D E exactly counteract those on G H, F G, E F ; and in precisely the

same way it may be shown that in any combination whatever of enlargements and

contractions, provided the sectional area and direction of the pipe at the two ends

are the same, the total endways effect impressed on the pipe by the fluid flowing

through it must be nil.

  In the experiment I am about to show you, the several propositions which I

have been elucidating will be seen to be verified step by step, if due allowance be

made for the effect of friction.

  A cistern (see Plate X. fig. 20), in which a definite head of water is maintained,

discharges itself through a continuous series of pipes, which, in their local changes

of diameter, exhibit the several characteristic features which have been under con-

sideration.

   From « to e at the outlet end, we have a contraction followed by an enlargement
from e to g the diameter is imiform ; from A to / we have an enlargement followed
by a contraction. At the various critical featm-es are fitted gauge-glasses such as

have been described, so that the level at which the water stands in each indicates

the pressure in the pipe at the point of attachment.

   The series of pipes is laid out on an inclination which represents the mean resist-
ance due to friction, or the " head " lost by friction, between the cistern and the

--outlet in other words, the hydraulic mean gradient.

   The mean diameter of the contracted part between a and c has been so deter-
mined by well-known hydraulic rules, that when it is compared with the adjoining
parallel pipe, the hydraulic gi-adient shall be the same in each.

   You observe that while the levels at which the water stands in the several gauge-

glasses, correspond from end to end with the gradient from the head in the cistern

to the head at the outlet, when examined in detail they verify thi'oughout the

propositions I have been establishing.

   For if for the moment we regard the gradient as vu'tually level, the depressions

of the several columns below it due to varying velocity of flow should be inversely

as the fom'th powers of the several diameters ; but the local frictional gradient
should be is inversely as the fifth power of the diameter, and thus steepest where
the diameter is smallest. And, broadly speaking, the results plainly conform to

these rules. As a quantitative verification I point out that by careful calculation
the mean diameter, and therefore the gradient from a' to c', is the same as that for

the parallel pipe from e' to y'; and the result agrees exactly with the calculation.
   In dealing with pipes of varying sectional area I have hitherto treated only of

the modifications caused in the forward motion of the particles of fluid ; for I have
limited the argument to cases where the alteration in sectional area of the pipe is
so gradual that, practically, the only alteration in the motion of the particles is
that in their forward velocity ; but I have previously shown that tortuosity in a pipe
of uniform diameter does not introduce endways pressure, provided the initial and
terminal directions are the same ; and it is easy to see that an elongated system of

such gradually tapered pipes as we have been considering may bo also tortuous
228 REPORT--1875.

Nowwithout introduciiig endways pressure.   tortuosity of flow is but anotlier

word for sideways deviation of flow.

This leads us* up to the case of more sudden contractions or enlargements in

pipes, where the particles next the sides of the pipes have to follow their surfaces

and must therefore be moved rapidly sideways in their course.

  We will, for simplicity, consider the case of a contraction (see Plate XI. f)g. 21),

and one in which the pipe resumes the same diameter beyond the contraction.

The particles along the central line pua-sue a straight course, and are subject

only to the changes of pressiu-o necessary to induce the changes of velocity.

   lo consider the behaviour of the other particles, let us assume that we insert

anumber of perfectly thin partitions (see fig. 22), which we lay in sach a manner that

they exactly follow the paths of the particles of fluid at each point, so as not in

any way to affect tlieii' motion ; these partitions are quite imaginary, and merely

assist us in looking upon the entire fluid in question as divided into a number of

small streams. These streams are generally curvilinear, and -vary in sectional

area ; and at the point beyond the contraction where the pipe resimies its former

sectional area, we shall natiu-ally find these minor streams occupying the same

sectional area as before, and moving with the same velocity as before.

  Now each of these small streams is exactly represented by a stream of fluid

flowing within a pipe, that pipe being curvilinear and gradually varying in sectional

area, and its two ends being of the same sectional area and in the same straight

Weline.  have seen that in the case of such a stream the sum total of all

the forces due to its motion has no resultant longitudinally ; and this will be

equally the case, whether the envelope of the stream be an actual pipe or the

mutual pressure of adjacent streams ; this envelope will not be moved endways by

the flow of the fluid. What is true of each stream is true of all put together; and

thus it follows that the whole bodj^ of fluid which these separate streams constitute,

does not exert any endways force ; or, in other words, there will be equilibrium of

fluid forces throughout tlie passage of the fluid through a local contraction in a

pipe, such as we have been considering. The same line of argument evidently

holds good in the case of an enlargement, where the pipe beyond the enlargement

regains the same diameter as before.

   In illustration of the conclusions which have been thus far established, if we

had a perfect fluid with which to try the experiment, we luight exhibit a very

instructive and striking result.

  A BAssume a stream of perfect fluid flowing through a pipe of very large diameter,

C, with a contraction in it, at B, as shown in fig. 23, and that the equal pressures at

A and C on either side of the contraction are indicated by the head of fluid in pres-
A E--sure-gauges D, C
                       the pressure at B, which will be less, being represented by

B Athe height F. Now, the condition of the pipe at will be just the same if we sup-

pose the pipe supplied from a large cistern G, as shown in fig. 24; and the appro-

A Gpriate pressure at will be maintained if the fluid stands in the cistern at a
Aheight H, equal to the head D in the pressure-gauge. So, again, the condition of

the pipe at C will be the same if the pipe discharges into a cistern, I ; and the appro-

priate pressure at C will be maintained, and can only be maintained, if the water
m Ethe cistern stands at a height J, equal to the head
                                                         in the pressure-gauge,

Gwhich is, in fact, the same level as TI in the cistern    so that if we once esta-

                                                         ;

ABC,blish the motion through the pipe       and maintain the supply of fluid, we

shaU have the fluid running rapidly, and continuing to nin ·wdth unabated

rapidity, from one cistern into another, though both are at the same head.

  BIf we take such a condition of things that the pressure at is zero, or, in other

ABwords, if the velocity at is that due to the head D, then we might cut the

Bpipe at and separate the two cisterns, and we shoidd find the fluid issuing at
B in a jet, and re-entering the pipe again at K, and rising as before in the cistern

I to the same level with a perpetual flow.

The experiment here suggested is, if rightly understood, only a specialized

instance of the properties of what in the previous experiment was termed a con-

traction followed by an enlargement ; it is, in fact, as if in that experiment the

diameter of the contracted part had been so far reduced that the pressure within it

--would have sunk apparently to zero that is lo say, in reality, to the pressure of
                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

tlie atmosphere; in that case, of course, the pipe which enclosed that portion of

the stream would have become simply an inert envelope, and might have been
removed without aiFecting- the dynamic properties of the stream. Theoretically,

indeed, with the frictionless fluid the contraction of jet might he carried so far as

not merely to obliterate all positive pressure, but to produce a negative pressure

equal to that of the atmosphere. For, in fact, the conditions thus brought into

operation would be in efiect identical with those which would exist if the experiment
were performed in vacuo, and the head in cistern and at the outlet were both in-

creased by 34 feet ; but the theoretical possibility thus indicated is greatly curtailed

by friction ; and the illustrative experiment I am about to exhibit deals only with

the case in Avhich the pressure at the contraction is reduced apparently to zero, or

in reality, as I have said, to that of the atmosphere.

   In the apparatus as here arranged (see Plate XI. fig. 25), consisting of the dis-
charging and the recipient cistern, with the intervening jet-orifice and recipient-

orifice, the overflow of the recipient cistern is at 18 inches above the centre of the

orifices.

As I continue to fill the discharge cistern, you observe the jet shoots across the

open space between the orifices, and the water-level continues to rise in the recipient
cistern ; and so long as the head in the former is maintained at a moderate height
above that in the latter, the whole of the stream enters the recipient-orifice, and

there is no waste except the small sprinkling which is occasioned by inexactness of

aim, and hj the want of exact circularity in the orifices.

  When the head in the recipient has reached the o-^erflow, and thus remains at a

steady height of 18 inches above the orifices, the virtually complete reception is
insured by maintaining a head of 20^ inches in the discharging cistern, or an excess
of head of 2| inches on the discharge side ; and this excess, in efl'ect, represents the
energy wasted in friction.

   You observe that as I diminish the supply of water and allow the excess of head

in the discharger to become reduced, a steadily increasing waste becomes established

between the orifices ; and it is interesting to trace exactly the manner in which the

friction operates to produce this result.

If the conoids of discharge and reception are tolerably short as they are here, it

is the outer annuli or envelopes of the stream which are in the first instance affected,

that is to say retarded, by friction                                                                                                                               and the escape or  waste  between  the  orifices
                                                                                                                                                                ;

implies that this surface-retardation has reduced the velocity of those envelopes

below that due to the head in the recipient ; thus an annular counter-current is

able to establish itself, and in fact constitutes a counter discharge from the recipient.

As the head in the discharger is more and more reduced, the diminishing velocity

of the central inflow into the recipient offers less and less frictional resistance to the

annular counter-current which envelops it, and the waste continually increases

it is probable, however, that to the last the velocity of the central zones of the jet

remains equal to that due to the head in the discharger ; and hence you wiU observe

that unless this is reduced below the level of the overflow, the head in the recipient

is fully maintained to that level, though the whole quantity discharged is wasted

between the orifices.

When the supply is altogether cut ofl", both cisterns simultaneously empty them-

selves, the two jets meeting between the orifices and becoming spread into a beau-

tifvU plane disk or film of water at right angles to the line of discharge ; but you will
notice that from some inequality in the commencement of the action, and to some

extent probably from a quasi-instability in the equilibrium of the double discharge,

one of the jets will presently for a moment get the better of the other and drive it

back so as almost to an-est its flow, and thus for the moment arrest also the waste of

head on that side ; but the momentary excess of head thus occasioned, almost in-

stantly asserts its superiority, producing a jet of superior force, and thus driving-

back for a moment the opponent by which it had just before been mastered. Thus
a curious oscillation of discharge ensues, which is to a large extent a tiiie dynamic
phenomenon somewhat analogous to that which becomes established in an inverted
siphon partly filled with water, if for a moment the head is increased in one of tlie
legs ; the reaction which in the siphon is furnished by the other leg, beyond the bend,

is, in the case before you, furnished by the dynamic reaction of the jets ; but the cir-
--330 REPORT 1875.

cumstances here involve an instability which does not exist there, so that the small
initial disturbance presently magnifies itself into one of considerably greater range.

   This curious corollary phenomenon of the alternated retardation of discharge,
thouo-h not strictly relevant to the main object of the experiment, is nevertheless
highfy interesting in itself, and tends to enlarge our apprehension of some of the

characteristic features of fluid dynamics.
   In this treatment of the propositions concerning the flow of fluid through pipes,

I have at length laid the necessary foundation for the treatment of the case of the
flow of an iuflnite ocean past a submerged body. I have shown these propositions
to be based on principles which are imdeniable, and the conclusions from which,

when they seemed in any way startling or paradoxical, you have seen confirmed

by actual experiment.
   I have dealt with the case of a single stream of uniform sectional area (and there-

fore of uniform velocity of flow) enclosed in a pipe of any path whatever ; I have
dealt with the case of a single stream of very gradually varying sectional area and
velocity of flow; and I have dealt with the case of a combination (or fiiggot, as it
were) of such streams, each to some extent curved and to some extent varying in
sectional area, together composing the whole content of a pipe or passage having
enlargements or contractions in its course ; and in all these cases I showed that,
provided the streams or pipe-contents finally retm'n to their original path and their
original velocity of flow, they administer no total endways force to the pipe or

channel which causes their deviations.

   I am now going to deal with a similar combination of such streams, which,
when taken together, similarly constitute an infinitely extended ocean, flowing

steadily past a stationarv submerged body ; and here also I shall show that the
combination of curved streams surrounding the body, which together constitute the
ocean flowing past it, retm-n finally to their original direction and velocity, and
cannot adniinister to the body any endways force.

    The argument in this case is, in reality, precisely the same as that in the case of
the contractions and enlargements in pipes which I have already dealt with ; for,
in fact, the flow of the ocean past the stationary submerged body is only a more
general case of the flow of fluid through a contracted pipe ; but, though the cases
are really the same, there is considerable difference in their appearance ; and there-
fore I will proceed to point out how the arguments I have abeady used apply

 equally to this case.

    Everv particle of the fluid composing the ocean that passes the body must

undoubtedly follow some path or o\her, though we may not be able to find out
what path ; and every particle so passing is preceded and followed by a continuous

Westream of particles all following the same path, whatever that may be.

may, then, in imagination, divide the ocean mto streams of any size and of any
cross-section we please, provided they fit into one another, so as to occupy the
 whole space, and provided the boimdaries which separate the streams exactly

 follow the natural courses of the particles.
     I before sugo-ested a similar conception of the constitution of the ocean flowing

 past the stationary body, and there pointed out that the streams forming this

 system must not only be ciu-Ved in order to get out of the way of the body, but
 might each require to have to some extent a diflerent sectional area, and therefore a
 ditferent velocity of flow at diflerent points of their course. If we trace the streams
 to a sufficient distance ahead of the body, we shall there find the ocean flowing
 steadily on, completelv undisturbed by, and as we may say ignorant of, the exist-
 ence of the body which it will ultimately have to pass. There, all the streams must

 have the same direction, the same velocity of flow, and the same pressure. Again,

 if we pm-sue their course backwards to a sufficient distance behind the body, we
 shall find them all again flowing in their original direction ; they will also have

 all resumed their original velocity ; for otherwise, since the velocity of the ocean

 as a whole cannot have changed, we should have a number of parallel streams

 having different velocities and therefore different pressures side by side with one

 another, which is an impossible slate of things*.

     * In an imperfect fluid it is possible to have p.irallel streams having different velocities

 side by side with one another, because, in an imperfect fliud, change of velocity may have

 been communicated by friction, and therefore does not imply difference of pressure.

Although, in order to get past the body, these streams follow some courses

or other, various both iu direction and velocity, into which courses they settle

themselves in virtue of tlie various reactions which they exert upon one another

and upon the surface of the body, yet ultimately, and through the operation of

the same causes, they settle themselves into their original direction and original

Nowvelocity.  the sole cause of the original departure of each and all of these

streams from, and their ultimate return to, their original direction and velocity, is tlio

submerged stationary body ; consequently the body must receive the sum total of the

forces necessary to thus affect them. Conversely this sum total of force is the only

force which the passage of the fluid is capable of administering to the body. But

we know that to cause a single stream, and therefore also to cause any combination

or system of streams, to follow any courses changing at various points both in direc-

tion and velocity, requires the application of forces the sum total of which in a lon-
gitudinal direction is zero, provided that the end of each stream has the same direc-
tion and velocity as its beginning. Therefore the sum total of forces (in other words
the only force) brought to bear upon the body by the motion of the fluid in the

direction of its flow is zero*.

   I have now shown how it is that an infinite ocean of perfect fluid flowing past

a stationary body cannot administer to it any endways force, whatever be the nature
of the consequent deviations of the streams of fluid. The question, what will be

in any given case the precise configuration of those deviations, is irrelevant to the

proof I have given of this proposition. Nevertheless it is interesting to know some-
thing, at least, of the general character which these deviations, or " stream-lines,"

assume in simple cases ; therefore I have exhibited some in Plate XI. figs. 26, 27,
which are drawn according to the method explained by the late Professor Rankine.

   The longitudinal lines represent paths along which particles flow; they may
therefore be regarded as boundaries of the .streams into which wo imagined the

ocean to be divided.

  We see that, as the streams approach the body, their fii-st act is to broaden, and

consequently to lose velocity, and therefore, as we know, to increase in quasi-

hydrostatic pressm-e. Presently they again begin to narrow, and therefore quicken,
and diminish in pressure, until they pass the middle of the body, by which time
they have become narrower than in their original undistmbed condition, and con-

sequently have a greater velocity and less pressure than the undisturbed fluid.
After passing the middle they broaden again until they become broader than in
their original condition, and therefore have less velocity and greater pressure than

the undistiu-bed fluid. Finally, as they recede from the body they narrow again,
until they ultimately resimie their original dimension, velocity, and pressm-e.

   Thus, taking the pressm'e of the surrounding undisturbed fluid as a standard,

we have an excess of pressure at both the head and stern ends of the body, and a

defect of pressure along the middle.

We proved just now that, taken as a whole, the fluid pressures could exert no
Weendways push upon the stationary body.
                                          now see something of the way in

which the separate pressures act, and that they do not, as seems at fii'st sight

natural to expect, tend all in the du'ection in which the fliud is flowing ; on the

contrary, pressure is opposed to pressure, and suction to suction, and the forces

neutralize one another and come to nothing ; and thus it is that an ocean of per-

fect fluid flowing at steady speed past a stationaiy submerged body does not tend to

push it in the direction of the flow. This being so, a submerged body travelling

at steady speed through a stationary ocean of perfect fluid will experience no

resistance.

  We wiU now consider what wiU be the result of substituting an ocean of water

for the ocean of perfect fluid.

   The difl'erence between the behaviour of water and that of the theoretically

perfect iiuid is twofold, as follows :

   First. The particles of water, unlike those of a perfect fluid, exert a drag or
frictiouul resistance upon the surface of tlie body as they glide along it. This
action is commonly termed surface-friction, or slriu-friction ; and it is so well
known a cause of resistance that I need not say any thing fmlher on this point,

              * See Appendix, Note C,
232 REPORT--1875.

except tbis, tliat it constitutes almost the wliole of the resistance experienced hy
bodies of tolerably easy shape traTelling under water at any reasonable speed.

   Secondly. The mutual friclional resistance experienced by the particles of water

in moving past one another, combined willi the almost imperceptible degree of vis-
cosity which water possesses, somewhat hinders the necessary stream-line motions,

alters their nice adjustment of pressm-es and velocities, and thus defeats the balance

of stream-line forces and induces resistance. This action, however, is imperceptible

in forms of fairly easy shape. On the other hand, angular or very blunt features

entail considerable resistance fi'om this cause, because the stream-line distortions

are in such cases abrupt, and degenerate into eddies, thus causing gi-eat differences
of velocity between adjacent particles of water, and great consequent friction be-
tween them. " Dead water," in the wake of a ship with a full run, is an instance

of this detrimental action.

   So far we have dealt with submerged bodies only ; we will now take the case of

a ship travelling at the surface of a perfect fluid. But first, let us suppose the

surface to be covered with a sheet of rigid ice, and the ship cut off level with

her water-line, so as to travel beneath the ice, floating, howe-\-er, exactly in the same
position as before (see Plate XI. fig. 28). As the ship travels along, the stream-line

motions will be the same as for a submerged body, of which the ship may be regarded
as the lower half; and the ship will move without resistance, except that due to the

two causes I have just spoken of, namely surface-friction and mutual friction of the
particles. The stream-line motions being the same in character as those we have

been consideiing, v.e shall still have at each end an excess of pressure which will tend

to force up the sheet of ice, and along the side we shall have defect of pressure
tending to suck down the sheet of ice. If, now, we remove the ice, the fluid will
obviously rise in level at each end, so that excess of hydrostatic head may afford

the necessary reaction against the excess of pressxu-e ; and the fliud will sink by

the sides, so that defect of hydrostatic head may afford reaction against the defect

of pressure ; and the same actions and reactions will happen in the imperfect fluid,
water, making only the same allowance for the modification of velocities and pres-

sures by friction as were sho'wn to be necessary in treating of wholly submerged

bodies.

   The hills and valleys thus formed in the water arc, in a sense, waves ; and, though
originating in the stream-line forces of the body, yet when originated, they come

rmder the dominion of the ordinary laws of wave-motion, and, to a large extent,

behave as independent waves.
   The consequences which result from this necessity are most intricate ; but the

--final upshot of all the different actions which take place is plainly this that

the ship in its passage along the surface of the water has to be continually sup-

plying tlie waste of an attendant system of waves, which, from the nature of tlieir con-

stitution as independent waves, are continually difliisiug and transmitting them-
selves into the surroundii^g water, or, where they form what is called broken water,

crumbling away into froth. Now waves represent energy, or work done ; and

therefore all the energy represented by the waves wasted from the system attend-

ing the ship, is so much work done by the propellers or tow-ropes which are urging
the ship. So much wave-energy wasted per mile of travel, is so much work done
per mile ; and so much work done per mile is so much resistance, and this cause of

resistance at least would operate with full effect even in a perfect fluid.

  The actions involved in this cause of resistance, which is sometimes termed " Wave-

Genesis," are so complicated that no extensive theoretical treatment of the subject can

be usefullj' attempted. All that can be known about the subject must, for the present

I believe, be sought by direct experiment.

Having thus briefly described the several elements of a ship's resistance, I will

proceed to draw yoiu' attention more particularly to certain resulting conside-

lations of practical importance. Do not, however, suppose that I shall \enture on

dictating to shipbuilders what sort of ships they ought to build : I have so little

form is better than some otlier, it will be with the simple object of illustrating the

application of principles, by following which it wonld be possible to design a ship of

given displacement to go at given speed, with miuinium resistance, in smooth water

in fact, to make the best performance in a " measured mile " trial.

 --I have pointed out that the causes of resistance to the motion of a ship through

the water are : first, surface-friction ; secondly, mutual friction of the particles

of water (and this is only practically felt when there are features sufficiently abrupt

to cause eddies); and thirdly, wave-genesis. I have also shown that these are the

only causes of resistance. I have shown that a submerged body, such as a iish, or

torpedo, travelling in a perfect fluid, would experience no resistance at all ; that in

water it experiences practically no resistance but that due to surface-friction and

the action of eddies ; and that a ship at the surface experiences no resistance in

addition to that due to these two causes, except that due to the waves she makes.

I have done my best to make this clear ; but there is an idea that there exists a

form of resistance, a something expressed by the term " direct head-resistance,"

which is independent of the above-mentioned causes. Tliis idea is so largely

prevalent, of such long standing, and at first sight so plausible, that I am anxious

not to leave any misunderstanding on the point.

myLest, then, I should not have made  meaning sufficiently clear, I s.ay distinctly,

that the notion of head-resistance, in any ordinary sense of the word, or the

notion of axiy opposing force due to the inertia of the water on the area of the

ship's way, a force acting iipou and measured by the ai-ea of midship section, is,

from beginning to end, an entire delusion. No such force acts at all, or can act,

as throughout the greater part of this address I have been endeavouring to explain.

No doubt, if two ships are of precisely similar design, the area of midship section
may be used as a measure of the resistance, because it is a measure of the size of

the ship ; and if the ships were similar in every respect, so also would the length of

the bowsprit, or the height of the mast, be a measure of resistance, and for just the

same reason. But it is an utter mistake to suppose that any part of a ship's resist-

ance is a direct effect of the inertia of the water which has to be displaced from

the area of the ship's way. Indirectly the inertia causes resistance to a ship at the

surface, because the pressm-es due to it make waves. But to a submerged body,

or to the submerged portion of a ship travelling beneatli rigid ice, no resis-

tance whatever will be caused by the inertia of the water which is pushed aside.

And this means that, if we compare two such submerged bodies, or two such sub-

merged portions of ships travelling beneath the ice, as long as they are both of suffi-

ciently easy shape not to cause eddies, the one which will make the least resistance

is the one which has the least skin smface, though it have twice or thrice the area

of midship section of the other.

 --The resistance of a ship, then, practically consists of three items namely, surface-

friction, eddy-resistance, and wave-resistance.

Of these the first-named is, at least in the case of large ships, much the largest

item. In the 'Greyhound,' a bluff ship of 1100 tons, only 170 feet long, and

having a thick stem and sternposts, thus making considerable eddy-resistance, and

at 10 knots visibly making large waves, the surface-friction was 68 per cent, of the

whole resistance at that speed ; and there can be no doubt that with the long iron

ships now built, it must be a far greater proportion than that. Moreover the ' Grey-

hound ' was a coppered ship ; and most of the work of om- iron ships has to be done
when they are rather foul, which necessarily increases the surface-friction item.

The second item of resistance, namely the formation of eddies, is, I believe, imper-

ceptible in ships as finely formed as most modern iron steamships. Thick square-

shaped stems and sternposts are the most fruitful source of this land of resistance.

The third item is wave-resistanco. On this point, as we have seen, the stream-

line theory rather suggests tendencies, than supplies quantitative resiilts, because,

though it indicates the nature of the forces in which the waves originiite, tlie laws

of such wave-combinations are so very intricate, that they do not enable us to pre-

dict what waves will actually be formed under any given conditions.

There are, however, some rules, I will not call them principles, which have to

some extent been confirmed by experiment. At a speed dependent on her length

and form, a ship makes a very large wave-resistance. At a speed not much
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

234 REPORT--1875.

lower tlian this, the wave-resistaoice is considerably less, and at low speeds it is

insignificant. Lengthening- the entrance and run of a ship tends to decrease the

wave-resistance ; and it is better to have no parallel middle body, but to devote the
entu-e length of the ship to the entrance and run, though in tlais case it be neces-

sary to increase the midship section in order to get the same displacement in a

given length.

   With a ship thus formed, with fair water-lines from end to end, the speed at
which wave-resistance is accumulating most rapidly, is the speed of an ocean wave

the length of which, from crest to crest, is about that of the ship from end to end.

   I have said we may practically dismiss the item of eddy-resistance. The problem,

then, to be solved in designing a ship of any given size, to go at a given speed with

the least resistance, is to so form and proportion the ship that at the given speed

the two main causes of resistance, namely surface-friction and wave-resistance,

when added together, may be a minimum.
  In order to reduce wave-resistance we should make the ship very long. On the

other hand, to reduce the surface-friction we should make her comparatively short,

so as to diminish the surface of wetted skin. Thus, as comnionh' happens in such

problems, we are endeavouring to reconcile couilicting methods of improvement

and to work out the problem in any given case, we require to know actual quan-

Wetities.  have sufficient general data from which the skin-resistance can be de-

termined by simple calculation ; but the data for determining, wave-resistance must

be obtained by direct experiments upon difierent forms to ascertain its value for

each form. Such experiments should be directed to determine the wave-resistance

of all varieties of water-line, cross section, aud proportion of length, breadth, smd

depth, so as to give the comparative results of difierent forms as well as the absolute

result for each.

  An exhaustive series of such experiments could not be tried with full-sized
ships; but I trust that the experiments I am now carrying out with models, for the

Admiralty, are gradually .accumulating the data required on this branch of the subject.

I wish in conclusion to insist again, with the greatest lU'gency, on the hopeless

futility of any attempt to theorize on goodness of form in ships, except under the

strong and entirely new light which the doctrine of stream-lines throws on it.

   It is, I repeat, a simple fact that tlie whole framework of tliought by which the
search for improved forms is commonly directed, consists of ideas which, if the

doctrine of stream-lines is true, are absolutely delusive and misleading. And real

improvements are not seldom attributed to the guidance of those very ideas which

I am characterizing as delusive, while in reality they are the fruit of painstaking,

but incorrectly rationalized, experience.

  I am but insisting on views which the highest mathematicians of the day have
established irrefutably ; and my work has been to appreciate and adapt these views
when presented to me*.

  No one is more alive than myself to the plausibility of the unsound views against
which I am contending ; but it is for the very reason that they are so plausible that

it is necessary to protest against them so earnestly ; and I hope that in protesting

thus, I shall not be regarded as dogmatic.

In truth, it is a protest of  scepticism, not of dogmatism                                                                                                                                       for I do not profess  to
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

direct any one how to find his way straight to the form of least resistance. For

the present we can but feel our way cautiously towards it by careful trials, using

only the improved ideas which the stream-line theory supplies, as safeguards against

attributing tbis or that result to irrelevant or, rather, non-existing causes.

   * I cannot pretend to frame a list of the many eminent mathematicians who originated
or perfected the stream-hue theory ; but I must name, fi'cm amongst them, Professoi-

Rankine, Sir William Thomson, and Professor Stokes, in order to express my personal

indebtedness to them for information and explanations, to which chiefly (however imper-
fectly \it)lized) I owe such elementary knowledge of the subject as alone I possess.

                     APPENDIX.

                     Note A.

   Tlie proposition, that the flow of fluid through a tortuous pipe having its ends
in the same straight line does not tend to push the pipe endways, can be treated in

several ways, of which only one is given in the accompanying address; but it may

be interesting to some readers to trace some of the other ways of viewing the

question.

   First let us take the case of a right-angled bend in a pipe (that is to say, where
the direction of a pipe is altered through a right angle by a curve of greater or lesa

radius; a bend of this sort is shown in Plate XII. fig. 29), and assume that the

A Afluid in it at is flowing from towards 0. I propose at present to deal only

with those forces or tendencies which act more or less powerfully in the direction

of the original motion of the fluid, namely along the line AC.
  I must here remind you that I am dealing with this matter entirely indepen-

dently of hydrostatic pressure. Perhaps to some it will be difticult to disassociate

the idea of hydrostatic pressure from a fluid in a pipe. This difficulty might be

got over by assuming that the pipe is immersed in a fluid of the same density

and head as the fluid within it. There will thus be hydrostatic equilibrium

between the fluid within and withoiit the pipe, the only difterence being that

the fluid inside the pipe is assumed to be in rapid motion, and thus subjects the

pipe to any stresses properly incidental to that motion of the fluid within it.

The sole work that has to be done in the present case is that of deflecting the

ACcurrent of fluid to a course at right angles to its original course  ; and, regard-

ing the forces employed in this work as resolvable throughout into two sets of com-

fionents, the one at right angles to the line AC, the other parallel to it, it is of the

atter alone that account is to be taken. Manifestly the sum of these latter compo-

nents is measured by the circumstance that it is precisely sufticient to entirely de-

Astroy the forward momentum of the fluid that flows along the pipe at towards

the bend. This force is administered to the fluid by the curved portion of the

DEFpipe at the bend  ; and, as the pipe is assumed to be rigid, the work of

arresting the forward velocity of the fluid throws a forward stress on the pipe in the

line AC.
   Let us now assunre that to the right-angled bend, AB, we attach rigidly a second

right-angled bend, BG, as shown in fig. 30, in such a manner that the termina-

Gtion of this second bend at is parallel to the commencement of the first bend

at A. Here I will again, for the present, deal only with the forces in a direction

parallel to the line AC.

  BThe fluid at has no velocity in the direction of the line AC, and at Gr it has

n velocity in that direction equal to the velocity which it had at A. To give it

--this velocity in a forward direction (I mean forward in its original direction

of motion) to establish this forward momentum, requires the application of a

force in the direction HG; and this force is administered to the fluid by the

curved portion of the pipe at the bend I.JK ; and as the pipe is assumed to be

rigid, the duty of establishing the forward velocity of the fluid, throws a rear-

ward stress on the pipe in the direction .GH. ?fow as the forward momentum

given to the fluid between B and G, in the line GIT, is exactly the same as the

Amomentum destroyed between Band in the line AC, it follows that the rear-
UKward stress thrown on the pipe at the bend
                                              is exactly equal to the forward

stress thrown on the pipe at the bend DEF. Hence it will be seen that the

forces acting on the rigid pipe AG, treated as a whole, balance each other, so far as

relates to the forces in the line AC, the original line of motion of the fluid ; that is

DEFto say, the forward stress acting on the pipe at the bend    is balanced bj-^ the

equal rearward stress acting on the pipe at the bend UK. These two of the forces

acting on the pipe are shown by the arrows L and M, which, it must be remem-

bered, are the only forces which act in a line parallel to AC.

It will have been seen that the measure of these forces is the amount of forwnr(J
236 REPORT--1875,

momentum of the fluid -which is destroyed or created ; and from this it will be

inferred that the forces will be the same, no matter what is the radius of the curve

of the pipe, inasmuch as the curvature of the pipe does not affect the amount of

the forward momentum of the fluid that has to be destroyed or replaced.

Let lis next take the case of a bend in a pipe that is not a right angle, as shown

in Plate XII. lig. .31 ; and here, as before, I only propose to deal with the forces

A Nowthat come into play in the direction C of the original motion of the fluid.

in this case the forward motion of the fluid is not, as in the instance of the right-

A Bangled bend, entirely destroyed in its progress from to ; only a portion of the

motion is checked, and a portion of the momentum destroyed ; and the magnitude
of the force required to destroy the momentum is in proportion to the amount

Aby which the forward velocity of the fluid in the line C is destroyed. This

force is administered to the fluid by the curved portion of the pipe at the bend

DEF, and, as in the former case, exercises by reaction on the pipe a forward

stress, which will be in proportion to the extent by which the forward motion of

the fluid is checked by the divergence of the pipe from its original line.
BGSuppose to this bend we attach rigidly another bend
                                                               of the same angle,

Gas shown in fig. 32, so that the termination of this second bend at is parallel to

Bthe commencement of the first bend at A. Here, in the portion of the pipe G,

that part of the forward velocity which was taken away has to be again given to

the fluid; this requires force, which is administered to the fluid by the curved part

UK, of the pipe. There is thus thrown on the pipe a rearward stress represented

B Gby M. The force required in the bend between and to reinstate completely

the forward velocity, is evidently the same in amount as the force required in the

A Bbend between and to destroy in part the forward velocitJ^

   It follows, therefore, that the two stresses on the pipe, represented by the

arrows L and M, which indicate the forces acting on the pipe, are equal and

opposite to one another ; and these are the only forces acting on the rigid pip in

Athe line  of the original motion of the fluid at A. It follows, therefore, that in

the case of two right-angled bends rigidly attached, or in the case of two con-

nected equal-angled bends of any other angle, the stresses brought on the pipe by

the flow of the fluid will not tend to move the pipe bodily endwaj's.

It will be seen also by this reasoning that the forces we have referred to do not

depend on the cm-vature of the pipes, but are simply measured bj' the amount of

the forward momentum of the fluid and the extent to which that momentum is

modified in the total amount of deflection of the course of the fluid at the bend,

or, in other words, by the angle of the bend. And from this reasoning it becomes

apparent that by whatever bends or combinations of bends we divert tlie course of

a stream of fluid in the pipe, provided the combination be such as to restore the

stream to its original direction, the aggregate of the forces in one direction required

to destroy forward momentum are necessarily balanced by equal forces in the

opposite direction required to reinstate the former momentum.

It will be useful to consider more in detail the action of all the forces acting on a

fluid in a bend of the pipe ; and I will return to the case of a single right-angled

bend, as shown in fig. 29. I before spoke merely of the forces acting parallel to
the line AC, and said that the forward momentum of the fluid in that line had to be
destroyed in its passage round the bend DEF, and that this must be effected by a

force acting parallel to AC, which would by its reaction throw a forward stress on

the pipe, tending to force it in the dirgction AC. But similarly velocity has to be

NBgiven to the fluid iu the direction  ; and to do this a force must be administered

BNto the fluid which will cause a reaction on the pipe in the direction     ; and as the

momentum to be established in the direction NB, has to be equal to that in the di-

rection AC, which had to be destroj'ed, it follows that the forces of reaction upon the

pipe in the directions AC andBN are equal. These forces can be met in two waj's,

DEFeither by securing the bent part of the pipe  so that it will in each part resist the

stresses that come on it, or by letting the forces be resisted by the tensional strength

of the straight parts of the pipe Al) and BF, operating in the direction of their

ADlength ; and in this case we see that the tension on  must be equal to the force

acting along AC, and the tension on BF must be equal to the equal force acting

along BN, so that iu fact the forces brought into play by the right-angled bend

produce a longitudinal tension on the pipe at either end of the bend equal to the

foice required to destroy the forward moiuentuni of the fluid.

 --Proceeding to the case of the non-right-angled bend, as shown in fig. 31 in

this case, as we have seen, a portion only of the forward momentum of the fluid in

ACthe line  has to be destroyed, also a certain amount of sideways momentum has

QPto be created in a direction which we may consider parallel to the Hue  ; and

the composition of the remaining forward momentum in the line AC with the

created sideways momentum in the line QP, results in the progi-ess of the fluid along

the path FB ; this partial destruction of forward momentum and establishment of

some sideways momentum are essential to tlie onward progress of the fluid along FB.

DEFThe bend  will be subject to the reaction of the forces necessary to produce

these changes ; and either the bend may be locally secured, or the stress upon it

may be met, as in the case of the right-angled bend we have just been considering,

by a tensional drag on the pipe at either end of the bend. There is, however,

this difference between the cases, that the force required to establish sideways

QPmomentum parallel to  cannot be directly met by the reaction of tension along

BFthe line  of the second part of the pipe ; but this force may be met by the

BFobliquely acting tension of the pipe  combined with additional tension along

the pipe AD. It is well known that in the case of a given force, such as that we

are supposing parallel to PQ, resisted by two obliquely placed forces such as the
DAtension along the lines DxV and FB, the nearer the lines
                                                            and FB are to one

straight line, the greater must be the tension along those lines to balance a given

FBNowforce acting on the line PQ.          diverges from the line AC,
                        the less the line

QPthe less will be the sideways momentum parallel to  that has to be imparted

to the fluid ; but at the same time and to precisely the same extent will the pro-

DAportionate tension put upon the limbs  and FB of the pipe be aggravated by

the greater obliquity of their action. The sideways pull is greatest when the bend

is a right angle ; and then it amounts to a force that will take up or give out the

entire momentum of the fluid, and it is supplied directly by the tension of the

limb of the pipe at FB. If the bend is made less than a right angle, the less the

bend is made, the less is the sideways pull, but the greater by the same degree is
the disadvantage of the angle at which the tension on the pipe resists the pull

and it results from this that in the case of a bend other than a right angle, the ten-
Asion on the pipe is the same as in the case of a right-angled beud.
                                                                      geometrical

proof of this is given in fig. 33. It is evident that the radius of curvature of tha bend

does not enter into this consideration, and that the forces acting are not afiected by

the rate of curvature of the pipe, the simple measure of the forces being the increase

or decrease in the momentum of the fluid in each direction. It results from this that
if a fluid be flowing along a pipe with a bend in it, no matter what may be the angle of

the bend or the radius of its curvature, the reactions necessaiy to deflect the path of the

fluid will be met by a tensional resistance along the pipe ; and this tension is equal to
the force that would be required to entirely destroy the momentum of the fluid.

   If we now assume any number of bends, of any angle or curvature, to be con-

nected together (see Plate IX. fig. 3), the equilibrium of each bend is satisfied by a
longitudinal tension which is in every case the same ; and this tension is therefore

imiform throughout the pipe for the tension at any intermediate point in a bend is
                                                                                                                                                            ;

clearly the same as at the ends of the bend, as we may suppose the bend to be divided

at that point into two bends, and there joined together by an infinitely short piece

of straight pipe.

  A BIf then the tortuous pipe 1 have above refeiTed to has its ends at and parallel

to one another, as shown in fig. 4, it is clear that the tensional forces at its ends
balance one another, and the pipe, as a whole, does not tend to move endways.

                        Note B.

The law regulating these changes of pressure due to changes of velocity can be

best understood by considering the case of a stream of perfect fluid flowing from a gra-

dually tapeerd pipe or nozzle placed horizontally and connected with the bottom of

Ba cistern, as shown in Plate Xll. fig. 34. Let us suppose that at the points and

the sectional areas of the pipe are severally twice and foiu- times that at the point

of exit A.

--238 REPORT 1875.

AAt the point of exit the fluid is under no pressure whatever, since there

is no reacting force to maintain any pressure ; each particle of fluid in the issuing

jet is rushing on on its own account, neither giving nor receiving pressure from its

Weneighbours.  know, however, what force it has taken to give the velocity

which the fluid has at the point of issue A, and we measure this force by the

pressure, or head of fluid, lost. In the case we are considering, this head is

represented by the height of the fluid in the cistern, or by the height AD._

  A --Within the cistern, at the point E, on the same level as the point of issue at

Ethis point within the cistern, we have the pressure due to the head of fluid equal

to AD, but we have no velocity, at any rate the velocity is so small as to be in-

Aappreciable ; and at the point of issue we have no pressure at all, but we have

what is termed the "velocity due to the head."

   Let us suppose that at the points A, B, C, and E, gauge-glasses or stand-pipes

are attached so that the fluid in each may rise to a height corresponding with the

pressure within the pipe or nozzle at the point of attachment.

AThe gauge-glass attached at will show no pressure, thus indicating that the

ADentire head  has been expended in producing the velocitj^ at the point A.

   At the point B, as the sectional area is twice, the velocity is one half that at A;

Now the head required to produce velocity varies as the square of the velocity to

be produced ; in other words, to produce half the velocity requires one quarter of
ADthe head ; thus of the whole head
                                     available, one quarter only, or GD, has been

absorbed in developing the velocity at B, and the remainder of the pressure, which

will be represented by the head BG, will be sensible at the point B, and will be

exhibited in the gauge-glass attached at that point.

   Again, as the pipe at is four times the area that it is at A, it follows that, of the

whole head AD, one sixteenth part onlj', or HD, has been absorbed in developing

the velocity at C, and the remainder of the pressure, which will be represented

by the head CH, will be sensible at the pomt 0, and will be exhibited in the

gauge-glass attached at that point.

In the case I have chosen for illustration the small end. A, of the nozzle, is open

and discharging freely, and the pressure at that point is therefore nil. But the

absolute difierences of pressure at each point of the pipe or nozzle will be

precisely the same (as long as the same quantity of fluid is flowing through it

per second), however great be the absolute pressures throughout.

  AThus, suppose that from the end of the nozzle at a pipe of the same diameter^

and of uniform diameter throughout its length, is curved upwards so that the end

of it, I, is two feet higher than A, as shown in Plate XII. fig. -35, if the level of the

cistern is also raised two feet, namely to the level marked J, instead of D, we shall

have the same deliveiy of fluid as before ; and the differences between the pres-

sures at each point will be the'same as before.

If we add 50 feet instead of 2 feet to the head in the cistern ; and raise 1 to 60

feet, instead of 2 feet above the nozzle, the diflerences of head or pressure vsdll

A Bstill be the same, the head at being 50 feet, that at being EG-f 50 feet, that

Eat C, CII-l-50 feet, and that at (the cistern-level) ED-f 50 feet.

  ATo put the case into actual fig.m'es, suppose the sectional area at to be 1 square

inch ; that at B, 2 square inches ; and that at C, 4 square inches ; and suppose thatthe

fluid is passing through the nozzle at the rate of one ninth of a cubic foot per second
A --we shall have a velocity at
               of 16 feet per second to generate which would

E Arequire a difference of pressure between and equivalent to 4 feet of vertical
Bhead. The velocity at will be 8 feet per second, which would require a difference

Ebetween Band equivalent to 1 foot of head. That at C wiU be 4 feet per

second, and will require a difference of pressure equivalent to 3 inches of head. If

A Ethe pressure at be zero, the pressures at B, C, and will be 3 feet, 3 feet 9 inches,
Aand 4 feet respectively. If the pressure at be 1 foot, the pressures at B, 0, and
E Awill be 4 feet, 4 feet 9 inches, and 6 feet respectively ; and if the pressure at

Ebe 1000 feet,",the_pressures at B, C, and will be 1003 feet, 1003 feet 9 inches, and

1004 feet respectively, always supposing the quantity of fluid passing per second to

be the same. If the quantity be different, the absolute differences of pressure will be

different, but will be relatively the same. If, for instance, the quantity flowing

per second be doubled, the velocity at each point will be doubled, and the differences

   Here again the argument given in the text suggests certain other lines of argument

which some persons may feel interested in following out.

Suppose each and every one of the streams into which we have subdivided the

ocefin to be enclosed in an imaginary rigid pipe made exactly to fit it throughout,

the skin of each pipe having no thickness whatever. The innermost skin of the

innermost layer of pipes (I mean that layer which is in contact with the side of the

body), the innermost skin, I say, of this layer is practically neither more nor less
than the skin or surface of the body. The other parts of the skins of this layer,
and all the skins of all the other pipes, simply separate fluid from fluid, which fluid,
ex hypothesi, would be flowing exactly as it does flow if the skins of the pipes were

not there ; so that, in fact, if the skins were perforated, the fluid would nowhere tend

to flow through the holes. Under these circumstances there clearly cannot be any

force brought to bear in any direction by the flow of the fluid, on any of the skins

of any of the pipes except the innermost skin of the innermost layer. Now,
remembering that we are dealii:g vnih. a perfect fluid which causes no siu-face-
frictiou, we know that the fluid flowing through this system of pipes administers
no total endways force to it. But it produces, <as we have just seen, no force what-

ever upon any of the skins which separate  fluid from                                                            fluid                     consequently, if these
                                                                                                                                        ;

are removed altogether, the force administered to the remainder of the system,

--will be the same as is administered to the whole system namely, no total endwaj's

force whatever. But what is the remainder of the system ? Simply the sm-face

of the body, which is formed, as I have already said, by the innermost skins of the

innermost layer of pipes. Therefore no total endways force is administered to the

surface of the body by the flow of the fluid.

Lastly, let us recur for an instant to the case of fluid flowing through the single

flexible pipe. Here it was proved that the flow of the fluid through it, if it waa

anchored at the two ends, did not tend to displace any part of it, because the centri-

fugal forces, produced by the flow of the fluid, and which must act exactly at right

angles, or normallj^, as it is called, to the line of pipe at each point, are exactly counter-

balanced by a uniform tension throughout the length of the pipe. If the flexible pipe

has variations in its diameter, the differences of quasi-hydrostatic head appropriate to

those variations are also normal to the surfaces of the pipe, being simply bursting-pres-

sm-es. If, however, these normal forces were directly coimterbalanced by equal and

opposite and normal external forces or supports, it is obvious that this tension

would be entirely relieved. Now, if we suppose the system of pipes which we have

several times already imagined to surround the submerged body, to be flexible pipes,

(instead of rigid pipes, as we have before imagined them), the counterbalanciug,

or normal, external forces which exactly relieve the tension are supplied to each

pipe by its neighbour, except in the case of the innermost skin of the innermost

layer of pipes, since this innermost skin has no neighbour. In this instance the

counterbalancing, normal, external forces are supplied by the rigidity of the surface

of the body. Now we Iniow that, since the teusional forces produced bv the flow

of fluid through a flexible pipe, whether of uniform or varying sectional area, have

no sum total of endways force, the counterbalancing forces which exactly relieve

this tension must also have no total endways force ; and since the counterbalancing

forces acting throughout the whole system have thus no sum total of endways force,

it can be proved, as before in the case of the similar system of rigid pipes, that if we

remove the whole of the skins or sides of pipes, which separate fluid from iluid and

which are all therefore necessarily in perfect equilibrium, the forces acting on the

remainder, namely on those skins which are in contact with the surface of the body,

forces which therefore mav be considered as acting simply upon the body, must also

have no endways sum total.

On, th'i Drainarja of the GUy and Countu of Bristol. Bi/ Frederick Asiimeab,
          M.Inst. C'.E., Eiir/liie.'r and Sarveijor to the Saaitari/ Authority.

   The borougli of Bristol exteuds over au area of 4687 acres, or nearly 8 square
miles, containing- a population at the last Census in 1871 of 182,524, with an estimated
population of 196,186 in 1875, and about 120 miles of streets and roads. The
rateable value in 1875 was £739,045. Number of houses in 1871, 27,536.

   About the year 1803, the Bristol Doclc Company was formed for the purooso of
floating portions of the rivers Avon and Frome under the direction of Mr. William
Jessop^C.E., and on April 30, 1809, the works were set in operation. From that
date down to 1825 frequent complaints were made of the oflensive state of the
Frome part of the Harbom-, and the Doclc Company constructed the Culvert
known as Mylues Culvert in addition to the Bread-Street Culvert previously con-
 sti-ucted. By means of these culverts a large quantity of sewage was removed

 from the floating harbour, and discharged into the tidal river.

    These culverts, with the existing sewers in the old city and the new sewers
 constructed by the late Surveyor to the Commissioners, JNIr. John j\a-mstroug,
 Assoc.Inst.C.E., making a length of about 41 miles, completed the drainage
 of the old city at the time of the adoption of " The Public Health Act " in 1851,
 at which time the outlying districts of CUfton, Westbury, St. Philip and Jacob,

 the District Parishes, and Bedminster were placed under one government, viz. the
 Corporation of the City and County of Bristol, acting as the Local Board of Health,
 since which time the management and control of the sowers of the whole district
 has been entrusted to a Committee of the Coimcil elected annually.

     One of the first acts of this Committee was to ascertain the state of the drainage
 of the whole borough with a view of improving the same ; and it was decided to
 proceed Avitli the drainage gradually and in districts, as the best and cheapest

  manner, this course being almost a necessity in consequence of the peculiarly

 isolated position of parts of the borough, by reason of the rivers Avon and Frome

 --(floating harbour, locks, tidal basins, and other works) natm-ally dividing the whole

  borouo-h into districts the levels and dimensions of the sewers beino' so designed
  and arranged as to form one continuous scheme, to be eventually united so as to
  discharo'e the sewage of the whole borough at two points, one on each side of the
  river, for deodorization or for continuing the same to the mouth of the river Avoji
  to be hereafter determined; and for drainage purposes the borough has been
  divided into six districts, viz. 1st, Clifton Iliyh Level; 2nd, Bedminster; 3rd,

  Clifton Low Level; 4th, Saint rhilijj's; 5th, Tlte Frome Intercepting; 6th, T]ie

 --Avon Intcrcejitini/.
      Ist. Clifton Iligh-Level District. Clifton has been divided into two districts,
  viz. the High- and the Low-Level districts ; and the first undertaken was the High-
  Level disti'ict. It includes the whole of tlie higher parts of Cliftyn, and parts of
  Westbury and Cotliam, and is drained by means of a main sewer commencing in
  Hampton Road, passing under White Ladies Road, along Alma Road under the

  College grounds, and the Clifton Down Road, passing down the new zigzag to tlie

  river Avon. Main branch servers are also constructed along the several main roads

 --of the district.
      2nd. Bedminster District. The next district vmdertalcen was part of the parish
   of Bedminster, and situate on the south side of the river Avon, which is drained
   by the main sewer commencing in East Street, passing into and along Dean
   Lane, under Nelson Terrace and Coronation Road to the tidal river, main branch

   sewers being constructed along the several principal streets of the district; also
   a separate sewer, called Parsons-Sti-eet sewer, was constructed for a portion of

   this district, passing along Parsons Street under the main road to Bedminster

 --Down, along Duckmoor to the tidal river.
      3rd. Clifton Low-Level District. The main sewer of this district may be called

    an intercepting sewer, as it passes in nearly a parallel line with the floating

   harbour and the river Avon ; it is also constructed sufficiently large to receive the
   drainage from a portion of the Frome district to be hereafter described.

       It commences in Hotwell Road, near the bottom of Jacobs Wells Road, and
   continues along Hotwell Road in front of Dowry Parade, St. Vincent's Parade,

                                                                    J

    4th. Saint riiihys Bistrid. This district is situate en the east side of the
boroupli, and is Ixumded on the north bv the river Frome, on the west and south
by the lloatingr harbour, and on the east by the boundary of the borough. This
district was partially drained by the Eread-Street culvert already described ;_ but a

new sewer has been constructed, commencing' at Baptist Mills, and continuing

along the south side of the river Frome, so as to intercept all drains discharging

into the said river as far as Haberfield Street, up which it passes and continues
along Captain Carey's Lane, and underneath Old Market Street, John Street,
St. Philip's Plain, Bread Street, into and along Cheese Lane and Avon Street
to the Feeder, under which it passes and continues along the Feeder Eoad to the

--tidal river.
   5th. Frome Intciccptinf/ Sneer District. This district lies on the north side of

the river Frome, which river formerly received the drainage of the district.

This district has been divided into separate areas, and is now drained by means

of two main sewers, one for the higher ground, and the other for the lower level.

The first named commences at the boundary of the borough in Stokes Croft Eoad,

at which  point  it receives  the drainage of  Horfield  Parish                             passing down  Stokes
                                                                                         ;

Croft Eoad it continues along Jamaica Street, in front of the Infirmary, along

Upper Maudlin Street into Trenchard Street, passing the bottom of Lodge Street,

into Frogmore Street to the bottom of Park Street, continuing along College
Street, passing the back of the gas-works at Canons Marsh, and discharges into
the Low-Level district of Clifton, before described, and the tidal river.

   The Low-Level main sewer of this district commences at Baptist Mills on the
north side of the river Frome, and passes under Ashley Eoad and under the new-
road leading into Newlfoundland Lane, continuing along Newfoundland Lane, Milk
Sti-eet, Clarke Street, and Eosemary Street into Broadmead, passing under the river
Frome into Nelson Street, and formerly discharged into Mylne's culvert and the
tidal river, but now discharges into the Prince-Street sewer hereafter described.

   These sewers with main branch sewers up Ashley Hill complete the drainage of

this district.

  --Gth. The Avon IntercqHiiig Seiver District. This is the last remaining district,

and is bounded on the north side by the floating harbour, and on the east by the St.
Philip's district. It comprises nearly the whole of the old city, which, as before
stated, was fairly drained by the late Commissioners ; and the existing sewers
have been made available by constructing new sewers on either side of the river
Avon, so as to connect the whole and discharge the sewage at present at three
points in the river ; and eventually the sewage of this district on the north side of
the river will be connected with the Main-Outlet sewer on the south side of the
river, hereinafter described, by means of iron siphons passing under the river from
the north to the south side, and discharged at one point near Clift House.

   In considering the drainage for this district, it was also necessary to determine

the levels for the Main-Outlet sewer, with a view, if necessary, of continuing the

same to the mouth of the river, a distance of about 7 miles ; and the portion now

constructed is laid at .such level as to allow of its being so continued at the same

gradient, and to discharge at a level of 3 feet above low-water mark, which will
allow of free access to the valves &c. at the mouth for about three or four hours

each tide.

   The principal sewers in this district are the main sewer on the south side of the
river Avon, and the Prince-Street sewer. This latter commences at the stone
bridge, at which point it now. receives the sewage of the Low-Level sewer of the
Frome district ; it then continues underneath the Tontine warehouses and Clare
Street, along Marsh Street and Prince Street, vmderneath the floating harbour to a
point in front of the Gaol, and discharges into the tidal river. This sewer, with
the main branch sewers constructed on the north side of the river, and the old
sewers constructed by the late Commissioners, completes the drainage of the
portion of the district north of the river Avon.

   The main .sewcr on the south side of the river Avon commences at a point
opposite Tottcrdown Lock, above which is situate the outlet for St. Philip's
--S34 REPORT 1875.

district, and .also the outlet for the St. George's district, lying outside the Borough
of Bristol, hut which hy arrangement has heeu allowed to pass through the

borough to this point ; and the new sewer has been constructed of sufficient size
and at such levels as to receive the sewage from these two districts by means of

iron siphons, to be laid under the river ; the sewer then continues along the side
of the river until arriving opposite to Myhie's culvert and Prince-Street sewer ; it
then continues along Coronation Road, passing the outlet for the Bedminster
district and Mr. Drake's tan-yard, continuing underneath the fields at the back of
 Clift II(?use, and discharges into the tidal river for the present through the outlet
 described as Parsons-Street sewer, thus intercepting the whole of the sewage on
 the south side of the river Avon, and providing for the conveyance of all the

sewage now discharging into the river above Cumberland Basin.
    From the foregoing it will be seen that these drainage works have been designed

 and constructed for the delivery of the whole of the sewnge now discharging into

 the river above Cumberland Basin, at one point near Clift House, by means of three
 iron siphons, to be laid under the bed of the river from the outlets of the following
 districts, viz. 1st, St. Philip's and St. George's districts ; 2nd, Redcliif Hill; and 3rd,
 Mylnes or Prince-Street district ; the only points of discharge will then be the
 Clifton outlet on the north side, and the outlet near Clift House on the south side

 of the river.

    Plaving brought the sewage of the borough to these two outlets, the question to
 bo determined is, In what manner shall the same be dealt with ? and until this
 point is settled the writer has recommended that all the present five outlets be
 retained, viz. four on the north side, and one on the south side of the river.

    The sizes of the several sewers in each district are calculated to can-y 5 cubic
 feet or 31f gallons per head per diem, for a variable population of from 30,000 to
 60,000 per square mile, according to the district, and ^ inch of rainfall in twenty-
 fovu' hours, storm overflows being formed in all cases where possible to provide for
 any greater rainfall.

    The question of ventilation, after many years' consideration and discussion, and
 after the experience of other localities, has been left in the same position as found
 by the writer, viz. the sewers are without any external openings or means of

 ventilation, the whole of the street gullies are trapped, and the manholes are all
  closed doAvn, in which particulars the sewers of Bristol differ from those of nearly
 all other towns, all external air being excluded. The several districts have for the
  most part separate outlets into the tidal river, as before described, in all of which
  districts, with one exception (that of the High Level of Clifton), j^'ovision has been
 made for flushing from the floating harbour or watercourses discharging into the
  harbour ; but in no case has it been found necessary to have recourse to artificial

  flushing, there being no deposit in any of the new sewers ; nor has it been found
  necessary to provide other means of ventilation. But in the High-Level district
  of Clifton, it was found that during low water, when the outlet was exposed, the
  draught in these sewers was sufficient to drive the sewer-air into some of the
  houses, and an air-valve was placed at the top of the incline to the outlet, which
  has prevented such draught. · The whole of the other sewers, being low-level

   sewers, have double tidal valves fixed at their outlets. These valves are self-acting,
   of cast iron, and oval in form ; they are hung with chains and bedded on india-

   rubber.

       In February 1871 tlie wiiter reported on a proposal for dealing with the sewage
   of the borough by discharging it only on the ebb of the tide.

      The outlets of the present sewers being provided with self-acting valves, which
   open with the receding tide and close with the rising tide, it was proposed to
   provide means for preventing the discharge of the sewage during the up-flow of
   the tide, previous to the closing of the valves, by means of penstocks and storage

    tanks.

      From a series of float experiments it was found that during spring-tides the
   sewage would be carried down the Bi'istol Channel nearly as far as Portishead,
   and would return in such a diluted form as not to be in any way offensive, but that

    duriug neap-tides and all tides below 22 feet in height, no portion of the sewage
    would pass out of the river, but would flow backwards and forwards with each tide,
                                                                                                          --

until the return of the spring-tides, when it would bo carried out into the Bristol

Channel as before stated ; and on referring to the Tide Tables it will be found that

about 220 of these low tides occur each year.

Under these circumstances it has been determined not to incur any further cost

in the matter imtil such time as the Report of the Rivers Pollution Commission is

published, or some Act of Parliament is passed requiring Local Boards and sanitary

authorities to deal with all sewage discharged into the tidal river.

In November 1873 the writer reported as to the practicability of uniting the

two outlets by bringing the sewage of the north side to the site near Clift House,

this site having been approved of by Mr. Robert Rawlinson, C.B., as in all respects

siutable for dealing with the sewage in any manner that may be determined on
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

and it was proposed to accomplish this in one of two ways, viz. :

First, by carrying the sewage across the river by means of iron siphons at or

near its present outlet, and then by sewers to be constructed along the south side

of the river to Clift House.

Second, by means of iron siphons carried under the river at or near the new

entrance-lock gates at Cumberland Basin, at which point the sewage of the Clifton
Low-Level district, and the portion of the Frome district, could be intercepted and

conveyed to the south side, leaving only the Clifton High-Level sewage to be dealt

with ; and as the level of this district is so much above that of the Low-Level
district, advantage could be taken of the length of sewer now conveying the Low-

Level sewage to the High-Level outlet, by using this length of sewer as a siphon,

and forcing the sewage from the High-Level district against the gradient of the

sewer to the same point near the new lock-gates to Cumberland Basin, now

proposed for the conveyance of the sewage of the Low-Level district, by means of

iron siphons across the river to the south side, to be continued thence by double or

single culvert, as may be hereafter determined, to the proposed outlet near Clift

House ; and the only objection to the same is the use of the present sewer with the

gradient  the  reverse  way  to  the  flow of  the  sewage                                     but  this  objection  coidd  be  met
                                                                                            ;

by providing means for periodically flushing this length of sewer ; at the same time

it vnll be a question, to be hereafter determined, if it will not be better to adopt

the first-named plan ; the whole sewage of the borough would then be brought to

the one site near Clift House, and could be dealt with in any manner that may be

hereafter decided upon.

In conclusion, it will be seen that at present no determination has been arrived

at with regard to the ultimate disposal of the sewage of the borough, which is still
discharged into the tidal river at the five separate outlets. The total cost of the
drainage works to the present time, less £6161 paid by the St. George's district,

has been £154,743, which, taking the estimated population of the borough at
193,183, will give as the cost per head los. 9|fZ. This amount has been raised by

rates in each separate district, varying from Is. 6d. to 2d. in the pound. The

whole cost in the two first-named districts having been repaid, the special rates
have ceased ; in the next two districts it will expire in 1878, in the fifth district in
1880, and in the last district, the amount borrowed having been spread over thirty

years instead of twenty years as in the other districts, the repayment will extend

to the year 1901.

   The average death-rate before the construction of the foregoing works was 28-0
per 1000, and for the year ending January 1875 it was 22-7.

          On the Prevention of Sand Bars at tJie Mouth of Harbours.

   The apparatus consists of a small standard mounted sideways on the roof of the
carriage and carrying a short inclined tube, open at the upper end. From the lip
of this tube or holder light cords are conducted into each compartment of the
--244 KEPORT 1875.

carriage ; and on pulling any one of these cords the lip is drawn down and the tube
Areversed.
                 small counterweight, in the form of a flag, attached to the tube bv an

arm, prevents its returning to its former position, and at the same time shows at a
distance which liolder has been reversed.

   The communicating cable is in the first instance coiled round a light drum or
reel ; it consists of two copper wires perfectly insulated, and further protected by a
stout waterproof sheath. At intervals corresponding to the length of a carriage

short branches are led from each of these wires and taken through the sealed top of
a small wooden tube about 4 inches long (denominated a " tipper "), whence they
terminate in twy adjacent platinum points. The tipper, which is solid at the other

end, also contains a small quantity of pure mercury.

   The two batteries and bells, one for the locomotive the other for the guard's van,
may either be fixed in their respective places, or mounted inside a reel provided
with the wire and tippers, in which latter case there are absolutely no electric con-

nexions whatever to make, the cable being paid out either way from the centre of

the train, the wire of the two reels being continuous. In the former case the cable
is connected to the locomotive battery, then paid out along the train, the surplus
wu-e on its reel being placed in the guard's van alongside the second battery.

   The tippers are normally in a more or less upright position, and the mercury in
each remains at the bottom away from the wires. On reversing the tipper the
mercury flows downwards upon the wii-es, and thus causes both bells to ring.

  _ After a passenger has once pulled over a tipper lie cannot replace it, and the red
disk or flag makes detection easy.

   If desired the cable forms a ready means of intercommunication between guard
and driver at all times.

   Should a train part from a broken coupling, the cable will necessarily break ; but
before doing so the two tippers adjacent to the break will have been reversed, thas

calling attention of both driver and guard.

          On the Bristol Port and Channel Dock at Avonmouth, near Bristol.
                                  By James Bktinlees, C.E.

   The site of the dock is so chosen that the centre line of the lock passes through the
centre of the mouth of the Avon, or what is known as the Swashway entrance from
Kingroad. Between the Swashwav and the lock there will be a deep channel, or

approach, 450 yards long by 100 yards wide. The part immediately in front of the
dock has a bell-mouthed shape, the side diverging fi-om the centre line of the lock at
an angle, and forming a tidal basin of about two acres in area. The lock is 600 ft.

in length, 70 feet wide from cope to cope, and has a depth of water on the lower

sills of 41 ft. 6 in. at high water equinoctial spring-tides. The dock itself is 1400

ft. ^ong by 500 ft. wide, and has an area of 16 acres. It will have a depth of water

of 35 ft. at high water equinoctial sjjrings, 31 ft. 3 in. at ordinary springs, and 22 ft.
3 m. at ordinary high-water neaps. By locking vessels in and out at high water

of neap-tides 28 ft. of water can always be maintained in the dock.

The formation of a dam in front of the works proved of considerable difl[iculty,

biit  it  was successfidly constructed                                                                                                        and although the tide  has  reached to within  2  ft.
                                                                                                                                           ;

6 in. of its top, it has never shown any symptom of weakness. About 1,320,000

c ubic yards of earth have been excavated fi-om the dock-basin and entrance-lock.

The_ excavations for the foundations were made with the help of portable engines for

Apulling up the earth at the rate of 100 cubic yards per day.                                                                                                             steam-lift piunp,

throwing up 20,000 gallons an hour, was emploved to keep the foundation trenches

clear of water.

   The construction of the lock is the most important and costly part of the works.
Ihe foundations are laid about 6 ft. under low water equinoctial springs, the level
of the sand varying only about 12 in. throughout the whole 600 of its length.
Above the sand a bed of rubble masonry 6 ft. thick and fi-om 100 ft. to 120 ft. wide
is laid, and on this foundation the inverts and walls are built. The lentjth between
the inner and outer cells is 454 ft. This length is divided by a pair of gates into

cock-chambers, the outer 204 ft., and the inner 250 ft. in length. The sliuce-wavs

tor falling and emptying the locks are formed in the interior of the side walls. They
--

are 7 ft. by 4 ft. 6 in. culverts, havings brick arches and inverts and aslibir sides.
About 60,000 cubic yards of masonry lia^e been put into the lock, a quantity that
represents about 100,000 tons of stone. The stone used in the works is of various
kinds, according to the situations and uses in and for which it is applied. The dock

walls are 20 ft. thick at the bottom, and gradually reduced to 7 ft. thick at the top.
They have a curved batter on the inner face on a radius of 157 ft. The lower
foundation is of blue lias concrete, and over it Portland concrete to 2 feet below
the iloor of the dock, where the masonry commences. The dock-gates, originally
intended to be of iron, consist of oak keel and mitre-posts and cross pieces of pitch

pine. The lower gates are designed to retain a 41i-ft. head of water. On the rib

next the sill the pressure of the water is about I5 ton per square foot, and tlie total
stress resulting on the sectional area of the rib is 77'3 tons. The leaf is 3 ft. thick
at the centre, and 2 ft. 8 in. at keel and mitre-posts, so that the effective sectional
area of the rib is 384 square inches, and the stress on the square inch about one
fifth of a ton. The total weight of one leaf of the lower gate is eighty nine tons.
There has been a double line of railway constructed, at the joint expense of tho
(Jreat Western and Midland Railway Companies, to connect the dock with the

respective .systems of those Companies, and that will bring the dock into commu-

nication with all parts of England.

On a Si/stem of Audible Signals for Bailivays. By Messrs. Ceicdton & Ceaig.

   The object of this invention is to prevent a class of accidents of very frequent
occurrence, viz. those that arise from non-observance of signals. The desired end is
attained by self-acting apparatus, causing the engine whistle to soimd when a driver

inadvertently passes a danger-signal.

   The inventors have foimd that the following qualities are essential to apparatus
for this purpose, and they trust it may be found that they have been successful in
embodying the same in the system described :

   1. The impact of apparatus fixed on the line against that upon the engine must

not cause injm-y to either.

   2. Special provision must be made to counteract the tendency to carelessness that
usually results from the employment of automatic machinery-

   3. The apparatus should be constructed so that it cannot be kept out of action
either through negligence or improper motive.

   4. It should be solely auxiliary, and in no way a substitute for the appliances at

present used in securing safety.
    5. It should be capable of being adapted to the vai'ious types of engine.

   6. The apparatus on the line should be easily actuated and not liable to derange-

ment from contingencies of weather.

  --7. The whole should be of simple construction and thoroughly reliable in action.

   Description. At each distant signal a simple piece of mechanism is placed beside
the line of rails. It may be described as a bell-crank connected by a wire to said
signal, so that both work in unison, i. e. an arm of the bell-crank moves towards the
rails at the same time that the semaphore arm rises to danger, and recedes when
the semaphore arm falls.

   The engine carries a vertical rod, which is free to slide in a protecting tube attached
to the side of the " cab." This rod is connected at its tipper end to a lever, which
acts upon an arrangement for sounding the whistle, precisely the same as that now
extensively used for the passenger's communication. (The same mechanism may
--246 REPORT 1875.

serve both purposes.) The loiver end of the rod is formed hoUo-w, .and receives one

end of a staff or baton of wood which rests on a bracket. The baton when put into

this socket cannot afterwards be withdrawn without being broken, as it is lield by

--means of a spring catch, which is inaccessible so long as the baton remains whole.
    The action of the apparatus is asfolloius : So long as the driver does not require to

pass within a danger-signal for protection the apparatus requires no attention.

When he finds this necessarj^, it is his duty to raise the vertical rod carrying the

baton, which is thereby removed from a position where it would be broken by

coming in contact with an arm of the "bell-crank" on the line. This action is

accompanied by a sounding of the whistle, which prevents the driver from keeping

the baton out of the normal position after passing the signal. It also gives the

necessary warning to signalmen and others that a train is approaching. Should a

driver inachertenihj pass a danger-signal, the baton, not having been moved into the

position of safety, must of necessity be broken at a point made specially weak.

The vertical rod being thus deprived of support falls, and by means of its con-

nexions causes the whistle to sound, at once giving warning of danger and recording

the driver's negligence. When a baton has been broken, the lower part of the ver-

tical rod protrudes from the tube in which it slides and allows the spring-catch to

become accessible, so that the part of the baton remaining in the socket can be

withdrawn and a new one substituted. The batons aa-e to be supplied to engine-

drivers at such a price as may be considered suiRcieut to secure the necessary vigi-
Alance in preserving them.
                              simple and efficient way of preventing counterfeit

would be to place a seal on the weakened part.

As usually constructed automatic signals act on ever}' occasion that a danger-

signal is passed. The effect of this is necessarily to induce reliance on the apparatus.

By the system which has been described, the driver has a certain duty to perform at

every danger-signal the neglect of which will subject him to pecuniary loss, and

also, if of frequent occiu-rence, to dismissal. There is therefore every reason to expect

that the vigilance of the driver would be fully maintained.

   The " block system " has now been ver}' extensively adopted, and the apparatus

used in connexion with it is being improved in order to eliminate the element of

human fallibility in so far as the operators are concerned. But if it is important to

get signals duly exhibited, it is equally important that they be attended to when
exhibited. It is therefore evident that the " block system " cannot work satis-

factorily so long as its efficiency depends exclusively upon the semaphore-signal,

which appeals to the sense of sight alone, and, especially when there is fog, is often

passed imnoticed by drivers.

                            On tlie Trials of Screw Steani-Ships.

            By William Denny, Leven SJiip-yard, Dumbarton.

  The object of this paper was to further the adoption of the progressive method
of trying steam-ships on the measured mile.

   The present method is, as a rule, confined to maximum power speeds, or to
speeds which are the maximum effects of half-boiler power. Such trials afford

only meagre and isolated results, giving little if any basis for the comparison of
different steamers, and they cannot, as they ought to, show the varying relations
of power and speed throughout the range of any steamer's possible speeds.

   The ratios of these relations are veiy unlike in different steamers, and a know-
ledge of them must be the basis of any true method of comparison. Mr. Froude's
resistance-curves, formed from model experiments, are a very good illustration of the
objects to be attained by progi-essive trials, which, when set off' on suitable scales,
should show at once the relation existing between any speed and power within

the limits of the experiments.
   For example, a vessel capable of such a series of speeds might be tried at or

about 13, 11, 9, 8, and .5 knots, the resulting mean speeds and developments of
power being set off and formed into a curve ; and it is very evident such a curve
would show more easily than any number of single trials the progressive difficulty

of driving the ship.

   It must be clear to any unbiassed mind that a method which is of absolute im-

portance in the trials of models, can be of no less need in the concrete trials of

ships' engines and propellers made on the mile. Of course, curves of revolutions

per minute, ship percentages and constants, according to any formula, can also be

set off wth the simple speed and power curve.

   Such curves were shown in the diagrams illustrating this paper, and included,

besides specimens of trials conducted by the author's firm, others conducted by

Messrs. A. and I. Inglis and the Admiralty.

   The constant cm-ve shown in each case was set off" to tlie numbers of the Ad-

miralty midship-section formula, but represented equally well, with suitable scales,

the Admiralty displacement and Prof. Rankine's augmented surface constants.

Had the theory been true that the power reqmred for propulsion varied as the

cube of the speed, these constants would not have been curves but straight lines

parallel to the base of the diagram. As they were very marked curves, and, indeed,

liir removed from any approach to horizontal straiglit lines, .they indicated an

equally great fault in all the three formula). An examination of the cm-ves showed

this fault to be the acceptance of the fallacious theory that the power varied as

 the cube of the speed.

    In none of the diagrams and in no progressive series of trials submitted to the

author had this fallacy even the shadow of a sound support ; and had Professor
 Rankine known the extent and worthlessness of it, he would never have been
 tempted to prove his theory underlying the augmented surface formula from the
 ' Warrior's ' highest speed trial, as two other trials exist, taken at the same draughts

 and within a few days of each other, which contradict it. In one of the speed-
 curves shown to the Association, the horse-power varied from ratios in the square

 to ratios nearly in the fifth power of the speed.

    Had Professor Rankiue possessed such sets of trials as the practical world
 should have supplied him with, his great skill would have doubtless drawn from

 them some very valuable teachings, instead of the formula of the auo-mented
 surface, which for every purpose (seeing a comparison of steamers is rendered im-
 possible by our ignorance of their progressive speeds and powers) is of no more
 value than the Admiralty formulae it was intended to supersede. Beyond this
 these curves go to prove that in the expenditure of power in relation to speed,
 within the limit of the liighest ocean speeds now in use, marked speeds pecidiar
 to the vessel are seldom likely to be apparent, excepting tliey be foimd by some
 such empirical formula} as those referred to. These formulte show apparent speeds

 of maximum efficiency ; but they are only apparent, and depend upon the theoretical

  power of the speed in which the horse-power is supposed to vaiy. Different speeds

 of apparent maximum efficiency will appear as the square, the cube, and the fourth

  and fifth powers of the speed are selected.

    Indeed if we are ever to get a tolerably good formula, for finding speeds and

  power, which is doubtful, it will not be found without progressive trials combined

 with and checked by such experiments as Mr. Fronde is now making on models.

      Regarding the conduct of progressive trials, it is of primary importance that
  their accuracy in all parts should not fall below the Admiralty standard, and that
  a calm day shoidd be chosen for their performance. The wind has a most disturb-
  ing influence on the slow speeds. In the engine-room, the head of it must not
  only control his obser^dng staff, but must carefully regulate the development of

  power on each pair of runs. Any great inequality will vitiate the results of the

 Atrials. In fact progi-essive trials without honesty and accuracy will be failures.
           small copy of the speed-power, revolution, Admiralty midship and section
  constants, and ship percentage curves of the screw steam-ship ' Taupo,' built and
  tried by the author's firm, is appended (see fig. 5, Plate XIII.). After the remarks

  already made, this diagram will be clear. Small circles mark the points of mean

   speeds observed on trial.

     On Improvements in the ClochvorJc of Revolving Lighthouses.
                            By J. HopKiKSON, D.Sc.

Until recently tlie macliineiy driving tlie apparatus of revolving liglits lias

alwaj's been controlled by revohing fans, wliich slightly mask the variations of

friction in the machine and rollers which carry the light by adding a considerable
Aresistance of the air, which increases slowly with the velocity.
                                                                                                                light thus

governed goes, at the best, if carefully regulated by the lightkeeper, too slow at

starting, whilst the lantern is cool and the lubricating oil thick, and too fast when

the apparatus has run some time. The lightkeepers endeavour to correct this ac-

celeration by taking off driving-weight. It is perhaps true that a careful man,

with the fan arrangement, or indeed' without any governor at all, by adjusting the

driving-weight, may keep his apparatus so near to time that there would be little

danger of niistake. " But it is undesirable that the want of such care should cause

such serious risks, if it can by any means be avoided. As a matter of discipline,

too, it is advantageous that a*n absolute rule maybe laid down that?;o sensible vari-

ation of velocity is permissible; and if it occurs, it should be only attributable to

interference with the machine, insufficient driving-weight, or neglect of winding

up, for either of which the lightkeeper is responsible. With fans it was necessary

that a certain error  should be  tolerated                                     it  is  better  that  cmy error  should  con-
                                                                            ;

demn the lightkeeper.

   In the apparatus made at the works of Messrs. Chance during the last year, I
have replaced the fans by a centrifugal governor, in principle the same as those of

Sir "William Thomson and Mr. Grubb. It consists of a weight in the form of a

disk, sliding on a vertical revolving shaft, guided by feather keys. Two governor

balls, carried by arms which malce an angle of about 45° with the shaft, are con-

nected with the disk by links, so that in expanding they lift the disk from the collar

on which it rests when below speed. Two adjustable screws, tipped with leather,

are fixed to the frame of the clock above the outer rim of the disk. As soon as the

disk is lifted from the collar it comes in contact with these brake-screws. Since

the disk has a diameter of 12 to IG inches, and makes over a hundred revolutions

per minute, the friction has sufficient moment to control the rotation of the appa-

ratus. Indeed the clock goes at sensibly the same speed whether the apparatus,
Aweighing about a couple of tons, is in ge'ar or at rest.
                                                                                               little thumbscrew pressed

at pleasure against the edge of the disk serves to instantly stop the clock. With

the exception of Sir AVilliam Thomson's clock at the Holywood Bank, and those

arranged by Mr. Douglas for light-vessels, the clocks made by Messrs. Chance during

the last year are the only ones iii use for revolving lights capable of going_ any
thing like uniformly. This governor almost places it beyond the power of the light-

keeper to make his apparatus go wrong. Deficient weight he will be compelled

to correct; for the friction of the apparatus being constant, and the governor

not acting when below speed, the machine will slowly stop.
   In most lighthouse clocks, whilst the driving-weight is wound up, the motion of

the apparatus is either allowed to take care of itself, or is maintained by a weighted
lever acting on a ratchet-wheel, and spasmodically lifted by the act of winding.

With the fan-governor this must interfere with the rcgidarity of the motion, and

in any case it jerks the machine. The author finds it best to return to the oldest
maintaining arrangement, that of Huyghens, in which an endless chain or rope

passes over separate winding and driving pulleys, and hangs in two loops, of which
one passes under a snatch-block to which the weight is hung. The chain passes

continuously over the driving-pulley as it revolves. The author cannot understand

why this old and simple plan is not used for turret-clocks. With suitable pulleys,

and a chain of moderately accurate pitch, the clock works perfectly smoothly, and

is absolutely unaffected by the operation of winding.

A ScJieme of Water-supply for the Villages and Country ParisJtes of the

   Central and Eastern Counties of Enrjland. By Professor Hull, F.R.S.,

Director of the Geologiml Survey of Ireland.

After referring to the prevalence of zymotic diseases in villages, hamlets, and

country parishes, admittedly due to "dirt" (which, as Lord Palmerston defined

it, is " matter in the wrong place ") and bad water, the author proposed to_ deal

with the latter evil by a scheme applicable to the central and eastern comities of

England. This scheme was oulv intended to apply to those districts which come

under the division of " Rural Sanitary Districts " of the Public Health Act of 1872,

the " Urban Sanitary Districts " being provided for by local resources and en-

gineering skill ; but the author maintained that in a large number of instances the

villages and hamlets required the introduction of some system of water-supply

quite as much as tlie larger towns and cities.

The author's proposal involved a double system of supply applicable in two dif-

ferent sets of cases, (1) either by means of wells, or (2) when wells were inadmis-

Hesible, by surface streaius.  proposed, as a preliminary step, that, by the aid of

the llural Sanitary Officers appointed under the Act of 1872, returns should be ob-
tained regarding the water-supply at present in existence in the villages and ham-

lets throughout the central and eastern counties. These returns were to be trans-

mitted to the Central Board of Health in London, and from them it could be deter-

mined what were the cases requiring the application of a scheme of supply.

   The author then proceeded to point out how favoumbly circumstanced were

those districts of England to which his observations applied for a system of supply

by means of wells of greater or less depth. These districts were formed geologi-

cally of the ISIesozoic or Secondary strata, included between the Lower Tertiaiy

strata above and the Permian beds below. And it would be found that they were

capable of being grouped into an alternating series of permeable (or water-bearing)

strata on the one hand, and impermeable (or dry) strata on the other.

   The permeable strata were grouped as follows :--1. Chalk and Upper Green-

sand. 2. Lower Greensand. 3. Purbeck and Portland Beds. 4. Coralline Oolite

and grit. 5. Great and Inferior Oolites and sands. G. Middle Lias, or Marlstone.

7. New Red Sandstone. Attaining a combined thickness of 1,275 to 5,600 feet.

 --The impermeable strata were also gTouped as follows: 1. Gault Clay. 2.

Kimmeridge Clay. 3. Oxford Clay. 4. Upper Lias Clay. 5. Lower Lias Clay

and Keuper Marls. Attaining a combined tliickness of 2,100 to 5,000 feet.

   It was shown, by reference to the Geological Map of England, that these gi-oups

of strata, alternating i;\-ith each other, were spread out over considerable areas, and

dip one underneath the other at very moderate inclinations, owing to which the

waters collected from the rainfall over the permeable strata percolate downwards

till stopped by the underlying impermeable strata, forming underground reservoirs

which might be reached by wells or bore-holes.
   It was also shown that these underground waters pass for long distances under

the overlying impermeable formations in the direction of the dip, and could be

reached and rendered available by wells or borings on the Artesian principle.
   As an illustration of this, the author referred to the deep boring recently made

nt Scarle, near Lincoln, where, after the impermeable Lias and Keuper Marls had

been passed through, the water-bearing beds of the New Red Sandstone were en-

tered, and a fine fountain of water rose through the bore-hole above the surface of
the gTound. In this instance the water had travelled 12 to 16 miles imderground,
from the outcrop of the water-bearhig sandstones near Mansfield. The author
then described the qualities of the waters yielded by the different formations as

shown by numerous examples submitted to chemical analyses.
   From the knowledge now possessed on such subjects, it was certain that, by

means of wells or borings, supplies of water could be obtained, not only in localities
situated on water-bearing strata, but on those situated on the overlying impermeable
strata, according to depth. At the same time there would necessarily be a large
number of villages aiul hamlets where the depth to the water-bearing bed.> and the
cost of reaching" them would be too great for the resources of the inhabitants.
These would have to be dealt with by other means of supply.

    In order to carry out a geueral scheme applicable to all villages found, from the
--250

returns of the Medical Officers of Health, to be insufficiently or improperly supplied,

the author proposed to utilize the maps of the Government Geological Survey,
now nearly complete, for the districts referred to, and on which the areas of the
water-bearing and impermeable formations respectively are accurately laid down.
With the aid of these maps (which were easily obtainable) it could be determined
by the Local Sanitary Authority whether any special village or hamlet was so situ-
ated as to be capable of receiving a supply by a well of reasonable depth. In case
of necessity, however, professional advice might be called in ; but the author con-
sidered that, owing to the special nature of such cases, it would be necessary to
have a geologist of experience attached to the Central Board of Health, whose duty
it would be to advise with each Local Sanitary Board as occasion might arise.

This officer should also assist in the selection of a proper site for a well, and aft'ord
data for determining the depth and cost of sinking, &c.

   Upon the report by the Officers of the Local Board of Health, certified by the
Government Adviser, of the feasibility of a plan of water-su)3ply by a well or bore-

hole, an order should issue for the compulsory carrj'Lng out of the work, and powers
should be vested in the Local Sanitary Authority to raise money for the purpose.

   The well thus constructed should be carefully preserved from pollution, and bo
accessible to the inliabitauts of the village or hamlet comprised in the order; and
all objectionable or impure sources of supply should be destroj'ed or stopped up.

   In cases, on the other hand, where it is foimd that, owing to the position of any
village or hamlet in reference to the subjacent water-beai-iug fonuation, the depth
and cost would be too great for the resom-ces of the inhabitants, then it woidd be
necessary to have recourse to the most suitable sti-eam or brook, which should be put
under strict regulation as regards the prevention of contamination. The author
proposed that in such cases small tanks should be constructed for storage of the

waters in winter, and should be vested in the Local Sanitary Board, who should

be responsible for their due preservation.
   In conclusion the author expressed his opinion that tlie time for carrying out

some general scheme of water-supply for the too greatly neglected villages and
country parishes had come, and which he considered might be earned out by com-
bining the information to be derived from Geological Survey maps with the power

granted under the Public Health Act of 1872. He considered that any scheme to
be of use should be both compulsory and of general application. He also considered

that until every village and hamlet, as well as every to\vn and city, had a constant
supply of pure water for domestic purposes, sanitary legislation could not be consi-

dered to have oflected its purpose.

              Tides in the Irish Sea. By James N. SHootBEED, C.E.

At the Easter equinoctial tides in 1875, a series of simultaneous observations

were carried on at several points on the English and Irish coasts of the Irish Sea,

on March 31st and on April 8th, the calculated least neap and the greatest spring

of the year.

On the English side, at Whitehaven, Barrow, Fleetwood, Liverpool, and Holyhead,

and on the Irish one at Belfast, Dundalk, and Dublin, simultaneous observations

were obtained, generally imder the direction of the Engineer in charge of the port.

The English observations, taken by Greenwich time, have been reduced to a

uniform level of ICO feet below the  Ordnance datum of  Great  Britain                               while  the
                                                                                                  ;

Irish ones, where Dublin time was observed, were reduced to the Ordnance datum

of Ireland. And as the diffi?rence between each Ordnance datum and the mean

level of the surrounding sea has been ascertained, it is possible, by assuming uni-

formity in the mean sea-level, still further to compare directly the two systems of
levels with each other. From a general comparison of these tidal data the fol-
lowing conclusions may be roughly drawn.

W.1st. That the time of H.            at all the points of obseiTation is practically the

same, allowance being made for the disturbing influence of weather; and the

same remark applies to L. W.

W.2ud. That the level of H.           at all points {actually within the Irish Sea) on

each coast, taken separately, is nearly identical ; and the same may be said of the

level of L. W.

3rd. That the tidal range on the English coast is about double of that on the

Irish side.

   In explanation of these peculiarities it must be borne in mind that there are two

--tides which set into the Irish Sea the northern one round the north of Ireland,

and the southern one coming from the English Channel, the meeting of the two

being somewhat along a line drawn from Fleetwood across to Duudalk.

   Captain Beechey, R.N., who some j'ears back made considerable researches as to
the tides of the Irish Sea, described them under the name of " Stationary Tide," in

contradistinction to the " Progi-essive Tide," where the times of H. W. and of L. W.

at different points vary with the distance previously travelled by the tidal wave*
The result of the above-named simultaneous observations has been on this head to

confirm positively what Captain Beechey and others had supposed to be the case.

   The greater range of the tide on the English side, 30 feet at equinoctial springs
iis against 16 feet, may be accounted for by the shallow water of Morecambe and

Liverpool bays and along the English coast, where, under v\'ell-known tidal laws,

a considerable heaping up and a corresponding depression might be anticipated.

  At equinoctial springs the H. W. on the English side stands about 7 feet
above, and at L. W. about 7 feet beloiv that on the Irish coast ; while at equinoc-

tial neaps the excess on the English side, both at H. AV. and at L. W., is reduced

to little over one foot.

      On Vertical Motion of Vessels. By John I. Thoentcroet.

The present paper treats on some experiments made to ascertain the vertical

motion of a vessel relative to the undisturb ed water-surface.

   The experiments were made with a torpedo-boat, 67 feet in length and 85
feet beam, which had a speed of about 19 knots. The water-surface was measured

at three points respectively (1, 14, and 27 feet ahead of the launch) by suspended
weights adjusted to its surface, as suggested by Mr. Froude (see Plate XIII. fig. 3),
the inclination of the boat and revolutions of the propeller being at the same time

noted.

   The results are shown in the accompanying diagi-am (see fig. 4, Plate XIII.), where
the horizontal ordinates represent revolutions of the propeller per minute (240 to

one inch)                                                the vertical ordinates of the line A, speed of screw ;  vertical ordinates of

The diagram shows that the vessel sank more deeply as the speed increased to

about 12 knots,  when almost suddenly,  with increasing speed, the       boat rises                                               and

of level observed was about 8 inches.

       On the Channel Tunnel*. By W. Toplet, F.G.S., Assoc.Inst.C.E.

   The author first described the geological structure of the shores of tlie Straits of
Dover, noting especially tlie water-bearing qualities of the various strata. The
most important bed in relation to this question is the ChaUc; the upper part of it
contains layers of ilints, which are wanting in the lower part. Water passes only
slowly through the mass of the chalk, but more freely along joints and fissures or
along the lines of flint. Below the Chalk come Gault, Lower Greensand, Weald
Clay, and Hastings Beds. Of these the Gault and the Weald Clay may be taken
as impervious beds. The author then passed on to note the lower beds, which come
to the surface near Boulogne, but wliicli are only known in the S.E. of England
by the Sub-Wealden boring. The various folds into which the strata have been
thrown were then noticed, and the relation of these to the structure of the district
was discussed.

   The author then referred to the various schemes which had been proposed fur
traversing the bed of the Channel, dwelling in greatest detail upon that of Sir J.

--IIawk.shaw a tunnel through the Challc, He alluded to the views of Prof.

Herbert as to the supposed existence of a large transverse fold iu the Channel, whicli
it was suggested might seriously interfere with the work, by bringing up beds

lower than the Chalk along the proposed line of tunnel. He was not prepared to

follow Prof. IJebert in his argument, believing that there was no evidence of such

difficulties as were suggested. It is frequently supposed that faults in the strata
would cause great inconvenience ; but the author showed, by reference to actual
workings in coal and other mines, that the danger here was exceedingly small, and
that there is no reasonable expectation of meeting with a larger quantity of water

tlian can be dealt with by pumping.
   The author referred to a proposal, by Prof. Prestwich, to construct a tunnel

through the Paljeozoic rocks; and al.so to one, first suggested by Mr. H. Willett,

for using in this way the Kimmeridge Clay, which occurs in great thickness in
the Sub-Wealden boring, and also exists on the French coast. He showed that a
tunnel through the Kimmeridge Clny would be quite feasible, the chief objection

--being its length. He gave a preference to Sir J. Hawkshaw's scheme a tunnel

through the Lower Chalk, and had little doubt that this could be successt'iilly

carried out.

can be varied at will. When it is so adjusted that it sjoichronizes with the waves,

the oscillations become very violent, and a large amount of power can be obtained
from them. The theoretical amount of power per minute in foot-lbs. obtainable,

when the synchronism is perfect, is equal to 57-7 X the range of oscillation of the

   The manner in which this result is arrived at is explained by the diagram. Tlie
dotted wavy line represents the motion of the ship through one oscillation, and the
full wavy line that of the weight. The distances between these two lines are indi-
cated by the ordinates a, b, c, d, &c., which also represent the tension of the spring.

Whenthe ship is rising the spring is pushing down, and when it is falling the spring

is pulling up, thereby affording a resistance against which the ship can work. The

ordinates «, b, c, &c., planted as oi-dinates on a line which represents the vertical
motion of the ship, make an elliptical figure, the area of which represents the work
taken out of the ship and put into the oscillating weight in one complete oscillation.

   In practice the spring would consist of highly compressed air pressing on the rams
of hydropneumatic cylinders ; and the arrangement is such that the vessel containing

the compressed air forms the moving weight. The natm-al period of oscillation in

   The author exhibited a design for a machine for working an auxiliary propeller

of a sailing-ship of 1800 tons displacement. The moving weight in this case is
200 tons ; and ho showed by calculation that with a range of oscillation of 20 feet
it would give, after allowing for friction, about 30 horse-power in the long swell
met with in the tropical calm, 2()0 horse-power in average ocean-waves, and more
than 600 horse-power in a heavy head sea. The space occupied by the machine

compares favourably with a steam-engine of the same power.
   The author exhibited a model of the machine, which in a moderate sea had yielded

power at the rate of 1 J horse-power per ton of moving weight.

On SteeritKj. By Joseph Woolley, LL.D., Vice-President of the Institution

                                            of Naval Architects.

   The only mode of steering considered in this paper is that in which the rudder
is the instrument employed, screws placed athwartships, in the bow or stern, and

jets of water on the principle of Ruthven's propeller, having been proposed, but

never seriously adopted.
   Ancient authors always assumed that, in accordance with the received theory of

resistance, the resistance on tlie rudder varied as if sin '' <1>, where v is the velocity of
the ship and <P the angle to which the rudder is put over. Modern observations and
experience show that tliis law is incorrect ; that the resistance is not uniform over
the whole surface, but more effective at the fore than the aft part ; and the pivot-
balanced rudder gives reason to believe that the resistance of the foremost third is

equivalent to that on the aftermost two thirds of the wliole surface. It is also now

allowed by most competent authorities that the resistance at different angles varies
more as the sine than as the square of the sine of the angle. In accordance with

the old theory, the angle of maximum efficiency was laid down at 54 deg. 44 sec.

Bouguer points out that this angle is too large, and that it ought to be reduced, in
consequence of the change of direction of the water particles at the upper or

broader part of the ship ; and in a general way thinks it should be reduced by at

least 7 deg. or 8 deg. Euler, following in his steps, by reasoning analogous to rudi-
mentary stream-line principles, finds that v cos /3 is the velocity with which the

particles of water impinge on the rudder at the part where ^ represents the angle
made by the water-hne with the fore and aft lines. He then deduces for the angle

of maximum efficiency at that height 90° -^31^, where y=co3-* - cos /3. Thus,

if i3 be 4-5 deg., this angle is 29 deg. 9 min. But as the angle varies for different
water-lines, he concludes in favour of a mean angle of 48 deg., or at least 45 deg.

    There is reason to believe that not only does the putting over of a rudder produce

a direct resistance on its outer surface (which alone has hitherto found its way
                                                                                                  19*

into matlieuiatical formulfe), but also increases tlie pressure on the stern-post and

dead wood for a considerable distance forward by cliecking tLe velocity, the effect

of which on the turning of tlie ship would form a considerable item in the whole

action. This is in accordance with the principle of stream-lines so ably explained

by Mr. Froude, in which he shows that a diminished velocity is always accompanied

by increased pressure. When the stream has, however, set up a decided cun-ent

towards the outer edge, the velocity increases and the pressure diminishes. This

e.xplains the experimental fact before mentioned, that the fore part of the rudder is

more efficient than the after part. In accordance with this view, it is understood

that some ships in the royal service are being fitted with the balanced rudder, so

arranged that, when under canvas only, not only is the fore part of the rudder

turned into a stern-post, and the blades of the screw made to act as dead wood,
but additional dead wood is made to run out under the counter, so as entirely to fill

up the cavity before the screw.

There are two conditions in the putting over of the rudder to be considered. At

the first moment the axis of motion, or instantaneous axis of rotation, is not the

centre of gravity, but a point determined as follows :--The first impulse in the

rudder is to produce a pressure on it perpendicular to its surface, which on ordinary

mechanical principles is equivalent to au impulse applied to the ship at its centre

of gravity in a parallel direction, and a couple to turn it round the centre of gravity.

A B G AIn fig. 2, Plate XIII., is the instantaneous axis, thus formed :                                        is drawn per-

G Dpendicular to the direction of the water-pressure on the rudder ;                                 parallel to 15 C,

G A Aby the construction,

This is only true at the first moment. The ship afterwards shifts laterally until

the lateral resistance so created becomes equal to the lateral force on the rudder,

and there remains a couple turning the ship round, whose force is the resistance on

the rudder, and the arm the distance between the centre of effort on tlie rudder

and the centre of lateral resistance on the ship. This latter point is almost always

before, and sometimes very considerably before, the middle point of the ship's

length. Hence evidently the stern is the most effective place for tlie rudder, as no-

Avhere else can this arm  be  so large                                        and hence also is the  manifest  disadvantage
                                                                           ;

mof a rudder raking forward from the top downwards, as is sometimes the case

vaehts, which arrangement not only diminishes the arm of the turning couple,

but practically increases the immersion in consequence of the existence of a verti-

cally resolved part of the water-pressiue on tlie rudder.

Sensibility to tlie helm («. e. quickness and readiness in a ship to go about) is

a most important quality. At the first moment the angular acceleration, which is

a measure of tliis sensibility, varies directly as the moment of the water-pressure

on the rudder, and inversely as the product of the weight of the ship and the

.square of its radius of gyration about a vertical axis through the centre of gravity.

The moment of water-pressure varies catcris paribus as the area of rudder surface.

When large ships wore first built the area of rudder surface was not increased in

proportion to the dimensions; hence large ships (cf/. the 'Achilles') were not

handy. Ilandiness is also diminished by putting heavy weights at the stem and

Astern, and so increasing the radius of gyration.                             short ironclad would thus carry

heavy bow and stern guns with less injury to steering qualities than a larger one.

The great difficulty under which naval architects lay on the first introduction of

large ships was not in making the rudder big enough, but in finding power enough

on the wheel to turn tliem through an efficient angle, rudders of even moderate size

being found to require the united efforts of 40 or even GO men to bring them over

tol8deg. or 20 deg., not to speak of .38 deg. or40deg. This difficulty has since been

overcome by applying steam or hydraulic pressure to the wheel. In' the latter case,

however, if Mr. Reed's explanation of the cause of the ' Bessemer ' not answering

her helm fast enough on steering into Calais harbour be accepted, there seems to

be the inconvenience that it requires an appreciable interval of time to move the

rudder ; and hence for instantaneous purposes {e. g. getting clear of an obstacle or

avoiding a collision) this mode of supplying power is fault}'. The period in which

a complete turn of a steam-ship is eti'ected and the diameter of the circle described

are important elements in the handines-s.

On this subject I abridge from M. Bertin's ' Notice sur la Marine a Vapeur de

/Guerre et de Commerce, 1876. In tig. 1, Plate XIII., is the pressure on the

rudder O B, and F the resultant of the lateral pressure acting through the ship's

Vcentre of lateral resistance and the direct resistance acting on the bows.                                                                                        is

Gthe velocity of the ship in direction V. Though here the angular velocity-

G Vhas become uniform, G C perpendicular to           is the diameter of the circle in

Awhich the ship turns.         G V is the angle of turning described in a unit of

time while the ship moves through the space V. The moment of resistance of

the water to the ship's turning, which is nearly proportional to the square of the

angular velocity, is equal to the moments of the two forces/ and F. The sum of

Gthe projections of these forces on the line C is equal to the centripetal force under

-- Fwhich the circle is described, and therefore to

Aexactly proportional to ¥'', and made with the axis O a constant angle, the
Glength of the radius C would be independent of the velocities, and the period of

a complete turn would vary inversely as V. In actual practice the velocity di-

minishes, the lateral resistance which is due to the small lateral velocity decreases

more slowly than the direct resistance which is proportional to V-, the angle made

G Gby F with  increases, and the centripetal force decreases more slowly than

G\'-, and the radius  diminishes. The circles described thus become smaller at

/ Fsmaller velocities. In comparing similar ships of different dimensions, and

Wincrease as the square, while increases as the cube of the dimensions. Hence

Ct C should increase nearly in the direct ratio of the dimensions. Thus the dia-

meter of the circle described by a ship in a complete turn should be about twice

that described by a similar ship of half its length.

The smaller the diameter of the circle in which a ship turns the more handy

.'ihe is. Records of the performances of the most handy ships in the English and

French navies established five times the length as the limit below which this

diameter never falls. Mention has been made of the difficulty felt by naial archi-

tects in supplying etiective steering-apparatus in lieu of the limited power available

in former days at the tiller. M. Barnes, stalling from the principle that only a

given power couid be thus used, made an investigation of the conditions under

Hewhich this could be most efficiently applied.       established two propositions :

(1) that for the same power to bring over rudders of different breadths to different

angles, the breadths should be inversely as the sines of the angles ; and (2) that

the efficiency of the rudder under such circumstances varies as the sine of twice

the angle. Hence, if a rudder of a certain length could be brought over to 15 deg.,

a rudder of half its breadth could he brought over by the same force to oO deg., and

the efficiency thereby nearly doubled. He recommended subsidiary rudders to be

fitted so as to assist the maiu rudder when required. Such ruddeis were tried by

Admiral Halsted at Sheerness in 1863, but were found to diminish instead of in-

creasing the steering efliciency. This investigation has now little more than an
historical interest. It is to be observed that he finds the angle of maximum effi-

ciency to be 45 deg., which, however, on stream-line principles, would require to bo

reduced to 33 deg. or 34 deg. The law of variation of the resistance which he adopts

is that of the square of the sine. If that of the sine alone be introduced, it would

seem that the breadths of the rudders should be inversely as the square root of

the sines, and the angle of maximum efficiency 35 deg. 10 min., or, practically,

30 deg.

   It is often asserted now-a-days that the lower part of the rudder is of no use

and hence the practice of cutting it away has come into vogue. An experiment,

however, made by Mr. Froude, which he kindly couununicated to me, leaves no

doubt that this opinion is erroneous. To a model of the new ' Encounter,' 10 ft.

fiin. long, was fitted a rudder, consisting of two blades of equal dimensions, one

above the other, and tixcd at an angle of 30 deg. They were governed by the

same tiller, provided with  a  graduated  arc,  to  which  it  could be clamped                                                                                    thu.«,

when the angle of one 1)lade was reduced, tliat of the other was increased to an equal
extent. The model was towed hy the nose with an arrangement which allowed

perfect freedom of motion in a vertical direction, but inexorably resisted any attempt

at lateral motion, while the stern was left perfectly free to move sideways in

either direction. The set of the rudder was varied until she followed neutrally;
and it was found that when she did this, the upper half required just 20 deg. of

inclination to balance the lower half with 10 deg., thus proving incontestably the

higher efficiency of the lower half. Possibly, however, an advantage inay accrue

from raising the centre of effort on the rudder, in some ca.ses by reason of the arm

of the turning couple, viz. the distance between this centi-e of effort and centre

of ship's lateral resistance                  becoming  less inclined                                                           while this is  inclined,  there  is
                                                                                                                             ;

a tendency to heel, which may sometimes be troublesome, especially in sailing-

ships.

Stream-lines modify the velocity and the direction with which particles of water

impinge on the rudder less perceptibly in screw-propelled than in sailing-ships.

Another phenomenon may be noticed, viz. that a vessel or model moving in the

direction of its lengtli is, on stream-line principles, in a position of unstable equi-
librium. She will always have a tendency to deviate on one side or the other

on which seems a matter of indifference ; but this tendency will, when once ex-

hibited, go on increasing until she turns broadside on to her original direction. In
a Sixiling-vessel moving obliquely to the direction of the wind the relative position

of the centre of efi'ort of sail and of lateral resistance may oblige her to carry lee

or weather helm according as she is ardent or slack. In any case the less helm a
ship requires, the less is her way retarded, and tlie better she will sail.

I can only glance <at the improvements which have been made in the forms of

rudder ; of these the most important, as far as screw-ships are concerned, is the
pivot-balanced rudder, in which, by placing tlie axis of rotation at or near the
centre of eilort, very little power is required at the tiller or wheel to bring it over
to any required angle. The most usual form is that fitted to the ' Bellerophon,' in

whicii the proportion of the fore and aft part (determined by experiment) is as 1

to 2                       when under  steam  the  column of water driven backwards by                                                         the screw acts
                        ;

powerfully on each side and produces a stron": turning power. When under sail

the fore part is disconnected from the aft, and being fixed in the direction of the

keel, becomes a stern-post. The means of still further increasing this stern-po.st

or dead wood by a movable plane mider the counters now fitting in screw-ships has

already been adverted to.

                                                                       by checking the velocity of the im-

pinging stream a very considerable additional pressure is brought to bear on the

fore part, and thus the steering quality is much improved. It was formerly fitted

in several of II.M. ships, but has been latterly discontinued in consequence of the
rusting and corrosion of the chains and self-acting machineiy under water. Chap-
lin's rudder, consisting of two plane surfaces fitted in the counter, inclined at about

an angle of .30 deg., the outer edges flush with the counter when not required, but
let down by suitable machinery when wanted for use, was tried on board PI.M.
ship ' Sultan ' and immediately condemned as useless, needs no further comment.
Other forms which have not been received at all favourable need no description.

   Another form, however, invented by Mr. Gumpel, seems very promisino-. Its

peculiarity is that the tiller-power applied in the ordinary way gives motion to a
crank working on a vertical axis moving freely on the rudder-blade at or about the
centre of water effort. The fore end of the blade is directed by a pintle moving in

a fore-and-aft slot, so that it always remains in a line with the keel. When put

hard over to an angle of 38 deg. 40 min. the crank is at right angles to the blade,
which requires the length of the crank to be to the distance of the vertical axis
from the fore edges as 4 to 5. The ratio of the forces required at the tiller of this

rudder to that of the ordinary rudder, to keep it at angles of 5 deg., 10 deg., 15 deg.,
up to .3.5 deg., and 38 deg. 40 min., is given in the following Table, and is in-
dependent of the laws of resistance.

   The ratio of work required to put over the two rudders respectively to angle
88 deg. 40 min. is found to be four tenths if the resistance is supposed to vary as
the square of the line of inclination, and five tenths if (as is more correctly assumed)

it vary simply as the sine of this angle.

   The value of this rudder is manifest, as when the angle increases the relative

force dimiuishes considerably ; and after about 26 deg. the absolute force duuini.shes,
until at 38 deg. 40 min. it vanishes; and it is for the higher angles that the diffi-

culty of putting the common rudder over is most felt.

On the Effect, of Heat in altering the Molecular Structure of Steel. By W. F.

   Barrett, F.R.S.E., Professor of Phi/sics, Royal College of Science for

    Ireland.

   If a wire of steel of any thickness be heated, by any means, at a certain critical
temperature and for a certain length of time, the wire ceases to expand, although
heat be continuously poured in. During this period also the wire does not sen-
sibly increase in temperature. The length of time this abnormal condition lasts
varies with the thickness of the wire and the rapidity with which it can be heated
through its mass.

   Rods of steel from two to three tenths of an inch in diameter cease to expand for
five seconds when the wire is heated in a powerful combustion-furnace. This
change takes place as the wire begins to glow with a red heat and after it has ex-
panded one hundredth of its total length. The temperature of the critical point is
a little over the melting-point of antimony, but under that of silver. The heating
being continued, tlie elongation of tlie wire is resumed till the wire glows with the
full heat it can attain from the source ; it then ceases to expand, and no further
change is noticed till the heat is cut oft". Wlien this is done, the wire begins to
cool down regularly, till it has reached the critical point at which the change took
place on heating. Here a second and reverse change occurs. Tliis is the di.sturb-
anee first noticed some time ago by Mr. Gore, and wliich he believed was confined
to the cooling of steel wires and of wires of small diameter This, however, the
author has found not to be the case. Hence it appears that, at a certain critical
temperature, the molecular structure of steel changes. The specific heat of the
metfil doubtless increases at this point, and tlie heat that is rendered latent is again
given out at the con-esponding temperature during cooling, when both the molecular
structure and the specific heat of steel pass into their normal state at the tempera-

 ture of the air.

    The molecular disturbances during the cooling of steel wires are thus exceedingly
remarkable, and may be summarized as follows :

    1st. M, the critical temperature these wires undergo a momentary and consider-
 able elongation, the amv>unt mainly depending on tlie strain to which the wire is

subjected. When wires of gradually increasing thickness are used, the amount of

the elongation diminishes ; but the duration increases considerably, lasting fifteen
seconds with a steel wire from two to three tenths of an inch in diameter.

   2nd. At the moment that the expansion occurs, an actual increase in tempera-
ture takes place sufficiently large to cause the wire to glow again with a red heat.

It is very curious that this after-ylow has not been noticed long ago, for it is a very
conspicuous object in steel wires that have been raised to a white heat and allowed

to cool.

   3rd. The molecular change taking place during cooling is accompanied by a
series of ticking sounds like those produced by scraping the edge of a metal plate
with a jagged knife.

   4th. But the most interesting point remains to be noticed. This is the fact that
the critical temperature is precisely that at which iron and steel resume their pro-
perties as magnetic metals, a property they had lost when at a white heat.

    5th. Further, the molecular changes already noticed are coincident with the
alteration in the thermoelectric properties of iron discovered by Prof. Tait. It
appears, therefore, that this remarkable critical temperature of steel is intimately

connected with many different and important phenomena. Some light may thus
be obtained on the inner structure of a magnet and other obscure phenomena.
The author stated that he had brought forward the foregoing points in a research
that is now in progress, in the hope that he might have the benefit of suggestions

fi'om the eminent phj'sicists that were present.

On Mechanical Self- Registerimi Apparatus for Barometer, Thermometer, Itain-
                and Wind-Gauges. By N. Lowejjthal Lonsdale.

The author described (1) a glass pen, of the form of the Wiirtemberg siphon,

filled with clear lithographic ink, and marking on a prepared zinc plate or cylinder,

from which might be printed zincographically copies for distribution and com-

parison; (2) the gearing, the "tape" conue.xion instead of rack and pinion; and

--(3j two .sensitive thermometers one an iron tube 56 inches long (closed at one

end), filled with mercury, and an iion piston ground in at the open end: the

piston has a play of one inch between the freezing- and boiling-points ; but by

means of his gearing this inch can be augmented ad libitum, and in connexion with

the writing-apparatus would mark any fraction of Fahrenheit's degree. The other

thermometer is a hammered or drawn zinc rod, 13 feet 6 inches long. These ther-

mometers being fixed in the open air move an axis which penetrates the wall (or a

pane of glass); and fixed on the other end, in the 7-com, is an index, as also the

well-balanced registering-apparatus.

Eain and velocity of wind are indicated by a governor and the above-mentioned

gearing                                 and the direction of wind  by an arm, in  connexion with  the vane-.'haft,
                                     ;
