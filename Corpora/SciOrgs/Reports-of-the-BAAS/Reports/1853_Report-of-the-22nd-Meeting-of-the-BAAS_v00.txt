Report on the Proceedings of the Council in 1851-52, as presented
   TO THE General Committee at Belfast, Wednesday, Sept. 1,

    1852.

    " I. With reference to the subjects referred to the Council by the General
Committee at Ipswich, the Council have to report as follows :

    (a) The Council having requested the President, Mr. Airy, to use his best
endeavours to obtain from Government a grant towards the publication of Mr.
Huxley's Zoological and Anatomical Researches, made during the voyage of
 H.M.S. ' Rattlesnake,' have been informed by Mr. Airy that the Govern-
 ment have expressed their inability to make a grant for that purpose in the
 present year : the Council recommend that the application should be re-

 peated.

    (b) The Council requested the President, Mr. Airy, to communicate to
 Her Majesty's Government, and to the Court of Directors of the East India
 Company, the recommendation approved by the General Committee, that
 the necessary aid should be given for the speedy publication of the Bo-
 tanical Researches of Drs. Hooker and Thomson, Captain Strachey and Mr.
 Winterbottom, so as to constitute, by combination with former publications,
 a general Indian Flora. The Council have been informed by Mr. Airy, first,
 that Dr. Hooker is engaged under an instruction from Government, in
 arranging his materials for publication, in three volumes, the first of which
 will not be ready before November 1852 ; and that no immediate application
--

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  XXV

for further assistance is required ; and secondly, that, having ascertained the
state of preparation of Dr. Thomson's researches, he has laid the case fully
before the Court of Directors in a letter to Mr. Melvili, to which he has as

yet received no reply.
   (c) The Council requested the President, Mr. Airy, to make the necessary

application to the Court of Directoi's of the East India Company to afford
Captain Strachey such aid as would enable him to publish his explorations
in the Himalaya Mountains and in Thibet, with the necessary maps and
illustrations; and have learned from Mr. Airy tiiat he has been informed
that the Chairman of the Court of Directors has signified his intention of
giving to Captain Strachey the assistance contemplated by the Association,
and that he lias therefore taken no further step.

    " II. The President, as one of the Committee for Tidal Observations in the
Atlantic appointed by the General Committee at Ipswich, has communicated
to the Council the Memorial which the Tidal Committee has presented to
 Government. It is as follows:

   We" ' beg leave to make to Her Majesty's Government a representation

with which we have been charged by the British Association for the Ad-
 vancement of Science, respecting the importance of sending out a ship or

 ships to extend our acquaintance with the phoenomena of the Tides of the

 Atlantic Ocean.
    " ' The importance of an acquaintance with the phaenomena of the Tides,

 both for practical and theoretical purposes, is sufficiently obvious, and has
 been recognised by the Government of this country in many ways. At
 most of the points of our own coast, and at several places in other countries,
 observations have long been made which suffice for most of these purposes.

 But perhaps it is not generally understood how far these observations,

 hitherto, are from giving us such a connected knowledge of the subject as

 may enable us to follow the course of the tide over any considerable portion
 of the Ocean. Even with regard to our own shores, such accurate know-
 ledge hardly existed till observations were made and continued for a fortnight
 at the coast-guard stations of Great Britain and Ireland in June 1834, and
 again in June 18S6. On the latter occasion application was also made to
 foreign maritime states, to make a similar and simultaneous series of obser-
 vations, the Duke of Wellington, at that time Foreign Secretary of State,
 promoting the object in a manner which procured from them the most cordial
  and effective co-operation. The results of these observations were inserted

  and discussed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1836 (Part II.) ; and, in
  consequence, the course of the tides along the shore from the Strait of
  Gibraltar to the coast of Norway, was made out, as to some general features
  and also along the coast of the United States. But beyond these limits we
  may be said to have no connected knowledge of the course of the tides of
  the Atlantic ; and even within these limits it is impossible, for want of other
  observations, to connect those which were made ; for instance, the tides on
  the American and the European shores. Along the coasts of Africa and of
  South America we are ignorant of the course and progress of the tides,
  although Ave know some of the phfenomena at detached points, and know
  some of them to be remarkable and perplexing. Nor is it at all likely that
  these defects in our knowledge will be removed by any collection of de-
  tached observations. It is only by systematic observations made with the
  express view of connecting our knowledge on this subject, and pursued from
   place to place, as the results themselves suggest, that Ave shall ever obtain a
  general view of the facts. Such observations might be made in no long
                                              ,  --                                   ;

XXvi                                              --REPORT 1852.

time if an expedition were sent out with this special and exclusive object
and might, in that case, be so conducted as to lead with certainty to the

result.

   " ' The best mode of mailing observations would, probably, be found to be

to place observing parties at certain distances along the coast, the intervals
being various according to the nature of the phaenomena; and to direct

them to make simultaneous observations for a few days^nd then to proceed
farther along the coast with the expedition ; or the tides at any place might
(on any day) be referred to the moon's transit, and this would afford suffi-
cient means of comparison with any neighbouring case, unless the phaeno-
mena were peculiar. In this way the progress of the tide-wave along the
coasts of Africa and America would be determined ; from what points it
diverges, and towards what points it converges ; the latter points being, it is

presumed, generally those of very high tides, such as occur on the east coast
of Patagonia. With these observations, combined with others at oceanic
islands, the general course of the tide elevation might be traced ; and if this

were done for the Atlantic, it would be the first time that the course of the
tide in such an ocean-space has been made known to us.

   " ' It would also be desirable to observe at the same time the streams of
flood and ebb. From such observations, combined with those of High and

Low water, it has appeared in Captain Beechey's recent researches, results
may be deduced, giving a new and unexpected view of the tidal movements

of the sea, and supplying knowledge useful for the practical purposes of

navigation.

   " ' As has been said, it is probable that an expedition devoted especially to
such a purpose might attain the leading features of the required results in no

long time                                     perhaps in a year or eighteen  months.  This must be on the sup-
                                           ;

position that it did not attempt to follow the details of the tides out of the

oceanic space into collections of islands like the West Indies, the details of

which would employ a much longer time.
   " ' One ship, with several boats to set down and take up observing parties,

would probably be the fittest scale of the expedition ; and standard points,

where the observations should be longer continued, and to which the obser-

vations at secondary points sliould be referred, would be established from

place to place in the course of the operations.'

   "III. It has been reported to the Council, by the officers of the Associa-
tion, that from accidental circumstances, the three following recommenda-
tions from the Committee of Section C, at Ipswich, had not reached the
Committee of Recommendations in sufficient time to be included in their
Report to the Committee :

   "1. That a Committee be appointed to take into consideration and report
upon the exact position, number and nature of the phosphatic beds of the
Crag, and to connect this subject with that of mineral manures generally
with reference to their scientific and economic value ; and further to investi-
gate the geological conditions under which the so-called ' Coprolites ' and
other drifted Organic and Inorganic bodies occur in the Red Crag, and the
probable sources from which these bodies have been respectively derived.

The Committee to consist of Professor Henslow, Mr. Searles Wood and

Mr. Long, with power to add to their number.

   " 2. That Mr. Searles Wood be requested to prepare for the next meeting

of the Association, a Report of the observed distribution of the specific forms
of Vertebrata and Invertebrata in the supracretaceous deposits in the vicinity
of Ipswich.

   " VI. The Council have great pleasure in submitting the following list of
invitations from which the General Committee will have to select the place
of meeting in 1853, viz

    "Hull: from whence invitations were also received in 1838, 1839, 1842,
1849, 1850 and 1851 ; in which invitations the Municipal Council and all
the other public bodies of the town united.

    "Liverpool: from the Mayor and Corporation; the Literary and Philo-
sophical Society ; the Royal Institution ; the Architectural and Archasolo-
gical Society ; the Polytechnic Society ; Historic Society of Lancashire and
Cheshire ; being a renewal of the invitation presented at Edinburgh in 1850.
. " Brighton : from the Earl of Chichester and sixty-eight other gentlemen,
xxviii  --REPORT 1852.

in addition to the application made to the meeting at Ipswich, on tlie part of
the Commissionei's of Brighton, by their clerk.

   " Glasgow ; from the Magistrates and Town Council, and from tlie

Glasgow Philosophical Society.
   "Leeds: for a meeting some year after the year 1853.

   " VII. The Council are happy to have it in their power to report most
favourably on the proceedings in the last year at the establishment at Kew.
The experimental f'^l of Mr. Ronalds's magnetographs, which was in pro-
gress when the last Report of the Council was made, has been completed,
and detailed statements of the performance of each of the three instruments
have been furnished by Messrs. Ronalds and Welsh, and are inserted in the
volume of Reports for 1851. The Council have great pleasure in referring
to these statements as showing that Mr. Ronalds's adaptation of photography
to record the magnetic variations is an effective and practicallj^ useful in-
vention, supplying to those who may desire it the means of making and
preserving a continuous registry of the phaenomena. The processes employed
for the construction and verification of standard thermometers, have proved
remarkably successful, and will form the subject of a distinct and detailed

Report from the Committee of the Kew Observatory. The thermometers

prepared by Mr. Welsh, under the direction of the Committee, have been
found, on intercomparison, and also on comparison with Mr. Regnault's
standard, to furnish results highly satisfactory. They have already been
supplied on application to the observatories at the Cape of Good Hope and

--Toronto, and to several persons under the following regulation of the

Council : ' That standard thermometers made at Kew be supplied on ap-

plication to members of the British Association, and Fellows of the Royal

Society, at 1/. each.' The Council have also directed that the Kew Com-

mittee be authorized, at their discretion, to supply standard thermometers

on official application to any department of Her Majesty's Government, or
to the East India Company ; and 2nd, that the Committee be authorized, at

their discretion, to present standard mercurial thermometers to certain of

the philosophical instrument makers. In compliance with the first of these
regulations, the Committee have supplied, on application from the Admiralty,
fourteen thermometers graduated to extreme low temperatures, to be em-

ployed in the Arctic Expeditions: and, in compliance with the second

regulation, they have presented standard thermometers to each of the follow-

--ing artists, viz. Messrs. Adie, Barrow, Watkins and Hill, Negretti, Newman,

and Simms. Applications have been received from Professors James Forbes
of Edinburgh, and William Thomson of GlasgoAv, for suitable thermometers
for very delicate experimental researches in which these gentlemen are en-
gaged, and which thermometers are now in preparation.

    " The preparations for the construction of standard barometers are far
advanced ; and with a view to the further prosecution of these objects, the
Committee for the construction and verification of standard instruments have
taken steps for procuring autlientic standards of length and weight, by placing
themselves in communication with the Commission appointed by Her Ma-
jesty's Government to prepare such standards.

    " At the request of the East India Company, twenty sets of instruments
for proposed meteorological observations in India have been examined and
verified at Kew.

    " The arrangements required for Professor Stokes's experiments have been
completed, and the experiments are now in progress.

    " The Council have great pleasure in repeating their former expressions of
                                                                    --

           REPORT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.                   XXIX

entire approbation of the zeal and intelligence with which Mr. Welsh con-
tinues to discharge the various duties entrusted to him from time to time,
by the Superintending Committee. These qualities have been especially-
shown in the manipulations required in the construction of the standard ther-
mometer's, and in the processes for their verification.

   "At the request of the Council, the Superintending Committee have made
arrangements with Mr. Green for four ascents of the Nassau balloon, for the

purpose of investigating the meteorological phaenomena of the atmosphere.

Two of these ascents have already taken place, one on the 17th and the

other on the 26th of August, on each of which days Mr. Green ascended
to between 19,000 feet and 20,000 feet, accompanied by Mr. Welsh and

Mr. Nicklin, taking with them instruments prepared in the Kew Observatory.
The observations made in these two ascents had reference chiefly to the laws

of the deci'ement of temperature and of aqueous vapour in ascending into
the atmosphere, and will be the subject of a communication from Mr. Welsh
to the Mathematical and Physical Section.

   " In closing this report of the proceedings at the establishment at Kew, the

Council are glad to be able to state that the expenditure during the year has
not exceeded the sum placed at their disposal by the General Committee,
and that there are no debts; and the Council strongly recommend that the
establishment should continue to receive the support of the British Asso-

ciation."

Report of the Parliamentary Committee of the British Asso-
   ciation FOR THE Advancement of Science, presented to the
   General Committee at Belfast, Wednesday, September I, 1852.

The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as follows :

   The Committee met for the first time on the 3rd of February last, they
met again on the 11th of March and on the 17th of June.

At these several meetings the following, among other business, was trans-

acted. The Committee agreed to meet yearly on the day succeeding the

meeting of Parliament, and on the second Thursday in July.

In consequence of the dissolution of Parliament, the meeting of June was

this year substituted for that of July. The Committee resolved to cooperate

with the President and Council of the Iloyal Society, who had already taken

steps in this behalf, in urging upon the Government the expediency of facili-

tating the cheap and rapid international communication of scientific publi-

cations ; and the Council of the Royal Society, by a resolution dated the 19th

of February, informed this Committee that they would be much gratified by

such cooperation.

   In pursuance of these resolutions, Lord Wrottesley, as Chairman of this

Committee, in company with the End of Rosse as President, and Colonel

Sabine as Treasurer of the Royal Society, had, on the 10th of March, an in-
terview with Sir Thomas Freemantle, the Chairman of the Board of Customs,
who suggested a plan by which eminent scientific individuals and institutions

might be permitted to receive from abroad their presentation copies of scien-
tific works duty free, through the medium of the Royal Society, and whereby

certain facilities in this behalf might likewise be afforded to the Smithsonian

Institution of the United States, in return for privileges conceded to that
Institution by the Government of those States ; and he recommended that a

letter should be Avritten to the Lords of the Treasury embodying these sug-

gestions.

--XXX REPORT 1852.

   In conformity with this recommendation a letter was addressed to the
Lords of the Treasury by the Earl of Rosse, as President of the Royal So-
ciety, in concurrence with Lord Wrottesley as Chairman of this Committee.
To this letter no reply has as yet been received.

   With the view of promoting the same general object, viz. the cheap and
rapid international communication of scientific publications, it was resolved
that Lord Wrottesley should address, and he addressed accordingly, a letter
to the Earl of Malmesbury, as Secretary for Foreign Affairs, of which the
following is a copy :

                                                                                                      " March 15, 1852.

  --"My Lord, As Chairman of a Committee composed of Members of both

Houses of Parliament, selected by the British Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, to watch over the interests of science and inspect the various
measures from time to time introduced into Parliament likely to affect such

interests, and which met for the first time on the 3rd of February last, I am

requested to represent to your Lordship the great inconvenience to which
the cultivators of the various branches of science in this country are now ex-
posed by the extravagant charges levied by Foreign Governments on the
conveyance by post of Presentation Copies of Scientific Publications sent from
this country to eminent scientific men, pursuing similar branches of science

in foreign parts ; and I am further directed respectfully to request your Lord-

ship, by negotiating Postal Conventions or otherwise as you shall think pro-
per, to endeavour to prevail on the governments of other countries to afford
greater facilities for the 'transmission by post of such publications.

   " The undersigned believes that he cannot better illustrate the extent of
the evils complained of than by subjoining the following list of charges for
the conveyance by post to the various countries named therein, of a commu-
nication printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1851, and which was
conveyed by our own post office to every place within the United Kingdom

at a charge of 8d. :

To Modena     14 10  To Berlin        9
              15                      9
     Palermo  18 4        Seeberg     9
     Milan    12 8         Dreissen   5
     Turin    18 4         Brussels
     Padua                 Cadiz      7
    Bonn       9          Gottingen'  6

   "Your Lordship will at once perceive that such charges as these are far
beyond the moans of many of the most distinguished cultivators of science,
who are absolutely disabled thereby from forwarding by post to their friends
abroad the copies of their scientific memoirs which are presented to them

gratuitously for the purpose of distribution by the respective societies, to
which such communications are sent and in whose Transactions they appear.

   " From this cause, combined with the duties levied at the Custom House on

similar publications imported from abroad, at present the interests of science
are very injuriously affected, for it happens continually, to use the expressions
of the Treasurer of the Royal Society in a letter addressed to the under-
signed, ' That a quantity of intellectual labour of a very high class is un-
productively consumed in doing over again in one country that which has
already been done in another, from the want of a more rapid interchange of
knowledge.'

   " Mr. Rowland Hill of the Post Office Department, has suggested a mode
       REPORT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.                                                      XXXI

by which these evils might be remedied, viz. if Foreign Countries could be
induced to adopt the arrangement, by which books are now forwarded to
some of our Colonies, at charges very reasonable as compared with the above.

                                                                                         " I remain, &c.,

                                                                                 " Wrottesley."

   To the above letter the following reply was received from Mr. Addington,
the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs :- ^^ ^^^^.^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^

  « My Lord,--I am directed by the Earl of Malmesbury to acquaint your

Lordship that he has referred to the Postmaster-General your letter ot the
15th inst., urging that steps be taken by Her Majesty's Government to induce
Foreign Governments to reduce their rates of Postage on printed papers, with
a view of facilitating the distribution of scientific works.

                                                                          " I am, &c.,

                                                                           " H. U. Addington."

   The Committee also requested Lord Wrottesley and Sir Robert Inglis to
represent to the Earl of Derby the inadequacy of the present fund out ot
which Pensions are provided in certain cases for eminent scientific men.

   In pursuance of this resolution Lord Wrottesley and Sir Robert Inglis re-
quested and obtained an interview with the Earl of Derby on the 19th of March
last, at which they directed his attention to the ill-success which had lately

attended the applications for Scientific Pensions, and instanced the cases ot
Mr. Hind and Dr. Mantell, in whose behalf the Earl of Rosse, as President

of the Royal Society, had applied for a grant of Pensions.
   The Earl of Derby, in replv, stated it to be the wish of the Government

to apportion the fund equitably amongst all the separate classes into which
the List is divided, or to that effect, and requested to know the share of the

whole fund which had in fact been allotted to Science. In answer to this

latter question Lord Wrottesley addressed to the Earl of Derby a letter, of

which  the   followin"g  is  a  copy       :--                                                     ,^^,,
                                      ^·'                    " Wrottesley, April 24, 1852.

   « Dear Lord Derby,--When I had the honour of an interview with you
in the matter of Pensions to Scientific men, you asked me for the exact

amount of those that had been granted in favour of Science. I could not

answer this question, as I had not then been able to obtain either the earliest
or latest returns. I have since procured all the papers and the account stands

as follows: out of £16,800 (1200 X 14), the total sum granted for Pensions,
since the Civil List was settled at the commencement of the Queen's reign,
a sum of £2150 has been appropriated to Science, properly so called, or not

quite 13 per cent.

"I     give  this  detail    because       it was  required  from  me                but I  would  not    be
                                                                                  ;

understood to ground any argument upon it : our complaint is, that in a
country like this, which owes so much to Science, there should be at any

time no means of rewarding, either by money payments, or in any other

manner both appropriate and acceptable to the candidates for distinction,

cases of great merit, which have been brought to the notice of the Govern-
ment by Scientific Societies in whose recommendations confidence may be

securely reposed. 1 say Scientific Societies, for however trustworthy an in-

dividual may be, there can never be the same reliance on a single opinion in

cases of this description*.

would likewise seem to be a very deserving case ; it was favourably enter-

tained, but the funds were exhausted*.

   In closing their Report the Committee cannot but express a hope that
their negotiations with the Government, with respect to the cheap and rapid
international communication of scientific works, may ultimately result in the

complete accomplishment of this desirable object.

RESEARCHES IN SCIENCE.  XXXIU

             Involving Application to Government or Public Institutions.

    That in order to meet the growing wants of science, and remedy, in some
degree, the inconvenience caused to its cultivators by the dissociated, incom-
plete, and discontinuous publication of scientific researches, it is expedient
that the British Association, which, by its constitution, includes representa-
tives of the various scientific institutions of the empire, should propose such
general views on the subject as may be suggested by the experience of its
members.

    That a Committee be formed for the purpose of considering of a plan by
which the Transactions of different Scientific Societies may become part of
one arranged system, and the records of facts and pheenomena be rendered
more complete, more continuous, and more convenient than at present.

    That it be an instruction to this Committee to place itself in communica-
cation with the Council of the Royal Society, and the Councils of other Sci-
entific Societies which receive scientific communications at regular meetings.

   That the Committee consist of Prof. W. Thomson, Prof. Andrews, Leo-
nard Horner, Esq., Prof. Owen, Sir R. I. Murchison, Col. Sykes, W. J. Ran-
kine, Esq., J. C. Adams, Esq., Dr. Lloyd, Prof. Wilson, Dr. Robinson, Prof.
Bell, Prof. Graham, W. R. Grove, Esq., Sir D. Brewster, and ex officio the

General Officers, with power to add to their number.
    That it is important to have a Quarterly Record of British and Foreign

scientific publications and discoveries, and that the consideration of the prac-
ticability of obtaining this be referred to the same Committee.

   That a representation be made to the Royal Society of the importance at-
tached by M. Otto Struve to the determination of the constant of "Irradiation"
for the Huyghenian object-glass of 123 feet radius.

    That it is expedient to proceed without delay with the establishment in
the Southern Hemisphere of a Telescope not inferior in power to a three
feet reflector ; and that the President, with the assistance of the following
gentlemen, viz. Lord Rosse, Dr. Robinson, Lord Wrottesley, J. C. Adams,

Esq., the Astronomer Royal, J. Nasmyth, Esq., W. Lassell, Esq., Sir D.

Brewster, and E. J. Cooper, Esq., be requested to take such steps as they
shall deem most desirable to carry out the preceding Resolution.

    That the publication of the reduction upon a scale of one inch to the mile
of the Tovvnland Survey of Ireland, ordered to be made in connection with
the Geological Survey by the Ordnance, and for which a vote was taken for
1852-53, upon the Estimates of that department, be recommended to the
Government to be accelerated.

    That the Council of the British Association be requested to continue their
efforts to obtain the assistance of the Government for the publication of Mr.
Huxley's researches.

    That, with the view of obtaining an accurate knowledge of the countries

on and near the Eastern coast of Africa, from the Red Sea to 10° S. lat., the
very important products of which have been enumerated by the late Sir
Charles Malcolm and Mr. D. Cooley, the British Association do call the
attention of the Court of Directors of the Honourable the East India Com-

pany, to the desirableness of sending an expedition thoroughly to explore,
that region, as recommended by the Royal Geographical Society of London.

The deputation to consist of the President of the British Association, and
the President and Vice-Presidents of the Royal Geographical Society.

    That most important meteorological data are attainable by balloon ascents ;
and that the Council be requested to solicit the cooperation of the Royai

Society in this investigation.

XXxiv  --REPORT 1852.

  That it is important that Professor W. Thomson and Mr. J. P. Joule be

enabled to make a series of experiments, on a large scale, on the thermal
effects experienced by air in rushing through small apertures ; and that a
representation to this effect be made to the Royal Society.

   That the Government be requested, on the part of the British Association,
to connect with the survey of the Gulf-stream an examination of the Zoology
and Botany of that current ; and also of the temperature of the sea round

the shores of the British Islands.

   The Committee having been informed that an expedition has been pro-
posed for ascending the Niger to its soui-ce, by Lieut. Lyons Macleod, R.N.
and that it has been recommended to Her Majesty's Government by the Royal
Geographical Society and the Chamber of Commerce of Manchester, resolve
that the President be requested to concur with the President of the Royal
Geographical Society in bringing the subject before the Government.

   The Committee having understood tiiat Dr. Bakie, Mr. A. Adams and Mr.
W. T. Alexander, each of them in the medical branch of Her Majesty's Navy,

have proposed to undertake a thorough exploration of the countries watered
by the river Magdalena in South America, in respect to their botanical,
zoological, and geological products, on the condition of being allowed their
full pay, request the President of the Association and Sir R. I. Murchison

to urge the Government to accede to this proposition.
   The Committee being aware of the liberality with which the Master-

General and Board of Ordnance have supplied the several engineer stations
with instruments for meteorological observations, would suggest the advan-
tage of adding to their instruments, in the Ionian Islands, others for measu-
ring the direction and amount of earthquake vibrations, so frequent in these

islands.

    That a systematic collection of the Agricultural Statistics of Great Britain,
of a similar nature with the returns of the agricultural produce of Ireland,
prepared under the care of Major Larcom, R.E., is a desideratum, and would

be of great public utility ; and that the President, Mr. Hey wood. Major
Larcom and Col. Sykes, be requested to communicate the above resolution
to Her Majesty's Government.

    That a Committee, consisting of Rev. Dr. Robinson, Prof. C. P. Smyth,

W. Fairbairn, Esq., W. J. M. Rankine, Esq., C.E., and W. S. Ward, Esq.,

be requested to take into consideration the methods of cooling air for the
ventilation of buildings in tropical climates by mechanical processes, and
should they see fit to prepare a memorial in the name of the British Asso-
ciation to the Hon. the East India Company, representing the. advantage of

making a trial of a process of that kind on a large scale, e.g. in a hospital.

                ADDRESS

COLONEL EDWARD SABINE, R.A.

                Treasurer and Vice-President of the Royal Society.

Gentlemen of the British Association,

My first duty in addressing you from this Chair, must be to express my

grateful thanks for the high honour you have conferred upon me by placing

Myme in so distinguished a position.  acknowledgements are due in the

first place to the gentlemen of Belfast, who by their Provisional Committee

brought my name before the Council as that of a person whose nomination

to the Presidency would give satisfaction at Belfast ; next, to my colleagues

in the Council, who adoped the suggestion of the Provisional Committee,

strengthening it by tiieir approval ; and finally, to the General Committee

(the governing body), by whom it was confirmed. The strong attachment

which I am known to have felt for so many years to the British Association
will be my best guarantee that no endeavours shall be wanting on my part

to perform the duties of the Office to the utmost of my power.

Gentlemen, we meet for the third time in the Sister Kingdom, on the

invitation, which has been most welcome to us, of a part of the kingdom

which has furnished to tlie British Association so large a proportion of dis-

tinguished members actively engaged in almost every department of science.

On our arrival, we find ourselves surrounded by faces familiar to us in the

recollections of many previous meetings, and long recognised as amongst the

warmest and steadiest friends of our Association. Our meeting is graced

and honoured by the presence of Her Most Gracious Majesty's representa-

tive in Ireland. With ample and excellent accommodation liberally provided

in the fullest anticipation of our wants, and with the evidence which forcibly

impresses itself on every side of rapidly increasing prosperity, opening a wide
--xlii REPORT 1852.

field for the practical applications of science, our satisfaction in assembling
here would be complete, were it not clouded by the absence of one friend

who would have been among the foremost to have welcomed us to this
meeting which he prepax-ed, the Naturalist of Ireland, whose memory will
long be honoured and cherished by the members of the British Association.

   The ever-increasing activity of the various branches of science embraced
by the British Association is such, as to render it scarcely possible to com-
prehend within the limits of an address of the usual length, even a brief
review of the progress made in the seven departments which constitute our
Sections. In the selection which I have thus found myself compelled to make,
I have been guided by a practical principle, which appears not unsuited to
an Association in which the Presidency is an annual office, viz. that the
President for the year should notice by preference those subjects with which
he is most familiar, in which the Association as a body have taken a part, or
which are likely to be discussed at the meeting over which he presides.

   Among the subjects which are likely to come before the Mathematical and

Physical Section, there is none perhaps of greater importance, or requiring
more careful consideration, than the question whether the time is arrived,
when the establishment of an Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere, fur-
nished with instruments of suitable optical power for the examination of the
Nebulae of the southern heavens, and devoted exclusively to that branch of
sidereal astronomy, should be again brought under the consideration of Her
Majesty's Ministers. I need not occupy your time by restating on this
occasion the reasons both of scientific and national concernment, which in-
duced the two principal Scientific Institutions of the United Kingdom, con-
jointly, to recommend to those entrusted with the administration of public
affairs, the formation of an establishment of this description in some fitting
part of Her Majesty's southern dominions. I would rather refer you to the
memorial presented to Government by the Earl of Rosse on the part of the
Royal Society, and by Dr. Robinson on the part of the British Association,

not only because it contains such a complete and formal exposition, as may
be most advantageously consulted by those who will now be called upon to

take part in the reconsideration of the subject, but also because it appears to

me to furnish an admirable model both in spirit and in matter, for communi-

 cations designed to fulfil the important purpose of conveying in an official

form the opinions and suggestions which the united body of scientific men
of this Kingdom may desire from time to time to bring under the considera-

 tion of the Executive.
     In the discussions which took place at a former period, the only diflficulty

 which appeared to be apprehended in reference to the successfid working of
 such an establishment, arose from a doubt whether mirrors of the required
 magnitude could be repolished, as they would frequently need to be, on the
 spot. This difficulty has now it is understood been entirely removed by the
 improvements which the noble Earl, the President of the Royal Society, to
ADDRESS.  xliii

whom science is so deeply indebted for the instrumental means of prosecuting

these researches, has made in the apparatus for repolishing the mirrors,
and in the instructions for the guidance of those who may have occasion to
employ it, which his own great personal experience has enabled hira to

prepare.

   In this happy country, in which men are free to consider and to discuss the

propriety of public support being given to undertakings conducive to national

honour, and are encouraged to do so by the experience that public men of all
parties who succeed each other in administration, seek to be guided by en-
lightened public opinion, we may justly entertain the full conviction that
measures which from their intrinsic importance deserve to be adopted will
sooner or later obtain the consideration they merit. When such propositions

--are brought in the first instance, as in the class of subjects with which we

--are here concerned it is desirable they should be, before those public bodies

which are justly regarded as possessing the highest scientific authority in this
country, and as most competent to judge of them, they cannot be too carefully
considered and discussed, before by their adoption they become invested with
the authority and weight which those bodies have it in their power to impart.
But when after due deliberation they have been so adopted, it is equally fitting
that those public bodies should be true to their own convictions, and should
steadily persevere in urging on ail proper occasions, both publicly and pri-
vately, the measures which they believe Avill add to their country's honour,
as well as to that general advancement of science by which all nations benefit
freely and alike in proportion to their degree of mental cultivation. That an
Observatory for the purpose specified, in a part of the globe where it can
render peculiar service, and where we possess facilities which other nations
do not possess, will ere long be established, no one I believe entertains a

doubt. The importance was admitted by the Ministry to whom the recom-

mendation was made, the only question with them appearing to be one of

time. When therefore we view the intrinsic merit of the proposition itself,
the general interest which it has excited at home and abroad, and its already,
to a certain extent, favourable reception by Government, we cannot doubt
that we have but to persevere, and by a judicious selection of times and
opportunities the object will be secured. It will be for the Members of the

Mathematical and Physical Section to consider in the first instance, and for
the General Committee, subsequently, to consider and decide whether any
official step shall be taken by the British Association in the present year.
Should such be your decision, it will be the duty of the Officers and Council
of the Association to confer with the President and Council of the Royal
Society, and in conjunction with them to take such steps as may appear most
fitting to bring the subject again, and in the most impressive manner, under

the consideration of the Authorities of the State. On the former occasion it

selected to direct an establishment of this novel description. Such may still
be deemed, perhaps, the least exceptionable course ; but at the same time it
may be desirable that it should be fully known, that we are not unprepared
on these and other points, if it be the pleasure of Her Majesty's Government

to desire our opinion.
    Hitherto the reseai'ches of Sidereal Astronomy, even in their widest exten-

sion, had manifested the existence of those forces only with which we are
familiar in our own solar system. The refinements of modern observation

and the perfection of theoretical representation, had assured us that the
orbits in which the double stars, immeasurably distant from us, revolve
around each other, are governed by the same laws of molecular attraction which
determine the orbits of the planetary bodies of our own solar system. But
the NebulfK have revealed to us the probable existence in the yet more distant
universe, of forces with which we were previously wholly unacquainted. The
highest authorities in this most advanced of all the sciences, acknowledge
themselves unable even to conjecture the nature of the forces which have
produced and maintain the diverse, yet obviously systematic arrangement of
the hosts of stars which constitute those few of the Spiral Nebulae which
have been hitherto examined. Hence the importance of increasing our
knowledge of the variety of forms in which the phaenomena present them-
selves, by a similar examination of the Southern Heavens to that which Lord
Rosse is accomplishing in the Northern Heavens ; hence also, we may believe,
in great measure, the devotion with which his Lordship has directed the un-
precedented instrumental power which he has created almost exclusively to
the observation of nebulas. But whilst we cannot but admire the steadiness
of purpose with which an object regarded as of paramount importance is un-
deviatingly pursued, we can scarcely forbear to covet at least an occasional
glance at bodies which from their greater proximity have more intimate
relations with ourselves, and which, when viewed with so vast an increase of
optical power, may afford instruction of the highest value in many branches
of physical science. In our own satellite, for example, we have the opportu-
nity of studying the physical conformation and superficial phsenomena of a
body composed, as we believe mainly at least, of the same materials as those

of our own globe, but possessing neither atmosphere nor sea. When we re-
flect how much of the surface of the earth consists of sedimentary deposits,
and consequently how large a portion of the whole field of geological research

is occupied with strata which owe their principal characteristics to the ocean
in which they were deposited, we cannot but anticipate many instructive
lessons which may be furnished by the points of contrast, as well as of resem-
blance, which the surface of the moon, viewed through Lord Rosse's telescope,
may present to the best judgement we are able to form of what the appearance
 of the earth would be if similarly viewed, or with what may be more difficult

--perhaps to imagine, what we may suppose the earth would appear if it

 could be stript of its sedimentary strata, which conceal from us for the most

part the traces of that internal action which has played so large a part iu

moulding the great outlines of tlio present configuration of its surface. It is

understood that Lord Rosse himself participates in the wish that such an
examination of the surface of the moon should be made, and, should the

desire of the Association be expressed to that effect, is willing to undertake

it in conjunction witli one or two other gentlemen possessing the necessary

physical and geological knowledge. It will be for the Members of the As-

sociation to determine the form in which a Report on the " Physical Features

of the Moon compared with those of the Earth " may most appropriately be

requested.

In connection with Astronomy, I permit myself to notice the publica-

tion, now in progress, of two works of considerable magnitude and value,

because they do honour to the science and public spirit of the part of the
United Kingdom in which we are assembled ; I refer to the Markree

Catalogue of Ecliptic Stars, and to the results of the Observations at the

Armagh Observatory. The establishments from which these publications

emanate belong to the class which owe their endowment and support to

private munificence, but by the extent and character of the work they per-

form entitle themselves to rank with the Institutions, which in this and

other countries testify the liberality of a nation's patronage. The Markree

Observatory, which has already distinguished itself under the personal

superintendence of its founder, amongst other services by the discovery

of one of the thirteen planets by which our knowledge of the solar do-

--main has been enriched in the last seventeen years, will hereafter take

its position amongst the establishments which have most largely contributed

to the perfection of modern astronomy by its catalogue of the appi-oximate

places of all the stars in the ecliptic down to the twelfth magnitude inclusive

by which catalogue the detection of any still undiscovered planetary bodies

belonging to our system will be greatly facilitated. One volume has already

been published in the year which has elapsed since our Ipswich Meeting, and

a second is in preparation, and both, by the aid of funds supplied from the
annual grant now placed at the disposal of the Royal Society, to be applied

in the advancement of science. Tlie publication of the results of the ob-

servations of the Armagh Observatory, since it has been under the very able

direction of Dr. Robinson, has been for some time a desideratum. At the
instance of the Royal Irish Academy it was recommended by the Irish
Executive, but without success. It is now being accomplished by aid
from the same source as the Markree Catalogue. I have the more satis-

faction in noticing these appropriations in favour of Irish science from funds

designed for the general benefit of the United Kingdom, because they indicate

the fairness and equality with which the distribution of those funds is ad-

ministered : it is also I believe strictly in character with the prevailing

principles which sanction public aid, that it should be given, when needed, to

those who, as in the case of these private observatories, have already largely

contributed from their own resources.

The Mathematical and Physical Theories of Light have afforded subjects

for many interesting and profitable discussions in Section A, and have usually

had one day in the six specially allotted to them. Those discussions will

derive a more than usual interest at this meeting from the remarkable dis-

covery recently made by Prof. Stokes, that under certain circumstances a

change is effected in the refrangibility of light, and from the advantage we

possess in having amongst us on this occasion the eminent mathematician

and physicist by whom this most important contribution to the science of

physical optics has been made. His researches took their origin from an

unexplained phsenomenon discovered by Sir John Herschel and communicated

Aby him to the Royal Society in 1845.  solution of sulphate of quinine exa-

mined by transmitted light, and held between the eye and the light, or

between the eye and a white object, appears almost as transparent and colour-

less as water ; but when viewed in certain aspects and under certain

incidences of light, exhibits an extremely vivid and beautiful celestial blue

colour. This colour was shown by Sir John Herschel to result from the

action of the strata which the light first penetrates on entering the liquid;

and the dispersion of light producing it was named by him epipolic disper-

sion, from the circumstance that it takes place near the surface by which the

Alight enters.  beam of light having passed through the solution was to all

appearance the same as before its entrance ; nevertheless it was found to have
undergone some mysterious modification, for an epipolised beam of light,

meaning thereby a beam which had once been transmitted through a quini-

ferous solution, and had experienced its dispersive action, is incapable of fur-

ther epipolic dispersion. In speculating upon the possible nature of epi-

polised lights Prof. Stokes was led to conclude that it could only be light

which had been deprived of certain invisible rays which in the process of

dispersion had changed their refrangibility and had thereby become visible.

The truth of this supposition, novel and surprising as it at first appeared, has

been confirmed by a series of simple and perfectly decisive experiments
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

showing that it is in fact the chemical rays of the spectrum more refrangible

than the violet, and invisible in themselves, which produce the blue superficial

light in the quiniferous solution. Professor Stokes has traced this principle

through a great I'ange of analogous phaenomena, including those noticed by

Sir David Brewster in his papers on " Internal Dispersion," and has distin-

guished between " cases of false internal dispersion" or "opalescence," in

which the luminous rays are simply reflected from fine particles held in me-

chanical solution in the medium, and those of " true internal dispersion," or

" fluorescence," as it is termed by Mr. Stokes. By suitable methods of ob-

servation the change of refrangibility was detected, as produced not only by

transparent fluids and solids, but also by opake substances ; and the class of
          :

ADDRESS.  Xlvii

media exhibiting " fluorescence" was found to be very large, consisting chiefly
of organic substances, but comprehending, though more rarely, some mineral
bodies. The direct application of the fact, as we now understand it, to many
highly interesting and important purposes, is obvious almost on the first an-
nouncement. The facility with which the highly refrangible invisible rays of

the spectrum may be rendered visible by being passed through a solution of
sulphate of quinine or other sensitive medium, affords peculiar advantages

for the study of those rays ; the fixed lines of the invisible part of the solar

spectrum may now be exhibited to our view at pleasure. The constancy
with which a particular mode of changing the refrangibility of light attaches

to a particular substance, exhibiting itself independently of the admixture
of other substances, supplies a new method of analysis for organic compounds

which may prove valuable in organic chemistry. These and other applica-
tions of the facts as they are now explained to us, will probably form subjects
of notice in the Chemical and Physical Sections, and a still higher interest
may be expected from the discussion of the principle itself, and of the founda-

tion on which it rests. A discovery of this nature cannot be otherwise than

extremely fertile in consequences, whether of direct application, or by giving
rise to suggestions branching out more and more widely, and leading to
trains of thought and experiment which may confer additional value on the
original discovery, by rendering it but the first step in a still more extensive

generalization.

   As the interest of this discovery is not confined to a single branch of

science, the Officers, with the approbation of the Local Cbmmittee, have
requested Mr. Stokes to favour the Association with an exposition of the
subject at an evening meeting, when the members of the different sections

may be able to attend without prejudice to their respective sectional duties

and in that view I have thought that this brief introductory notice might not
be misplaced, a notice which I cannot conclude without adverting to the

gratification which all who cultivate science in this part of the United
Kingdom must feel at the rising eminence of their highly accomplished

fellow-countryman.

   Among the subjects of chemical inquiry which may well deserve the

attention .of a combination of philosophers, perhaps few could more usefully
occupy their joint labours than the revision of the Equivalent Numbers of the
Elementary Bodies. This is a task which must necessarily require the co-
operation of several properly qualified individuals, if it be accomplished
within anything like a reasonable period of time. Most of the Numbers now
in use depend upon experiments performed by Berzelius, at a time when the
methods of research then known were inadequate, even in such hands, to
determine these constants with an accuracy sufficient for the wants of science
at the present day. So much has this been felt to be the case, that many
of the most accomplished chemists now living have undertaken extensive
and laborious, though isolated researches, upon the combining quantities of

                                                                        d2

some of the most important elements. But much more than has been already
performed still remains undone. Such a subject it is believed might be
 highly proper for consideration by the Chemical Section, to whose notice it
would be introduced by the distinguished chemist, Dr. Andrews, who pre-
sides over that Section, and than whom no one could be named as more
 competent to estimate the importance of such a revision, or to judge more
 truly of the qualifications that would be required for its execution.

   We are deprived by the illness, I tiust only temporary, of our valued asso-

 ciate Prof. James Forbes, of the Report he would have given us of the progress
 of the experiments which he has undertaken at the request of the Association
to test the Theory of Heat. But this branch of Physics abounds more
perhaps than any other at the present time in subjects which may be most
profitably discussed. The theory of Heat has made great advances within
the last ten years. Mr. Joule has by his experiments confirmed and illustrated

the views demonstrated about the end of the last century by Davy and Rum-
ford regarding the nature of heat, which are now beginning to find general
acceptance. He has determined with much accuracy, the numerical relation
between quantities of heat and of mechanical work. He has pointed out the

true principles upon which the mechanical value of any chemical change is
to be estimated, and by very careful experiments he has arrived at numerical
expressions for the mechanical equivalents in some of the most important
cases of chemical action, in galvanic batteries, and in combustion. These
researches appear to be laying the ground-work for the ultimate formation
of a Mechanical Theory of Chemistry, by ascertaining experimentally the
mechanical equivalents expressed in absolute motive force of the thermic,
electric and magnetic forces. Mathematical developments of the theories of
heat and electro-dynamics, in accordance with these principles, are given in

various papers by MM. Helmholz, Rankine, Clausius and Thomson, published

principally within the last two years. In discussing these subjects the Sec-
tion will have a great advantage in being presided over by the last-named of
these gentlemen, a native of Belfast, who at so early an age has attained so
high a reputation, and who is taking a leading part in tiie investigations
to which I have referred.

    In connexion with the subjects of Heat, I would advert to the experiments
in which Mr. Hopkins is engaged for investigating the possible influence of
high pressure on the temperature at which substances, in a state of fusion,

--solidify an inquiry which was shown by Mr. Hopkins, in a report recently

presented to the British Association, to have an important bearing on the
questions of the original and pi'esent state of the interior of the earth. It is
well known that the temperature of the earth increases as we descend, and
it has been calculated that at the rate at which the increase takes place in
such depths as are accessible to us, the heat at the depth of eighty or a hun-
dred miles would be such as to fuse most of the materials which form the

solid crust of the globe. On the hypothesis of original fluidity, and assuming
ADDRESS.  xlix

that the rate of increase known to us by observation continues further
clown, and is not counterbalanced by a considerable increase in the tempe-
rature of fusion occasioned by pressure, the present state of tlie earth would
be that of a solid crust of eighty or a hundred miles in thickness, enveloping
a fluid nucleus. Mr. Hopkins considers this state to be inconsistent witli the
observed amount of the precession of the equinoxes, and infers that if the
temperature of fusion be considerably heightened by pressure, the conclusion
must be unavoidable that the earth is solid at the centre. Mr. Hopkins is
assisted in these experiments, which are carried on at Manchester, by the
well-known engineering knowledge of Mr. Fairbairn, and the equally well-
known experimental skill of Mr. Joule. The principal difficulties attending
the experiments with substances of low temperatures of fusion have been
overcome, and strong hopes are entertained of success with substances of
more difficult fusibility. The pressures employed are from three to four
tons to eight and ten tons on the square inch. The latter is probably equal
to the pressure at several miles beneath the earth's surface.

   From Heat the transition Is easy, and by many may be deemed natural, to
Terrestrial Magnetism, a science which, more perhaps than any other, has
profited by the impulse and systematic direction communicated to it by the
British Association, and whicii perhaps more than any other required such

external aid. In the infancy of a science, the phsenoinetia of which present
on our first acquaintance with them a great appearance of complexity, the

path by which its progress may be advanced may be by no means easy to
discern ; and individual explorers may well, under such circumstances, be
discouraged by doubts whether their labour will be recompensed by pro-

portionate success, as well as disheartened by the little sympathy which is
usually given to investigations which hold out but little immediate prospect
of practical utility. Some there have been however from time to time, who,
impressed with a persuasion of the position which magnetism deserves to
take, and which sooner or later they believe it will take, amongst the phy-
sical sciences of the highest order, have not spared this precursive labour,
and have been uniformly conducted by it fo the same general conclusion,
viz. that in order to obtain a sufficient foundation of facts upon which to
raise a fitting superstructure of inductive reasoning, it would be necessary to

organize a system of cooperative research, in which the labours of many

might be united agreeably to concerted arrangements ; and that as such re-

searches would require to be carried on nearly at the same epoch at many

distant parts of tiie globe, for which private resources were inadequate, public
assistance must be sought. That this conclusion w'as extensively recognised
and acquiesced in is sufficiently attested by the readiness so f^jenerally mani-
fested by governments and individuals in all countries where mental cultivation
is regarded to take part in the general system of magnetic cooperation pro-
posed by this country in 1838. In the years which have since elapsed, the
energy and zeal of those who have engaged in these researches have accumu-

lated a mass of observations, which, as the fruit of systematic and concerted
labour, is, I believe, wholly unprecedented. The labour of digesting, com-
paring, and coordinating the body of facts thus obtained may certainly be
stated to be not less than that expended in obtaining them ; and as the one
process must necessarily be in great measure carried out subsequently to the

other, we are only now beginning to reap the first-fruits of this great co-
operative undertaking in the bearing of its results upon theory. At the

Ipswich meeting of the British Association, I was requested by the General
Committee to draw up a report on the state and progress of the magnetic
researches consequent on the application of the British Association to Her
Majesty's Government in 1838. I regret that, from the other very pressing
duties above alluded to, I have not been able to complete this report in time

to present at this meeting, but as I may assume, from the request just made

to me, that the subject retains with the British Association the interest which

it there so happily acquired, I may venture to avail myself of this opportunity
to make a very few remarks on some of its most important results ; confining
myself for the most part to results obtained by persons of our own country
as the direct and immediate consequences of the recommendation of the
 British Association, leaving to a more fitting occasion a more general and

 comprehensive view.

   We recognise in terrestrial magnetism the existence of a power present

 everywhere at the surface of our globe, and producing everywhere effects
 indicative of a systematic action ; but of the nature of this power, the cha-
racter of its laws, and its economy in creation, we have as yet scarcely any
 knowledge. The apparent complexity of the phsenomena at their first aspect

may reasonably be ascribed to our ignorance of their laws, which we shall
 doubtless find, as we advance in knowledge, to possess the same remarkable

 character of simplicity which calls forth our admiration in the laws of mole-
 cular attraction. It has been frequently surmised, and the anticipation is I
 believe a strictly philosophical one, that a power which, so far as we have the
 means of judging, prevails everywhere in our own planet, may also prevail
 in other bodies of our system, and might become sensible to us, in the case
 of the sun and moon particularly, by small perturbing influences mea-
 surable by our instruments, and indicating their respective sources by their
 periods and their epochs. As yet we know of neither argument nor fact to
 invalidate this anticipation ; but, on the contrary, much to invest it with
 a high degree of probability. Be this however as it may, we have in our
 own planet an exemplification of the phaenomena which magnetism pre-
 sents in one of the bodies of our system, on a scale of sufficient mag-
 nitude, and otherwise convenient for our study. Accordingly the first
 object to which the British Association gave its attention was to ob-
 tain a correct knowledge of the direction and amount of the magnetic
 force generally over the whole surface of the globe corresponding to a
 definite epoch. It has been customary to represent the results of magnetic
ADDRESS.  li

observations by three systems of Lines, usually called isogonic, isoclinal,
and isodynamic lines. [Lines of equal horizontal direction, of equal
inclination, and of equal force.] In the maps of these lines existing
in 1838, large spaces of the earth's surface were either blank, or the lines
passing across them were very imperfectly supported by observations. In
the more frequented parts, where observations were more numerous, the dis-
crepancies of their dates impaired their suitability for combination ; for the
position and configuration of the magnetic lines has been found to undergo
a continual process of systematic change, with the causes of which we are as
yet wholly unacquainted, but which has obtained the name of secular change
to distinguish it from periodical variations of known and limited duration.
Amongst the most marked deficiencies in these maps, were the greater part

--of the extra-tropical portion of the southern hemisphere, the British pos-

--sessions in North America, and British India; magnetic surveys of these

were expressly recommended, and the practicability and advantage of
making the observations on board-ship, and of thus extending them over the
surface of the ocean, were pointed out. It is most pleasing to recall to recol-
lection, and gratifying to acknowledge from this chair, the favourable manner
in which the recommendations of the British Association were received by

Her Majesty's Government and by the East India Company, and how
promptly and eflFectually they have been carried out. The blanks in the

southern hemisphere have been filled up by maritime expeditions appointed
expressly for the purpose. Magnetic surveys have been completed of
British North America at the expense of our own Government, and of the
Indian Archipelago at that of the East India Company, and India itself is
now in progress ; whilst from the zeal of our naval officers contributions
have flowed in from almost every accessible part of the ocean. The coordi-
nation and mutual connection of so large a mass of materials is necessarily a
work of time, but is progressing steadily towards completion, and when pre-
sented in one connected view,will form the groundwork on which will securely
rest a general theory of terrestrial magnetism corresponding to the present
epoch. Until these combinations and calculations are performed, it would be

obviously premature to speak of numerical values by which the magnetic
forces at one part of the globe may be compared with those of another, or

with forces of other descriptions ; and for the same reason it is desirable

to abstain for the present from notices of the geographical positions which

particular lines, or as some may deem them, critical points in the magnetic
resultants may occupy on the earth's surface at the present epoch. Such
notices could only be as yet provisional and liable to the amendments which
more exact and extended calculation must be expected to produce. But
thus much may be safely stated in reference to the general character of the
three systems of lines which have been spoken of, that when derived afresh

and exclusively from the observations of the last few years, they do most

fully confirm the general conclusions derived from the observations of earlier
                                                                       --

date, which were submitted to tlie British Association in the Report on the
" Variations of the Intensity of the Magnetic Force at different points of

the Earth's surface," which preceded the recommendations of 1838. The

magnetic phaenomena, or as it is now customary to call them, the three mag-

netic elements, appear to be everywhere and in both hemispheres the

resultants of a duplicate system of magnetic forces, of which one at least

undergoes a continuous and progressive translation in geographical space,

the motion being from west to east in the northern hemisphere, and from

east to west in tiie southern. It is to this motion that the secular change in

all localities is chiefly if not entirely due, affecting systematically and ac-

cording to their relative positions on the globe, the configurations and geo-

graphical positions of the magnetic lines, and producing conformable

changes in the direction and amount of the magnetic elements in every

part of the globe. The comparison of the earlier recorded observations

with those of the present epoch gives reason to believe, that viewed in its

generality, the motion of the system of forces wliich produces the secular

change has been uniform, or nearly so, in the last two or three centuries.

Under favourable conditions the regularity of this movement can be traced

down to comparatively very minute fractions of time ; by the results of

careful observations continued for several years at the observatory of St.

Helena, where, in common with the greater part of the district of the South

Atlantic, the secular change of the declination exceeds eight minutes in the

year, and from its magnitude therefore may be advantageously studied,

every fortnight of the year is found to have its precise aliquot portion of the

annual amount of the secular change at the station. This phaenomenon of

secular change is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable features of the

magnetic system, and cannot with propriety be overlooked, as too frequently it

has been, by tliose who would connect the phaenomena of terrestrial magnetism

generally, mediately or immediately, with climatic circumstances, relations of

land and sea, or other causes to which we are assuredly in no degree entitled
to ascribe secular variation, and who reason therefore as if the great magnetic

phaenomena of the earth were persistent instead of being as they are subject

to a continual and progressive change. It may confidently be affirmed that

the secular magnetic variation has no analogy with, or resemblance to, any

Weother physical phaenomenon with which we are acquainted.  appear at

present to be without any clue to guide us to its physical causes, but the way

is preparing for a future secure derivation of its luivs to be obtained by a

repetition, after a sufficient interval, of the steps which we are now taking to

determine the elements corresponding to a definite epoch.

The periodical variations in the terrestrial magnetic force, which I have

before adverted to as distinguished from its secular change, are small in com-

parison with the force itself, but they are highly deserving of attention on

account of the probability that by suitable methods of investigation they

may be made to reveal the sources to which they owe their origin and the
             ADDRESS.                                     liii

agency by which they are produced. They formed accordingly the subject

of a distinct recommendation from the British Association, which met with
an equally favourable reception. To investigate these variations by suitable

instruments and methods, to separate each from the others, and to seek its

period, its epochs of maximum and minimum, the laws of its progression, and

its mean numerical value or amount, constituted the chief purposes for which

magnetic observatories wei*e established for limited periods at certain stations

in Her Majesty's dominions, selected in the view that by a combination of

the results obtained at them, a general theory of each at least of the principal

periodical variations might be derived, and tests be thus supplied whereby

the truth of physical theories propounded for their explanation might be

Weexamined.  are just beginning to profit by the collocation and study of

the great body of facts which have been collected. Variations corresponding

in period to the earth's revolution around the sun, and to its rotation around

its own axis, have been ascertained to exist, and their numerical values ap-

proximately determined in each of the three elements, the Declination, In-

Weclination, and Magnetic Force.  unhesitatingly refer these variations to

the sun as their primari/ source, since we find that in whatever part of the

globe the phsenomena are observed, the solstices and equinoxes are the cri-

tical epochs of the variation whose period is a year, whilst the diurnal varia-

tion follows in all meridians nearly the same law of local solar hours. To

these unquestionable evidences of solar influence in the magnetic aflPections

of the earth, we have now to add the recently ascertained fact, tliat the mag-

netic storms, or disturbances, which in the absence of more correct know-

ledge were supposed to be wholly irregular in their occurrence, are strictly

periodical phajnomena, conforming with systematic regularity to laws in which

the influence of local solar hours is distinctly traced.

But, whilst we recognise the sun as the primary cause of variations whose

periods attest the source from whence they derive their origin, the mode or

modes in which the effects are produced constitute a question which has been
and may still be open to a variety of opinions : the direct action of the sun

as being itself a magnet, its calorific agency occasioning thermo-electric

and galvanic currents, or in alternately exalting and depressing the magnetic

condition of substances near the surface of the earth, or in one of the consti-

--tuents of its atmosphere, have been severally adduced as hypotheses afford-

ing plausible explanations. Of each and all such hypotheses the facts are the

only true criterion ; but it is right tiiat we should bear in mind that in the pre-
sent state of our knowledge, the evidence which may give a decided counte-

nance to one hypothesis in preference to others does not preclude their possible

coexistence. The analysis of the collected materials and the disentanglement

of the various effects which are comprehended in them, are far from being yet
complete. The correspondence of the critical epochs of the annual variation

with the solstices and equinoxes rather than with the epochs of maximum
and minimum temperature, which at the surface of the earth, in the subsoil

beneath the surface, or in the atmosphere above the surface, are separated
by a wide interval from the solstitial epochs, appears to favour the hypothesis
of a direct action ; as does also the remarkable fact which has been established,
that the magnetic force is greater in both the northern and southern hemi-
spheres in the months of December, January, and February, when the sun
is nearest to the earth, than in those of May, June, and July, when he is
most distant from it: whereas if the effects were due to temperature, the two
hemispheres shoidd be oppositely instead of similarly affected in each of the
two periods referred to. Still there are doubtless minor periodical irregular
variations yet to be made out by suitable analytical processes, which, by

their possible accordance with the epochs of maximum and minimum
temperature, may support in a more limited sense, not as a sole but as

a coordinate cause, the hypothesis of calorific agency so generally received,
and so ably advocated of late in connection with the discovery by our great
chemist and philosopher of the magnetic properties of oxygen and of the
manner in which they are modified and affected by differences of temperature.

It may indeed be difficult to suppose that the magnetic phenomena which

M'e measure at the surface of the globe, should not be in any degree influ-
enced by the variations in the magnetic conditions of the oxygen of the
atmosphere in different seasons and at different hours of the day and night
but whether that influence be sensible or not, whether it be appreciable by
our instruments or inappreciable by them, is a question M'hich yet remains
for solution by the more minute sifting of the accumulated facts which are

now undergoing examination in so many quarters.
   To justify the anticipation that conclusions of the most striking character,

and wholly unforeseen, may yet be derivable from the materials in our
possession, we need only to recall the experience of the last few months,
which have brought to our knowledge the existence of what may possibly

prove the most instructive, as it is certainly at first sight the least explicable,

of all the periodical magnetic variations with which we have become ac-

quainted. I refer to the concurrent testimony which observations at parts
of the globe the most distant from each other bear to the existence of a
periodical variation or inequality, affecting alike the magnitude of the diurnal
variations^ and the magnitude and frequency of the disturbances or storms.
The cycle or period of this inequality appears to extend to about ten of our

years ; the maximum and minimum of the magnitudes affected by it being
separated by an interval of about five years, and the differences being much

too great, and resting on an induction far too extensive, to admit of uncer-
tainty as to the facts themselves. The existence of a well-marked magnetic
period which has certainly no counterpart in thermic conditions, appears to
render still more doubtful the supposed connexion between the magnetic and
calorific influences of the sun. It is not a little remarkable that this periodical
magnetic variation is found to be identical in period and in epochs of maxima
and minima with the periodical variation in the frequency and magnitude of

                                                                                     ll

the solar spots which M. Schwabe has established by twenty-six years of
unremitting labour. From a cosmical connexion of this nature, supposing it
to be finally established, it would follow, that the decennial period which
we measure by our magnetic instruments is, in fact, a solar period, mani-
fested to us also by the alternately increasing and decreasing frequency and
magnitude of obscurations on the surface of the solar disc. May we not

have in these phsenomena the indication of a cycle or period of secular
change in the magnetism of the sun, affecting visibly his gaseous atmosphere
or photosphere, and sensibly modifying the magnetic influence which he

exui cises on the surface of our earth ?

   The determination of the figure and dimensions of the globe which we

inhabit may justly be regarded as possessing a very high degree of scientific

interest and value, and the measurements necessary for a correct knoM'ledge

thereof, have long been looked upon as proper subjects for public underta-

kings and as highly honourable to the nations which have taken part in them.

Inquiries in which I was formerly engaged led me fully to concur with a

remark of Laplace, to the efiect that it is extremely probable that the first

attempts were made at a period much anterior to those of which history has
preserved the record; the relation which many measures of the most remote

antiquity have to each other and to the terrestrial circumference strengthens

this conjecture, and seems to indicate, not only that the earth's circumference

was known with a great degree of accuracy at an extremely ancient period, but

that it has served as the base of a complete system of measures the vestiges of
which have been found in Egypt and Asia. In modern times the mei-it of re-

suming these investigations belongs to the French nation, by whom the arc of

the meridian between Formentera and Dunkirk was measured towards the close
of the last century. The Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain, commenced

in 1783, for the specific object of connecting the Observatories of Greenwich

and Paris, was speedily expanded by the able men to whom its direction was

then confided into an undertaking of far greater scientific as well as topo-

graphical importance, having for its objects on the one hand the formation

of correct maps of Great Britain, and on the other the measurement of an

arc of the meridian, having the extreme northern and southern points of the

AIsland for its terminations.  portion of this arc, amounting to 2° 50', viz.

from Dunnose in the Isle of Wight to Clifton in Yorkshire, was published in

the Phil. Trans, in 18C3. As the whole arc, extending from Dunnose to

Unst and Balta, the most northern of the Shetland Islands, would comprise

more than 10°, and as nearly half a century had elapsed since the publication

of the earlier part of the Survey, it is not surprising that some degree of impa-

tience should have been felt, both by those who desired the results for scientific

use, and by those who were interested for the scientific character of the nation,

that the general results of the Survey applicable to scientific purposes should

at length be given to the world. Accordingly, at the Birmingham Meeting

of the British Association in 1849, a Resolution was passed appointing a
--Ivi REPORT 1852.

deputation to confer with the Master-General of" the Ordnance, and a similar
resolution was passed about the same time by the President and Council of

the Royal Society. On communicating with the Master-General, it appeared

that the want of special funds for the requisite calculations formed the only
obstacle, a difficulty which was happily immediately surmounted by an appli-
cation of the President and Council of the Royal Society to Lord John
Russell, then First Lord of the Treasury. The Report of the Council of the
British Association to the General Committee at the Meeting of the last year at
Ipswich, contained an official statement from the Inspector- General of Forti-
fications of the progress of the reduction and examination of the observations
preparatory to the desired publication, and concluded with expressing the
expectation of the Director of the Survey, that he " should be able to furnish
for communication to the British Association that would probably assemble
in 1852, the principal results obtainable from the geodetic operations in

Great Britain and Ireland." By a recent letter to my predecessor from
Captain YoUand of the Royal Engineers, who is entrusted with the direction
of the publication, I am enabled to have the pleasure of announcing that the
"printing of the observations made with the Zenith Sector, for the determi-

nation of the latitudes of stations between the years 1842 and 1850, is
finished, and will be presented in time for the meeting of the British Asso-
ciation, and that the calculations connected Avith the triangulation are
rapidly advancing towards their completion."

   In the meantime the great arc of Eastern Europe has been advancing
with unexampled rapidity and to an extent hitherto unparalleled. Originating
in topographical surveys in Esthonia and Livonia, and commenced in 1816,
the operations, both geodesical and astronomical, have been completed be-
tween Izmail on the Danube and Fugleness in Finnmarkeu, an extent of 25J
meridional degrees. Next to this in extent is the Indian arc of 21° 21' be-
tween Cape Comorin and Kaliana ; and the third is the French arc already
referred to of 12° 22'. It appears by a note presented to the Imperial
Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburgh by M. Struve, that a provisional
calculation has been made of a large part of the great arc of Eastern Europe,
and that it has been found to indicate for the figure of the earth a greater
compression than that derived by Bessel in 1837 and IS^l, from all the arcs

--then at his conmiand, Bessel's compression having also been greater than La-

place's previous deduction. It is naturally with great pleasure that I perceive

that the figure of the earth derived by means of the measurement of arcs of
the meridian approxiniates more and more nearly, as the arcs are extended
in dimension, to the compression which I published in 1825 as the result of
a series of Pendulum Experiments, which, by the means placed by Govern-

ment at my disposal, I was enabled to make from the equator to within ten

degrees of the pole, thus giving to that method its greatest practicable ex-

tension.

   The observations hitherto made on the tides of the ocean have been insuf-
ADDRESS.  Ivii

 ficient to furnish such a connected knowledge of the subject as would enable
 us to follow the coui'se of the tide over any considerable portion of the ocean,
 and in the opinion of persons most competent to judge, it is only by systematic
 observations specially directed for the purpose, that this connected knowledge
is likely to be obtained. Accordingly a resolution was passed at the Ipswich
 Meeting of the Association, appointing a Committee to prepare a Memorial
to Her Majesty's Government, representing the importance of determining
the progress of the tide wave along the coasts of Africa and South America
by an Atlantic Tidal Expedition. This Memorial was presented to Govern-

ment by my predecessor, and, having been referred to the Hydrographer, has
been most favourably reported upon. We may therefore expect that the

survey will be very shortly commenced. The recent researches of Captain
Beechey, which have given a new and unexpected view of the tidal movements
of the ocean, show how much yet remains to be learnt respecting the tides

even for the practical purposes of navigation.

   The facts derived a few years since from the barometrical observations at
St. Helena, showing the existence of a lunar atmospheric tide, have been
corroborated in the last year by a similar conclusion, drawn by Captain Elliot
of the Madras Engineers from the barometrical observations at Singapore.
The influence of the moon's attraction on the atmosphere produces, as
might be expected, a somewhat greater effect on the barometer at Singapore,
in lat. 1° 19', than at St. Helena, in lat. 15° 57'. The barometer at the
equator appears to stand on the average about 0"006 in. (more precisely
0'0057, in lat. 1° 19') higher at the moon's culminations than when she is
six hours distant from the meridian.

   We have received from our valued corresponding member Prof. Dove, for

presentation to this Meeting, an important continuation of his researches on
the temperatures at the surface of the globe. In former communications he
has furnished us with maps showing, so far as observation permits, the

isothermals of the whole globe in every month of the year. He has now

given us, first, the norynal temperatures of each parallel of latitude in each
month ; being the average of all the temperatures in that parallel in such
month ; and second, the abnormal temperatures, or the difference between the

temperature of each place and the mean temperature of its parallel. From
these again are formed lines of abnormal temperature for each month, sur-
rounding and marking out those districts or localities, which, from peculiarities

of the surface or other causes affecting the distribution of heat, are charac-

terized by excessive abnormal heat or abnormal cold. The importance of
these researches on the general theory of the causes which interfere with the

equable distribution of heat according to latitude is obvious.

   The activity which has prevailed so greatly of late, in the collection
of meteorological data, has been almost exclusively confined to that portion
of the surface of the globe which is occupied by land, although the portion

covered by the ocean is not only much greater in extent, but is also better
suited for the solution of several meteorological problems. Many striking
examples might be adduced to show that it is " systematic direction," and
not " individual zeal " in naval men, which has been wanting, and it has been

therefore with great satisfaction that meteorologists have learnt that a pro-
position has recently been made from the United States Government to the

British Government, to undertake, conjointly and in cooperation, a system

of meteorological observations, to be made -at sea in all ships belonging to

the naval service of the two countries, and sufficiently simple to be parti-

cipated in by the merchant service also. In a partial trial which has been
already made of this system in the United States, it has been found to produce

results which, exclusive of their scientific bearing, are of great importance to

the interests of navigation and commerce, in materially shortening passages

by the knowledge of prevailing winds and currents at particular seasons.

The practical advantages arising from the coordination of the observa-

tions in the Hydrographic Office of the United States, and of the circu-

lation of the charts of the Avinds and currents, and of the sailing direc-

tions founded on them, have been such and so appreciated, that there

are now, as it is stated, more than 1000 masters of American ships en-

gaged in making them. The request for British cooperation in an un-

dertaking so honourable to the country in which it originated, was referred

in the spring of this year by the Earl of Malmesbury to the President and

Council of the Royal Society for a Report ; from which I permit myself to

quote the concluding sentence, in the persuasion that it would find an echo,

if necessary, in every part of the United Kingdom, and that it cannot fail to

be promptly acted upon by the Government of a country in which

--maritime interests hold so prominent a place : " To the Government of

this country the demand for cooperation and for the interchange of obser-

vations is most earnestly addressed by the Government of the United

States ; and the President and Council of the Royal Society express their

in our packet service, and in our vast commercial navy, better means for

making such observations, and a greater interest in the results to which they

lead, than any other nation ; for this purpose every ship which is under the

control of the Admiralty, should be furnished with instruments properly con-

structed and compared, and with instructions for using them ; similar in-

structions for making and recording observations, as far as their means will

allow, should be given to every ship that sails, with a request that they will

transmit the results to the Hydrographer's Office of the Admiralty,

where an adequate staff" of Officers or others should be provided for their

prompt examination, and the publication of the improved charts and sailing

directions to which they would lead ; above all, it seems desirable to establish

a prompt communication with the Hydrographer's Office of the United States,
ADDRESS.  lix

 SO that the united labours of the two greatest naval and commercial nations
of the world may be combined, with the least practicable delay, in promoting

 the interests of navigation."

    Amongst the most valuable results which the Physical Sciences may expect
to obtain from this extensive system of nautical observation, we may reckon

 the construction of charts of the isothermals of the surface of the ocean cor-
responding to every month in the year, similar to Dove's monthly isothermals
of the temperature of the air ; and a knowledge of the normal condition as
well as the abnormal variations, with their special causes and effects, of the

great Gulf-stream which connects the shores of the Old and New World,
and in its normal effects is influential in many ways on the climate of the

United States and Western Europe, whilst its abnormal effects are principally
known, so far as we are yet aware, by the peculiarities of climate they
occasionally produce on the European side of the Atlantic. Of the extent,
depth, and limits of this remarkable current in ordinary and extraordinary
years we are as yet very imperfectly informed. Of the zoology of the great
tracts of ocean which are covered by its banksof seaweed, we know nothing
beyond the fact that they are the habitation of a countless number of oceanic

--animals, giving rise possibly to deposits which may have distinctive

characters from littoral deposits or from those of marine estuaries. But
doubtless, we can now estimate only a very small part of the advantages
'(Vhich Terrestrial Physics as well as Hydrography and Navigation would
derive from the concurrent exertions of the two great maritime nations in
the way that has been pointed out.

    The analogy of the configuration of the land and sea on the north of the
Continents of Asia and America, has for some time past caused an opinion
to be entertained that the sea on the north of the Parry Islands might be as
open as it is known to be throughout the year in the same latitude on the
north of the Siberian Islands. The expectation that Wellington Strait might,
as the continuation of Barrow's Strait, prove a channel of communication
from the Atlantic into that part of the Polar Ocean, has been considerably
strengthened in the last year by the discoveries which we owe to the hardi-
hood and intrepidity of our merchant seamen. The access to the Polar
Ocean, and the degree in which it may be navigable for purposes of dis-
covery or of scientific research, are amongst the few geographical problems
of high interest which remain to be solved ; and we may confidently look
for a solution, in the direction at least that has been adverted to, by the
Expedition which has been despatched under Sir Edward Belcher to follow
up the discovered traces of Sir John Franklin's vessels.

   The success which the Kew Observatory Committee have had in their un-

dertaking to make Standard Thermometers, encourages us to hope that they
will be equally successful in the endeavour in which they are now engaged

to introduce a greater degree of precision in the construction of meteorological
instruments generally, as well as in the more delicate kinds which are so fre-

quently required in phj'sical experiments. An establishment has long been

a desideratum in whicli instruments for various physical researches employed
in foreign countries should be tried in comparison with the instruments used
here, and the relaitive merits of each examined, and in which new and pro-
mising inventions and suggestions should receive a practical trial. Amongst
its other services rendered to Science and to the country, the British Associa-
tion is now entitled to claim the merit of having organized an establishment
M'hich appears extremely well-suited to supply this deficiency, and needs only
more extensive means to supply it to any required extent. The applications

which have been made to Kew in the past year by Profs. Forbes and Thomson

for thermometers of particular kinds, required in very delicate experiments in
which those gentlemen are engaged, and by the Admiralty for Standard Thei'-
mometers for very low temperatures to be employed by the Arctic Expeditions,
show that the advantages to be derived from such an establishment are already

beginning to be recognised ; and as these become more known and felt, it may
confidently be anticipated that means will not be wanting for such an exten-
sion of the establishment at Kew, as may be necessary to meet fully the
public requirements. The desire which is so frequently manifested by

voyagers and travellers in distant countries to contribute to our knowledge
of terrestrial physics, would be greatly aided by increased facilities afforded
to them of obtaining suitable and well-assured instruments, and still more if
practical instruction or advice could be added. It is not from deficiency of
interest, or of a desire to be useful in such inquiries, that our British travellers
do not reap the full advantages of the great opportunities which they possess,
so much as from the absence of any provision for supplying instruments on
which reliance can be placed with practical instructions for their use. In no
department is the " systematic direction," which it is the object of the British
Association to communicate to the sciences generally, more needed than in

Physical Geography. To carry this desirable purpose into effect, might with
great propriety and public benefit be made to form a branch of the duties of
the Kew Observatory.

   In compliance with a resolution of the Council, the Kew Committee have

made arrangements for four aeronautic ascents in the Nassau Balloon, chiefly
for the purpose of investigating the laws of the decrement of temperature
and of aqueous vapour in ascending into the atmosphere. The two first of
these ascents took place on the 17th and 26th of August, attaining in each
case between 19,000 and 20,000 feet, and will be the subject of a commu-
nication to the Association, which will doubtless excite much interest, from

Mr. Welsh of the Kew Observatory, who was charged by the Superintend-

ing Committee with the conduct of the observations.
   The opportunity which the Observatory furnishes to the Association, of a

convenient locality, presenting many facilities for carrying on a series of
delicate experiments, has been taken advantage of by Professor Stokes for
experiments in which he is engaged on the Index of Friction in different
                         ADDRESS.                                       Ixi

Gases. Experiments reported by myself to the Royal Society in 1829,

showed that the retardation of a pendulum vibrating in different gases

was not proportionate to their respective densities, but appeared to depend

also on some inherent quality, whereby the different gases present different

degrees of resistance to the motion of bodies passing through them. I was

interrupted in the prosecution of this subject by a recall to military duty, and

I now rejoice to see it in hands so far more able to do it justice.

The Parliamentary Committee appointed at the Ipswich meeting to watch

over the interests of Science, consisting of Members of the British Asso-
ciation who are also Members of the Legislature, have this morning made

their first Report to the General Committee, and some notice of the subjects

which have chiefly occupied them in the past year may not be unacceptable
to the Members of the Association at large. One of these subjects is that of

Scientific Pensions. It is known to all that since the commencement of the

reign of Her present Majesty pensions to the amount of £1200 have been at

the disposal of the First Minister of the Crown, to be granted each year in

recompense of civil services, chiefly, though not exclusively, in literature and

science, and that several persons of various degrees of literary and scientific

eminence have received pensions accordingly, many of which have given

much public satisfaction. On examining the appropriations which have

been made in the fourteen years since this fund became available, it appeared

that only about thirteen per cent., or an eighth part of the whole amount, had

been allotted to scientific pensions. Considering this (o be a proper subject

to be brouglit under the notice of Government, Lord Wrottesley, the Chair-
man, and Sir R. H. Inglis, one of the Members of the Committee, obtained

an interview with the Earl of Derby for that purpose. The readiness of

Government to attend to such representations has been fully shown in the

scientific pensions granted in the present year, amounting to nearly a third

of the whole sum available for the year. These pensions have been granted,

--on the recommendation of the President of the Royal Society, to Mr.

Hind, who has the unique distinction of being the discoverer of no less than

--six out of the twenty-five known planets of the solar system,- to Dr.

--Mantell, so well known for his successful researches in palaeontology, and

to Mr. Ronalds, for the electrical and kindred researches in which he has
been engaged for so many years. The intimate association of the scientific
services of Mr. Ronalds for several years past with the Observatory of the

British Association at Kew, must render this last selection peculiarly gra-

tifying to our Members.

Another subject which has occupied the attention of the Parliamentary

Committee in the last year, is one to which their attention was requested by

the Council of the Association, with a view of carrying into effect the desire

of the General Committee for a more cheap and rapid international commu-
nication of scientific publications. The credit of the first move towards the

accomplishment of this desirable object is due to the Government of the

1852.                                                                e

United States, by whom an arrangement was made for the admission duty

free of all scientific books addressed as presents from foreign countries to all
institutions and individuals cultivating science in that country, such books

being sent through the Smithsonian Institution, by whom their further dis-

tribution to their respective destinations was undertaken. This arrangement
was notified to our Government through the British Minister at Washington,
and a similar privilege was at the same time requested for the admission
duty free into England of books sent as presents from the United States to
public institutions and individuals cultivating science in this country, under
such regulations as might appear most fitting. This proposition gave rise to
communications between the President of the Royal Society and the Chair-

man of the Parliamentary Committee on the one part, and the Treasury and
the principal Commissioner of Customs on the other ; the result of which
has been the concession of the privilege of admission, duty free, into England

of scientific books from all countries, designed as presents to institutions and
individuals named in lists to be prepared from time to time by the Royal So-
ciety, after communication with other scientific societies recognized by charter,
under the regulation, however, that the books are to be imported in cases
addressed to and passing through the Royal Society. This arrangement has
come into operation ; and it may be interesting to notice, as giving some
idea of its extensive bearing, that the first arrival from the United
States which has taken place under these regulations consists of packages
weighing in all no less than three tons. There is another branch of the
same subject which is more difficult to arrange, viz. the international com-
munication hy post of scientific pamphlets and papers at reduced rates of
postage ; the Parliamentary Committee have directed their attention to this
part of the subject also, and I earnestly hope that their exertions will be

successful.

   Allusions have been made by influential men, and in influential places, to
a direct representation of Science in Parliament ; and we frequently hear
opinions expressed that Parliament might be improved by a greater admix-
ture of men who might be chosen as the representatives of the intellectual
cultivation of the nation, amongst those who represent its material interests.
The benefit which the Legislature might derive from a change of this descrip-
tion, is a question rather for statesmen than for men of science, and would
be quite unsuitable for discussion here : but in respect to the influence which
such change would exercise on Science itself and on its cultivators, it does
belong to us to consider both its probable advantages and disadvantages. I

have no hesitation in expressing as an individual opinion, my belief that the

possible gain would be incalculably outweighed by the too certain evils ; and
that scientific men cannot too highly value and desire to retain the advantage
they now possess in the undisturbed enjoyment of their own pursuits un-
troubled by the excitements and distractions of political life. Some there
are amongst us, and some there ever have been, who, born to a station which

brings with it public duties, but gifted with a strong natural taste for the

pursuits of science, do manage to succeed in a greater or less degree in com-

bining both. Success is in such cases the more honourable, and is the more

admired, because it manifests the strength of the original disposition, and in-

dicates how much more might probably have been accomplished by an

undivided attention. The economy of human labour points specially to such

men as the most suitable representatives of science in the legislature of which

they already form a part. The selection from amongst them of a certain

number to be particularly charged with the duties of watching over and pro-

moting the interests of science, either with Government or in the Legislature

Weappears in this view a most happy expedient.                           cannot read over the

names of the noblemen and gentlemen who form the Parliamentary Committee

of the British Association, without being satisfied that science would not be

likely to be more honourably or more ably represented by any system of
direct representation ; nor can we look to the discretion and practical wisdom

with which the proceedings of the Committee have been conducted in the

first year of its existence, without being impressed with the belief that it is

destined to render important services both to the country and to ourselves. "

Gentlemen, I have now occupied fully as much of your time and attention

as I can venture to trespass upon, and yet have found it impossible to com-

prehend within the limits of a discourse all the topics to which I would gladly

have called your notice, even in those branches of knowledge in which I

may consider myself least uninformed, in three of the seven departments

into which our science is divided. I have left wholly untouched those wide

fields of Geology and Natural History, which would of themselves have

furnished fitting subjects for an address of still longer duration. No one can

be more sensible of this, and of many other imperfections and deficiencies,

than  the  individual  who  addresses  you                  yet,  if he  has not wholly failed  in

--the purpose he designed if the impression which he has endeavoured to

convey, however faint may be the image, be true to that which it is intended

British Science in the full career of energetic action and advancement, press-

ing forward in every direction to fill the full measure of the sphere of its
activity in the domain of intellectual culture; regardful on the one hand of

the minutest details in the patient examination of natural facts, and on the

ERRATA IN MR. MALLET'S SECOND REPORT ON EARTHQUAKES,

    Since the printing of the preceding Report the following errata have been
discovered :

               In page 288, line 5 from bottom, /or 0"-014206 read 0"-014286.
                            289, line 14, /or 0"-013910 read O'H) 13903.
                                     Iine30,/or0"-41743reac;0"-4l726.
                                   hue 31, /or 0"-013914 read 0"-013909.

    [The preceding corrections apply also to the table of chronograph ratings

at foot of p. 289.]

               In page 290, line 2,/or 0"-013914 read 0"-013909.
                                               for 0"-006956 read 0"-006954.

                              293, line 1,/or ratio read rate.
                            298, line 33, for 307-05 read 307-50.
                            299, line 12, /or 9-607 read 9-609.

                       306, line 13, supply a comma after the word "dial".
                       306, line 4 from bottom, supply a comma after " dial ".

   These errors are all small, and affect the results within limits much less

than those of the differences between one experiment and another. A single

arithmetical mistake remains however to be noticed, which alters consider-

ably the constant of wave  transit in  sand as deduced  from the experiments
                                                                                                                                                       ;

namely, that in page 292, line 3 from bottom, '8 was read instead of '3, at

the beginning of the number representing the average of col. 4. The result

of the subtraction should therefore be3"-411639 instead of 2"-911639, and

hence the gross rate of transit in sand =774'*568 feet per second. Using

this corrected number in the calculation (p. 307) of the distance lost in
raising the wave in the seismoseope, and applying throughout the small

corrections mentioned above, the true rates of transit are

In Sand                                824-915 feet per second.
In discontinuous Granite
In more solid Granite                  1306-425             ,,

                                       1664-574             ,,

which numbers should therefore be substituted for those given in pp. 307,
308.

   This correction still further removes any probability of aerial commotion
having at all interfered in the Killiney experiments : see pp. 303-305.

   The Catalogue of Earthquakes contained in Mr. Mallet's Report will be

continued in the next volume.

ON THE VITALITY OF SEEDS.     177

 Twelfth Report of a Committee, consisting of H.E.Strickland, Esq.,
    Professor Daubeny, Professor Henslow, o?j(/ Professor Lindley,
    appointed to continue their Experiments on the Growth and Vitality

    of Seeds.

The 8eeds set apart for this year's sowing were those collected in IS'i^, and

it is the third lime that the same kinds have been subjected to experiment.
    There is a very evident decrease in the numbers which have vegetated when

compared with those of previous sowings, as will be seen by reference to the
annexed table.

    It being still desirable for the continuation of these experiments that seeds

of known date should be added to the Depot at Oxford, more especially of
families and genera not already there, we again beg to call the attention of
the Members to the subject ; and to guide them in the selection, we refer
them to the List of Genera, the seeds of which are now in our possession,
given in p. 32 of the Report of this Association for IS^S.

Name and Date when gathered.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1851-52. By the Rev.
   Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., F.G.S., Savilian Pro-

    fessor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.

 In submitting to the British Association a fifth report in continuation of

 former ones on observations of Luminous Meteors, I am bound to acknow-
 ledge the contributions (as heretofore) of Dr. Buist, the Rev. J. Slatter, Mr.
 J. King Watts, the Rev. T. Rankin and Mr. Birt, besides several other friends
 who ha\ e favoured me with occasional observations : to Mr. E. J. Lowe I am
 especially indebted for communicating, besides his own valuable series, those
 of Mr. Lawson, and the very exact observations of M. Bulard, and a series ob-
 served by the Rev. J. B. Reade and several friends.

     These latter sets of observations have each been drawn up in such complete
 and distinct tabular forms that I have judged it better for the most part to
 retain them in the order in which they were communicated, than to attempt
 to reduce them to a more strict chronological arrangement.

     I have also received a considerable series of older meteor-observations by

 T. W. Webb, Esq., of Ganarew, near Monmouth, extending over a period

 of upwards of thirty years prior to 1850. As it was found almost impossi-
 ble to reduce these to the tabular form, they are given precisely as they were
  communicated : they in several instances afford points of comparison with
  former records, and supply deficiencies in them.

L Observations of Luminous Meteors, from 1818 to 1850, extracted from old
     diaries of natural phmiomena. By Thomas William Webb, Esq., of

       Ganarew, Monmouth.

A1818. Jan. 5    meteor about S'' 30TM p.m.; it passed from N.E. to S.W.

across the zenith ; its observed time was about 3 sees. (This is but an uncer-

--Mytain observation, from youth and inexperience.)
1820. Aug. 10.      father, the Rev. John Webb, "informed me that as

he was travelling about a quarter past 2 a.m., he saw a remarkable meteor.

It was somewhere near Auriga, and had the appearance of a luminous line,

with sparks issuing in great quantity from both sides of it. This soon dis-

appeared gradually, and directly after, another, much less bright, was seen

further on, which lasted only for a moment." He was also informed, that

" one had been seen about 1 1 p.m., which was much brighter and lasted longer.

Shooting stars were observed in surprising numbers all night."

  --1821. Aug. 23. The same gentleman supposed that a meteor might have

appeared about 9 p.m. " in tlie N.W. part of the sky, as he saw a light on the

hedges before him (he was then going S.E.) such as would be produced by

the sudden appearance of a candle, or the flash of a gun. It was accompanied
by a noise like a rushing gale. The weather was hot, and the sky serene and
cloudless, without a breath of wind. It should be observed that there was a

thunder-storm on the evening of the 24'th"(and therefore this observation is

only so far valuable as it may be corroborated by others. It was in South

Herefordshire).
-- A1821. Sept. 9.
                    meteor about 8*^ p.m. at some height in the north. It

had the appearance of a star, about as bright as Venus, and disappeared

instantly without motion.

  --1822. Nov. 28. About 9^^ 45TM p.m. I saw a falling star which appeared,

at first, quite as bright, if not brighter, than a star of the first magnitude, but
                    :

A CATALOGUK OP OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS. 179

very soon lost its splendour and gradually diminished till it became totally
invisible. Its course was perpendicular, in the N.E., and about 30° in length.

The full moon was shining at the same time with very great I)rightness. Its
course was sti'aight and performed with a medium rapidity.

   1823. Sept. 7 About 9'^ 15"^ p.m., a meteor was seen in the S.S.E., whose

course may be thus delineated

                                                 In its descentitmade an angle of about 10° with

*,,                     the horizon : at first it appeared as bright as
^y Aquarius */3
                    ^ Athair, and it did not diminish until it had run
                    *o about half its course, when it gradually became

                    fainter and I'ainter. Its progress was not more

                    rapid at first than that of a cloud driving with a

*Scheat             *y high wind, but it became quickerwhilsttheangle

                    *J of inclination to the horizon increased. It re-

                                               mained visible about 3 sees. (S.Herefordshire.)

 --1821'. Aug. 29. About 10*^ p.m., my mother saw a meteor in the S.W.,

which from her description must have had when first seen 20° or 30° of alti-
tude : it descended in a sloping westerly direction, till near the horizon, when
it disappeared without diminution, either by extinction, or by passing behind

trees. It was larger than Venus in her brightest state, but so blue as to be

compared to a batl of quicksilver, and to appear quite unUke any planet or

star. Its velocity was considerable, and it seemed as though projected with

force. (South Herefordshire.)

, 1824. Aug. 31,-- About g'' 30TM p.m., the Swan being S. of the zenith,

a falling star appeared in it, whose course was short and rapid, in a S.E. di-
rection. It was of the second magnitude at one time, but very tremulous and

variable. About three minutes after, another appeared just below it, in the

N. part of Aquiia, of the fourth magnitude, sailing in a W. direction, with

a slow and equable movement, over a considerable space. (South Here-
fordshire.) The Diary adds, " this night there seemed to be many little

starlings and flashings in the heavens;" but on this I would not rely, as I am

very near-sighted, and I think at that time did not wear a concave glass.

A1825. April 13     servant at Gloucester saw a meteor at night in the S.,

which passed in a W. direction : it was quite red, larger than a falling star,

and not like one. The night was quite cloudy, but the veil was unequal, and

--in some places occasionally thin.
   1825. June 5. About 8"^ iS'" p.m., a light seemed to catch my eye for a

moment in the N. at about 30° of elevation. If not a deception, which is

very probable, it must have been twice as large as Venus.

1825. Aug. 10 About lO'^ 30"" p.m., a meteor equal to a star of the 3rd

magnitude in brightness passed across the upper part of Pegasus in a straight

line, tending somewhat downwards. Immediately on its disappearance an-

other appeared just E. of the hand of Perseus, exactly in the course of the

first, produced in the opposite direction : it seemed to come with a very short

horizontal course from the N., then becoming stationary, blazed out as bright

as Algenib for an instant, then diminished to the 4th magnitude, and quickly

after vanished. Soon aiter another of the 3rd magnitude fell in the S.W., in

a perpendicular line from Serpentarius downwards, with a swift course. After

ll** P.M. another meteor shot horizontally, rather descending, for the length

of 2° or 3° by Scheat in Pegasus : it dissolved into a splendid broadish train

of faint bluish light visible for some seconds. At the begiiming of its course

its apparent magnitude was about the 2nd. Just after this a very distant red

reflexion of lightning was seen in the S. All these meteors came more or

less from the N.E.

180 REPORT 1852.

--, 1825. Aug. 16. About 9^ 30°^ p.m., a shooting star of the 3rd magnitude

was seen in the E. at an altitude of about 40°, which rose perpendicularly for

7° or 8°.

  --1825. Nov. 6. At 9^ p.m., a meteor was seen 3° or 4° below Menkar in

the E.S.E., as large or larger than Venus when at her greatest brightness. It

did not seem to move, but vanished in an instant.
--1826. Ma 12.
                                  J'  Great meteor, about 10^40"" p.m., which by the account

of a person who was with me began to appear about two-thirds of the distance

between the Pole and Lyra, but on a lower line, between Lyra and Cygnus.

It was described to me to have begun " as if a star had shot," and then it

broke out all at once in a great body, moving, with a moderate velocity, to

the N.W. ; at first, and for some parts of its course, horizontally, but at last

deflecting downwards in a considerable curve ; in which part of its course I

first saw it, my attention being roused by the strange blue light it cast on the

ground. As it was passing on beneath the Pole, it went out, as it were, but a

red spark, half as large as Mars, passed on in the same direction for 3° or 4°,

and had the same effect as a case that remains kindled after the extinction of

a fire-work. This meteor had an intense bluish white light, and illuminated

objects considerably which were not immediately in the moon's rays. When

I saw it I thought it one-third as large as the moon, then about five days old.

I do not think it left any train. I fancied the light on the ground was waver-

ing and streaming, and diminished before I looked up, but"I was informed that

the meteor appeared uniform from beginning to end. An hour before, a fall-

ing star had been seen, with a course of 50° or 60° from the zenith to S.\\

diminishing before it disappeared. (Gloucester.)

  --1826. Sept. 15. I was informed that about S^ p.m. (uncertain to half an

hour), a meteor had been seen at some elevation S.E., which passed from N. to

S., or from N.E. to S.W., for 30° or 40^ as large as a star of the 1st magnitude
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

its course was mostly horizontal, but descending towards the last. It had a

--very broad train, as long as two-thirds of its course, which lasted a short time.
    1826. Dec. 21. About 9^ 30TM p.m., while I was looking through a tele-

scope, I perceived a falling star with the other eye : as soon as I could direct

my attention to it, 1 ascertained that it was descending nearly in a straight

line in the E., the point where I first saw it being between Ursa Major, Au-

riga, and Gemini : its course was perhaps 20°, pretty slow. It was of the Ist

magnitude, as large, as bright, and nearly as red as Mars : at the extremity

of its course it suddenly diminished to the 3rd or 4th magnitude, proceeded

A2° or 3° in that state, and vanished.  few seconds after, another was seen,

which first appearing very near the course of the former one, I think below

Gemini, proceeded 8° or 10° in a direction to the S., perfectly at right angles

to the course of the other. It was hardly so large as the 3rd magnitude.

  --1827. Dec. 6. About 6^ or 7*^ p.m., a very large shooting star was seen,

whose course was nearly perpendicular, 8° or 10° long, passing through the

tail of Ursa Major, and very slow : its commencement was not very accurately

noted, but afterwards it exhibited two or three alternations of light, from a

white star of the 2nd magnitude, to a brightness much exceeding a Lyrse, and

--of a splendid reddish yellow colour. It went out in a faint spark.
   1828. Jan. 19. About 5^ 45'" p.m., during light twilight a shooting star

was observed to pass between two clouds in an open space of 2° or 3° in a

direction sloping to the left. It seemed quite as bright as Venus.

  --1828. April 10. About Q"" SO" p.m., a meteor appeared at about 30° high,

S.S.W. As I only saw it out of the corner of my eye, I cannot be particular

as to its appearance, but it seemed a sudden short blaze or flash of bright red

light, brighter I thought than Venus, then uncommonly brilliant. There had
A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS. 181

been a clap of thunder in a hail-storin during the day, which was showery;

and there were a few clouds in the sky at the time, and a faint liaze in the

place where it appeared. It might, perhaps, be an electric spark ; its instan-

taneous disappearance rendered this likely, but no report followed, nor did it,

as far as I can judge, illuminate the haze in which it appeared.
-- A1828. Aug. 22.
                      beautiful shooting star as large as Venus passed in a

long tract from S.E. to N.W. under Cassiopeia, about 9*^ JOTM p.m. It seemed

to become extinct by degrees.

  --1828. Aug. 28. About 10^ .SO"" a beautiful shooting star was seen, whose

course was from S.E. to N.W., not less than 40° long, a little S. of the zenith.

It was of the 1st magnitude. About the middle of its course it became duller,

moved slower as I thought, and was perhaps a little deflected : it then resumed

its first appearance : it seemed to leave a train on disappearing, but I could

not tell, the moon being bright, and 1 not using an eye-glass.

  --1828. Sept. 29. At lO'' 52"" a brilliant falling star appeared, which had a

short course close to the horizon a little to the W. of the W. extremity of a

fine auroral light in the N. horizon. It made an angle of 60° or 70° with the

horizon (as a streamer might have been supposed to do in that situation),

being deflected to the right as it advanced. It was gradually extinguished. It

had a blue colour, as bright as Venus.

  --1828. Dec. 1. (At the close of the memorandum of an aurora borealis,

--the following occurs) : Several falling stars were seen, whose courses were in

opposite directions.

--1830. June 25. (The following is added to an account of a most tremen-
dous thunder-storm.) The storm passed about two miles E. of Gloucester at

lO'^p.M., and at some period between lO"" 20TM and 10'' 40", Mr.  , who had

a complete view of the whole, perceived a strange meteor in the W. or W.S.W.,

where the sky was cloudy, precisely like the moon behind clouds, of the same

colour, and nearly as large, so that he thought for a moment it had been the

moon. He called several other people, who all saw it. It lasted about three

minutes as near as he could judge, and gradually disappeared as if obscured

by clouds, or retiring in a straight line backwards, for it was quite stationary.

He stated also that he saw another thing of thef same kind, very much smaller,
on the same night. But query, was it not the moon ? [Supposing it to have

been actually a meteor, and the observer, an educated and intelligent man,
might not have been supposed liable to such a mistake, though the moon was,
I believe, actually in that quarter, some light may be obtained from the fol-

lowing memorandum, which occurs under 1831, Feb. 6.] Mr. J. B'    , an

accurate observer of nature, told me that about the beginning of Sept. 1830

(a note states that there can 'be no doubt, from the account of another per-

son, that the correct date was June 25) a thunder-storm came on towards

night, the lightning of which was of a remarkable pale hue, and had not so

much the appearance of flashing as of rolling from one cloud to another, and

chiefly from N.E. to S.W. (This observation was made in the South of Here-
fordshire.) When it had passed oif, and the sky was clear, about mid-

night, though it still lightened at a distance towards N.E., as he was return-

ing home, a meteor suddenly broke out in the E. horizon, and passed rapidly

W.across the sky till it disappeared in the  horizon.  He described it as a cloud

of fire, of the deepest i-ed, of surprising brilliancy, especially at its first break-

ing out ; so that while it passed any minute thing might have been seen upon

the ground. He described it as appearing as large as his garden, but taper-

ing at the two ends : it produced no noise, and the whole appearance was

over in a quarter of a minute.

1830. Nov. 11 (After some streamers of an aurora in the N. about 9^

P.M.) Just afterwards a very large falling star was seen E.N.E.
                                                                            ;

--182 REPORT 1852.

--1830. Dec. 10. About 5'^ 1.5" p.m., a meteor was indistinctly seen at

about 10° elevation N. by E. It was stationary, lasted a second or two, and

appeared in colour and size much like Mars in opposition, as far as could be

judged from a very imperfect view.

  -- --1830. Dec. 12. (A description of a fine aurora, concluding thus): After

8^, when the streamers hud ceased, a splendid and large green falling star was

seen lowish in W.N.W. which left a train : another large one was also seen

and one also during the aurora of the night before.

 --1831. April 10. There were faint streamers N. at night, and a beautiful

and brilliant falling star N.E., and a light most clearly connected with a

black cloud N.W.

  --1831. Dec. 8. The morning being overcast with very low fuggy clouds,

and very dark (it was probalily before 7*^), as I looked suddenly towards my

window I saw a flashing or flickering effect of light, such as might have been
produced by faint lightning oi- a fire in the opposite quarter. No light seemed

to come into the room ; the illumination was in the clouds or fog. As I in-
stantly went towards the window, the light, after becoming rather brighter,

faded and disajipeared very suddenly. It occurred to me that it was proba-

' bly the efi"ect of some great meteor (for though the light was faint, the lumi-

nous body must have been considerable to have produced such an eff"ect

through such dense clouds); on the other hand, a boy was whistling not far off",

who, had such been the case, would probably have been frightened. Such an

eff'ect from a lantern I never saw, nor believed it possible ; it might have been

best compared, as above, to faint lightning perhaps a little ruddy. (South
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

Herefordshire.) (The Hereford Journal of Dec. 21, contained a long ex-

tract, a copy of which I possess, from the Bath Journal, giving a long, though

very unscientific account of this meteor, for such it was, which seems to have

been visible over a great extent of country.)

  --1832. Oct. 20. Four shooting stars were seen within half an hour about

10^, three of which were large and beautiful, and sailed with a fine equable

motion : all from E. or N.E. But one which proceeded from the latter quarter,
at a considerable elevation, traversed 40° or 50° of the N. sky in a direction

nearly straiglit and parallel to the earth, leaving behind it a fine white streak,

which gradually spread wider and dispersed. As the star was equal to one

of the 1st or 2nd magnitude, and as the streak was visible at once throughout

so long a course, the effect wa.'; very striking and beautiful : what seemed re-

markable was that the other three, though similar lo this in their direction,

left no visible train behind them. One night two oi' three months ago (I

rather think on Sept. 18), I saw a bright star, which falling perpendicularly

seemed to be partially quenched, but yet proceeded a short distance before

it was totally extinct, in the form of a dull red spark. The appearance was

just like that of a candle suddenly plunged into carbonic acid ; the transition

being apparently from a state of inflammation to that of simple ignition.
-- A1832. Dec. 12.
M8^ P.M.            great meteor seems to have appeared between 1^ and

          was then returning through the field behind her mother's

house at  , when a bright light shone round her, much brighter than

moonlight, and more permanent than lightning.

 --1832. Dec. 13. Another great meteor about G'' p.m., described as a great

body of fire passing across the sky from E. to W., and giving so strong a

light that a pin might have been taken from the ground for a short time.

Another account was that it passed two ways. No report seems to have

succeeded it. The weather had latterly been electrical : it lightened on

several nights at the end of last month, and I saw a strong distant flash on the

evening of Dec. 2. (South Herefordshire.)
A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS. 183

--1833. Dec. 11. At 10'' p.m., I saw a very beautiful meteor. It com-

menced somewhere near /3 and y Ursas Minoris, probably above and to the

right of them, as a small shooting star, taking a left-hand direction, with an
inclination of about 4:5° to the horizon. During a course of 8° or 10° it had

increased gradually to a splendid globe, perhaps three times the size and bril-

liancy of Jupiter, and of a lovely colour, not easily described, probably nearest

to a greenish blue. The remainder of its course was intercepted from my view

by a building ; but from the great illumination of the sky, I imagine its splen'

dour still continued to increase. Its velocity was that of an ordinary falling

star : it did not appear to leave any train. Frequent, though faint, flashes of

lightning were seen in the E. horizon between 6'' and 7'' p.m.. and a very strong

one had been perceived on the prceedicg evening. The wind was N.W. with

slight but very cold showers, indicating snow upon the mountains, which pro-

bably existed there at the time, and the next day was seen in considerable

quantity. (South Herefordshire.)
-- A1834. July 4.
                   very beautiful meteor was seen at Tretire (South Here-

fordshire) at about 9*^ 1.5TM p.m. When first noticed it was probably about 55°

(or perhaps 60°) above the E.S.E. horizon, in the form of a very brilliant body

of yellow or pale orange light, not apparently exactly circular, but a little irre-

gular or angular in its outline. This appearance I think may have arisen from
the preceding part being more brilliant than the rest, but my surprise at its

sudden outbreaking, and the smallness of its diameter, which probably did not

exceeds', prevent me from speaking with certainty. It descended with a very

slow motion, vertically, for about 15°, and then broke into three balls, and be-

came extinct : the lowermost bail was by far the largest and brightest, the
other two were much smaller, one of them almost a point. They all became

of a dull red before their disappearance, which took place when they were

several minutes apart, one beneath the other, in a vertical line. This change

of colour before extinction I have several times remarked, and it always gives

me the idea of an entrance into a medium incapable of supporting combustion.

The appearance of the present meteor was decidedly that of a ponderable

body, probably fluid, in a state of ignition, perhaps fusion, actually, not ap-

parently, descending, and upon disruption coalescing by the force of gravity

into smaller globules, of which the heaviest preceded the rest. At any rate

it had no resemblance to any electrical phaenomenon which 1 ever witnessed.

No report could be perceived ; there was, however, a considerable noise of
wind, and of the mill ; at the time I am almost cerlain that the largest ball

preserved its original brilliant colour longer than the others. I should esti-

mate its splendour, before division, at 6 or 8 times greater than the maximum

of Venus : such estimates, however, are apt to be very uncertain. The twi-

light was so strong, that a Aquilse, which was a little below and to the left

of the place of its disappearance, had not long been visible with the naked

eye. Had it been in a dark winter's night the effect would have been surprising

and magnificent. This meteor was also seen by young Mr. P  , then in the

neighbourhood of Newport, Monmouthshire ; he described it as having a tail,

which very probably was at its first appearance, which I did not see. He says

it was as large, or larger at first than at last ; its disappearance was out of

sight behind trees, but he thought it had fallen in the garden just at hand.

Mr. P. informs me that two or three years ago, very early in the morning,

there was so brilliant a meteor as to terrify such of his men as were out ; the

blaze seemed to surround them ; and they might have picked a pin from the

--ground. (South Herefordshire.)
   1834. Sept. 29 About 7'' 15TM p.m., the twilight having already become

very dusky, as I was walking along a lane among trees, I was startled by
                                                  --

--184 REPORT 1852.

seeing the road before me suddenly illuminated by a beautiful blue light, much

resembling the eifect of lightning, and scarcely longer in its duration ; such
indeed for a moment I supposed it to be. I looked up, and saw, at a height
of about 60° as I guessed, in the N.E., the luminous track of a meteor. The
sky for a great extent in this quarter was overcast with a thin irregular veil,

interspersed with darker masses ; but a few stars were visible here and there,
and as it soon became clear, I found that the phaenoinenon must have oc-
curred in or near the Galaxy between Cassiopeia and the tail of Cygnus. The
track was about 3° or 4° long, considerably bright and very narrow, if not in-
terrupted in places. Its form and appearance were exactly that of the summit
of a dense cloud illuminated from behind, which, indeed, for a moment I
thought it had been ; its light was reddish. It continued visible by estima-

tion for 2 or 3 minutes, gradually decreasing in brightness and appearing

more unconnected and like a series of insulated patches. The following may

give a faint and inadequate idea of its form.

         _^V                ^^2x_  No report was heard.

 --1835. Aug. 4. The forenoon had been very warm and nearly cloudless.

Towards 3'' or 4'' clouds began to form in the W. horizon, which rapidly in-

creased. Their great darkness indicated considerable density, but they exhi-

bited no towering summits, or hard and defined edges, such as would lead to

any apprehension of thunder. They gradually rose and spread to a consider-

able height, and it appeared likely that showers would ensue towards even-

ing, which proved to be the case, but they did not seem dense enough for

tempest. About 4'' 30TM, being in my bedroom at Tretire (in the South of Here-

fordshire), I was surprised by a distant explosion, dull and heavy, like that of

a cannon, and by no means loud, yet causing a vibration in the house, which

is very strongly built, and the windowr distinctly rattled from it. I should

have supposed it a cannon fired at Goodrich Court (about 5 miles distant), or

the blasting of a quarry, had it not been followed by a long low rumble of

some duration. I immediately exclaimed almost involuntarily two or three

Atimes, that I never heard anything like it.      servant in the kitchen heard

the cellar door so jar from it, that she thought some person had gone down

there. Our man, who had the fairest opportunity of hearing it, being out of

doors, was greatly surprised at it, and thought it had been the blasting of a

quarry, only it seemed at some height in the air towards the E., and the suc-

ceeding rumble travelled towards the N. I also referred it to an E. direction.

The sky on that side was nearly free from clouds, and of a fine serene appear-

Myance.  own impression decidedly was that it was not thunder, but the ex-

plosion of some meteor.

Extract from Hereford Journal, referring to the last notice :

" On Tuesday the 4th inst. a most extraordinary concussion in the air was

perceived by several persons in different parts of the kingdom, and at the same

moment, about 40 minutes past 4 in the afternoon. It is described as a re-

port as of heavy ordnance, and followed by a reverberating heavy sound for

some seconds. A great peculiarity attending it, and most strongly showing the

immensity of its distance, is the impression it made on all those who heard it,

as if it was immediately in their own vicinity."

(I find here a reference to the Analyst, No. XIII., p. 175, which I am at

present unable to verify.)

1835. Aug. 28.--About 9"^ IS"", a falling star, brighter than Venus, was

seen at a moderate elevation in the E. descending with a straight course.
--A1836. March 8.
                   beautiful falling star appeared in the S. to the left of

Sirius, about 7^ p.m., but was scarcely noticed time enough to be fairly seen.

It seemed fully as brilliant as Jupiter, and of a greenish light.
   18^8. Oct. 15 About 8^ 35'", or 40TM p.m., the sky being for the most part

covered with low dark dense clouds, driving with a strong wind, with an ob-
vious degree of electrical light between them, in a part of the sky somewhat

less obscured, and where several stars were plainly shining, a bluish light be-

gan to appear, which in two or three seconds became very brilliant, as much
so as one-quarter or one-third of the full moon, and faded away again in about
the same time. The luminous body itself was invisible behind a cloud, and

nothing was seen but the reflexion. This exactly resembled distant light-

ning, but was less transient.
-- A1838. Dec. 7.
                   great number of falling stars were observed between

6^ and 1^. In about half an hour forty were counted, sometimes by one,

sometimes two, sometimes three observers, two at a medium. They were of

all magnitudes up to the first : the larger dissolved into a train of light, but

left no train [I presume this means no streak] behind them ; the S. and W.

quarters were chiefly observed, but their prevalence seemed to be universal
they all fell in nearly a vertical direction, but those in the N.W. and S.E.
quarters inclined towards the S.W. The colour of the more conspicuous ones

seemed to verge towards orange. Their courses were of no great length.
There was at the same time a pale auroral light along the N. horizon from
N.W. to N.E., apparently equally extended on each side of the true meridian.
The meteors were not watched after 7^ but about 1 1\ upon looking out again,
I saw one, the only one in several minutes, in the S.W.; but it had no longer a

vertical direction, its course pointing now to the N.W. (South Herefordshire.)
    (For an account of this phaenomenon as observed by Mr. Maverly at Gos-

port, see ' Proceedings of the Meteorological Society during the Session

1838-39,' p. 9.)

   [This shovver of stars is not noticed by M. Coulvier-Gravier in his ' Etoiles

--Filantes.']
   1840. June 30. About 10'' 30"", a beautiful falling star was seen in the S.,
nearly in the meridian, having a long straight course somewhat inclined to
the E. Its commencement was small ; it gradually attained considerable
splendour, and after a period of obscuration, produced perhaps by a thin

cloud, it attained the magnitude of Jupiter in quadrature before it disap-
peared. Its colour was orange. Streamers of the aurora borealis had pre-
viously been noticed, extending from N.E. towards S.W.

  --1841. Aug. 12. In the early part of the night, from about 9'' to lOi"',

many falling stars were seen. Being engaged myself with the telescope, I
saw but very few ; but two or three persons in the company were frequently
exclaiming that they perceived them. I should imagine that there must have
been three or four times the average number. I did not then recollect, what

has since occurred to me, that the smaller periodical shower is about this

time.

 --1841. Aug. 13. On looking out of my window between lO'' and ll"", I

saw a large falling star, which induced me to go out to examine whether there

was any repetition of the phaenomenon of last night ; I saw however nothing

in the course of several minutes.

  --1841. Nov. 8. The night seemed remarkably free from shooting stars. I

was abroad from 6*^ to 6^ 15TM, and from 9*" 30TM to 9'' 55TM, without noticing

one. (South Herefordshire.)

 --1841. Nov. 9. There appears to have been a considerable meteor this morn-
--ing, from the following extract from a note from Miss H. (South Hereford-

shire) : " Last Tuesday morning, before 5 o'clock, one of our workmen saw
--186 REPORT 1852.

an immense large substance, which he described to be like a ball of fire,
coming down from the sky quite perpendicular till within fifteen yards of the

earth, when it suddenly disappeared."

  --1841. Nov. 11. One of our servants saw three falling stars in the course

of milking, about 7'' p.m. She described them as passing from E. to W. in
the N.W. quarter of the heavens, as being of the first magnitude, and leaving

trains. (South Herefordshire.)

  --1841. Nov. 12. The day had been rough and showery, with a high wind

from W. or W.S.W., and a little hail in some places, but the evening twilight

was very clear, during which, about the same hour and in the same quarter
as last night, our servant saw two considerable falling stars with trains. About
6^ SO"* there was afaint light in the N. horizon, which I then thought indicated a
slight tendency to an aurora, but I afterwards found it accompanied the edges
of dark clouds in various parts of the sky. Until 9^ I was detained indoors at
L. (South Herefordshire) ; from that time till 9'' 45°\ I kept as sharp a look out
as a speedy walk over a bad path permitted, but saw nothing until about
9I1 40TM, when a meteor of an orange-colour appeared low in the S.E. to the
right of Rigel, and about the size of that star ; its course was short, rapid and
flickering, descending gradually towards the S. I did not perceive any train.

lO*" SO"* there was a fine meteor of the 1st magnitude, orange-coloured, with
a train, in the E. quarter, shooting, as the former, in a line directed from Leo ;

it was not seen by me. Two smaller ones afterwards, one with a train, which

one I did not see, had short courses from the same direction in the E. or S.E.
quarter, in the space of the next 7"" or 8"". But between lO"" 35°> and 10^ 40"",
a small point was perceived towards the feet of the Great Bear, not far above
the N.E. horizon, drawing a small train after it, and rapidly increasing in size
as it rose with a steady course, in such a way as to prove that it was really
drawing near from an incalculable distance in an apparently straight line. It
grew brighter and brighter, as did its splendid and beautiful train, and it as-
sumed an orange-yellow hue ; it passed a few degrees N. of the zenith, but
not quite so far N. as Cassiopeia, and still continued to increase as it de-

scended towards the W. horizon, but it seemed to become fainter and to be

extinguished before it reached it; but trees partially obscured this portion of

its course. It was seen by three others besides myself, my father, Mr. T. and

his son, and it appeared to all of us except ray father, to be attended, when at its
height, with a hissing sound, but a loud rushing wind prevented any cer-
tainty as to this point. Its appearance was like that of a magnificent rocket,
and the impression of absolute height, speed, and projectile force, was truly

sublime. Its size appeared to me greater than Venus, but not so vividly
brilliant. The length of its course might be 5 or 6 seconds. At ll"* 5TM a

stormy cloud in the N.E. horizon had a faint luminosity attendant upon its

upper edge. A shower afterwards came on. At Il''45°S a storm, which had

passed to the E.N.E. horizon, was followed by a similar light, which was very
 evident 5TM afterwards amongst dark patches of cloud. Our friends also saw
 what appeared like a light cloud somewhere towards the S.W. horizon, and
 wondered at it in the absence of the moon. 10TM after midnight the E. ho-
 rizon continued light, though the clouds had left it. I watched the S.E.
 quarter pretty frequently from 11'' till l"" 30TM, Nov. 13, but no meteor was
 seen after the large one, nor could I see anything during a short examination
 at 3'' 30TM and 4'' 30TM. The distinctness with which I saw the light of the

Welsh furnaces [20 or more miles distant] upon my walk about 9^ 30TM,

 though the sky was very clear, except low in the horizon, was very unusual
 indeed. The air was not favourable for delicate astronomical observations,

the diameters of the stars, according to Sir W. Herschel's remark, appearing

enlarged. Miss H. N., who watched from half-past l*" till morning, informed
me that she saw thirteen meteors ; the finest, which ran a longer course, were
between 5"" and 6''. None of them, however, seem to have been remarkable

--either for brilliancy or trains.
    ISil. Dec. 10. Eleven shooting stars were counted between ll"" and IS*"
at night, by a person in Hampshire. " The greater part proceeded from a

N.W. direction, some far less brilliant than others, and their light of a silvery

whiteness."

  --184-2. Aug. 9. About lO*" (as near as I can judge) I looked out for two

or three minutes for the periodical meteors, but saw nothing, though the sky

was very clear : my fatlier thought he perceived a flash of lightning in the S.

horizon. But on looking out about lO"" SO"* (having been called by him upon
the appearance of a falling star), I counted in about one-fourth of the hea-
vens, or possibly one-third, 8 or 9 in as many minutes, two of which were
brighter than any fixed star, and of an orange-colour ; one left a beautiful
train. I heard that two had been seen by a servant, between 9'' and 10\
bright, and in immediate succession, but passing in diflTerent directions; and

one of those 8 or 9 (which one I did not see) appeared to my father to de-

viate from the general direction of the others, which was towards the S.
 For about 15'" afterwards I saw no more, and gave up the observation. No-
 thing could be seen during a minute or two, about 1'' SO" on the following
 morning, or again at 2^ 45TM, except perhaps one meteor the latter time, but

 I am not sure. (South Herefordshire.)
    The meteors on this night were seen by several persons in the neighbour-

 hood.

  -- --1842. Aug. 10. The night was cloudy and rainy. Aug. 11. I was out

 much during the evening and eaiiy part of the night, but saw nothing.

  --1842. Aug. 13. Extract of a letter from a correspondent in Hampshire.

 " The scene was truly magnificent. I saw thirteen shooting stars within the
 space of half-an-hour, between 11 and 12, and S. saw one shoot at the same
 time that I did not witness, making fourteen. Three of them had beautiful
 trains, two in the S.W., with trains something like the tail of the comet of
 1818 ; colour of these two a silvery whiteness ; one was of sui-passing beauty
 and brilliancy ; they both proceeded in a southerly direction. The third ap-
 peared near the Polar star, and proceeded towards the S.E. This was less
 brilliant than the two preceding ones, of the same colour, but had a curious

 flickering motion in the train ; the streams of light radiated towards the cen-

tre of the train, something like this figure /-/^^^/v"/ · -''' ^^^ ^^'"Y beau-

tiful indeed, and what I had never before witnessed. The motion too was

-- Aless rapid than that of the two preceding ones."
1842. Aug. 27.  little before D'' p.m., the sky being overcast with thin

clouds, a glow of dusky red light appeared between me and a thick hedge be-

side which I was riding, and which was very dark ; from its peculiarity of ap-

pearance, its being chiefly visible to one eye, and its duration (however short),

I felt more inclined to refer it to (the reflexion of) a great meteor than to

lightning, of which there was no appearance, though the weather was close

and warm. The clouds were thin and foggy, and had no electrical appear-

ance. (South Herefordshire.)

  --1842. Sept. 3. Between 9'' and lO"" p.m., an unusual number of falling

--stars were seen, probably seven or eight in about 20".
    1844. Aug. 9. Several fine falling stars, more numerous than the average,

were seen (at Gloucester). Mr. H. W., who was observing with me, told me

that for some nights previously, but especially last night, they were still more
--188 REPORT 1852.

numerous and brilliant at Minehead in Somersetshire, and that he saw one

very curious appearance, resembling a serpentine train of sparks. He de-

scribed them as generally visible towards the S.E. All those that we noticed

tflnight had a similar general direction from N.E. to S.W.

AISii. Aug. 10       few falling stars were noticed (at Gloucester) moving

in the same direction as last night, but one was observed which presented the

singular appearance of a comparatively slow, and as it were difficult progress

--Ain the opposite direction.
1846. July 25.       workwoman near Gloucester, returning home about 10''

p.Ar., saw a meteor of considerable magnitude. It was of the size and colour

of the moon, and she compared its light to that of day. According to her

account, it seemed as though it proceeded downwards from an opening cloud,

and Avas instantly withdrawn into the cloud again ; but probably this retro-
grade motion may have been a deception. It was in the N. or N.E. at a con-

siderable altitude.

[This meteor was described in the ' Illustrated London News.']

--184-7. March 19. Extract of a letter from a lady.

" On the evening of Friday, March 19, A. and I left Albion Road [Hol-

loway] about half- past 8. Not any stars were then visible, but when we were
in Highbury Place, A. called my attention to what we thought a fire-balloon

ascending slowly. It was in the west, a little inclining to the south. As it
passed on slowly to the west its intense brilliance convinced me that it was not
an earthly thing. When it appeared to be over Hampstead (but as high in the

heavens as the sun is at 6 o'clock in the evening when the days are longest),

it shot forth several fiery coruscations, and whilst we were gazing at it, broke

into an intenselj/ radiant cloud. This cloud sailed on slowly, and we never
took our eyes off it. At this time the stars were shining. When we were in

the gravel path opposite to Highbury Terrace, the cloud was rather higher

in the heavens, and more to the W. It cast a most brilliant light on the

houses there, brighter than moonlight, and unlike any light I ever saw. It

appeared of a blue tint on the bricks, but there was no blue light in the cloud

itself. Suddenly over the radiant cloud appeared another cloud still more

brilliant, but I now felt so awe-struck that I cannot say precisely how long

they hung one over the other, before the most wonderful sight happened.

Perhaps tiiey remained so for two or three minutes, when from the upper

cloud a small fiery ball (about the size that the largest planets appear to the

naked eye) dropped into the lower cloud, and was instantly absorbed. Soon

after another similar ball dropped from the upper to the lower cloud ; and

then a ball apparently four or five times the size of the two preceding fell from

one cloud to the other in the same wonderful way. Shortly after this both

clouds disappeared, apparently absorbed in the heavens, though I did see a

few pai'ticles of the brilliant clouds floating about for a minute or so. Pre-

sently the moon appeared considerably to the northward of the place where

Wethe clouds had hung.         then saw the bright light across the heavens which

you told me was zodiacal light, which lasted for more than an hour."
-- A1847. Aug. 10.
                     little after lO*" p.m., several large and beautiful falling

stars, with fine trains, appeared to descend in the S. in pretty quick succes-

sion ; and on the whole the meteors of this kind certainly much exceeded the
average between lO'^ and 11'^ 30". Most of them fell in the above-men-

tioned direction, but the track of a small one, near the latest time of obser-

vation, pointed towards the N.W. Several of them were noticed two or three

nights ago. [Reference is then made to an account of shooting stars in a

letter in the ' Times,' dated Aug. 17, and this folloAvs.] The Hereford Journal

--of Sept. 8, 1847, contains also the following : " M. A. Frere, of Montizon,
A CATALOGUE OP OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS. 189

has stated that on the night of the Hth ult. he counted more than fifty shooting

stars in the course of two hours, viz. from 11 to 1. Most of them were seen
in the Milky Way, and a few towards its edges. The direction of all, how-

--ever, was by the Milky Way, and towards the S.W. horizon."  ·

184.7. Sept. 14. About 9'' 48^" p.m., as I was looking (or going to look)

through a telescope towards the S., a light caught my left eye towards the E.

horizon. I turned immediately, but only caught a glimpse of a meteor of a

yellow or reddish colour, about the brightness of Jupiter or Venus, Avhich

had descended through the N. Fish, to the S. of Aries, in a course a little in-

clined towards the N., and had become invisible behind a building, leaving a

narrow red streak, at first of considerable brightness, but fading very rapidly.

Its course must have been of 20° or 30° in length, before hidden near the ho-

rizon. (Gloucester, I believe.)

  --1848. Nov. 17. During a brilliant aurora witnessed by me at the ex-

treme W. verge of Herefordshire, three falling stars of considerable magnitude

--Awere seen, one with a long course and fine train.
1850. Aug. 12.  few minutes after 11^ (Greenwich time) a beautiful

meteor shot across Cygnus, then at a great elevation in the meridian. I do

not know whether I caught its first appearance ; but its brilliancy drew the

attention of my left eye, while the other was at the telescope. Its course was

from W. to E. and not rapid, extending for perhaps 10° or 12° till I lost it

behind the top of a tree. Its light was intense, much brighter than that of

Venus, and of a beautiful clear blue colour : in the middle of its course it

seemed to be extinguished, and then broke out again as bright as before. I
think it left no train. Nearly an hour before I had noticed a much smaller

one, falling in quite a difi"erent direction, low in the S.S.W. perpendicular to
the horizon. This meteor was seen at Highfield near Nottingham, by Mr.

Lowe, as appears by his letter in the ' Times.' He calls its colour, however,

--Ayellow. (South Herefordshire.)
1850. Aug. 24.  little after 10"" p.m., a fine yellow meteor fell from near

the zenith to a Aquilse, as large as Venus.

  --1850. Oct. 5. While looking with my 5^ feet achromatic at a consider-

able star, probably of about 7 mag., I saw in the field a bright point of light,
of nearly the same size and appearance, and at no great distance, which imme-

diately vanished. It seems to have been a small and instantly extinguished

meteor. It had I believe a reddish tinge.
   1850. Nov. 29.-- About 9^, or from 9" to 9^ 10" p.m. Greenwich time, I

caught an oblique sight of a very beautiful meteor of a yellowish colour and

considerable size, which seemed to run a very short course at a great alti-

tude, a few degrees W. of the zenith, and I believe among the stars of Gloire

Frederici ; but I did not exactly note the place, as finding it had left a bright
and beautiful, though short train, I endeavoured to turn the telescope upon

it ; but before I could succeed, the train had disappeared, and I then could

not exactly identify its place. [This meteor is mentioned in the 'Times,'

in two letters, dated Barnstaple and Brixton Road.]

                        have been favoured with the following from Madras on the

       subject of the shower of meteors visible all over India on the 1 9th or 20th

       of April. By a blunder of our own we mistook the Bombay date, and made

       it Saturday the 19th, when it ought to been Sunday the 20th; and on this
       night accordingly the shower was seen here, at Poona, and at Cawnpore.

       With all these coincidences we came to the conclusion that our Kolapore

       correspondent, who gave an account of them, had also mistaken the date, and

       that there had been one shower only. As he makes no sign of recantation,

we now come to the conclusion that there were two showers on two suc-

cessive nights, bearing a very close resemblance to each other. The following
description is one of the most copious and clear that we have met with ; it is

from the pen of one of the oldest and ablest of our observers in India :

   " ' On the evening of Saturday the 19th of April, I was sitting in a

verandah of the Government House at Madras, facing to the eastward, from
about \ past 8 to i past 10. From the height of the verandah 1 could see
the sky to about an altitude of 60° or 6,5°, and about one-fourth of the horizon
between north-east and south-east. During the period above stated I counted

not less than forty meteors, of diiferent magnitudes and brightness. The flight
of the whole was from north and north-east to south and south-west. Some

of them commenced their flight at a point of the heavens invisible to my eye,
whilst others came into sight whilst on their career, from my left-hand. Some
burned out (if I may use the expression) whilst visible, and others disap-
peared whilst yet burning to my right-hand. I heard no explosions, though

some of the largest left a bright streak or tail, the trace of which remained
for several minutes. The greater part of the time it was brilliant moonlight,
which detracted greatly from the effect of the meteors.

                                                                                                 Q2

228 REPORT-- 1852.

29th of April, 1851, and the 6th of May the atmosphere at Madras was com-
pletely overcast with dense clouds. On the night of the 2nd of May (Friday),
at 10 o'clock, there was every symptom of the subsequent gale. At the

hour I state, I observed in the south-east quarter a very extensive circular
illumination of the clouds^ which continued for above a minute. The space
in the clouds so lighted up might, I estimated, be about 10° in diameter,
but owing to the dense state of the atmosphere and the lowness of the
clouds, I saw nothing of the meteor, which doubtless covered the circular
illumination. I infer that the meteor was flying towards me, that is, from
 south-east to north-west, because the shape of the illumination in the clouds

 did not vary.

   " ' On the night of the 22nd of this month, I was sitting, as is my wont,
under an awning on the terrace of my bungalow at Ennore (11 miles north

 of Madras) : I could see in altitude about 75°. About ^ past 10 o'clock, a

very brilliant and large meteor came within the range of my sight, and fell
 apparently perpendicularly in the sea (Bay of Bengal). From the moment
it became visible to me it rather increased into size and brilliancy than other-

 wise, and was in full blaze when it disappeared behind the sand-hills in front

 of my bungalow, which is not above a quarter of a mile from the sea-shore.

 The colour of this meteor, which seemed to be as large as an 811b. shot (qu.),
 was bright purple and green mingled, and it left a luminous tail or streak,
 which did not wholly disappear for about two minutes.

     " 'Last night (the 23rd) I saw another meteor in the same quarter, but
 neither of the dimensions nor brilliancy of that of the preceding night. The

--flight was from north-west to south-east, and it burned out before it had got

 within 10° of the horizon. Ennore, 24th of May, 1851.'
    " Our correspondent mentions a very brilliant meteor seen from Madras

 some months since before sunset ; it swept clean across the sky, and was so
 light and of such magnitude that it caused a glare over the landscape even at
 this early hour. This is the third meteor within the year that has been visible
 in daylight in India ; that seen to explode on the 30th of November, 1850,

-- --near Bissunpore at 3 p.m., the stone was afterwards picked up ; and that

 seen near Beerbhoom at 9 p.m. on the 8th of January, 1851." [See last Re-
 port.] Bombay Times, June 4, 1851.

  -- ANo. 4. " correspondent of the Bengal Hurkaru, subscribing himself

 ' W. M.,' gives the following interesting account of a meteor which he had ob-

 served on the night of the 19th of September :

    '"A splendid meteor burst over Calcutta last night about 11 p.m., and I
 send this notice to you that it may serve as a record of the event. On the

  13th, 14th, and 15th, theatmosphere was dry and its general movement from
 south-west, the lower clouds also moved from south to west, little wind and

 occasionally sultry and oppressive. On the 16th and 17th a storm or squall
 brewed in the south-east during the afternoon, but did not visit us. On the

  18th of September the clouds and atmosphere during the forenoon moved from
  south-west ; the weather dry and close. Between 3 and 5 p.m. nimbus clouds
  passed over quietly from north-west to east, with scarcely a breath of air. After
 5 p.m. the aspect of the sky was again dry. The chirping of the crickets was
  unusually loud, and the weather close and sultry. About 11 p.m. the sky was
  clear, but the stars were not brilliant, and there was no wind, when a most
 splendid meteor lighted up in zenith or a little north of it, and shot down

  half-way to south a little west, illuminating the landscape as if the full or

  half-moon had suddenly appeared on high. The meteor was a bright ball of
-- ----

light appearing to be of a size equal to one-fiftli the area of the full moon : it

was star-shaped, its light brilliant with a faint tinge of blue, but its light re-

flected from surrounding objects had a green tinge even in the sky ; and in

its progress there was a curdling appearance in the sky, about ten or fifteen

degrees in advance of it, as if cirrus or fleecy clouds, very gauzy and thin, were

retreating from it and crowding on each other, or more like a very thin and

watery solution of white paint brushed over a smooth and polished surface

and then invaded by the finger. The white particles fly from the finger with

the repelled liquid, and form a white fleecy circle at a little distance all round

it. The meteor endured as long as a person would require to take five or

six steps at a quick march and disappeared at once, from perfect brightness

to nothing, leaving no apparent tracic where it was extinguished : but in the

upper part of its course, a little south of zenith, there was a milky or phos-

phorescent line, its thickness that of the little finger, and tapering towards the

south ; and between its southern point and the spot where the meteor vanished,

a clear space of some degrees without any evidence of a track. There was

no appearance of an explosion, nor did I hear any sound. I am not quite

certain of the hour, but I think the church clocks were chiming eleven a few

minutes after the meteor disappeared. Shortly after a light southerly air

sprung up, and during the night the temperature was low, approaching to

cold.'" Bombay Timesy Oct. 3, 1851.

 --No. 5. " On the 1st of June last, about 8| p.m., while there were clouds

around, cirrostratus overhead, and moderate south-east wind blowing, a splendid

meteor shot from zenith towards south : it gave a light like that of the moon

when it is four days old, and turned to a green star just before it disappeared.

This meteor was preceded by four days of dry and sultry weather." Ihid.

 --No. 6. " Some singular phsenomena occurred during the thunder-storm

of Thursday evening, Sept. 25, 1851, which seem well-worthy of record.

Exactly at a quarter past ten, when the thunder was at its loudest, the inha-

bitants of the northern end of the Fort were alarmed with the sound as if of

a large mass of something rushing violently through the air, the noise

resembling that of a huge cannon-shot passing close by ; and immediately
afterwards a tremendous crash was heard, as if the mass had impinged on the

ground or penetrated some of the buildings ; nothing however could yester-

day morning be discovered in the neighbourhood. The whole closely re-

sembled what is mentioned as having occurred in Ross-shire in August 1849,
when a huge mass of ice was found to have fallen. The rain was at this time

falling so furiously, the night was so dark in the intervals between the

flashes of lightning, and these last so bright and frequent, that a meteor of
any size might have " swept unheeded by;" yet appearances look very much

as if something of this sort had fallen, and we should recommend observers

--to be on the outlook for the corpus delicti more than likely at the same

Atime to have dropped into the sea. tumbler half full of water, on the side-

board of a house near the Mint, fell in two about seven in the evening, im-

Wemediately after a vivi(f flash of lightning !                        have it now before us; it is

cut almost as clean asunder as if cloven with a knife. The storm abated

somewhat after eleven, having apparently gone round to the west and south-

west : half an hour after midnight it again got round to east, and several loud

peals of thunder were heard; the lightning throughout was almost continued.

--Shortly after one all was tranquil again." Bombay Times, Sept. 27.

--230 REPORT 1852.

Weor those on board the outer light-vessel.  have no doubt whatever that this

was a meteor or fire-ball of large dimensions which has fallen into the sea :

' It may be of interest to you, with reference to the notice in to-day's paper
of the storm on the night betwixt Thursday and Friday, to know that I was
last evening informed by a seafaring friend of mine, who was, at the time the

Times describes the rushing sound to have been heard, sitting on the deck of

a vessel in harbour watching the storm, that he saw what appeared to be an

immense mass or ball of electric fluid fall perpendicularly (as it were) into

the sea, apparently near the outer light- vessel : the persons in charge of this

craft may probably be able to afford further information.' " Ibid. Sept. 29.
   " Some further particulars of the fall of the meteor which occurred during

the thunder-storm of Thursday evening noticed in our two last issues, have

since then been received. The mighty rushing sound and violent concussion

--perceived by hundreds of persons in the Fort, was so in exactly the same

manner in Colaba, a mile to the southward, at Ambrolie, two and a half miles

--to the north-west, as it was in the Roadstead, a mile to the eastward. All the

parties between these two extremes of nearly four miles give exactly the same

account of the matter. The sound was said to proceed from the northward as

of that of a body passing right over head towards the south, and striking the

ground at no great distance. As these phaenomena are spoken of by all parties

as nearly identical, the meteor must have passed when at its nearest at a di-

Westance of ten or twelve miles at least.  want more information on the sub-

ject; the smallest contributions will be acceptable: only one party who has

communicated with us actually saw it rush through the air, and observed it

--fall near the outer light-ship." Ibid. Sept. 30.
   " The 3Ieteor of last Thursday. The following notice of the meteor of
Thursday last, Sept. 25, closely corresponds with what has already reached us :

had our correspondent been able to give us anything like an exact idea of

the interval which elapsed betwixt the fire-ball being seen and the sound being

heard, we might have formed an estimate of the distance of the falling body,

if the hissing spoken of was in reality the same as the rushing through the

Weair described by other observers.  shall be happy to receive the further

Mycommunication our correspondent promises us. '  wife and I had been

watching the lightning for some time at the door of our bungalow, but feel-

ing very much fatigued, being an invalid, I retired to the sofa, and had scarcely
done so when my wife called out that she saw a ball of fire fall into the sea

in the vicinity of the outer light-ship. The heavens appeared to open at one

spot, from which it descended. This took place between the hours of ten

and eleven p.m. Neither of us noticed at that time any peculiar noise, but

at a later hour I said. Listen to the conflict going on amongst the elements
they seemed hissing one another for some moments. I recollect many

years since, when residing at Sidmouth, on the coast of Devon, during a

violent storm, a large ball of fire fell into the sea, illuminating the whole re-
gion ; but in those years little or no notice was taken of these things.' "

 --No. 9 Extract of a note from John Carrick Moore, Esq., Corswall,

Stranraer, N.B. Addressed to Mr. Faraday.

" On the evening of Tuesday, the 13th of July, 1852, 1 happened to observe

a very brilliant meteor. I was walking on the bridge of Carlisle when it oc-

curred. It resembled a large star, but certainly bigger than Jupiter, which

was shining bright at the time. It was about N.W. or perhaps N.N.W., and

seemed to fall vertically, or with a very slight inclination to the E. I guess

the altitude when it -first appeared to have been about 20° above the horizon.
[I am aware that persons not in the habit of using instruments generally ex-

aggerate altitudes ; but still I do not think it could have been less.] The co-

lour was a bright orange-red                                                                                                                          as it fell, the  brilliancy increased ;  it became
                                                                                                                                                   ;

nearly white, and then again a very bright red, and disappeared without di-

viding. The night was still, there were no clouds, and not the slightest sound

was perceptible. I do not think it could have been two seconds visible. It

had scarcely disappeared, when the clock of Carlisle, set to railway, that is

London time, struck 10.

" I would mention a circumstance, which I thought I noticed, but in which,

as the time was so short, I may be deceived. The meteor appeared after the

brilliancy increased, suddenly to become dim, and then again to shine out in

its greatest brightness, which was at the moment of its disappearance. It

seemed so near, that I tried to mark the spot where it fell. Mr. Hyslop, the

clergyman of Kirkcolm, tells me he also saw it on the shore of Loch Ryan,

about 90 miles as the crow flies to the west ; he expected it also to fall near

him. Mr. H. tells me it seemed to him to fall with a considerable slope to the

Heeast.  did not observe the dimness after the first increase of brilliancy,

which I have mentioned, and of which I feel rather confident ; the more so,

that I did not expect it, and never heard of such being observed before."

 My -- " 11a Wellington Street, Victoria Park, London, Aug. 11, 1852.

" dear Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you the enclosed obser-

vations of luminous meteors witnessed by myself and a friend, Mr. J. Hard-

ing, last evening in the Victoria Park. The two classes of shooting stUrs are

very apparent, viz. those stars that increase in brilliancy during their progress,

and those that decrease as they proceed. The first star seen by myself, at
gh gm p.m., is an instance of the first class, and that seen by Mr. Harding, at
gh 28" P.M., is a fine instance of the second. The description by Mr. Harding

appears to be very accurate : I regret I did not catch it, but the figure given

well describes the appearance presented by the meteor seen on the evening

of July 29th, an account of which I forwarded you. The paths of the whole

of the stars now sent, if prolonged, meet in the constellation Camelopardalis,

and may be regarded as confirmatory of the point of divergence being in this

constellation at this period of the year                                                                                                              The same feature which I noticed

three years since was well brought out last evening, viz. the retrograde move-

ment of the meteors towards the southern and eastern part of the heavens,

--and the direct movement of those in the northern and western, confirmatory

of the idea that the real movements of the meteors are of a planetary nature

and opposed to the motion of the earth in its orbit, unless they should be com-

paratively at rest as the earth passes through the group.

a Andromedae ; its motion was from the line joining a Andromedae and /3 Pe-

          " Upon comparing the path of this star with that observed on August 10,

9*" 2"" P.M. (1 852), it will be found that their paths cross at rather a consider-
able angle, the star of August 10 moving from Capella towards Cygnus,

which would be slightly erratic from the general direction of movement wit-

nessed on that evening. The direction of the star seen this evening at 9'' 14TM,

is considerably at variance with the motion of the other three, indicating that

the body was certainly moving (i. e. with its true motion) in a different di-

rection."

nessed by myself and my family on the morning of the 4th of September,

1850.

   " I was then residing at the Vicarage, South Mimms, Middlesex, in a

situation peculiarly favourable for astronomical observation.

" I had been engaged for several consecutive days in observing the planet

Mercury during   his  approach to the sun                                                                                       partly to test the accuracy of  my

power of observation by the calculations of the Nautical Almanack, but

chiefly to remark how nearly I could trace the planet in his course to the sun,

before he should be wholly lost in his rays.

  " For this purpose I used the most careful adjustments my instrument was
capable of, and continued my observations without noticing anything peculiar.

   " When, however, on the morning of the 4th of September I was preparing

my equatoreal before it was fixed on the planet, I observed, passing through

the field of view, in a continuous stream, a great number of luminous bodies ;
and I cannot more correctly describe the whole appearance, than by employ-
ing the same language which I used when I communicated the circumstance

to the Royal Astronomical Society, in the Monthly Notices of Dec. 13, 1850,

and Dec. I'ith, 1851.

   " When I first saw them I was filled with surprise, and endeavoured to ac-

count for the strange appearance by supposing that they were bodies floating
in the atmosphere, such as the seeds of plants, as we are accustomed to wit-

ness them in the open country about this season ; but nothing was visible to

the naked eye.
   " The sky was perfectly cloudless ; and so serene was the atmosphere, that

there was not a breath of wind through the day, even so much as to cause

any perceptible tremor of the instrument ; and 1 subjected the luminous

bodies to examination by all the eye-pieces and coloured glasses that were
needful; but they bore every such examination just as the planets Mercury

and Venus did, both of which were frequently looked at by me, for the pur-

pose of comparison, during the day ; so that it was impossible I could resist

the conclusion (much as I was early disposed to hesitate) that they were real

celestial bodies moving in an orbit of their own, and far removed beyond the

limits of our atmosphere.
   " They continued passing, often in inconceivable numbers, from i past 9

A.M., when I first saw them, almost without intermission, till about ^ past 3
P.M., when they became fewer, passed at longer intervals, and then finally

ceased.

" The bodies were all perfectly round, with about the brightness of Venus,

as seen in the same field of view with them ; and their light was white, or

with a slight tinge of blue ; and they appeared self-luminous, as though they

did  not  cross  the  sun's  disc                  yet when seen near him they did not                                          change
                                                ;

their shape, or diminish in brightness.

" They passed with difl^erent velocities, some slowly, and others with great

rapidity ; and they were very various in size, some having a diameter, as nearly

as I could estimate, about 2", while others were approaching to 20".

" I tried various powers upon them, and used both direct and diagonal eye-

pieces ; but with every one I employed they showed the same appearance,

being as sharply defined as the planet Jupiter, without haze or spot, or in-

equality of brightness.

   " I naturally anticipated some such appearance at night, but after \ past 3
I saw nothing peculiar, though I waited till 11 p.m. ; but have since been in-

formed that at \ past 1 1 (it is believed on the same night) a meteor of amazing
brilliance and size, and passing in the same direction and about the same al-
titude, was observed by Mr. Ballan of Wrotham Park, in the immediate

neighbourhood of South Mimms.

   " I repeated my observations the following morning, and then saw one such

single body pass in the same direction as those of the preceding day.
   " They occupied a tolerably well-defined zone of about 18° in breadth;

and, though with some exceptions, their direction was due east and west.
Their motion was perfectly uniform, so far as I was able to follow them with
the instrument at liberty; and they were observed continuously by myself and

members of my family, accustomed to the use of instruments, both by day

and night.
   " The telescope I employed on this occasion is one of 3^ feet focal length,

and 2f inches aperture, by Mr. Dollond, of faultless performance and mounted
equatoreally by Mr. Jones of Charing Cross, the circles divided by Mr.
Rothwell of London, and reading off to 5".

    " I understand that a similar phsenomenon has been witnessed by Mr.
Cooper of Markree Castle, County of Sligo, though I have not communicated
with that gentleman on the subject; but I take the opportunity of subjoining
a portion of the contents of a letter to me from Charles B. Chalmers, Esq.,

--F.R.A.S., now residing at Jugon, Cotes du Nord, France.
   " He thus writes : * About the latter end of the year 1849, I witnessed a

phaenomenon similar to that which you saw in September 1 850, in everi/ re-
spect, excepting that I thought some of the bodies were elongated, though

certainly the majority were globular; and their brightness appeared to me

about equal to that of Venus, as seen at the same time.
    " 'I was then residing at Weston- Super- Mare, in Somersetshire ; and the

instrument with which I saw them was a S-feet telescope, equatoreally
mounted, in a fixed observatory.

    " ' I was engaged similarly to yourself in observing the planet Mercury
about A past 10 a.m. I was at first inclined to believe it must be the seed of

some plants of the thistle nature floating in the air, but from my position that

could not have been the case.
    " ' The wind on the day I observed the phasnomenon was very slight ; but

such as it was it came from the sea. The bodies all appeared sharply defined,
no feathery appearances that I could detect ; and I did not observe any differ-
ence in their brightness during the time I observed them'.

    " Mr. Chalmers, then, after offering some remarks on a communication
made by Mr. Dawes to the Roy. Astron. Society's Notice in April 1852, says,

My' impression certainly is that the phsenomena observed by Mr. Dawes

and myself were not similar, and I trust that future observers may throw a
clear light on the subject ; for though Mr. Dawes is a very high authority,

he is not infallible'.
    " I feel it right, myself, to notice, that in the paper referred to by Mr.

 Chalmers, Mr. Dawes conceives an appearance which he saw to have been
 produced by seeds floating in the atmosphere.

    " No one, I am sure, would doubt the correctness of his observations on

 such subjects; but, excepting in the season of the year, there is so little real
 similarity, that they cannot be parallel cases ; and in his concluding observa-
 tion that ' had such a dense shoal of bodies so brilliant as those described by
 me, as seen in September, passed in the night, they would havesufticed to turn
 darkness into day ;' no doubt but that would have been the case, as it was
 in the phaenomenon witnessed by Messrs. Olmsted and Palmer in America,
 as recorded by Capt. Smyth and Baron Humboldt.

    " In conclusion, I may be permitted to say to the British Association, that

 I had been, at the time my family and myself witnessed what I now commu-

 nicate, a careful observer with superior instruments for upwards of 28 years,
 but that I never saw such appearance before nor since that period.

238 REPORT--1852.

  --No. 14. Letter from Dr. Buist to Prof. Baden Powell, Oxford.
          -- " Bombay, July 24, 1852.

    " Dear Sir, I have done myself the pleasure of forwarding from time to
time to your address copies of the ' Bombay Times,' containing notices of
meteors seen on the coast of India in the course of the year. I regret to say
that the list is a poor one ; whether it be the want of reapers or the barren-
ness of the celestial field which has prevented more information being gathered,
1 shall not take upon myself to determine. 1 have been about as much out
in the open air as usual, that is, I have driven home from office six miles every

evening after dark, and so am likely to observe anything unusual in the skies ·.

this season 1 have absolutely seen nothing.

   " One of the most extraordinary circumstances hitherto observed, is the
length of time through which they are occasionally visible in one spot, when
they must either be approaching or retiring from the earth in a line with the
observer's eye. Another adverted to by Olmsted is the almost equally sur-
prising train of light they occasionally leave behind them ; the most extraor-
dinary case of which is that described in a recent number of the Journal of
the Bengal Asiatic Society, by Professor Middleton. ' I was awakened,'
says he, ' at four o'clock on the morning of the 4th of Sept., 1844, by my friend
Mr. Williams, Head Master of the College, who remarked to me that some-
thing remarkable had occurred towards the north, when a truly beautiful
object presented itself, namely a delicate white arch of light, extending from
about four degrees from the horizon on the west, to about seven on the east,
its crown rising up to near the Pole star. It looked as if an even and rigid
rod coated with phosphorus had been made to arch the sky in the manner
described. It was seen under very favourable circumstances, also in so far
as no trace of cloud was anywhere visible, the sky being at the time of that
peculiar depth and transparency which is to be witnessed here during a break
in the rains. The account which he gave of its first appearance was this :

a servant rushed into the house in great fright, declaring that the sky had split.

He first saw he said an immense ball of fire pass from east to west, which left

behind it the rent which had terrified him so much. During the time which I
was able to observe the arch, about twenty minutes, it increased in curvature
near the crown, which besides moved slowly through about two degrees to-
wards the east. The dawn was now setting in, and the arch diminishing in
absolute brightness, though still as well-defined as at first, and before it had
ceased to be distinguishable it had shortened by several degrees, rushing away
from the ends upwards.'

    " I sent to you last year an account of a meteor seen here on the 6th of

November, 1850, a few minutes before seven o'clock. When first seen it was

about 60° above the horizon, and was rushing towards the south. It tra-
versed an arc of about 40°, when it exploded without noise, descending in a
number of brilliant fragments towards the earth. It left a long stream of
brilliant white light behind it, ten or twelve degrees in length, resembling the
tail of a comet, and which was visible for full twenty minutes. Seen through a
telescope it bore exactly the appearance of a comet, the nucleus, even after
the explosion, and when nothing was visible to the naked eye, but the light
appearing like a star of the second magnitude, surrounded by luminous va-
pour or cloud. Captain Shortrede describes a meteor seen by him from Churla
on April 11, 1842 ; it was from ten to twenty degrees in length, equally bright
throughout, except at the upper end, where it was rather faint. It continued
of the same appearance and at the same place for two or three minutes, when
it became fainter and fainter and then vanished. There are numberless
instances in which similar things have been visible, but for shorter periods of
time. I called your attention last year to the extraordinary shower of me-

teors seen on the 19th of March, 1851, at Shekarpoor, Bombay, Kholapoor,
and Cawnpoor, over an area of nearly a thousand miles each way. I have
now to bring to your notice the following remarkable facts in reference to
fire-balls seen to fall during thunder-storms.

   " 1 have scarcely any hope that this will reach you in time for the Meet-

ing of the Association, as this is our season of slow mails. It was not in my
power to despatch it sooner, and the facts may be worth preserving though at

present useless to you.

   We" have had three instances this season of what seems to have been the

fall of an aerolite during thunder-storms. On the 25th of September a violent

explosion occurred in the air at Bombay, followed by a wild rushing sound
overhead, heard at various points over an area of thirty miles in length and
eight in breadth, followed by a severe conucssion, as if a heavy body had
fallen, just before the occurrence of which a large fire-ball was seen plunging

into the sea. On the 18th of March, during a violent thunder-storm near
Dhutmah in the north-west provinces, at seven p.m., a thunderbolt, as it was

called, was seen to fall and strike the ground, giving out in the course of the
concussion a clear ringing sound like the crack of a rifle ; there was no echo
or reverberation at all like thunder. It appeared 150 yards from Choki, and
resembled in its descent a huge ball of red-hot iron with a band of fire esti-

mated at about thirty feet in length. On the 30th of April, about midnight, a

violent explosion was heard during a storm of wind and rain at Kurrachee,
resembling the discharge of a vast artillery battery, and about half a minute
afterwards a meteor, partially obscured by the rain, but still distinct and visible,
was seen descending into the sea. It is now well-established that in India at
all events earthquakes are almost always accompanied by furious storms of
thunder, lightning, wind and rain : it is difficult to trace the cause of coinci-
dences so remarkable in the commotions of the earth and air, still more so to
imagine any connection whatever betwixt the perturbations within the limits
of our atmosphere and the movements of solid bodies entering it from re-
gions beyond its boundaries; yet it is surely possible to suppose a thunder-
storm propitious to the precipitation on the surface of the ground of bodies
which might otherwise have passed on in their career."

On the Influence of the Solar Radiations on the Vital Powers of
   Plants growing under different Atmospheric conditions^ By J. H.
   Gladstone, Ph.D.

There are few subjects of experimental research in which such opposite
statements have been made as on the mutual action of the atmosphere and
the vegetable kingdom ; even the apparently simple question as to whether
plants increase or diminish the amount of oxygen in the air was long a matter
of dispute. This arose partly from defective modes of analysing gases;
partly from experiments upon plants being made under circumstances very

unfavourable to their healthy development ; and partly also from variations
in light having a great influence in modifying the functions of the vegetable
world. The history of these discussions, in which many of the greatest
philosophers of the day took part, is too long and too well known to need

further notice here. When it was fully conceded that carbonic acid really is
                                                                          ;

decomposed by the plant, it was natural enough that those who observed the

wonderful powers of the chemical rays of the solar spectrum in reducing

salts of silver and other substances, should refer the chemical changes taking
place within the vegetable tissues to the same occult agency. But Dr.

Daubeny, in an admirable investigation, published in the Philosophical
Transactions for the year 1836, has shown by indisputable evidence that it

is the luminous, and not the chemical or the caloriBc rays, which cause the

decomposition of carbonic acid with emission of oxygen from the leaves, the

formation of chlorophyl, the irritability of the Mimosa, the evolution of water,
and indirectly at least the absorption of it by the roots. The colours of

flowers are supposed by this author to depend also on the luminous rays
sunshine was found to act far more energetically than diff"used daylight

while no colouring effects were observed to be produced by any artificial

illumination, not even by that afforded by incandescent lime.

That portion of the inquiry requested by the British Association which

devolved upon me, embraced a question not included in the investigations of

the Oxford Professor, nor in those of any other experimentalist, as far as I

am aware : I refer to the influence of various atmospheric conditions in

conjunction with light. This circumstance necessitated the employment of

closed vessels under which the plants should be grown ; and glass, from its
transparency, was not only the best but almost the sole article which could

be employed. Bell-shaped glasses were accordingly procured ; and they were
made of various colours, in order that the different properties of the spectrum

might be to a considerable extent separated.

The blue glasses mentioned in this paper had each a capacity of about 690

Acubic inches.  smaller bell-glass of 172 inches capacity was also employed

in an experiment not described on the present occasion. The yellow glasses

had a capacity of 650 cubic inches ; the red of 558 ; and those made of

colourless glass of 740 cubic inches. The darkened glasses mentioned below

were made by partially covering bell-jars with brown paper, thus excluding

the light except such as passed through about one-eighth of the surface of
the glass, and that on the side turned away from the window. Their cubic

contents were 500 inches. Small colourless and yellow glasses were also

procured, each having a capacity of 177 cubic inches.
   The blue glass employed is of so intense a colour, that it cuts off by far

the greater portion of the luminous rays, but photographic paper showed that

it admits the chemical rays freely ; it may also be considered as interfering
much with the transmission of heat. The red glass, on the contrary, freely

admits the calorific influence, but stops the chemical, whilst, like the blue, it

diminishes greatly the luminous. The yellow again scarcely decreases the

illuminating power of light, but almost destroys its chemical action.
   The place in which the experiments here described were conducted, was a

room in a dwelling-house at Stockwell, in the neighbourhood of London.
The glasses stood on a table close by the window, which had a S.S.E. aspect.

No fire was ever lighted in the room, but it must have been a little warmer

than the external atmosphere in the winter time on account of the vicinity of

heated apartments.

   As preliminary experiments, merely the effect of these coloured glasses in
accelerating or retarding the growth of various kinds of plants was tried.

   Hyacinths were chosen as samples of bulbous-rooted plants. They were
all of the same description, purple in colour, as nearly as possible of the same
size, healthy, and beginning to put forth a plumule and radicles. They were

weighed, placed on the top of colourless glasses containing sufficient pure

water just to touch the rootlets, and then covered with the large glass shades.

      ON THE INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON PLANTS. 241

The experiments were started on Nov. 13th. In order to change the air,

the shades were lifted off for a minute or two about every second night.

Each  plant grew healthily and  flowered                                  yet some  differences were  observed
                                                                       ;

of a character which might fairly be attributed to the quality of the light.

First, as to the rootlets. Under the colourless glass they grew abundantly

under the blue glass they also grew abundantly and more rapidly ; under the

red glass scarcely any rootlets were produced, and what there were never

attained any considerable length ; while under the yellow glass they were few
in number, but long. Secondly, as to the leaves and flower-stalk. Under

the colourless glass they were put forth in process of time and grew healthily.

No difference was noticeable under the blue ; under the red long spreading

leaves were put forth, that bent towards the light in a very marked manner,

and the plant had an unhealthy appearance ; while under the yellow glass

short sturdy leaves and flower-stalks were produced.

As to the flower itself, it began to open at about the same period in each

instance, namely,

       Under colourless glass, on Feb. 1 1th, or after 90 days.

   There was no observable difference in the colour of the four flowers, not-
withstanding the variety of tint under which they had been formed. The

flower under the red glass was long and thin. Latterly they all suffered
for want of room.

   On April 16th all the plants were removed from the water into which their

rootlets dipped, dried in the air, and weighed.

The greatest growth therefore was in the plant exposed to all the influences

of the solar ray.
   Cereals were also grown under the various glasses, a comparative experi-

ment being made under a darkened shade. Access of air was permitted to

the plants by the glasses being placed upon boards which were perforated
with holes close together, and were raised about one-third of an inch from the

table. No direct rays of light could enter, especially as the space under the

boards was blocked up on the side nearest the window, and any diffused light

finding access by the perforations had to pass through several folds of tarla-

tane of the same colour as the glass shade itself.

   On Sept. 12th three grains of white wheat, sown in garden mould, to which
a little stable manure was added, were placed under the various glasses. The

wheat began to grow in a few days in each instance, one seed only under the

red glass proving unproductive. They were watered as occasion required.

In a week or two the plants under the darkened shades attained a consider-

able height, turning in a very marked manner to that part where most light

entered. No secondary leaves ever appeared, but each plant consisted of

two long white leaves of about 9 inches in length, so thin and flaccid that
they were unable to support themselves ; and after thirty days they drooped
entirely and became mouldy. The corn-plants under the other glasses grew

more slowly, but put forth "many leaves, attained a height of 10 or 12 inches,
and remained healthy throughout the winter and spring. Those under the.
yellow glass were the most sturdy in their growth ; and those under the blue

alone appeared thin and unhealthy.

Mallow-seeds (Malope trifida) were sown in garden mould, and placed

under the various glasses near the commencement of September, the arrange-

ments being the same as in the preceding experiment. They began to grow

after the lapse of a few weeks, first under the colourless glass, then under the

blue, and afterwards under the red, yellow, and darkened glasses at about

the same time, October 8th. Thin etiolated stalks, with only the first pair

of leaves, and those badly developed, about 2 inches in length, were all that

was produced under the darkened shade. In about a fortnight they died

and in the middle of March some other seeds sprouted in a precisely similar

manner. The mallows under the other glasses grew more healthily and sur-

vived much longer, but in no instance did they arrive at maturity : the best

plant was one that grew under the yellow light ; it had sprouted in the early

part of January and put forth many leaves, reaching the height of 5 inches.

AThey grew worst perhaps under the blue glass.  self-sown Stellaria grew

luxuriantly along with the mallows under the red, and a grass-plant under

the yellow shade.

   In a paper read by my brother and myself before the Association last year,

and published in the Philosophical Magazine for September 1851, we re-
marked that plants kept in an unchanged atmosphere appear to enter into a

sort of lethargic condition. An experiment was instituted for the purpose

of ascertaining whether the alteration in light produced by coloured media

made any marked variation in this matter; and as the pansy and Poa annua

were the plants generally experimented on in our previous investigation,
they were employed here likewise. Six pansies newly struck, which had
taken good root and were vigorous, were planted in six flower-pots contain-
ing good garden mould; and with each was also placed a grass-plant in
flower. They were all set in trays filled with water to the depth of an inch,

or thereabouts ; five were covered with the different descriptions of glass
shades dipping into the water, so as to cut off" all communication between
the external and internal atmospheres; while one was freely exposed to all
the changes of the surrounding air. The experiment was commenced on

October 17th, and access of air was never permitted to the covered plants.
The results under the glasses were very various, but how far they depended
upon the character of the light or upon the peculiar atmospheric condition,
could not be determined with any accuracy. One thing however was clear,
that the plants survived much longer for being in an unchanged atmosphere.
The pansy that was not covered by any shade was attacked with aphides
eight week^ after tlie commencement of the experiment, and although these

were washed off", it drooped before the end of December. The Poa also
scarcely survived the winter. Under the colourless glass the plants remained
healthy much longer ; the pansy was attacked by the forementioned insects
at the commencement of December, but although it was necessarily impos-

sible to remove the aphides without disarranging the experiment, the plant

Alived till March. The grass-plant grew very luxuriantly.  curious phae-

nomenon was observed. As the air within the glass shade was perfectly still,

the ripe seeds of the Poa did not fall from the flower-stalk, and through the

dampness of the atmosphere many of them which rested against the sides of
the glass germinated and sliot forth leaves, in some instances 3*5 inches long,

and radicles of 1 inch in length. Under the blue shade the plants grew very-
tall. No aphides appeared, but mouldiness was observed. In March both

plants were straggling and unhealthy ; the grass-seeds never germinated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and any portion that died quickly suffered decomposition. The plants ex-

posed to the red light were healthy at firjit, and the grass grew luxuriantly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

but aphides appeared on the pansy in the middle of December, and at the
commencement of the succeeding month it became sickly and drooped. The

grass-plant also lost its healthy appearance during the spring : some of its
seeds germinated. Under the yellow glass neither of the plants increased in

size at first, but in the spring they grew, the grass attaining a very great

length ; they maintained a strong and healthy appearance ; no insects showed
themselves on the pansy, and the grass-seeds gave little indications of germi-

nating. Some changes in the colour of the pansy's leaves were observed to
take place, but the grass remained of its proper green tint. The plants
under the darkened shade soon became sickly. On December 11th the

grass was found to be dead ; the pansy had grown tall, and turned decidedly
towards the least darkened part of the shade; it was mouldy and ill-favoured,

and on January 6th it drooped.

Researches connected with the growth of plants must necessarily stretch

Myover a considerable space of time.                        object in detailing these experiments

now is not to draw any general conclusions from them ; I regard them as

far too few and uncertain for that; but offer them to the Association as a

--sample of my preliminary attempts in this inquiry, attempts which may

indicate a line of fruitful investigation in future seasons.

   ing the Human Race, prepared by a Sub-committee of the British

   Association for the Advancement of Science, appointed in 1851 {con-

  sisting q/"DR. HoDGKiN and Richard Cull, Esq.), and adapted

  for the use of travellers and others in studying the Varieties of

   Man^.

The late Dr. Prichard read a paper at the Meeting of the British Association

held at Birmingham in 1839, " On the Extinction of some Varieties of the
Human Race." He cited instances in which total extinction has already

taken place, and other instances in which a continually decreasing population

Hethreatens a total extinction.                             pointed out the irretrievable loss to science

if so many tribes of the human family are suffered to perish, before those

highly important questions of a physiological, psychological, philological and

historical character in relation to them, have been investigated. In order

to direct inquiry rightly into the subject, a set of questions was drawn up by

a Committee of the British Association, which was largely circulated by

means of successive grants of money for that purpose. These questions were

however adapted, not only to direct inquiry respecting those tribes which are

threatened with extinction, but also to the rest of the human family. The

object in publishing these questions is to induce Consuls, political and other

residents and travellers, to obtain precise knowledge in reply to them, and

to send it to a centre, the British Association.

It should always be borne in mind that the verification of what is already

known is of importance in Ethnology, as in other sciences. The discovery

of new tribes of the human family falls to the lot of but few observers, while

many have the opportunity of adding to our knowledge of those tribes that
are partially known, besides which, recent observation may differ from the

older in consequence of changes that may have taken place in the people.
Any amount of knowledge, however trifling it may appear in itself, may be

of great value in connexion with other knowledge, and therefore will be wel-

Wecomed.  are seeking Facts, and not inferences ; what is observed, and not

what is thought.

The following questions might be much increased in number, and the

reasons and motives for framing them stated, but such detail would swell the

tract to a volume.

                    Physical Characters.

   1. Ascertain the form, size and weight of the people. Measure the height
of several men ; state those measures, and whether they are above or below
the ordinary stature. Measure the length of the limbs, giving the situation
of the elbow and knee. Measure the circumference of the chest, thighs, legs,
arms, neck and head of the same men : and weigh the same men. Observe
if the women be less than the men in stature and relative dimensions ; and,
if possible, measure and weigh them also. If any remarkable deviations
above or below the ordinary stature occur in the adults, measure and weigh
them also.

   2. Note if there be any prevailing disproportion between different parts of
the body, or any peculiarity of form.

   3. What is the prevailing complexion ? It is impossible to accurately
describe colour by words. The best method is to imitate the colour on paper
if this be impracticable, state what the colour is in comparison with some
well-known complexion. The colour and character of the hair can be ob-
tained by bringing home specimens. State at what age the hair falls off or
turns grey. The colour, form, size, situation and other character of the eyes

should be accurately described. It is very desirable to obtain individual like-
nesses by means of some photographic process.

    4. Is there, apart from lack of personal cleanliness, any peculiar odour, as
in the Negro? If so, describe it.

   5. The importance of the head claims particular attention. The head
consists of two parts, viz. the face and the brain-box. Is the shape of the
face round, oval, long, broad, lozenge-shaped, or of any other marked form ?
In addition to the best verbal description, give three sketches of the whole
head, by which means the character of the features, their relation to each
other and to the whole head, can be at once displayed. These sketches should

--be, 1st, a profile; 2nd, a front face ; and 3rd, a view looking down on the

top of the head. Let sufficient neck be taken in order to show how the head
is set on and carried. And in these sketches accuracy of drawing is indis-
pensable, without which picturesque effect is valueless.

   The form and size of the head, and the relative proportions of its parts,
can be obtained with minute precision, by measuring it in the method laid
down by phrenologists. If the observer be competent, by a previous study
of phrenology, he is requested to observe the manifestations of mind in con-
nexion with the cerebral development, as indicated by the form, size and

proportions of the head.
ETHNOLOGICAL INQUIRY.  245

   6. Human skulls should be collected, and care should be taken to bring

away such specimens as fairly represent the people. Remarkable skulls
should also be preserved and marked as such, their deviations should be ac-
curately described. And besides those specimens which are brought away,

it is desirable to observe certain things in a large number, always stating the

number observed.

       a. Is the OS frontis divided by a middle suture ?

       b. Are the skull-bones thick, thin, heavy, light, dense, &c. }
      c. Are the sutures much indented ?

       d. Are ossa triquetra frequent? if so, in what sutures do they occur?
       e. Does the squamous bone well abut on the frontal bone?

      f. Open some crania to ascertain if there be large frontal sinuses ; if so,
           state the condition of the ossification, and also of the teeth.

       g. Observe the bones of the face, their relation to each other, and to

            the cranium.

      h. What is the form of the outer orbitar process ?

        i. Is the palatine arch fiat or vaulted ?

      j. Does the upper jaw project forwards ?
      k. What is the form of the lower jaw ?
      /. What is the shape of the chin ?
      m. What is the relative position of the ossa nasi and unguis ?
      n. What is the situation of the foramen magnum ?
      o. What is the state of development of the paroccipital processes ?
      p. Observe the number, position, character and mode of wear of the

              teeth.

      q. Have they any artificial means of modifying the form and appear-

            ance of the teeth ?

   7. The number of lumbar vertebrae should be ascertained, as an additional
one is said to occur in some tribes.

   8. Measure the length of the sternum, and that of the whole trunk, so that
comparisons may be instituted.

   9. Give some idea of the relative magnitudes of the chest and abdomen.
   10. What is the character of the pelvis in both sexes ?
   11. What is the form of the foot ?
   12. The form of the scapula deserves attention, especially its breadth and
strength, and the clavicle also in relation to it.
   13. The blood-vessels and internal organs can be subjected to examination,
but with greater diflJculty : observe any peculiarities in regard to them.
   Peculiarities may exist which cannot be anticipated by special question

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the observer should, if possible, examine each organ in detail, and, comparing
one with another, he will find few things escape him.

    14. Are Albinos found ? if so, what characters do they present ? State
their parentage, and all that can be gathered to throw a light on their origin.
State the physical characters of their children if they have any.

   15. Where a district obviously possesses two or more varieties of the
human race, note the typical characters of each in their most distinct form,
and indicate to what known groups or families they may belong : give some
idea of the proportion of each, and state the result of their intermixture on
physical and moral character. When it can be ascertained, state how long
intermixture has existed, and of which the physical characters tend to pre-
dominate. It is to be observed, that this question does not so much refer to

the numerical strength or political ascendency of any of the types, but to

the greater or less physical resemblance which the offspring may bear to the
parents, and what are the characters which they may appear to derive from
--246 BEPOBT 1852.

each : whether there is a marked difference arising from the father or the
mother belonging to one of the types in preference to another ; also whether
the mixed form resulting from such intermarriage is known to possess a per-
manent character, or after a certain number of generations to incline to one
or other of its component types.

   16. Any observations connected with these intermarriages, relating to

health, longevity, physical and intellectual character, will be particularly
interesting, as bringing light on a field hitherto but little systematically in-
vestigated. Even when the people appear to be nearly or quite free from

intermixture, their habits, in respect of intermarriage within larger or smaller

circles, and the corresponding physical characters of the people, will be very

interesting.

              Language.

   17. The affinity of languages is one line of evidence of high value in eth-
nological researches, and hence the importance of obtaining accurate infor-

mation concerning the language of a people.
    18. If the language be a written one, care should be taken to obtain spe-

cimens of the best compositions in it, both of verse and prose. If possible,
procure native manuscripts ; if not, obtain copies of them.

   If there be no written language, and therefore no literature, yet traditions
will be found which should be obtained and recorded as closely as possible
verbatim, so as to preserve their own collocation and arrangement of words,
taking care to select as the most valuable, such as relate to their own origin,
history, wars, habits, superstitions, &c.

    19. If possible, cause some competent person to translate into their lan-
guage a well-known continuous composition, as the Lord's Prayer, the 1st
Chapter of Genesis, and the 6th and 7th Chapters of St. Luke's Gospel, for
with these examples a philologist will be able to give a very good account of
any language.

   20. In compiling a vocabulary from the mouth of an Intelligent native,
two objects must be steadily kept in view, viz. 1st, the right selection of
words ; and 2nd, their accurate reproduction.

  --1st. The proper selection of words. In selecting the words to form the
--first vocabulary of a strange language, we must reject, 1st, all words which

have no corresponding words in our own language ; 2nd, all words which
(mly imperfectly correspond to words in our own language ; and take only
such words as perfectly correspond. Words are names of things, events,
qualities, conditions, &c. Words of the following classes should be taken.

       a. The names of natural physical objects, as sun, moon, fire, water,
           man, arm, river, hill, &c. ; the names of animals, &c.

       /3. The names of physical qualities, as red, blue, round, long, heavy, &c.
       y. The names of events, actions, conditions, &c., as to fall, to walk, to

                eat, to sleep.

       B. The names of family relationships, as father, mother, sister, uncle, &c.
       f. The names of the numbers as high as they can enumerate. The ordi-

            nal numerals should also be given.
        It should be ascertained if there be Distributives, Multiplicatives, and

           Proportionals. Is there anything corresponding to our Numeral

            Adverbs ?

         'C. Personal Pronouns.
         jy. Particles such as prepositions, conjunctions, &c.
        In compiling a vocabulary, the observer should verify every word he

     --receives from one informant by the testimony of others.

    2nd, J'heir accurate reproduction. The words should be so written, that
ETHNOLOGICAL INQUIRY.  24?

a person quite ignorant of the language, and with no other guide than the
vocabulary, shall be able from it alone to pronounce each word with accu-

racy, sufficient for philological researches.

    If elementary sounds peculiar to the language, as the clicks of the Kaffirs,

^or the sounds represented by and c of the Persian alphabet, occur in the

words of the vocabulary, it is obvious that no alphabetic notation will enable
one who is ignorant of the language to reproduce those words even though
the compiler invents characters to represent them. Mr. Ellis's Ethnic Al-
phabet is a useful stock of characters to those whose lingual knowledge is
sufficient to use it. Our own alphabet, however, is found to be sufficient to
write many vocabularies, including both Kaffir and Persian, with an accuracy

sufficient for our purpose.

   In writing the vocabulary it is of great importance to mark the accented
syllable of the word. The mark' of the acute accent is commonly adopted
for this purpose, and is recommended to be continued by future compilers.

   21. Ascertain the extent of the geographical area over which the lan-
guage is spoken.

   22. Ascertain what languages it comes in contact with at the periphery of
its area : and if unknown, or but partially known languages occur, collect
vocabularies of them also.

   23. Ascertain if the same language without dialectic variations be spoken
over the whole lingual area. If variations occur, give examples of them
always bearing in mind that Facts are of greater value than opinions.

                                              Grammar.

   In giving an outline of the Grammar, the following hints may be useful.

   24. Give the various forms which words assume, as
       a. The plural forms of Nouns, and the Dual if it exist.
      /3. The cases of Nouns.
       y. Adjectives, their inflections and modes of concord.
       i. Pronouns, their various forms, with the Dual if it exist.

   25. Exhibit the formation of compound words.
   26. What is the order of words in a sentence?
   27. Beyond the mere order of words, observe if the subject take pre-
cedence of the predicate : the cause of the effect, and of any peculiarity in

the statement of propositions.

                                 Individual and Family Life.

   28. Are there any ceremonies connected with the birth of a child ? Is
there any difference whether the child be male or female ?

   29. Does infanticide occur to any considerable extent, and if it does, to
what causes is it to be referred, want of affection, deficient subsistence, or

superstition ?

   30. Are children exposed, and from what causes, whether superstition,
want of subsistence or other difficulties, or from deformity, general infirmity,

or other causes of aversion ?

   31. What is the practice as to dressing and cradling children, and are

there any circumstances connected with it calculated to modify their form
for example, to compress the forehead, as amongst the western Americans
to flatten the occiput, as amongst most Americans, by the flat straight board
to which the child is attached ; to occasion the lateral distortion of the head,

by allowing it to remain too long in one position on the hand of the nurse, as
amongst the inhabitants of the South Seas ?

   32. Are there any methods adopted, by which other parts of the body may

be affected, such as the turning in of the toes, as amongst the North Ameri-
cans; the modification of the whole foot, as amongst the Chinese?

   33. How are the children educated, what are they taught, and are any

methods adopted to modify their character, such as to implant courage,
impatience of control, endurance of pain and privation, or, on the contrary,
submission, and to what authorities, cowardice, artifice?

    34. Is there anything remarkable amongst the sports and amusements of
children, or in their infantile songs or tales?

   35. At what age does puberty take place ?
   36. What is the ordinary size of families, and are there any large ones ?

  48. How are widows treated ?

   49. What is the prevailing food of the people? Is it chiefly animal or
vegetable, and whence is it derived in the two kingdoms ? Do they trust to
what the bounty of nature provides, or have they means of modifying or

controlling production, either in the cultivation of vegetables, or the rearing

of animals? Describe their modes of cooking, and state the kinds of condi-

ment which may be employed. Do they reject any kinds of aliment from

scruple, or an idea of uncleanness ? Have they in use any kind of fermented
or other form of exhilarating liquor, and, if so, how is it obtained ? What
number of meals do they make ? and what is their capacity for temporary or

sustained exertion ?

   50. Describe the kind of dress worn by the people, and the materials em-
ployed in its formation. What are the differences in the usages of the sexes
in this respect? Are there special dresses used for great occasions ? and, if
so, describe these, and their modes of ornament. Does any practice of tat-

between the sexes in respect of longevity ?

   54. What is the general treatment of the sick? Are they cared for, or
neglected ? Are any diseases dreaded as contagious, and how are such

stitious or magical pi'actices connected with the treatment of the sick ? What

are the most prevailing forms of disease, whence derived, and to what extent ?

Is there any endemic affection, such as goitre, pelagra, plica, or the like?

With what circumstances, situations, and habits do they appear to be con-

nected, and to what are they referred by the people themselves?

55. Where there are inferior animals associated with man, do they exhibit

   57. What is the method adopted for the disposal of the dead?

generally adhered to, or subject to variation ?

58. Are any implements, articles of clothing, or food, deposited with the

dead ?

59. Is there any subsequent visitation of the dead, whether they are

                                   liuildings and Monuments.

   61. What are the kinds of habitations in use among the people ? Are
they permanent or fixed? Do they consist of a single apartment, or of
several? Are the dwellings collected into villages or towns, or are they

scattered, and nearly or quite single ? If the former, describe any arrange-
ment of them in streets or otherwise which may be employed.

   62. Have any monuments been raised by the present inhabitants or their
predecessors, and more especially such as relate to religion or war ? State
their character, materials, and construction. If they are still in use amongst

the people, state this object, even if they should be of the simplest construction,
and be little more than mounds or tumuli. If these monuments are no longer
in use, collect, as far as possible, the ideas and traditions of the natives re-
garding them, and, if possible, have them examined by excavation or other-
wise, taking care to deface and disturb them as little as possible.

    63. In these researches be on the look out for the remains of the skeletons

of man or other animals ; and, if discovered, let them be preserved for com-

parison with those still in existence.

stated journeys to or visits from other people ?

   65. Name the people and channels of this trade.

    66. Is it of long standing, or recent?

   67. Has it undergone changes, when and how ?
--250 REPORT 1852.

   68. When a people display their ingenuity by the extent or variety of their

works of art, it will not only be desirable to describe what these are, but also
the materials of which they are constructed, the modes in which these ma-
terials are obtained, the preparation which they undergo when any is required,
and the instruments by which they are wrought, Such particulars will not
only throw light on the character and origin of the people, but will, directly

or indirectly, influence the commercial relations which may be profitably
entered into when commerce alone is looked to. When colonization is con-

templated, the facts contained in the replies to these queries will point out
the mutual advantages which might be obtained by preserving, instead of
annihilating, the aboriginal population.

                                               Domestic Animals.

   Are there any domestic animals in the possession of the people ? Of what
species are they ? Whence do they appear to have been derived, and to what
variety do they belong ? Have they degenerated or become otherwise
modified ? To what uses are they applied ?

                                      Government and Laws,

   69. What is the form of government ? Does it assume a monarchical or

democratic character, or does it rest with the priests ?
   70. Are the chiefs, whether of limited or absolute power, elective or

hereditary ?
    71. Is there any division of clans or casts ?

   72. What are the privileges enjoyed by or withheld from these?
   73. What care is taken to keep them distinct, and with what effect on the

physical and moral character of each ?

  74. What laws exist among the people ? How are they preserved ? Are

they generally known, or confided to the memory of a chosen set of persons ?
What are their opinions and regulations in reference to property, and espe-
cially the occupation and possession of the soil ? Does the practice of hiring
labourers exist among them ?

   75. Have they any knowledge or tradition of a legislator, to whom the

formation of laws is ascribed ?

   76. Do they rescind, add to, or modify their laws? and how ?

   77. Are they careful in the observance of them ?
   78. What are their modes of enforcing obedience, and of proving and
punishing delinquency ?

   79. How are judges constituted? Do their trials take place at stated

periods, and in public ?

  80. How do they keep prisoners in custody, and treat them ?

   81. What are the crimes taken cognizance of by the laws? Is there gra-

dation or commutation of punishment ?

                                   Geography and Statistics.

    82. Briefly state the geographical limits and character of the region inha-

bited by the people to whom the replies relate.
   83. State approximately the number of inhabitants. As this is an im-

portant, but very difficult question, it may not be amiss to point out the modes
in which the numbers may be ascertained. The people themselves may state
their number with more or less accuracy, but it should be known whether
they refer to all ranks and ages, or merely comprehend adult males, who may

be mustered for war, or other general purpose requiring their combination.
In this case state the apparent proportion between adult males and other
                            ETHNOLOGICAL INQUIRY.                                      251

 members of families. The number of habitations in a particular settlement
may be counted, and some idea of the average numbers of a family be given.
Where the people inhabit the water-side, the number and dimensions of their
craft may be taken, and some idea of the proportion between the number of
these and of the individuals belonging to them, may be formed. In drawing
conclusions from observations of this kind, it will be necessary to have due
regard to the different degrees of density or rarity, in which, from various
causes, population may be placed.

    84. Has the number of inhabitants sensibly varied, and within what

period ?

    85. If it have diminished, state the causes ; such as sickness, starvation,

war, and emigration. When these causes require explanation, please to give

it. If the inhabitants are on the increase, is this the result of the easy and
favourable circumstances of the people causing an excess of births over deaths,
or is it to be assigned to any cause tending to bring accessions from other
quarters? State whether such causes are of long standing, or recent.

    86. Is the population generally living in a manner to which they have been
long accustomed, or have new relations with other people, and consequently
new customs and practices, been introduced?

   87. If the people, being uncivilized, have come under the influence of the
civilized, state to what people the latter belong, how they are regarded, and
what is the kind of influence they are producing*. State the points of their
good influence, if any, and those of an opposite character, as the introduction
of diseases, vices, wars, want of independence, &c.

   88. Is there any tendency to the union of races ? how is it exhibited, and
to what extent ?

                                                     Social Relations.

   89. What kind of relationship, by written treaty or otherwise, subsists
between the nation and other nations, civilized or not ? Have they any
intercourse by sea with other countries ? Do any of them understand any
European language ? Or are there interpreters, by whom they can commu-
nicate with ihem ?

   90. Are they peaceable, or addicted to war? Have they any forms of
declaring war, or making peace ? What is their mode of warfare, either by
sea or land ? their weapons and strategy ? What do they do with the slain,
and with prisoners ? Have they any mode of commemorating victories by
monuments, hieroglyphics, or preservation of individual trophies, and of what
kind ? Have they any national poems, sagas, or traditions respecting their
origin and history ? Where Europeans have introduced fire-arms, ascertain
the modes of warfare which have given place to them.

    State whatever particulars respecting their origin and history are derived,
either from traditions among themselves or from other sources.

                       Religion, Superstitions, ^c.

91. Are the people addicted to religious observances, or generally regard-

less of them ?

   92. Do they  adopt  the  idea  of  one  great  and  prresidin»g  Spririt,  or  are  thejv

polytheists?

   93. If polytheism exist, what are the names, attributes, and fables connected
with their deities, and what are the modes in which devotion is paid to each ?

 --* This question will comprise the existence of missions the success or the want of it from

causes connected with missionaries themselves or others.
--252 REPORT 1852.

Are any parts of the body held sacred, or the reverse ? Do they offer sacri-

fices, and are they of an expiatory character, or mere gifts ?
   94. Have they any sacred days or periods ? fixed or moveable feasts, or

religious ceremonies of any kind, or any form of thanksgiving or other
observance connected vith seasons

   95. Have they any order of priests, and if so, are they hereditary, elective,
or determined by any particular circumstance ?

   96. Is the religion of the people similar to that of any other people, neigh-
bouring or remote? If different, are they widely so, or dependent on par-
ticular modifications, and of what kind ?

    97. In what light do they regard the religion and deities of neighbouring

tribes ?

--98. Is there any idea of an inferior order of spirits and imaginary beings,
   such as ghosts, fairies, brownies, and goblins ; and how are they described ?
   99. Have they any notions of magic, witchcraft, or second sight?
   100. What ideas are entertained respecting the heavenly bodies ? Have
they any distinction of stars, or constellations? and if so, what names do they
give them, and what do these names signify ?

    101. Are they in any manner observed with reference to the division of
the year, and how ?

    102- If time is not divided by observations of those bodies, what other
mode is adopted ? and do observances connected with them rest with tiie

priests or chiefs?

   103. When the traveller, by personal acquaintance with the language, or

by means of competent assistance from interpreters, can freely converse with
the people, it will be desirable that he should form some idea of their amount
of intelligence, their tone of mind with regard to social relations, as respects
freedom, independence, or subserviency, and their recognition of moral obli-
gations, and any other psychological character which observation may detect
and more especially such as may contribute to an estimation of the probable
results of efforts to develope and improve the character.

    In using this little manual, it should be borne in mind that it is not a mere
 guide to inquire into those tribes that are threatened with extinction, nor to
make out certain details which are desiderata in our knowledge of the people
 of any given locality, but is intended to direct inquiry generally respecting
 the varieties of man.

Mean Temperature of the Day and Monthly Fall of Rain at 127
    Stations under the Bengal Presidency, from official Registers kept
    by Medical Officers, for the year 1851. By Colonel Sykes,

     F.R.S.
                              [Ordered to be printed entire among the Reports.]

 Dr. George Lambe, late Physician-General in Bengal, has been good enough
 to transmit to me the following analysis of official meteorological returns, made
 by medical officers of the Bengal Presidency to the Medical Board in Calcutta.
 They are limited to the returns of mean daily temperature and fall of rain, the

 extreme difficulty of getting barometers conveyed in safety to distant stations,
 not one in three sent over reaching its destination in an efficient state, having
 left the great majority of medical officers without the means of determining
 the varying pressure of the atmosphere j and with regard to the moisture in
                     TEMPERATURK AND RAIN IN BENGAL,.                                                          253

the atmosphere and fixing dew-points, although several medical officers kept

registers of the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers (there not being any hygro-
meters on Daniell's plan in use), yet the registers appeared so little satisfac-
tory, that Dr. Lambe did not think it desirable to include them in the
analysis. The daily mean temperature was determined by daily observations
from three to six in number ; but as these were made during the day and not
at all at night, the mean temperature is necessarily higher than the mean of

the 24 hours would be. Proper precautions were taken against direct radi-

ated or reflected heat, by the thermometers being placed in the hospitals or in

the surgeons' houses, properly shaded and with a northern aspect ; but the

errors of construction in the instruments do not appear to have been generally

verified ; they are not to be relied upon therefore for absolute results ; but as
the same mode of observation obtains throughout, the different meteorological

records have a relative value to each other which makes them acceptable.
The records of the pluviometer are more free from objections than those of the
other instruments, and they contain some highly interesting results respecting
the unequal distribution of rain, and in support of the facts adduced by myself
from Western India, and by Mr. Miller from Cumberland, testifying that the
rain-fall becomes a maximum in mountainous districts at a certain height, and
then diminishes as the height increases. For the reasons previously assigned,

I shall circumscribe my observations on temperature within narrow limits

but as the stations are arranged in groups, vnthin certain areas of latitude and

longitude, some few facts of interest may be selected. For instance, in the

Calcutta group of 15 stations, within lat. 19° 48' and 25° 42' N. and long.
85° 49' and 89° 14' E., Cuttack, in lat. 20° 28', has a lower mean daily tempe-
rature in January than Balasore, a degree further N. ; but in February this

is reversed, but reversed again in a marked manner in March, April, May and

the remaining months until September, when Cuttack becomes hotter than
Balasore ; but in October it is reversed again. The maximum daily mean

temperature in this group is 99° in May at Kishnaghur, lat. 23° 24', long.

88° 22' E. The next is the Dacca group of 19 stations between the parallels
oflat. 20° 8' and 27° 31' N., and long. 90° 17' and 95° I'E. The same discre-

pancies are observed here as in the preceding, of the higher latitude having a
higher mean daily temperature than the lower in some months, witness Buri-
saul, lat. 22° 35', temperature in January 66°, while Sylhet, lat. 24° 53', in

the same month is 6 7°' 7 Fahr. The highest daily mean temperature in this
group is 88°" 6 at Burisaul in May. The next group of 10 stations is in
ascending the Ganges from Hazareebaugh, lat. 24° 0', to Darjeeling, lat. 27° 3',
at 7000 feet above the sea* ; and from Gyah, long. 85° 3', to Dinagepore,
long. 88° 41'. The highest daily mean temperature is at Gyah in Behar, lat.
24° 48', viz. 96°-9 in Mayf. The next is the Benares group of 7 stations,
from Mirzapore, lat. 25° 9', to Goruckpore, lat. 26° 46', and from long. 82° 6'
Sultanpore to long. 83° 37' Ghazeepore. The highest mean temperature is
101° in May at Sultanpore, in a higher latitude than any station of the group

   * Cherrapoonjie and Decca are in the same group, the former at 4500 feet above the sea
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

the latter is on the Delta of the Brahmaputra. Their difference of latitude is 1° 33' 35"

their difference of mean temperature in May is 19°-1, which would give 235 feet to a degree.

In October the difference is 13°- 7, which gives 329 feet to 1° Fahr.

t Darjeeling at 7000 feet, and Sarun on the plains differ 17^ miles in latitude; the difference

ofmean daily temperature in May is 31°-1, giving 225 feet for each degree of temperature ; but
in December the difference of mean temperatures is only 14°-8, giving 473 feet for each

degree of temperature. Tirhoot and Darjeeling differ 55 miles in lat. The difference of the mean

temperature in  May  is  30°,  giving  233  feet  to  1°            the  difference  in  December  is  17°-4,  giving

except Goruckpore, and at 1050 feet above the level of the sea. The next

group is in the N.W. Provinces, and consists of 18 stations, from lat. 21° 51'

Baitool to lat. 27° 23' Futteghur, and from long. 11° 45' Hoshungabad to long.

81° 54' Allahabad. The highest mean temperature is 103° in May at Myn-

poorie, lat. 27° 1', and 100°" 1 at Allahabad and Nursingpore, the former in

lat. 25° 27' on the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna. The daily mean

temperatures run very high in May and June at all the stations in this group.

The Agra group, embracing Rajpootana, has 9 stations, but the observations

are incomplete. The highest mean daily temperature at Agra, lat. 27° 10',

was 96°- 1 in June. The Meerut and Delhi group has 1 3 stations, embra-

cing Almorah at 5500 feet, from Budaon, lat. 27° 50', to Deyrah, lat. 30° 19',

ITand from Delhi, long.                                13', to Almorah, long. 79° 41'. The highest

mean temperature is 104° at Goorgaon, 38 miles south of Delhi, lat. 27° 53',
in June, and at Delhi, lat. 28° 31', the temperature in May is 98°-6.

The Umballa group of 1 1 stations embraces Simla, at 7500 feet, and other

hill stations. At Ferozepore, on the Sutlege and Simla, differing 9 miles, in

lat. 30° 57' and 31° 6', the highest mean temperature at both is respectively

in  June,  97°"5  and  69°"2                           the difference of  elevation giving 220 feet for each

degree of difference of temperature in the month of June; but in the month of

January the difference of mean daily temperatures, 40° and 55°'9, gives 397

feet for each degree of temperature. The last group takes us to the Punjab,

where there are 25 stations between Mooltan, lat. 30° 10', and Peshawur, lat.

34° 0', and Kohat, long. 71° 26', to long. 76° 19' Kangra. Lahore in this group

is 1180 feet above the sea, and Peshawur 1068 ; and I presume none of the
stations, excepting probably Mooltan, have a lower elevation than these. The

returns are defective, but it wovdd appear a very high daily mean temperature

exists in some months, notwithstanding the comparatively high latitude; Mooltan,

lat. 30° 10', temp. 99°-4 ;                            Jehlum, lat.  32° 55',  temp.  97°                and Mean Meer, at
                                                                                                      ;

Lahore, lat. 31° 33', temp. 98°*2, all in June. The general results would seem

to indicate that the daily mean temperature in the summer months increases
with the latitude ; that is to say, that the daily mean temperature in lat. 32°
in June, July and August, is greater than in lat. 22°. The rain-fall manifests

in a marked manner, as I have formerly had occasion to show, the great discre-

pancies in the fall vnthin very limited areas ; and in the increase in the fall up
to certain maximum elevations. In the case of Calcutta and Barrackpore, only

9 miles separate in latitude and 4^ in longitude, the fall of rain respectively

for 1851 was 64' 16 and 42*75, differing 22 inches. Hooghly is 20 miles N.

of Calcutta, and differs only 6 miles in longitude, but the fall was only 36

inches, differing from Calcutta 28 inches. Barrackpore is intermediate between

Calcutta and Hooghly, and only \\ mile west of the longitude of Barrackpore,

but the difference in the rain-fall is 6| inches. All these three places are on

the Ganges, on the same level, about 20 feet above the sea. Burdwan, which

is 40 miles N. of Calcutta and 28 miles W., had only a fall of 28 inches ; but

more remarkable still, Midnapore, 8 miles south of Calcutta and 59 west of it,

had only 22'78 inches; while Cuttack, 1^ miles south and 1^° of longitude

west, had 50* 17 inches. In the Dacca group, which contains the hill station

of Cherraponjie in the Cossya hills, the most extraordinary discrepancies occur.

Chittagong, only 13 miles south of the latitude of Calcutta, but 2>\° to the E.,

has 86 '33 inches of rain, and lying under the same meridian as Cherraponjie,

which is 116 miles N. of Chittagong, at an elevation of 4500 feet, it has

524*02 inches of rain less than Cherraponjie, at which station the almost

incredible quantity of 61035 inches fell in 1851 ; and that this deluge is

no mistake of record, independently of the official report which I quote, I have

a letter from Professor Oldham in confirmation of the fact, who spent the mou-

soon of 1851 at Clierraponjie, and kept a separate record : 50 feet 10 inches depth

of water may be said to have fallen chiefly in 7 months, for in November and
December there was not a shower ; in Januaryonly ^of an inch, in February 3*05
in., and in March l^inch. The S.W. monsoon would appear to commence in
April vnth 67 in., followed by 115-15 in May, 147-20 in June, 99-40 in July,

103-9 in August, 71-7 in September, and 40*3 in October ; so that the vapour
from the south passed over Chittagong, and little of it was condensed until it
reached Cherraponjie and the Cossya hills. But the discrepancy in the fall

in the neighbourhood of Cherraponjie itself is not the least remarkable cir-

cumstance. Sylhet, which lies below Cherraponjie 23 miles to the S. of it,
and only 7 miles to the "W., had only 209-85 in. of rain ; the fall at the prox-
imate places differing 400-5 in. The greatest fall in any month at Sylhet was
43-35 in May. The explanation of this extraordinary fall at Cherraponjie is
in the physical circumstances connected with its location. The station is on
the Cossya hills, at 4500 feet above the sea, facing the south ; and the vapour
from the Bay of Bengal, floating at a height of about 4500 feet, passes over the
plains of the Deltas of the Ganges and Brahmapootra, and first impinges upon
the Cossya hills, and is immediately condensed by the lower temperature at the
hills ; and then comparatively little of the vapour reaches the higher regions,

as is the case in the Western Ghauts of India, where the maximum condensa-
tion takes place also at about 4500 feet. This is shown at Darjeeling, 1500
feet above Cherraponjie, 134 miles to the N., and 3^° of longitude to the W.

of Cherraponjie, the fall being only 125-20 in. ; and yet rain fell in every

month of the year, the maximum fall being 31 in. in June. The rain -tables
are not complete for Simla at 7500 feet, but the maximum fall in the mon-

soon months was only 17-95 in. in July and 1 1-65 in August, the most rainy
months ; so that there can be no question but that the fall does not exceed that
at Darjeeling, and we have then the fact that those stations so widely separated
in India as Simla, Darjeeling and Dodabetta on the Neilgherries, at about an
elevation above the sea of from 7000 to 8400 feet, have about the same
amount of rain-fall ; while the lower elevations of 4500 feet in the peninsula

of India have the maximum fall, ranging from 300 to 600 inches. It will scarcely
be desirable to make further comment upon the rain-tables ; but it may be

stated generally, that as the latitude is uacreased, and westing made, from Cal-
cutta the mean annual fall appears to decrease, the fall at Ferozepore being as
low as 23 in. ; but the discrepancies in the fall in neighbouring localities con-
tinue, as is manifest in the case of Goruckpore, lat. 26° 3', long. 83° 13',
having 61*70 in., Azimghur, 42 miles south and 9 miles east, having only
39-96 in. The rain-tables from the Punjab are incomplete.

   The above meteorological observations suggest to us to be cautious in ge-
neralizing from local facts, not less with regard to temperatures and falls of
rain, than on the supposed law fixing a fall of one degree of Fahrenheit for a
certain number of feet of ascent into the atmosphere.

262 REPORT-- 1852.

On the Chemical Action of the Solar Radiations.
                  By Robert Hunt.

(1). The following results are offered as a small instalment of an exten-
sive system of examination which I have undertaken. The object in view

is to determine, with all the accuracy possible, the relation which each

coloured ray of the prismatic spectrum bears to the chemical action which

takes place upon the different agents employed in the production of the

sensitive surface. Since different media exhibit very various degrees of

absorbent action upon the chromatic rays, as well as on the chemical rays, of
the spectrum, by employing them we obtain indications by which we may

determine the relation in which these phgenomena stand to each other.

   (2). The plan upon which I am proceeding is this. Having obtained a

very extensive series of coloured glasses, and by the solution of chemical

compounds, procured a still more varied set of transparent coloured solu-

tions, I analyse the luminous spectrum of a well-formed vertical opening be-

tween two knife-edges, by passing the spectrum through a particular absorb-
ent medium. The spectra are obtained, first, by means of an excellent flint-

glass prism ; again, by one of crown-glass of faultless purity, the manufac-
ture of Messrs. Chance, Brothers, of Birmingham ; and, thirdly, by a hollow
prism, in which I have the means of employing fluids of very different re-

fracting powers. For obtaining the chemical impression of the spectrum, I

procure a flame-like chromatic image of great intensity, 1 inch in length, from

mya vertical opening in  steel plate.  I have adopted this as my measure

throughout, dividing it into 100 equal parts : thus, all the numbers employed

are intended to express inches, or the one-hundredth part of an inch.

   (3). The first part of the present Report is devoted to the examination of
the prismatic spectrum by coloured glasses of various kinds. The numbers
affixed may appear somewhat irregular, but as they correspond with a very
extensive series, over many of which I have no control, but which are well
known to me by these numbers, and can always be obtained, I have thought
it best to retain them. I have however adopted the plan of numbering my

paragraphs, so that in referring back there will be no difficulty in comparing

the chemical with any particular luminous spectrum.

   As I hope to present to the next meeting a far more complete examina-

tion of this subject, I refrain from offering a single speculation, contenting

myself for the present with the record of careful observations and exact

experiments.

The lines a a' indicate throughout the length of the normal spectrum.

admits the permeation of the orange rays freely. The green very

much blended with the yellow, so that it is only by adjusting with

great care that a line of yellow can be seen. The blue and violet

rays suffer scarcely any change, the lengths of these rays being rela-

tively as follows: green '30, blue ·25, violet '15.

orange, green, blue and violet. The yellow rays are entirely want-

ing ; a very thin line of red appears at the lower end of orange ; the

violet is considerably reduced by the loss of red.                      SL

   In all the deep greens we find the violet rays almost entirely destroyed
owing to the removal of the red. It is from results of this character that I
am led to believe the violet rays to be due to a reappearance of red rays
amongst the more refrangible ordinary rays.

but more green and less yellow than ordinary.

ness, which extends to the second circle at ?/,

trum is not shortened at the most refrangible end, but the red of the violet
is entirely removed, forming a pure blue patch equal to '8. Over the space
marked g the green is far more luminous than over any other part, and the

ravs gradually darken towards the lower end.

yellow of natural objects, but produces no marked difference in

the general tints. Its action on the spectrum is very slight ; the yellow ray
is somewhat reduced in size, and appears whiter than ordinary ; and the

change on the colours of natural objects ; defines more perfectly the line
between the blue and violet, and by lowering the yellow gives a more de-

cided margin to the green.                                             Fig. 18.

lost when observed through this glass, all extraneous light being

into two circles, and the yellow into a well-marked patch. The

green rays are well defined ; blue and indigo do not appear to
suffer change. The red of the violet is completely lost.

 --(43) 123. Light cobalt-blue. The red of the spectrum is

brought into a well-defined oval, the yellow very distinct; the green

rays are considerably reduced. The blue rays extended, and con-

--sequently the violet rays are much diminished.

the spectrum is extended over the violet end, proving the existence of red

this point extends to the length of 1^ inch. Over the

space covered by the red and orange rays are indications

·of a well-defined circle of protective action ; immediately

above this a dusky brown commences, forming a kind of

fringing which is extended to '60, and in a similar manner

it bounds the whole of the spectrum. This is due to

diffused light, which I always find bordering the spectrum.

when it again increases just at the end of the violet, and

is somewhat sharply cut off at 1*90 above 0, or lowest

red, presenting an image similar to that represented in

the margin. Placing the glass at a small angle, and ob-

serving the spectrum by reflexion, the lower dark space

comes out very strongly, and the whole space above it

appears of a dark semi-metallic purple shaded by a dusky

brown border.

been repeated several times in both localities under precisely the same con-

ditions as regards prism, size of opening between knife-edges, length of

working with the very sensitive and beautiful collodion process

in the open air, yellow glasses have been introduced for the                  ^
purpose, as it was thought, of cutting off the chemical rays, at

the same time as light enough was admitted to enable the operator to see

his work. The results obtained (see Yellow Media) clearly prove that rays,
chemically active for collodion, pass the yellow media very freely; some

green glasses, as the above, offer much more obstruction, but red glasses ap-

pear to be still more effective.

   (63) 44. Deep iron-green (27) The action of this spectrum is very
slow, and confined to the limits between the mean green ray and the extreme

violet. In a great many experiments the spectrum impressed has been always

limited to the space -50 ; that is, it has commenced in the middle of the

luminous spectrum and terminated with the violet rays. Very weak hypo-

sulphite of soda washes off the darkened portion so readily, that I am led to

infer that it is an exceedingly superficial dust upon the surface only.

 --(64) 116. Another deep iron-green (25). By long-continued action

there is scarcely a trace of any chemical change. Here we have an example

of a spectrum in which the blue class of rays, ordinarily called the chemical

rays, are very brilliant, yet they are chemically inactive upon this most sen-

sitive photographic preparation.

                                                                    Fig. 30.

rapidity of action with this medium prevents the marking
of many of the more remarkable gradations of change
which appear to go on within the chemical spectrum.
Chemical action commences between 'TO and 1"70, and ex-
tends up to 2"20. The inner portion of this spectrum
appears the lightest, but in reality ^the action has been
much more intense over this section than on any other

part, and the semi-transparency of this portion is due to

the complete production of metallic silver in a state of

fine division. Ammonia will dissolve off the outer dark

brown edge, but does not act in the slightest degree on
the inside oval space. The spectrum obtained without
any interposed medium is, upon collodion, of less extent
than that now described ; it is, usually, a long flame-
shaped band of 1*60 or 1*70 in length, and of uniform
intensity throughout. The operation of the cobalt-blue

glasses on the spectrum indicates'some peculiar influences, which require more
extensive study than they have yet received. The remarkable difference
between the luminous and the chemical spectrum is very striking, and it ap-
pears to indicate the independent existence of the actinic or chemical rays.

   (66) 3. Combination blue and green (37), fig. 31.-- The spectrum
impressed by long exposure commences at -4.5 and terminates sharply at 1-0,

there being no indication of anv action beyond the visible spectrum. It will
be found by examining the drawing of the luminous spectrum obtained

when the light has passed this combination of j-^g. 31.                                                                         Fig. 32.

glasses, that the action commences at the lower

edge of the green rays. The whole space im-

pressed has equal intensity throughout, with a

brightening of the silver in the middle.

  (67) 49. A Light blue (35), fig. 32.--The

action commences at the lower edge of the blue
rays -55 from 0, and extends to 1'40, when it is

suddenly interrupted. Considering the usual

character of blue glasses, and that this one is of

an unusually transparent nature, it will be ne-                                                                       Rg. 33,

the chemical change is very superficial, is proved by the
rapidity with which the hyposulphite of soda removes the

mencing at -75, extending with full energy to 1-50; at

the lower edge it is continued with faint shading to -55,
and even some very slight continuation to -0, which is to
be detected by placing the collodion glass plate upon a
sheet of white paper and viewing it at a small angle, and

shading off at the most refrangible end, until at 2-10 all

action appears to cease. This is the greatest extension

of the spectrum which up to this date (August 20, 1852)
has been obtained ; and in two experiments made in very

intense sunshine at noon-day, a well-marked spot has

been obtained -10 below 0, as marked in the drawing.

This spot will be found to correspond with one of Sir

John Herschel's heat spots, and may possibly be referred

to some peculiar chemical action due to the so-called /^a-
rathermic rays. The presence of vapour, in the form of

light cloud or mist, however attenuated, appears to ob-

st'ruct this peculiar class of rays.                                                                                            Fig. 34.

On the Composition and (Economy of the Flax Plant. By Dr. Hodges,

   F.C.S., Professor of Agriculture, Queen's College, Belfast, and
   Chemist to the Chemico-Agricultural Society.

Next in importance to the study of the substances which serve man for food,

is the investigation of the composition and ceconomy of the materials which

yiehi him clothing. Among the plants which, from the most remote anti-

--quity, have been valued for their textile adaptation, those of the Linacese

family and especially the Linum usitatissimum, a native of our own country,

and widely spread over Europe, and also found in Hindostan and North

--America have occupied a prominent place; the flax plant, we have reason

to believe, having been cultivated for its fibre in the earliest seats of civi-

lization, and manufactured in the tents of the patriarchal fathers of our race.

We find that it was worn in the temples, and the microscope has demon-

strated that it was entombed in the sepulchres of Egypt. It also appears

that its valuable qualities were known to the ancient tribes of northern and

western Europe.

  A complete account of the flax plant, and its industrial applications in

--Ireland, should include 1st, the history of flax cultivation in Ireland; 2nd,

an account of the processes of cultivation ; 3rd, an examination of the chemical

composition of the plant; 4th, an account of its technical preparation.

The second division of the subject, however, belongs so exclusively to the

practical department of agriculture, that its consideration may at present be

properly omitted ; and though it would be out of place to occupy much time
in this Section with the first division, yet a few remarks may be permitted,

for the purpose of exhibiting the attention which, from a very remote period,

seems to have been directed to flax cultivation in this country, and as illus-

trative of its vast importance to the inhabitants of the province in the com-

mercial capital of which we are now assembled.

  --1 . The History of Flax Cultivation in Ireland. From the earliest periods,

we have reason to believe that the inhabitants of this island were acquainted

with the valuable qualities possessed by the fibre of the flax plant, and manu-

factured it for clothing. By whom, however, or from what country it was

introduced, we have no satisfactory record ; for the assertion made by some

writers, that the Phoenicians were the instructors of the Irish people, is

totally destitute of historical foundation. Our Irish name for flax is Lhin,

which word is also applied to thread, while the term Anairt, which is used

to express a kind of coarse linen cloth worn by the peasantry. Dr. O'Donovan,

of Queen's College, whose extensive and valuable researches in connexion

with the native records of this kingdom are so well known, informs me has

no cognate term in any language with which he is acquainted, and is evidently

a word of great antiquity. In the Brehon laws, also, we find it enjoined that

the Brughaidhs or farmers must be acquainted with the mode of working flax.

The linen shirt, dyed yellow, indeed, appears to have been a national dress

and the celebrated Jesuit, Edmund Campion, speaking of the "meere" Irish,

describes their fondness for capacious linen garments. " Linen shirts," he

says, " the rich doe weare for wantonness and bravery, with wide hanging

sleeves, playted ; thirtie yards are little enough for one of them." The

importance of flax cultivation in Ireland appears to have been fully recognized

by the English government, as may be inferred from the number of legislative

enactments and grants for its encouragement. In 1809, we find that govern-

ment appropriated the sum of £20,000 for this purpose. The exertions of

several national societies have also been directed to the promotion of flax

cultivation ; and by the labours of the Royal Dublin Society, the parent of
all our agricultural associations, important improvements were introduced in
the management of this crop. Since the establishment, in 1841, of the Royal

--Flax Improvement Society of Ireland an association of proprietors and ma-

--nufacturers, which was originated, and holds its meetings in this town there

has been expended of money, collected by subscriptions from members,
£.8000, and of money granted by the government to the Society, for the pro-

motion of flax cultivation in the south and west of Ireland, £4-000. Yet,
notwithstanding the efforts Avhich have been made by governments and

societies to stimulate the culture of flax, and though the total extent of the
crop produced last year was estimated by the Census Commissioners as equal
to 138,619 acres, the value of which would be about £1,700,000, this produce
is only about a fourth of that annually required by the rapidly increasing
manufactures of the United Kingdom. Though flax is at present cultivated

in almost every part of Ireland, yet it is in Ulster that this branch of industry

has attained its ciiief development. Of the 138,619 acres of flax grown in

1851, only 14,893 acres were beyond the bounds of this province. It is in
Ulster, also, that the principal seats of its manufacture are to be found.

  --2. The Composition of the Flax Plant. In reference to the third division

of the subject, I conceive that the most satisfactory method will be to com-
municate the history of a crop grown by myself for experimental purposes,
the progress of which I was able carefully to watch, from the sowing of the
seed till its conversion into dressed flax for the market. Some of the details

which I have collected, though of importance in the study of agricultural
science, have not been hitherto much attended to in this country.

   The field selected for the experiments was situated about a mile and a
half from Belfast; it has a south-west aspect, and the soil is a sandy loam,
composed of transported materials, such as are common in the districts sur-

rounding Belfast. It had been occupied as a grazing field for four years,
and allowed to produce rich crops of thistles and ragweeds. Its chemical

examination proved that it contained a fair supply of all the ingredients re-
quired for the purposes of cultivation : 100 parts had the following compo-

sition :

 --Progress of the Crop. On the 16th of April, 1851, a portion of the field,

measuring exactly 70 yards by 70, which had been prepai-ed by spade labour
in winter, was reduced to a fine tilth by harrowing and rolling, and sown

                THE FLAX PLANT.                                     277

   One of the earliest among those who directed their attention to tiie che-
mical composition of flax, was a distinguished member of this Association, Sir

Robert Kane. Since that time analyses of the ash of the straw of flax have

been published by Professor Johnston of Durham ; by Messrs. Mayer and
Brazier, and by Mr. Way in England ; by Leuchtweiss in Germany ; and by

the reporter. The only examination however of the proximate constituents

of the plant, so far as I am aware, consists of an analysis of the seed by Leo

Mayer. It is, indeed, strange that a plant, the straw of which has afforded oc-

cupation to the industry of so large a portion of the world in all ages, and the

preparation of which, for commercial purposes, consists in acting upon its

proximate constituents, should not have been more carefully studied. Having

been for some time engaged with investigations in this important department,

I shall, on some other occasion, bring forward the details of my analyses. At

present I shall merely state the general results of the examination of a spe-

Acimen of flax-straw taken from the experimental crop.      preliminary exa-

mination having indicated the presence of a volatile oil, a quantity of the

stems of the plant, carefully deprived of the seed capsules, was distilled with

water containing common salt, and from the distillate, which was without

action on litmus, I obtained an oil of a yellow colour; 5 lbs. of the fully-

grown fresh stems afforded about 10 grs. of this oil, which had an agreeable

penetrating odour, and suggested the peculiar smell which is remarked on

entering a room where flax is stored. In my examination of tiie proximate

constituents of the plant, the straw, coarsely powdered, was placed in an

extraction apparatus, and successively treated with aether, absolute alcohol,

water, dilute hydrochloric acid, and weak solution of potash. The solutions

obtained on examination were found to contain a fat oil, wax, traces of chlo-

rophyle, a peculiar green resin, a gum resin, which presented some of the

characters of the principle which Pagenstecher termed linine, and described

as existing in the Linum catharticum or " purging flax," but could not be

identified with it, a modification of tannic acid, which afforded a gray preci-

pitate with perchloride of iron, but was not aff'ected by solutions of isinglass

or tartar emetic, gum, not affected by solution of borax or basic silicate of

potash, a brown colouring matter, albumen, caseine, starch, pectine, cellulose,

and salts. The following table exhibits the action of the various solvents

employed :

   I shall now proceed to the fourth division of the subject, and describe the
various methods which are adopted for the purpose of preparing the flax
plant for the spinner. I shall not in this place allude to the oeconomy of its
seed, but confine myself to the management of the fibre of the plant, to
obtain which, of superior quality, is the main object of the flax-growers of

Ulster.

   When a portion of the straw, as it is termed, of the flax plant is examined,

it is found to consist of three parts : fii'st, of a woody, central, hollow column,
which the microscope shows to be composed of cellular tissue ; second, of a
tubular sheath, composed of long and firm bast-cells; and thirdly, of a deli-
--278 REPORT 1852.

cate covering of epidermis. By rubbing a piece of dried flax-straw between
the fingers, the woody central part and delicate epidermis can be readily

broken to pieces, while the tough fibres of the bast-cells will be found to re-
main but little injured. Those tough fibres, which are capable of being split
into filaments of extreme delicacy, constitute the raw material of our greatest
national manufacture. In the country farm-houses and manufacturing towns
of Ulster, they afford employment to thousands of our people, and are made
to assume almost innumerable forms. They are moulded into the costly lace
and beautiful cambric. They cover our tables, and supply us with "fine
linen," equal to that which was once the pride of Egypt. The coarser fibres
give stout sails to our ships, and even the refuse rejected by the spinner is
worked up into a cheap and substantial material for covering our farm-houses,
while the sweepings of the Belfast warehouses are sold to the paper-makers
of England, and used to produce the broad sheets upon which the Times
and Morning Chronicle newspapers are printed.

   To separate this invaluable fibre from the worthless parts connected with
it is the first step in its preparation for the spinner. Numerous plans have
been proposed for thia purpose, both by scientific and practical men. The
examination of the plant shows us that its parts are bound together by gummy
and resinous sul^stances, and that vegetable jelly fills its cells. The separa-

tion of the fibre, therefore, merely by mechanical means, as might be expected,
 cannot be perfectly accomplished yet at various times patents have been

                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

 taken out for the application of machinery for this purpose; and in 1815 the
 Linen Board expended £6000 in the attempt to introduce into Ireland a ma-
 chine which had been invented by a Mr. Lee. One of those machines was
 lately sold as lumber at the White Linen Hall in this town. In other
 countries the dry preparation has also been tried, and though it has been
 found capable of producing a coarse, discoloured fibre, adapted for inferior
 fabrics, such as bagging, &c,, yet it has been nearly discontinued. The
 specimens on the table will serve to illustrate the results of this method of
 treatment, as pursued in the jail at Cork, where it serves to give useful
 employment to the prisoners.

    From the earliest times only one method has been found capable of yielding
 the textile material in a condition adapted for every purpose, and possessing
 all the qualities demanded by the spinner, viz. the decomposition, by the
 process of fermentation, of the adhesive substances which connect together
 the bast fibres and the ligneous tissues of the straw. It is by this pro-

 cess, variously modified in the arrangements for conducting it, that nearly all
 the fibre produced in the great flax-growing countries of Europe is at present

 prepared. In many parts of Germany the fermentation is induced by ex-

 posing the flax, spread in the fields, to the influence of the air and moisture ;
 while in Belgium, which is justly regarded as the model country for flax
 management, the practice of enclosing the straw in wooden frames, and im-
 mersing it in the waters of rivers until the necessary changes are produced,

 is in many places adopted and found to yield fibre of superior quality.

  --In Ireland, at the present time, two modifications of the system of fermenta-

 tion are in use one of wiiich consists in steeping the straw in pools of water
 in the open air at ordinary temperatures, while, according to the other method,
  the steeping is transferred from the farm to the factory, and the fermentation

 accelerated by employing water maintained at an elevated temperature. The
  former method of steeping has prevailed in this country and in other parts of
  Europe to some extent from the earliest times ; and though it has been
  asserted by some writers, without, however, any authority for the statement,
  that the ancient inhabitants of this island prepared the flax in the same rude
                 ;;

THE FLAX PLANT.  2'J9

manner, by beating the unsteeped straw, as observed among some of the
people of the South Sea Islands, yet we may, I think, infer from the number
of places to which the name "poll a Ivi" i. e. flax hole, is applied, that
they steeped in water. The plan followed by the farmer, who adopts the plan
of steeping the flax on his farm in the open air, is to excavate a pond in con-
nection with some convenient stream. The dimensions preferred are from
twelve to eighteen feet broad, and about four feet deep. The quality of the
water employed requires careful consideration, hard waters being found ma-

terially to interfere with the process; ferruginous waters also are avoided

and in those districts where the steeper is obliged to make use of them, the
flax acquires a dark tinge, which the bleacher finds it difficult to remove.
From the action of the salts of iron upon the modification of tannic acid,
which I have shown to exist in the straw, we can readily understand that the
presence of iron in the water of the steep-hole must be prejudicial. As the

oozing of water from the adjoining soil also frequently produces discoloration
of the flax, careful sleepers place on each side of the pond a small drain, to
prevent the entrance of drainage waters. The flax, after pulling, is prepared
for steeping by removing the seed capsules, or bolls, by means of a simple
machine, composed of a number of iron teeth, about eighteen inches long,
screwed to a socket of wood, and fixed perpendicularly on a long bench, upon
which the workmen sit. The bolls are separated from the stems by the work-

men taking a handful of the flax, spreading it out, and drawing it through

the teeth of the ripple, as the machine is termed. Sometimes, however, the
steeping does not take place until the flax has been stored for some time, and
has become so dry that the fibre would be liable to injury by using the

common rippling-machine. In such cases the seed is beaten off" by means
of a " beater," formed of a block of wood furnished with a curved handle.

   In England, where the flax plant is cultivated more for supplying food for
cattle than for its fibre, the value of its nutritious seed is acknowledged by
every farmer; but in Ireland, unfortunately, industrial knowledge is only

beginning to influence the practice of the agricultural population. It is in

Ulster that the chief progress has been made. The Royal Flax Society has
diffused much useful information ; and another institution, the Chemico- Agri-
cultural Society, by its lectures and publications, has also contributed, in no
small degree, to overcome ancient prejudices. Yet it must, I fear, be regarded
by this meeting as but little creditable to our agriculture, that, though annu-
ally nearly 650,000 qrs. of ffax-seed and 70,000 tons of flax-seed cake are pur-
chased by the farmers of the United Kingdom from foreign countries, only
about one-tenth of the seed grown in this country is saved, the remaining

portion, by the prejudices or indolence of the farmer, being consigned to the

steep-hole.

    In placing the bundles of flax in the steeping-pond, they are arranged in
regular rows,' placed in an inclined position, so that the tie which confines
the straw in one bundle rests upon the root end of the preceding bundle
the bundles of flax of equal length being arranged in different parts of the

pond. When the pond is filled, a thin layer of straw or rushes is spread

evenly over the flax, and on this covering old sods are placed, so as to keep

the bundles from rising above the water. In a day or two, according to the

temperature of the season, fermentation commences in the pool, and in warm

weather in from eight to ten days, at other times in from twelve to fourteen,
the steeping and retting, as the process is usually termed, is completed.
During the steeping the water acquires a dark brown colour, carbonic acid
is disengaged in great abundance, and the surface becomes covered with a

gelatinous scum. To remove this matter it is usual to allow a gentle current
280 REPORT--1852.

of water to flow over the surface of the pond from the supplying stream, as,
when it is allowed to remain, the colour of the flax is found to be injured.
Various methods are resorted to in this and other flax-growing countries, to
ascertain the proper period for the removal of the flax from the pond. Thus
the Silesian steepers take some stalks of the flax from the pits, and place them
on the surface of the water. If the stalks sink they remove the flax, but if
they swim they allow the steeping to continue for some days longer ; while
the Irish farmer, day after day, when the fermentation has fairly commenced,
anxiously tests the progress of decomposition by drawing a few stalks from
one of the flax bundles and breaking them across in two places, about two
inches apart. If he can readily pull away the central woody column without
tearing the filaments of bast which surround it, he considers that the period
has arrived for removing it from the pit.

    It is easy to perceive that the peculiar series of changes which facilitate
the breaking up of the various organic compounds which compose the struc-
ture of the flax plant, must, in our fickle climate, where so many sudden
alterations of temperature occur, be liable to frequent disturbance, and
that the progress of the fermentation, in the shallow steeping-pools, must
be exceedingly irregular and uncertain. It is not, indeed, to be wondered,
that, notwithstanding the closest supervision, the most experienced steepers
should frequently be deceived, and that one part of the flax should be too

much decomposed while another part has not properly experienced the altera-

tions which facilitate the complete separation of the valuable material.
   The disagreeable odour evolved from a flax-pool must be familiar to those

who have travelled in the north of Ireland in the steeping season, and the
black hue which the streams in some country districts acquire at that period,

from the refuse waters of the pools being allowed to fall into them, excites the

surprise of strangers.
    It is interesting to discover, amongst those wonderful records, not merely

of the military achievements, but of the rural occupations and manufactures
of the ancient inhabitants of Egypt, which have come down to us on the walls
of their temples, that the steeping of flax and its preparation for their "fine

linen," was conducted nearly, we may conclude, in the same manner as by our
farmers at the present time. The drawings exhibit to us large wooden vats
for containing the flax-straw, and men are represented carrying water to fill

them.

    To render the history of the crop complete, it is necessary to give some

 account of the treatment which the flax undergoes on its removal from the
 steeping-pool. I shall confine myself to a description of the ordinary system
 of this country. The first operation to which it is subjected is what is tech-
 nically termed grassi7ig, which consists in spreading the steeped straw in thin
 and even layers upon pasture ground, for from six to ten days, according to
 the season, frequently turning it during its exposure, that tiie air may act
 equally on every part of it. Jiy ffrasshig the ereniacausis of the woody matter
 and loosening of the fibre is still further promoted, and the colour of the flax
 also improved. After grassing, the straw is either stored up in stacks, for
 subsequent treatirent, or at once subjected to the action of machines which

 break up and remove the brittle woody parts. To break up the woody matters

 so as to facilitate their removal in the ordinary practice of the farm, a simple
 machine, termed " the break," is employed. It consists of two wooden frames,
 each of which is furnished on one side M'ith a number of parallel angular bars,
 so arranged, that, when the frames are connected together by a hinge, the
 angular surfaces of the bars on one frame are received into the hollows formed

 between the bars of the other. One of the frames is permanently fixed on
THE FLAX PLANT.  281

a support, while motion is communicated to the other frame by means either
of an iron spring, or by an elastic pole of wood attached to it and connected
with a treadle, upon which the workman presses with his foot. By placing
a handful of the straws between the frames, and pressing upon the treadle,
the moveable frame descends and bruises, or breaks the inelastic woody
matter, while the supple fibre is uninjured. So prepared, the straw is ready
for the second and final operation, which it undergoes before it is transferred

from the farm to the factory. Steeping and grassing have destroyed the co-
hesion between the various structures of the straw, the break has fractured
the woody matters, it only now remains to liberate completely the valuable
textile material from its worthless encumbrance. This is effected on the farm
by means of a simple implement of manual labour ; an improved form has
been introduced from Belgium. It consists of a thin blade of wood, attached
to a handle, and an upright wooden stand, with a notch cut on one side, in
which the workman inserts a handful of the steeped and bruised flax, and
turning the flax so as to present every part to the implement, by the blows
of the "scutcher" the brittle and broken wcody matters, technically termed
"shoves," are knocked away, and at the same time any very short or injured
fibres are removed, producing what is known as "scutching tow." Some-
times bits of " shove " adhere so closely to the bast fibre, that the workman
requires to scrape them away by means of a blunt knife.

   Amongst the various obstacles which impede the extension of flax cultiva-
tion to the so.uth and west of Ireland, is the difficulty of obtaining experienced
scutchers; and serious loss has frequently been sustained, by persons who
have attempted the preparation of the crop, from the want of that skilled
labour which is available in almost every part of Ulster. Thus it was found
that while the northern scutchers can turn out from 12lbs. to I4lbs. of fibre
per day, the workmen in the south and west have not been able to prepare
more than from 5 lbs. to 6 lbs. daily, and frequently not more than 2 lbs. It
is therefore of great importance to this country that government is about to
afford encouragement to the erection of machinery for scutching, in districts
where skilled workmen cannot be obtained. Even in Ulster, for some years
the opinion has begun to prevail, that, as in other departments of our manu-
factures, hand labour must, in the preparation of the flax fibre, give place to
machinery, and "scutch-mills," where the work is performed for the farmer,

are to be found in all our flax-growing districts.

   The fibre of the flax, prepared either by manual labour, or in the scutch-
mill, is ready for market, and is sold according to its quality, at prices ranging
from £30 to £150 per ton. It is not yet, however, suitable for the opera-
tions of the spinner. In the same bundle there exist fibres of various quali-
ties ; and it is also necessary that the filaments should be arranged in parallel
" reeds." They must be sorted and hackled. " Hackling " consists in draw-
ing the mass of fibres through sets of iron teeth, fixed in a stand of wood,
which, like the teeth of a comb, separate and arrange the fibres, and remove
all broken pieces. Thus treated, flax is rendered fit for its various textile

uses.

 --Produce of Fibre, cSfC. The amount of rippled flax-straw, viz. 5824 lbs.,

obtained in my experiment, considerably exceeded the ordinary produce
of the farmer. From the returns of the Royal Flax Society, and from my
own inquiries, I would estimate the average produce of a statute acre, in the

north of Ireland, of air-dried flax-straw, with bolls, at two tons, which by the

seeding machine are usually reduced to 3360 lbs. By the various processes
of the rural manufacturer, the amount of dressed flax or fibre obtained ave-
                   ----

--282 REPORT 1852.

rages from four to five cwt. per acre. Some time ago I made an experiment

at one of the country sciUch-niills nearBelfast, for the purpose of ascertaining
the relative proportions of the various qualities of fibre, and also the distri-
bution of the inorganic matters. The flax employed had been steeped in the
usual way, and was found to contain 1*73 per cent, of inorganic matters:

   4000 lbs. of air-dried straw produced of

Dressed flax        500 lbs.
Fine tow            132 lbs.
Coarse tow          1 92 lbs.

                                                                                                                        824. lbs.

  An examination of the amount of ash which the above materials respec-
:--tively contained, showed that its distribution was as follows

In the flax        4"48 lbs. of inorganic matters.
In the fine tow    2-08
In the coarse tow  2'56, or in all 9"121bs.

So that .'JQ'OSlbs. of the inorganic matters, which the crop had withdrawn
from the field, remained locked up in the woody shoves, which, as obstinately
resisting decomposition, are used for fuel, while 9'12 lbs. were carried away
in the dressed flax and tow sold to the spinner.

 -- --Accelerated Fermentation The Patent System. For so far, we have con-

sidered the preparation of the flax fibre solely as constituting a part of the

ordinary farm operations of this country. Where the necessary amount of
intelligence prevails among the agricultural community, with regard to the
proper cultivation of the crop and its after treatment, as is the case in Belgium,
in some provinces of which country frequently 10 per cent, of the cultivated
area is devoted to its production, and in Ulster, where we find that, in 1851,
one out of every 44 acres was under flax, experience has taught the farmer,
that even with the various disadvantages attendant upon the old and uncer-
tain methods of management, it is capable of yielding considerable profit to the
grower. Notwithstanding, however, the efforts which have been made by
societies and government to extend the cultivation of the crop to those di-
stricts in the south and svest of the kingdom, where, for various reasons, it was
most important that the means of occupation which it was found to afford in
Ulster should be rendered available, great difficulties were experienced, both
from the deficiency of skilled labour and the want of convenient markets for
the produce. Fortunately, at a time when great discouragements had been ex-
perienced by those who had entertained the expectation that the fertile soils

of the south of Ireland were destined to render our manufacturers independent
of the supplies of foreign countries, the attention of the flax-growers of Ulster
was directed to a system of flax management, proposed by an American

named Schenck, which appeared to remove all the difficulties of the old
system, and promised completely to revolutionize the ceconomy of the crop.
In the method of Mr. Schenck, as in the old system, a process of fermentation
is employed for the separation of the fibre ; but instead of the steeping being
conducted in the open air in shallow pools, it is made a factory operation,
and the requisite changes are accelerated by placing the rippled flax in water
maintained at an elevated temperature. This method is not new, but had
been proposed by Professor Scheidweiler in Belgium, and tried in this country
several years before the arrival of Mr. Schenck. It also appears to have
been employed by the Malays and the natives of Bengal ; but it is to the late
                  --

THE FLAX PliANT.  283

Mr. Schenck, and his successors, Messrs. Bernard and Koch, that the credit
of organizing establishments for working the process is to be ascribed.

   The advantages whicli the new system presented were most important :
   1st. By leading to the establishment of factories for the steeping of flax,
and the purchase of the crop from the farmer, who would thus be relieved
from the trouble of its preparation, it rendered it possible to extend the cul-
tivation of the crop beyond the bounds of the ordinary flax-growing districts.
   2nd. It introduced greater certainty and ceconomy into the preparation of

the fibre.
   3rd. It prevented the destruction of the valuable seed, and also increased

the per-centage of fibre. With these advantages, as might be expected, the
new system made rapid progress, and establishments were erected, not merely
in Ireland, but in England and Scotland, and the attention of several Con-
tinental countries was also at once directed to it.

   To enable you completely to understand the system of management pur-

sued at these establishments, one of which those interested in the subject
will have an opportunity of inspecting in the neighbourhood of Belfast,
I shall continue the description of the treatment of the experimental crop, of

which I have already given a portion of the history. When the crop had

been completely air-dried, by exposure in the field, so as to yield, as al-
ready stated, in the straw, when dried at 212°, only 12 per cent, of water,
it was removed to the steepiug-works at Cregagh. It was there placed in
stacks, and after some time prepared for steeping. The first operation for
this purpose is the removal of the valuable bolls or capsules. This, in these
establishments, where the cost of labour is carefully considered, is usually most
expeditiously and perfectly efl'ected by means of a machine composed of two
massive cast-iron rollers, to which motion is communicated by a belt from
the steam-engine. Between these the flax is passed and the capsules bruised,
so that the seed can be readily shaken out. Having been deprived of its
bolls by this machine, it was found that the 7770 lbs. of flax plants were
reduced to 52 cwt., or 5824' lbs.

   Of the portions of the plant removed by the seeding machine, 910 lbs. con-
sisted of clean seed, 1036 lbs. of husks, leaves, and sand. The vats to which
the flax is now removed are formed of wood, strongly bound together by
hoops, the oval shape being preferred. They are furnished with false bottoms,
pierced with holes beneath, through which, by means of a coil of pipe, as re-
presented in the drawing, steam is conveyed. The flax having been placed in

the vats, with the bundles resting on the butt or root ends, and in single layers,
as in the ordinary steeping-pools, a wooden frame is fixed above them, so as
to prevent their rising out of the water during the fermentation. The vats
are now filled with water, so as completely to cover the flax, and the steam-
cock opened so as gradually to raise the temperature to 90° F. The
overseers are furnished with thermometers, and instructed carefully to main-
tain the temperature at that point day and night. Reckoning from the time
at which the steam is admitted to the vats, the duration of the steeping
averages about sixty-six hours. W^hen the object is to obtain a very fine
fibre, the retting is continued for a longer period. The method of ascer-
taining the proper period for the removal of the flax from the water is the

same as has already been described as relied on by the common steeper.

--The loss experienced by the seeded flax in steeping was 13 cwt.
   Drying. When the steeping is completed, the flax is carried from the vats

to an adjoining apartment of the factory, and placed in layers upon tables,
«iid fixed by women in the di'ying holders. These consist of two wooden rods,
284 REPORT-- 1852.

5f feet long, between which a thin layer of flax is secured, by passing metal
rings over the ends of the holders, fifty holders being employed for about
1 cwt. of flax. Tlius secured, the holders are carried to open drying sheds,
and suspended from cross-beams. In three days, in favourable weather, the
drying is completed; but in damp weather it is placed in a hot chamber, to
heat which the waste steam of the steam-engine is employed.

  --Breaking and Scutching. As in the patent steeping establishments a

sufficient number of skilled workmen could not be at all times obtained, a
new impulse was given to the invention of machines capable of performing
the work of the hand-scutcher, and several ingenious and beautiful mecha-
nical arrangements have been proposed, both for breaking and scutching the
flax. In this department Belfast has produced some excellent examples, and
the machines of Messrs. M'Adam, Brothers and Co., and of Mr. Richard

Robinson, are to be found in almost every flax-growing district both in this

country and in England. From the 52 cwt. of seeded straw, the produce of
the experimental crop, there remained 6 cwt. 1 qr. 2 lbs. of marketable

fibre.

   After the introduction of the new system, and that several establishments
were occupied in the preparation of fibre, objections were made to the
quality of the material, and considerable doubts were expressed, both with
regard to the amount of produce obtained, and its adaptation for its various
uses. These objections, however, were at the time removed by experiments
instituted by experienced manufacturers, both in this country and at the admi-
rably-conducted works of the Messrs. Marshall in Yorkshire. In Messrs.
Marshall's experiments, samples of the products of which are on the table,
flax-straw grown in Holland was the material employed ; the steeping of a
portion was conducted at two establishments, on Schenck's system, while
another portion from the same lot was steeped in Holland in the ordinary
way. The results were regarded as in all respects confirmatory of the supe-
riority of the patent process ; and a Committee of the Royal Flax Society
also reported, that all objections with respect to any injurious influence of the
accelerate fermentation on the strength and bleaching qualities of the fibre
had been shown to be groundless, and that the yield of the fibre was greater
than when " the old, slovenly, and uncertain process of watering " was prac-

tised.

   The process of fermentation, as conducted in the patent establishments, so
far as my investigations have extended, does not appear in any respect to
present phsenomena ditFertnt from what I have observed in the ordinary
steeping-pools of the country, when only rippled flax is employed. Usually,
in eight or ten hours after the flax had been placed in the vats, a copious
extrication of gas is observed, and sometimes the vat becomes covered with a
head of froth, like the vat of the brewer ; and at this period an odour is
evolved in the establishment closely resembling that of the brewery. The
gas evolved at this period is chiefly carbonic acid. The liquid at the same
time exhibits a slight acid reaction. As the process continues the tem-

perature rises, so that an additional admission of steam is seldom required to
maintain the liquid at from 85 to 90 degrees. Towards the conclusion of
the operation, usually in about 60 hours, the escape of gas becomes less abun-
dant, and a covering of slimy matter collects on the surface of the liquid.

    The steep-water at this period has a light brown colour, is transparent,
and closely resembling bitter ale. It is strongly acid to litmus, but the

original blue colour of the test-paper is restored on drying.
    Its taste at first is rather agreeably acid, but followed by the peculiar
--

    THE FLAX PLANT.             285

plant-like taste of the flax. Contrary to what has been stated in some reports
on this subject, the liquid I found, at the conclusion of the process, j'ields
nearly a trace of acetic acid, and in numerous experiments no trace of the
evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen could be detected at any stage of the fer-

mentation. When the flax is allowed to remain in the vats after the usual

time, a new series of changes, and a fresh and rapid extrication of gas, take
place. I have made, during the last three years, numerous experiments
with respect to the composition of the steep-water from several establish-
ments, and also from the common steep-pools, which afforded me some inter-
esting results, and satisfied me that the fermentation which is induced by

steeping flax in water resembles the so-called butyric acid fermentation,
merely traces of acetic acid, and invariably hirge quantities of butyric acid,
having been detected in every case. In fact, the fragrant butyric aether, so
extensively employed in the preparation of pine-apple rum, and in flavouring
confectionery, might readily be obtained in large quantities from the stinking

waters of the flax-pool.

 --(Economy of the Flax Water. With regard to the refuse waters of the vats,

some years ago, upon the opening of Mr. Schenck's establishment in Belfast,
I made an analysis of the water in which the flax had been steeped, which

confirmed the conclusions to which I had been conducted, from my examina-

tions of the waters of the country steep-ponds, that an opinion which had

been promulgated by scientific authority, of the possibility of restoring to the
fields of the farmer all the ingredients abstracted from the soil during the
growth of the flax, by moans of the steep-water and other refuse parts of the
plant, was not, even supposing that these matters could be oeconomically
employed as manure, which is impossible, supported by investigations with
respect to the amount of fertilizing ingredients which they contained.

    Chemistry is, I conceive, contributing in no small degree to the progress
of agricultural knowledge. It has even already introduced greater ceconomy
into many departments of the farmer's business, and has opened up to him
new sources of fertilizing agents. But in some cases it is to be feared that
the chemist has himself raised obstacles to the reception of agricultural
science by the practical agriculturist, by proposals which, though capable of
being carried out in the laboratory, are totally inapplicable in the great
operations of the husbandman.

   To ascertain exactly the effect produced by steeping, and the composition
of the steep-water, I obtained from the works at Cregagh a sample of flax-
straw unsteeped, a portion of steeped straw taken from the same lot, and a

gallon of the steep-water taken from the vat immediately after the removal
of the flax. The composition of the ash obtained by burning the extract of

the steep-water, and the samples of the straw, is given in the Table. The
spring-water employed at the works is moderately hard, indicating, on Dr.
Clarke's scale, 8 degrees. It was not considered necessary to deduct the in-
gredients supplied in it, as these would a.dd but little to its fertilizing value.
An imperial gallon of the liquid of the vat was found to contain, in grains
and tenths,

  By the kindness of the proprietors of the Patent Steeping-Works at Cregagh,

who have liberally given me an opportunity of inspecting the books of their

establishment, I am enabled to give the following average statement of the

changes which 100 tons of flax undergo, when treated by Schenck's process.

 --Flax Cotton. The irregularity in the supply of cotton, the raw material

of an important allied branch of English manufacture, and of which it is cal-
culated the mills of the United Kingdom require annually a quantity equal
to 1000 tons daily, has at various times suggested attempts to convert our
indigenous flax into a form which might render it capable of being spun with
the ordinary cotton machinery. It appears that attempts to produce from
flax a substance possessing the properties of cotton, were many years ago
made by a Swede named Des Charmes, and that in 1775 Lady Moira com-
municated to the Society of Arts some experiments which, suggested by those
of the Swede, she had made in this country. Her ladyship's experiments are
to us peculiarly interesting, as her letters show that they were carried on at
her seat, the present residence of David Ker, Esq., M.P., only twelve miles
distant from Belfast. Neither Des Charmes' nor Lady Moira's experiments
seem to have led to any practical application of the proposed substitute for
the foreign material ; and though subsequent trials for the same purpose
were made by various persons, the public do not appear to have placed any
confidence in their plans. Lately, however, the project has been revived by
a Brazilian gentleman, the Chevalier Claussen, known to the public as the
inventor of an ingenious loom. This gentleman has been more successful than
THE FLAX PLANT.  28/

his predecessors in exciting attention, and his processes have been described

by several chemists of reputation in England, as affording a new and beauti-

ful application of the powers of chemistry to practical purposes. In every

part of Europe, indeed, much interest has been excited by the accounts which
have been published respecting his discoveries, which were regarded as cal-

culated to render Great Britain nearly altogether independent of foreign

supplies of cotton. The proposals of M. Claussen were not confined to cot-
tonizing flax, but also embraced a method of preparing long-line or fibre for
the flax-spinner, substituting for fermentation the more rapid action of a
weak solution of caustic soda, followed by boiling, or simple immersion in
water, acidulated with sulphuric or muriatic acid. The material employed

for the production of his cotton was at first unsteeped flax-straw ; but at

present I find that the flax in its original state is not used, and that the
refuse tow of the scutch-mills is preferred. This limitation of the application

of M. Claussen's patent removes some of the objections which were urged

against his original proposal to cut up valuable flax, so as to produce what
the opponents of the invention regarded as an inferior article ; now, however,
it is merely the waste tow of the scutching-mill, which can be purchased at
from £4" to £7 per ton, that is used in M. Claussen's establishments : and
from this, as tlie interesting series of samples which have been kindly

supplied to me by Dr. Ryan show, a beautiful material, capable, it is stated,

not merely of being spun with cotton machinery, but of being combined
with wool, silk, and other fibres, and exhibiting, apparently, that increased
affinity for colouring matters which Mr. Mercer has found to be possessed
by cotton fibre, acted upon by caustic alkali, has been obtained. The first
operation at M. Claussen's works is to pass the tow through a carding and
hackling machine, for the purpose of arranging its fibres parallel ; so straight-
ened, it is cut by another machine (somewhat similar in its operations to the
chaff-cutter of the farmer) into pieces of about one and a half inch in
length, and is then conveyed to the steeping vats. The vats are placed side
by side ; and by means of a cradle and a travelling railway, the tow can be
transferred from one to the other, as required. It is, in the first place,
steeped for twenty-four hours in a cold solution of caustic soda, of 1° "Twad-
del. The next step is to plunge it in another vat containing a similar solution,

but furnished with a steam-pipe, so that the liquid can be kept at a boiling

temperature for two hours. The peculiar part of the process, or the Claus-
senizing of the tow, is commenced by transferring the material prepared, as
described, to a third vat, which holds a solution containing 5 per cent,
carbonate of soda. It is allowed to remain immersed about an hour, so as to
be completely saturated with this liquid, and is then raised from the vat and

placed in a solution containing about one-half per cent, of sulphuric acid.
In the bath of sulphuric acid it is alleged that important chemical and me-
chanical changes are effected in the character of the flax fibre. It is stated

that it becomes at once changed, as if " by a new instance of natural magic,"
from a damp aggregation of flax to a light expansive mass of cottony texture,
increasing in size, like leavening dough or an expanding sponge; and this
material, it is asserted, can be produced at a cost not exceeding '2}d. per lb.,
which is considerably below the price at which cotton can be grown and
imported from the United States or any other cotton-producing country.
By a simple process of bleaching, and subsequently " carding," the tow thus
modified assumes both the texture and appearance of foreign cotton, and can
at once be employed by the cotton-spinner.

    With such alleged advantages to recommend it, it was not wonderful that
M. Claussen's proposal attracted the attention and excited the sympathies of
Mr. Porter and other eminent ceconomists, and that the late Lord Lieutenant
288 REPORT-- 1852.

of Ireland, the Earl of Clarendon, should desire that a scheme which promised
such important results to this country, so deeply interested in the production
of flax, should be carefully tested on a proper commercial scale.

   An inquiry having been committed to Sir Robert Kane, Director of the
Museum of CEconomic Geology, I was requested, together with Professors
Blyth and Murphy of Cork, to make sucJi investigations as might properly

ascertain the value of the various methods proposed. But, unfortunately,
the mechanical arrangements which had been made by M. Claussen's agents,
to illustrate the production of the new material from unsteeped flax, were not
capable of affording satisfactory results ; and, though some trials with tow
proved more successful, it was found impossible to carry out the object of the

inquiry at the locality selected. I am informed that it is the intention of

the patentees to solicit a full investigation of the methods pursued in their
operations at works which they have established near London, and where,
they state, the material is produced in large quantities. Tlie real value
however oi" Claussen's substitute for cotton must be decided by the ex-
perience of the manufacturers of England. With regard to the ceconomy of
the processes, it would be improper to give an opinion until the investigation
whicii M. Claussen solicits has taken place. The specimens show what can
be made from the waste tow of the spinner; and it is interesting to find both
Berthollet and Gay-Lussac, many years ago, pointing out the advantages
which appear here to be realized from the conversion of tow into a substitute

for cotton.

   I have now to request attention to a new process, entirely different from
any of those which have been described, and the first public announce-
ment of which I am permitted by the patentees to make to this meeting.
The methods adopted are the invention of Mr. Watt, a countryman and
namesake of the great philosopher. In this process neither fermentation nor

the action of acid nor alkaline solutions are employed, the separation of the
fibre from the useless matters of the straw being effected by subjecting the
stems to the action of steam, and afterwards by pressure applied by powerful
rollers. In the first place, Mr. Watt proposes to take seeded flax, and to ex-
pose it to steam, at the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere, in a close cham-

ber, of peculiar construction, so as to soften and dissolve out the gummy

and other soluble matters. The chambers which he employs are square
vessels constructed of wood, or of plates of cast iron, and provided with false

bottoms, formed of the perforated iron plates used in malt-kilns. Two doors

are placed in the ends of the chambers, for putting in and removing the flax.
The top of each vat is formed of cast-iron plates so arranged as to constitute
a shallow tank for containing water, and through which, extending for some
inches above the surface of the water, passes an iron pipe, Avhich commu-
nicates with the interior of the chamber. To the opening of this pipe a valve
is fixed, whicli can be opened or closed as required. Resting upon the false
bottom, there is an arrangement of pipes, which are intended to act like the
vomiter, or throw-pipe of the bleacher. The process is commenced by
placing the flax in bundles, as received from the seeding machine, on the
false bottom, until the chamber is nearly filled. The doors are then secured
by screws, and steam is discharged into the chamber by a pipe which passes
between the bottoms, and for some time allowed to escape through the valve-
pipe in the roof, so as to remove the volatile oil contained in the straw.
After some time the valve is closed ; and the escape of the steam being pre-
vented, it penetrates through the mass of the flax, softening' and loosening
its various parts. Water is now admitted into the metal tank, and the steam,
which strikes against the cooled roof of the chamber, is condensed and made
to descend in showers of distilled water, by which the soluble and softened
                           THE FLAX PLANT.                                  289

extractive matters are washed out and carried below the false bottom, and
conveyed by pipes into a reservoir and preserved. It is, however, proposed

at intervals, during the operation, to allow the flax liquid to accumulate until
it rises above the false bottom, and then, by the pressui-e of the steam, to
cause it to ascend in the throw-pipes, and to descend in streams over the
straw, so as completely to Mash away all the softened matters. In about ten

hours the entire operation may be completed, though tiie patentee regards
it advantageous to subject the flax to the action of the steam for from

twelve to eighteen hours.

The second part of Mr. Watt's process consists in submitting the straw, as

it is removed, softened and swollen, from the steam chambers to the success-
ive action of two pairs of very heavy iron rollers, somewhat resembling the
seeding rollers used in the hot- water steeping establishments, for the purpose

both of quickening the drying process, and of expressing any adherent colour-

ing or glutinous matter. By this operation, also, he finds that not only is the

drying facilitated, but that a considerable portion of the enveloping cuticle

of the stems is removed, and that the separation of the fibre in scutching is
rendered more perfect by the bruising and splitting up of the woody parts

consequent upon the longitudinal pressure to which they are exposed under

the rollers. This new method, which is in operation at present in the extensive
works of Messrs. Leadbetter in this town, appears to offer most striking ad-

vantages. It is peculiarly adapted for rendering the separation of the fibre a

manufacturing operation. No disagreeable smelling odours are evolved ; and,

if experience confirms the expectations of the patentees with respect to the

quality of the fibre obtained, and the comparatively low expenditure required

in its production, the new process will, in no trifling degree, contribute to

the extension of flax cultivation in this countrj'.

  A striking peculiarity of this process, and one which renders it exceedingly

interesting to the scientific agriculturist, is, that it oflFers the only satisfactory

method of ceconomizing the matters which are dissolved from the flax plant
in its treatment. The dark liquid which accumulates in the lower chamber

of the vat can be obtained in a most concentrated form ; it is totally free

from the disagreeable odour of the flax-pool, and experiments which have

been tried prove that it is found by pigs a palatable and nutritious food.

   I have to apologize for the length to which this Report has extended, and I
feel that some of the details which I have included in it may appear unneces-
sary to those who are familiar with the various process of the flax manufac-
ture; but as many persons present, though acquainted with the beautiful

fabrics, which, in every market in Europe and America, attest the skill and
ingenuity of the linen manufacturers of Ulster, have probably now for the

first time visited a district which, like the north of Ireland, on every side

exhibits, in its steeping-establishments, busy flax-mills and extensive bleach-

greens evidences of the advantages which this country has derived from the
cultivation and skilful management of the flax plant, I trust, that, whilst in-

specting the various processes to which our manufacturers have liberally invited

the attention of the members of the Association, the outline which I have en-

deavoured to give them of the ceconomy of the crop may tend to increase
their interest in this important department of our national industry. And if
my remarks on the composition of the plant and the various plans proposed for
the preparation of its valuable fibre should induce any of those whom I have

the honour to address to undertake investigations which maj' contribute to
improve either the agricultural or technical management of the crop, the

present visit of the British Association will be regarded, if possible, with still

greater satisfaction by the manufacturers of Ulster.

Supplementary Report on the Fauna of Ireland ky the late William
   Thompson, Esq., President of the Belfast Natural History and

    Philosophical Society.

Robert Patterson and James R. Garrett, Esqs., the two gentlemen by

whom this communication was brought forward, gave the following explana-

--tion as to the circumstances under which it was prepared : At the Meetings

of the British Association held in the years 1840 and 1843, Mr. Thompson

presented Reports on the Fauna of Ireland, drawn up by him at the request

--of the Association. Shortly after his imtimely decease in February last

(1852), his MSS. were in pursuance of directions contained in his will

handed over to the two gentlemen above-named, with a \aew to publication,

-- --so as to complete his work on the Natural History of Ireland, three vols, of

which on the Birds of Ireland had appeared during the author's lifetime.

On examination of these MSS., a memorandum was found containing a list of

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       j

the papers which it had been Mr. Thompson's intention to submit to the

Belfast meetuig           of                    the Association,  and,  amongst  others,  there  was  specified
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \

a supplement to his former reports. The materials of this Supplement were ;

also discovered, partly arranged, and it was considered desirable that th^;

author's intentions should be carried out as far as possible. The remaining
volumes of " The Natural History of Ireland " being in course of preparation
for the press, the present communication was confined to an enumeration of
the several species of animals now recorded as Irish, but which had not
been made known at the date of the publication of Mr. Thompson's previous

reports.

ON THE METEOROLOGY OF BIRMINGHAM.                                    297

Observations on the Meteorology of Birmingham.

       By William Wills, Esq., F.G.S.

The accompanying Tables have been compiled from a Meteorological

Register kept at the Birmingham Philosophical Institution.

The observations for temperature, pressure, rain and wind, extend over a

period of eight years, from 1837 to 1844 inclusive. The dew-point tables

embrace a period of five years, from 1838 to 1842 inclusive; and the evapo-

ration tables the two years of 1843 and 1844 only. The whole of these

observations, with the exception of those for the four months from August

to November 1844, were made by the late Dr. Ick, the Curator of that

Institution, whose accuracy as an observer is well known ; the observations
for the excepted months were made by a gentleman who acted as his sub-

stitute during his last illness, and continued to do so for a short time after

his death, and as they bear internal marks of care and accuracy, I have not

hesitated to incorporate them with those of Dr. Ick.

   This Register came into my possession during an ofRcial connection with

the above-mentioned Institution, and from the care with which it appeared

to have been kept, the long period over which it extends, and the importance

of Birmingham as a meteorological station, it occurred to me that a reduction

of the recorded observations was likely to repay the necessary labour, and

that the results would probably form an acceptable contribution to this de-

partment of knowledge ; and the rather so, that with the exception of Mr.

Osier's papers on the winds, contained in the Reports of the Association,

I am not aware of the existence of any long-continued series of trustworthy

observations on the Meteorology of Birmingham.

I will briefly notice the subjects of these observations, and recapitulate

their chief results.

  --1 . Temperature (Tables I. to VII.). The instruments were placed in the

shade, for the first two years 4§ feet, and subsequently about 38 feet above

the ground, and about 437 and 470 feet respectively above the mean level

of the sea, the place of suspension being nearly in the centre of the town of

Birmingham. In consequence of breakages, the same instruments were not

employed throughout the whole series of observations, so that it has not been

possible to submit them to verification. The self-registering thermometer

was of Rutherford's construction.

 --The mean monthly and annual temperatures are deduced in Tables I., II.,

III., first, from continuous daily observations at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. local

time ; secondly, from the highest and lowest daily markings of the self-regis-
tering thermometer ; and thirdly, from the highest and lowest annual indica-

tions of the same instrument.

   The mean annual temperature for eight years, as deduced,          49°"90
1st. From the daily observations at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., is
2nd. From the highest and lowest daily observations of the self-

registering thermometer                \                             49°'17

3rd. From the highest and lowest yearly observations of the self-

registering thermometer                                              SO^'OO

ith. The mean temperature of the five years, from 1838 to 1842

inclusive (see Table XXL), which excludes the year 1837

and the unusually warm years 1843 and 1844, is                       49°'694<

Of these amounts some portion is doubtless due to the great number of

our manufacturing and domestic fires.

In Table IV. is shown the distribution of the temperature through the

several meteorological seasons, with the differences from the mean.
                --

299                          BEPOit,T<^1852.

The Tables III., V., VI. exhibit the mean range of the self-registering

thermometer through the several years, months and seasons, with the differ-
ences from the seasonal and annual means. The mean annual range of

temperature is 64-°"25, and the mean monthly range 32°'51 ; while the greatest
monthly range, that of April, is 6°"49 in excess, and the least monthly ranges,

namely, those of November and December, are severally 4'°*95 in defect

from the general mean.

In Table VII. is given the number of days on which the self-registering

thermometer was at or below  32°                 the average yearly number being 53.
                                              ;
--2. Barometric pressure (Tables VIII., IX., X., XL). The instrument

employed was a standard barometer of Newman's construction, of '5^Q in.

bore, with moveable brass scale, and which had been compared with the

flint-glass barometer at the Royal Society's rooms. The cistern was 18 feet

above the ground, and about 44'7 feet above the mean level of the sea.

The Tables VIII., IX., X. exhibit the mean monthly and annual barometric

pressure, deduced from observations at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., corrected for tem-

perature, with its distribution through the several meteorological seasons, the

corresponding barometrical ranges, and the differences of pressure and range

between each season, and the general mean of the several seasons.

   The mean annual barometric pressure is 2y"381 inches, from which the

--greatest yearly difference in excess is +*084;in., and in defect '109 in.

   In Table XI. is shown the mean monthly and annual pressures as derived
from the highest and lowest of the pressures at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. The mean
annual pressure thus obtained is 29303 in., differing from the mean of the

two daily observations by "078 in. only.

   In the synoptical Table XXI. the barometric pressure is resolved into its
gaseous and vapour constituents; and their mean monthly amounts, shown

for the period of five years, comprised in the dew-point register, namely, from

1838 to 184!2 inclusive, with their respective differences from the several

annual means :

                                                 Inches.

     The mean annual gaseous pressure is         29*065

     Ditto vapour pressure                       '324;

                   Total pressure (from 5 years' observations). . 29*389
   This result differs from that obtained from the mean of the daily obser-

--vations for eight years by only -f- '008 in.
   3. Rain (Tables XII. to XV.). The receiver of the rain-gauge was placed
38 feet above the ground, and about 470 feet above the mean level of the sea.
The quantities which fell were registered daily at 9 a.m. The average annual
amount was 25*258 in. The tables show the distribution of the aggregate
annual amounts through the several months and meteorological seasons, with
the differences from the means ; and also the number of days on which rain
fell in each year and season, and their mean monthly and annual numbers.

   The greatest excess in any year above the average amount was in 1839,
when it amounted to about -|- 3*907 in., and the greatest deficiency in 1844-,
when it amounted to --5*332 in., making a total difference between the two
years of 9*269 in. The mean monthly quantity is 2*105 in., which, on the
average of eight years, is exceeded in November, February, July, August,
September, and October, in the order of enumeration. The smallest monthly
amount falls in April, and next to that month, in December, after which fol-
low, in order of dryness, March, May and June.

   The greatest quantities of rain fell iu the several seasons in the following

order, nanjely, autumn, summer, winter, spring.
            ON THE METEOROLOGY OP BIRMINGHAM.                            299

 --4. Deto-point (Tables XVI. XVII.). The dew-point register extends over

five years, from 1838 to 184'2 inclusive. The Table XVI. shows the monthly

and annual means as derived from observations made daily at 9 a.m. and

3 P.M. with Daniell's hygrometer.

The mean annual dew-point from Table XVI. is 44°'95, while the same

result deduced in Table XVII. from the highest and lowest monthly dew-

point at the above-mentioned hours is 44'°'18.

Adopting the first quantity, 4'4'°-95, the mean annual dryness of the climate

of Birmingham is 4<°*95, and its mean humidity (complete saturation being

represented by unity) is =0*707 ; and consequently tlie weight of vapour in

a cubic foot of air is =S*03 grs., and the quantity required for saturation

--about 1*28 gr.
   5. Evaporation (Table XVIII.). The amount of evaporation is recorded

for two years only, namely^ 184'3 and 184'4; ; and was registered daily at 9 a.m.,

by Howard's evaporation gauge, which was placed 37 feet above the ground.

In 1843 the greatest amount took place in the months of June, July and

August, and the least in February; while in 1844? the greatest amount took

place in the months of May, June and July, and the least in December.

The total amount of evaporation was, for 1843, 32*166 in., and for 1844,

35-113 in.

6. Winds (Tables XIX. XX.).~The Table XIX. records the direction of

the winds at 9 a.m., through the several months of the years 1837 to 1844

inclusive ; Table XX. being a summary of the aggregate number of the

several winds throughout that period, with the corresponding barometric

pressures, reduced to 32°, with their variations from the mean. The mean of

the barometric pressures at 9 a.m. was 29*403 in. ; differing only by -f-*014 in.
from the mean of the observations at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.; and the forces, as

shown by the pressures, balance each other to the hundredth of an inch.

The prevailing winds at Birmingham are from the S.W., S., and S.S.W. in

the order indicated. Of 2914 registered winds, not fewer than 906, or nearly

one-third, blew from those quarters alone; namely, from the S.W. 341, from

the S. 300, and from the S.S.W. 265.

It is an anomalous fact, of which I do not understand the cause, that the

barometer is lower with the S.E. than with the S.W. winds, the mean pres-

--sure with the S.E. winds being 29*191, and with the S.W. winds 29*347.
   Conclusion. In the synoptical Table XXI. the meteorological elements of

temperature, pressure, and dew-point, during the five years for which the

materials of comparison exist, are brought into juxtaposition; and in the ap-

pended curves (Plate V.) these elements are represented graphically.

It is not my intention to enter into any enumeration or discussion of the

many interesting deductions suggested by the before-mentioned tables. I

may, however, remark, in general, that they exhibit some important results

in comparison with similar tables constructed from data derived from other

localities, and show a marked difference between the climate of the south-

western and other parts of our island and its interior ; and illustrate, more-

over, the influence of situation and local circumstances, even at moderate

distances, in modifying the general laws of climate, and their influence on

human health, longevity, and enjoyment.

The striking accordance of form between the accompanying curves and

Blmilar ones formed by numerous observers, from facts obtained at different

and widely separated places, is strongly corroborative of the simplicity,

uniformity, and universality of the laws by which the great agencies of me-

teorologic change are restrained from destructive irregularity and excess,

and controlled and adjusted, with the nicest exactness, to the exigences of

animal and vegetable e)dstence.                 - (·>

ON THE VORTEX WATER-WHEEL.                                   SljT

On the Vortex Water-Wheel. By James Thomson, A.M., Civil

                                            Engineer, Belfast.

[A Communication ordered to be printed among tlie Reports.]

Numberless are the varieties, both of principle and of construction, in the

mechanisms by which motive power may be obtained from falls of water.

--The chief modes of action of the water are, however, reducible to three, as

follows : First, The water may act directly by its weight on a part of the

mechanism which descends while loaded with water, and ascends while free

from load. The most prominent example of the application of this mode is

afforded by the ordinary bucket water-wheel. Secondly, The water may act

by fl'.iid pressure, and drive before it some yielding part of a vessel by which

it is confined. This is the mode in which the water acts in the water-pressure

engine, analogous to the ordinary high-pressure steam-engine. Thirdly, The

water, having been brought to its place of action subject to the pressure due
to the height of fall, may be allowed to issue through small orifices with a

high velocity, its inertia being one of the forces essentially involved in the

communication of the power to the moving part of the mechanism. Through-

out the general class of water-wheels called Turbines, which is of wide extent,

the water acts according to some of the variations of which this third mode

is susceptible. The name Turbine is derived from the Latin word turbo, a

top, because the wheels to which it is applied almost all spin round a vertical

axis, and so bear some considerable resemblance to the top. In our own

country, and more especially on the Continent, turbines have attracted much

attention, and many forms of them have been made known by published

descriptions. The subject of the present communication is a new water-

wheel, which belongs to the same general class, and which has recently been

invented and brought successfully into use by the author.

In this machine the moving wheel is placed within a chamber of a nearly

circular form. The water is injected into the chamber tangentially at the

circumference, and thus it receives a rapid motion of rotation. Retaining

this motion it passes onwards towards the centre, where alone it is free to
make its exit. The wheel, which is placed within the chamber, and which

almost entirely fills it, is divided by thin partitions into a great number of

radiating passages. Through these passages the water must flow on its

course towards the centre ; and in doing so it imparts its own rotatory mo-

tion to the wheel. The whirlpool of water acting within the wheel chamber,

being one principal feature of this turbine, leads to the name Vortex as a

suitable designation for the machine as a whole.

The vortex admits of several modes of construction, but the two principal

forms are the one adapted for high falls and the one for low falls. The

former may be called the High-pressure Vortex, and the latter the Low-pres-

sure Vortex*. Examples of these two kinds, in operation at two mills near

Belfast, are delineated in Plates 1 and 2, with merely a few unimportant

deviations from the actual constructions.

Plates 1 and 2 are respectively a vertical section, and a plan of a vortex

of the high-pressure kind in use at the Low Lodge Mill near Belfast, for

AAgrinding Indian cornf. In these figures  is the water-wheel. It is fixed

   * These terms correspond to Hochdruckturbine, and Niederdruckturbine, used in Germany

to express the like distinction in turbines.

   f This vortex was only in course of erection at the time of the meeting of the British
Association in Belfast. The water-wheel itself, removed from its case, being light and of small
dimensions, was exhibited in Section G. It is composed chiefly of thick-tinned iron plates
united by soft solder.

on the upright shaft, B, whicli conveys away the power to the machinery

to be driven. The water-wheel occupies the central part of the upper di-

vision of a strong cast-iron case, CC ; and the part occupied by the wheel

DDis called the wheel chamber.   is the lower division of the case, and is

called the supply chamber. It receives the water directly from the supply

pipe, of which the lower extremity is shown at E, and delivers it into the

outer part of the upper division, by four large openings, F, in the parti-

tion between the two divisions. The outer part of the upper division is

called the guide-blade chamber, from its containing four guide-blades, G,

which direct the water tangentially into the wheel-chamber. Immediately

after being injected into the wheel-chamber the water is received by the

curved radiating passages of the wheel, which are partly seen in figure 2, at

a place where both the cover of the wheel-chamber and the upper plate of

the wheel are broken away for the purpose of exposing the interior to view.

The water, on reaching the inner ends of these curved passages, having

already done its work, is allowed to make its exit by two large central orifices,

Lshown distinctly on the figures at the letters L, ; the one leading upwards

and the other downwards. It then simply flows quietly away ; for, the vortex

being submerged under the surface of the water in the tail race, the water

on being discharged wastes no part of the fall by a further descent. At the

central orifices, close joints between the case and the wheel, to prevent the

escape of water otherwise than through the wheel itself, are made by means

of two annular pieces, L, L, caWed joint-rings, fitting to the central orifices of

the case, and capable of being adjusted, by means of studs and nuts, so as to
come close to the wheel without impeding its motion by friction. The four

openings, H, H, Plates 1 and 2, through which the water flows into the wheel-

chamber, each situated between the point or edge of one guide-blade and the

middle of the next, determine, by their width, the quantity of water admitted,

and consequently the power of the wheel. To render this power capable of

being varied at pleasui-e, the guide-blades are made moveable round gudgeons

or centres near their points ; and a spindle, K, is connected with the guide-
blades by means of links, cranks, &c. (see the Plates) in such a way that,

when the spindle is moved, the four entrance orifices are all enlarged or con-

tracted alike. This spindle, K, for working the guide-blades is itself worked

by a handle in a convenient position in the mill ; and the motion is commu-
nicated from the handle through the medium of a worm and sector, which

not only serve to multiply the force of the man's hand, but also to prevent

the guide-blades from being liable to the accident of slapping suddenly shut

from the force of the water constantly pressing them inwards. The gudgeons

of the guide-blades, seen in fig. 2 as small circles, are sunk in sockets in the

floor and roof of the guide-blade chamber ; and so they do not in any way

obstruct the flow of the water.

M, in Plate 1, is the pivot-box of the upright shaft. It contains, fixed

within it, an inverted brass cup, shown distinctly on the figure ; and the cup
revolves on an upright pin, or pivot, with a steel top. The pin is held sta-

tionary in a bridge, N, which is itself attached to the bottom of the vortex-

case. For adjusting the pin as to height, a little cross bridge, O, is made to

bear it up, and is capable of being raised or lowered by screws and nuts

shown distinctly on the figure. Also, for preventing the pin from gradually

becoming loose in its socket in the large bridge, two pinching-screws are

Arequired, of which one is to be seen in the figure.  small pipe, fixed at its

lower end into the centre of the inverted brass cup, and sunk in an upright

groove in the vortex-shaft (see the Plates), aff'ords the means of supplying

oil to the rubbing surfaces, over which the oil is spread by a radial groove in
               ON THE VORTfiX WATER-WHEEL.                      319

Athe brass.    cavity, shown ia the Plates, is provided at the lower part of

the cup, for the purpose of preventing the oil from being rapidly washed

away by the water*.

Four tie-bolts, marked P, bind the top and bottom of the case together, so

as to prevent the pressure of the water from causing the top to spring up,

and so occasioning leakage at the guide-blades or joint-rings.

   The height of the fall for this vortex is about 37 feet, and the standard or
medium quantity of water, for which the dimensions of the various parts of
the wheel and case are calculated, is 540 cubic feet per minute. With this

fall and water supply the estimated power is 28 horse power, the efficiency

being taken at 75 per cent. The proper speed of the wheel, calculated in

accordance with its diameter and the velocity of the water entering its cham-

ber, is 355 revolutions per minute. The diameter of the wheel is 22-|- inches,

. and the extreme diameter of the case is 4; feet 8 inches.

    A low-pressure vortex, constructed for another mill near Belfast, is repre-

sented in vertical section and plan in Plates 3 and 4. This is essentially the

same in principle as the vortex already described, but it diflFers in the material

of which the case is constructed, and in the manner in which the Avater is led

to the guide- blade chamber. Ln this the case is almost entirely of wood ; and,
for simplicity, the drawings represent it as if made of wood alone, though in

reality, to suit the other arrangements of the mill, brick-work, in certain

parts, was substituted for the wood. The water flows with a free upper sur-

face, W, W, into this wooden case, which consists chiefly of two wooden

AAtanks,  and BB, one within the other. The water-wheel chamber and

the guide-blade chamber are situated in the open space between the bottom

of the outer and that of the inner tank, and will be readily distinguished by
reference to the figures. The water of the head race, having been led all

round the outer tank in the space CC, flows inwards over its edge, and passes

downwards by the space DD, between the sides of the two tanks. It then

passes through the guide-blade chamber and the water-wheel, just in the

same way as was explained in respect to the high-pressure vortex already

described ; and in this one likewise it makes its exit by two central orifices,
the one discharging upwards and the other downwards. The part of the

water which passes downwards flows away at once to the tail race, and that

which passes upwards into the space E within the innermost tank, finds a
free escape to the tail race through boxes and other channels, F and G,

provided for that purpose. The wheel is completely submerged under the

surface of the water in the tail race, which is represented at its ordinary level

at YYY, Plate 3, although in floods it may rise to a much greater height.
The power of the wheel is regulated in a similar way to that already de-

scribed in reference to the high-pressure vortex. In this case, however, as

will be seen by the figures, the guide-blades are not linked together, but each

is provided with a hand-wheel, H, by which motion is communicated to

itself alone.

    * Great stress has been by continental engineers and authors laid on the supposed neces-
sity for oiling the pivots of turbines. The autlior of the present communication has thus been
led to endeavour to find and adopt the best means for oiling pivots vporking under water. The
oiling, however, is a source of much trouble ; and he has found in the course of his experience,
that pivots of the kind described above, made with brass working on hard steel, and with a
radial groove in the brass suitable for spreading water over the rubbing surfaces, will last well
without any oil being supplied. The rapid destruction, which is commonly reported as having
been of frequent occurrence in turbine pivots, he believes may in many cases have arisen from
the employment of an inverted cup like a diving-bell as one of the rubbing parts, without any
provision for the escape of air from the cup. It is evident that a pivot of this kind, although

under water, might be perfectly dry at the rubbing surfaces.
--320 REPORT 1852.

In this vortex, the fall being taken at 7 feet, the calculated quantity of

water admitted, at the standard opening of the guide-blades, is 24'60 cubic

feet per minute. Then, the efficiency of the wheel being taken at 15 per cent.,

its power will be 24 horse power. Also the speed at which the wheel is

calculated to revolve is 48 revolutions per minute.

In connexion with the pivot of this wheel arrangements are made which

provide for the perfect lubrication of the rubbing surfaces with clean oil.

The lower end of the upright revolving shaft enters a stationary pivot box, K,

through an opening made oil-tight by hemp and leather packing. Within

the box there is a small stationary steel plate on which the shaft revolves.

Within the box, also, there are two oil-chambers, one situated above and

round the rubbing surface of this plate, and the other underneath the plate.

A constant circulation of the oil is maintained by centrifugal force, which

causes it to pass from the lower chamber upwards through a central orifice

in the steel plate, then outwards through a radial groove in the bottom of

the revolving shaft to the upper chamber, then downwards back to the lower

chamber, by one or more grooves at the circumference of the steel plate.

The purpose intended to be served by the provision of the lower chamber

combined with the passages for the circulation of the oil, is to permit the

oil, while passing through the lower chamber, to deposit any grit or any

worn metal which it may contain, so that it may be maintained clean and

may be washed over the upper surface of the steel plate at every revolution

Aof the radial groove in the bottom of the shaft.    pipe leading from an oil

cistern, L, in an accessible situation conducts oil to the upper chamber of the

pivot-box ; and another pipe leaves the lower chamber, and terminates, at
its upper end, in a stop-cock, M. This arrangement allows a flow of oil to

be obtained at pleasure from the cistern, down by the one pipe, then through

the pivot-box, and then up by the other pipe, and out by the cock. Thus,

if any stoppage were to occur in the pipes, it could be at once detected ; or

if water or air were contained in the pivot-box after the first erection, or at

any other time, the water could be removed by the pipe leading to the stop-

cock, or the air would of itself escape by the pipe leading to the cistern,

which, as well as the other pipe, has a continuous ascent from the pivot-box.

Certainty may consequently be attained that the pivot really works in clean oil.

The author was led to adopt the pivot-box closed round the shaft with oil

tight stuffing, from having learned of that arrangement having been sucess-

fully employed by Kdchlin, an engineer of Miihlhausen. As to the other

parts of the arrangements just described, he believes the settling chamber

with the circulation of oil to be new, and he regards this part of the arrange-

ments as being useful also for pivots working not under water. In respect

to the materials selected for the rubbing parts, however, he thinks it necessary

to state that some doubts have arisen as to the suitableness of wrought iron

to work on steel even when perfectly lubricated ; and he would, therefore,
recommend that a small piece of brass should be fixed into the bottom of the

shaft, all parts being made to work in the manner already explained.

The two examples which have now been described of vortex water-wheels

adapted for very distinct circumstances, will serve to indicate the principal

features in the structural arrangements of these new machines in general.

Respecting their principles of action some farther explanations will next be

given. In these machines the velocity of the circumference is made the

same as the velocity of the entering water, and thus there is no impact

between the water and the wheel ; but, on the contrary, the water enters the

radiating conduits of the wheel gently, that is to say, with scarcely any

motion in relation to their mouths. In order to attain the equalization of
        ON THE VORTEX WATER-WHEEL..                          321.

these velocities, it is necessary that the circumference of the wheel should

move with the velocity which a heavy body M^ould attain in falling through

a vertical space equal to half the vertical fall of the water, or in other words,

with the velocity due to half the fall; and that the orifices through which

the water is injected into the wheel-chamber should be conjointly of such

area that when all the water required is flowing through them, it also may

have a velocity due to half the fall. Thus one-half only of the fall is em-

ployed in producing velocity in the water ; and, therefore, the other half still

remains acting on the water within the wheel-chamber at the circumference

of the wheel in the condition of fluid pressure. Now, with the velocity

already assigned to the wheel, it is found that this fluid pressure is exactly

that which is requisite to overcome the centrifugal force of the water in the

wheel, and to bring the water to a state of rest at its exit, the mechanical

work due to both halves of the fall being transferred to the wheel during the

combined action of the moving water and the moving wheel. In the fore-

going statements, the effects of fluid friction, and of some other modifying

influences, are, for simplicity, left out of consideration ; but in the practical
application of the principles, the skill and judgement of the designer must be

exercised in taking all such elements as far as possible into account. To

aid in this, some practical rules, to which the author as yet closely adheres,

were made out by him previously to the date of his patent. These are to be

found in the specification of the patent, published in the Mechanics'

Magazine for Jan. 18 and Jan. 25, 1851 (London).

In respect to the numerous modifications of construction and arrangement

which are admissible in the Vortex, while the leading principles of action are

--retained, it may be sufficient here merely to advert, first, to the use (as

explained in the specification of the patent) of straight instead of curved

radiating passages in the wheel; secondly, to the employment, for simplicity,

of invariable entrance orifices, or of fixed instead of moveable guide-blades
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and lastly, to the placing of the wheel at any height, less than about thirty feet,

above the water in the tail race, combined with the employment of suction

pipes descending from the central discharge orifices, and terminating in the

water of the tail race, so as to render available the part of the fall below the

wheel.

In relation to the action of turbines in general, the chief and most commonly

recognised conditions, of which the accomplishment is to be aimed at, are

that the water should flow through the whole machine with the least possible

resistance, and that it should enter the moving wheel without shock, and be

discharged from it with only a very inconsiderable velocity. The vortex is

in a remarkable degree adapted for the fulfilment of these conditions. The

water moving centripetally (instead of centrifugally, which is more usual in

turbines) enters at the period of its greatest velocity (that is, just after passing

the injection orifices) into the most rapidly moving part of the wheel, the

circumference ; and, at the period when it ought to be as far as possible

deprived of velocity, it passes away by the central part of the wheel, the part

which has the least motion. Thus in each case, that of the entrance and

that of the discharge, there is an accordance between the velocities of the

moving mechanism and the proper velocities of the water.

The principle of injection from without inwards, adopted in the vortex,

affords another important advantage in comparison with turbines having the

contrary motion of the water; as it allows ample room, in the space outside

of the wheel, for large and well-formed injection channels, in which the

water can be made very gradually and regularly to converge to the most

contracted parts, where it is to have its greatest velocity. It is as a con-

1852.                                                     Y
--322 REPORT 1852.

comitant also of the same principle, that the very simple and advantageous
mode of regulating the power of the wheel by the moveable guide-blades
already described can be introduced. This mode, it is to be observed, while
giving great variation to the areas of the entrance orifices, retains at all times
very suitable forms for the converging water channels.

    Another adaptation in the vortex is to be remarked as being highly bene-
ficial, that namely according to which, by the balancing of the contrary fluid
pressures due to half the head of water and to the centrifugal force of the
water in the wheel, combined with the pressure due to tiie ejection of the
water backwards from the inner ends of the vanes of the wheel when they
are curved, only one-half of the work due to the fall is spent in commu-
nicating vis viva to the Mater, to be afterwards taken from it during its
passage through the wheel ; the remainder of the work being communicated
through the fluid pressure to the wheel, without any intermediate generation
of vis viva. Thus the veiocitj' of the water, where it moves fastest in the
machine, is kept comparatively low ; not exceeding that due to half the
height of the fall, while in other turbines the water usually requires to act at
much higher velocities. In many of them it attains at two successive times
the velocity due to the whole fall. The much smaller amount of action, or
agitation, with which the water in the vortex performs its work, causes a
material saving of power by diminishing the loss necessarily occasioned by

fluid friction.

    In the Vortex, further, a very favourable influence on the regularity of the
motion proceeds from the centrifugal force of the water, which, on any in-
crease of the velocity of the wheel, increases, and so checks the water supply ;
and on any diminution of the velocity of the wheel, diminishes, and so admits
the water more freely ; thus counteracting, in a great degree, the irregularities

of speed arising from variations in the work to be performed. When the

work is subject to great variations, as for instance in saw-mills, in bleaching
works, or in forges, great inconvenience often arises with the ordinary
bucket water-wheels and with turbines which discharge at the circumference,
from their running too quickly when any considerable diminution occurs in

the resistance to their motion.

    The first vortex which was constructed on the large scale was made in Glas-
gow, to drive a new beetling-mill of Messrs. C. Hunter and Co., of Dunadry, in
County Antrim. It was the only one in action at the time of the Meeting
of the British Association in Belfast ; but the two which have been particularly
described in the present article, and one for an unusually high fall, 100 feet,
have since been completed and brought into operation. There are also
several others in progress ; of which it may be sufficient to particularize one
of great dimensions and power, for a new flax-mill at Ballyshannon in the
West of Ireland. It is calculated for working at 150 horse-power, on a fall
of 14 feet, and it is to be impelled by the water of the River Erne. This
great river has an ample reservoir in the Lough of the same name ; so that
the water of wet weather is long retained, and continues to supply the river
abundantly even in the dryest weather. The lake has also the efi'ect of
causing the floods to be of long duration, and the vortex will consequently
be, through a considerable part of the year, and for long periods at a time,
deeply submerged under back-water. The water of the tail race will fre-
quently be 7 feet above its ordinary summer level ; but as the water of the
head race will also rise to such a height as to maintain a sufficient difl"erence
of levels, the action of the wheel will not be deranged or impeded by the
floods. These circumstances have had a material influence in leading to the
adoption in the present case of this new wheel in preference to the old breast

or undershot wheels.

        FOODS, IN RELATION TO RESPIRATION AND FEEDING. 323

On the Composition of Foods, in relation to Respiration and the Feeding
   of Animals, By J. B. Lawes, Esq., of Rothamsted ; and J. H.
   GibBERT, Ph.D., F.C.S.

During the last twelve years our knowledge of the adaptation of food,

according to its composition, to the various exigences of the animal system,

has assumed much of definiteness ; and it is to the experiments and writings

MM.of Boussingault, Liebig and Dumas, that we must attribute, either

directly or indirectly, much of the progress that has been made. There are,
however, connected with this important subject still many open questions

and it is with the hope of aiding the solution of one or two of these, and thus
providing a new starting-point for further inquiry, that we propose iu the
present paper to bring forward some results of our own which bear upon
them, and to point out the conclusions to which they appear to us to lead.

   The writers to whom we have above referred, as well as many others,

whether themselves experimenters or more systematic writers on the subject
of the chemistry of food, may, with few exceptions, and with some limita-
tions, be said to agree on two main points, viz. on the one hand, as to the
connection of the nitrogenous constituents of the food, with the formation in
the animal body of compounds containing nitrogen, and with the exercise of
force ; and on the other, as to the general relationship of the «ow-nitrogenous
constituents of the food with respiration, and with the deposition of animal
fat. It is indeed upon the assumption of this broad and fundamental classi-
fication of the constituents of food, according to their varied offices in the
animal oeconomy, that a vast series of analyses of foods have of late years
been made and published ; whilst, founded upon the results of these analyses,
numerous tables have been constructed, professing to arrange the current
articles of diet both of man and other animals, according to their comparative

values as such. Among the labourers in this field of inquiry, we are much
indebted to MM. Liebig, Dumas, Boussingault, Payen, Playfair, E. D.
Thomson, Horsford, Schlossberger and Kemp, and others.

   When speaking generally then, of the various requirements of the animal

organism, the more special adaptations of the several proximate compounds
and ultimate elements of which our vegetable and animal aliments are made
up, are, as we have already said, fully admitted ; but in attempting to apply to
practice the principles herein involved by the construction of tables of the
comparative value of foods, it seems to have been generally assumed, that our
current food-stuffs are thus measurable rather by their flesh-forming than by
their more specially respiratory and fat-forming capacities. Hence, with
some limitations, the per-centage of nitrogen has always been taken as the
standard of comparison.

   Founded upon their per-centage of nitrogen, M. Boussingault first arranged

tables of the comparative values of different articles of food, chiefly in refer-
ence to the dieting of the animals of the farm ; and with this method Professor

--Liebig has expressed his concurrence. At page 369 of the 3rd edition of his

Chemical Letters, he says " The admirable experiments of Boussingault
prove, that the increase in the weight of the body in the fattening or feeding
of stock (just as is the case with the supply of milk obtained from milch
cows), is in proportion to the amount of plastic constituents in the daily

--supply of fodder." And at page 349 of the same, speaking of the nitrogenous

compounds of food, he says "It is found that animals require for their
support less of any vegetable food in proportion as it is richer in these
peculiar matters, and cannot be nourished by vegetables in which these

matters are absent."
    In like manner, various specimens of flour and of bread have been arranged

by Dr. R. D. Thomson ; other articles of vegetable diet by Mr. Horsford ; and

                                                                      y2

MM.a large series of aliments from the animal kingdom by  Schlossberger

and Kemp. Dr. Anderson also, in his valuable Report on the Composition of

Turnips, grown under different circumstances and in different localities, has

taken their per-centage of nitrogen as the measure of their comparative feed-

ing value.

   The views which have thus led to a vast number of analyses of foods, as
well as the information supplied by the analyses themselves, have contributed
much to the advancement of our knowledge of the chemistry of food. It has
however been found, that the indications of tables of the comparative values
of foods, founded on the per-centages of proteine compounds, were frequently
discrepant with those which common usage or direct experiment affords.

These discrepancies have not escaped the attention of the authors of the theo-

retical tables ; but they have attributed them rather to the erroneous teachings
of common practice or experiments on feeding, than to any defect in the theo-

retical method of estimation. On all hands, however, it has been admitted,
that further direct experiment bearing upon this important subject was much

needed; and it is the acknowledgement of this necessity that seems to justify
the publication, under the auspices of the British Association, the results of
this kind which we have now to submit.

    The question to which we shall first call attention, is, whether, in the use

of our current foods, under ordinary circumstances, but especially in the case
of animals fattening for the butcher, the amount of food consumed, and that
of increase produced, have a closer relationship to the supplies in such foods

of the ^JzVro^ewozw, or of the «on-nitrogenous constituents? That is to say,

whether the sum of the requirements of the animal system is such, that, in

ordinary circumstances, and in the use of ordinary articles of food, the

measure of the amount taken, or of the increase produced, will be regulated

more by the supplies of the " Plastic," or of the more peculiarly respiratory and

fat-forming constituents. According to the views upon which all the tables

of the comparative values of foods are constructed, it is the supplies of the

plastic elements of food chiefly, that should regulate both the consumption,

and the increase in weight, of a fattening animal. If, however, we bear in

mind the views which are generally entertained as to the influence of respi-

ration on the demands of the system for the oxidizable elements of food, it

would appear more consistent to suppose that the measure, at least of the con-

sumption of food, would be chiefly regulated by its supplies of those elements.
   In the experiments to which we shall call attention, sheep and pigs have

been the subjects. As, however, their object has partlj^ been the solution of
certain questions of a more purely agricultural character than those now

under consideration, the details, as to the selection of the animals, and the

general management of tiie experiments, will be given more appropriately in

another place. Indeed, the particulars of some of the experiments with

sheep, so far as their agricultural bearings are concerned, have already ap-

peared in the Journals of the Royal Agricultural Society of England ; and
those of the rest, and also of the experiments with pigs, will probably do so

shortly. It should here be stated, however, that the general plan has been

to select several different descriptions of food, containing respectively various

amounts of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous constituents, the proportions of

which were ascertained by analysis. To one or more sets of animals to be
compared, a fixed and limited amount of food of a high or of a low per-centage

of nitrogen, as the case might be, was allotted, and they were then allowed to
take ad libitum of another or complementary food. In this way, in obedience

to the instinctive demands of tiie system, the animals were enabled to fix for

themselves, according to the composition of the respective foodsj tlie quantities

of eacii class of constituents which they required.

    1st. The amounts respectively of the nitrogenous and the wow-nitrogenous
constituents consumed iveekly per 100 lbs. live iveight of animal.

    2nd. The amounts consumed of each of these classes of constituents to
produce 100 lbs. increase in live weight.

   Summary tables of the results of the analyses of the foods are also given.

 --In the tables showing the amounts of the constituents consumed, &c. the

-- --weights of the animals themselves of the foods consumed and their per cent-
--ages, of dry matter, of ash, and of nitrogen have formed the basis of the

calculations. Thus, the column of nitrogenous substances consumed, is
obtained by multiplying the amount of nitrogen by 6'3, on the assumption
that they all exist as proteine compounds. This method of estimation will, we
think, be found sufficient for our present purpose ; though, as we shall have
occasion to point out further on, it is frequently far from accurate, and
especially when applied to succulent vegetable substances.

   The amounts of wow-nitrogenous constituents are obtained by deducting
those of the mineral and nitrogenous constituents from the amount of the

total dry matter consumed.
   In the tables showing the amounts of the respective constituents consumed

by a given weight of animal within a given time, it is their mean weights that
are taken for the calculation; namely, those obtained by adding together their
weights at the commencement and at the conclusion of the experiment, and

dividing by 2.
   In the tables showing the constituents consumed to produce a given iveight

of increase, the figures are obtained by simple rule of three; taking as the
elements of calculation, the consumption during the total period of the ex-
periment, and the total increase in weight during the same period.

   With these short explanations we may now introduce the tables them-

selves.

  A glance at the Tables as a whole must show, that in all comparable cases

there is much more of uniformity of amount in the total columns of 7ion-mtro-

genous than in those of nitrogenous substance, both as to the quantities con-
sumed to a given weight of animal within a given time, and to those required
to produce a given iveight of increase. The deviations from this general
regularity in the amount of non-nitrogenous substance consumed under equal
circumstances, arc indeed, in most cases such, that when examined into they
tend the more clearly to show, that the uniformity would be considerably
more strict if the amounts only of the really available respiratory and fat--
forming constituents could have been represented, instead of, as in the case
of these Tables, tliat of the gross or total ?«OM-nitrogenous substance consumed.
For, in reading tlie actual figures of the Tables, allowance has to be made
both for those of the non-nitrogenous constituents of the food which would
probably become at once effete, and also for the different respiratory and fat-
forming capacities of the portions of them M'hich are digestible and available
for the purposes of the animal ceconomy. It must further be remembered,
that even after all due allowance has been made for the sources of discre-

pancy just referred to, the amounts which we may suppose to be so corrected
must still cover all variations, whether arising from differences of external

-- --circumstances from individual peculiarities in the animals themselves from

the different amounts stored up in them according to the adaptation of the

--respective foods as well as from the many other uncontrollable circum-

stances which must always interfere with any attempts to bring within the
range of accui-ate numerical measurement the results of those processes in
which the subtle principle of animal life exerts its influence. Bearing, then,
all those points in mind which must tend to modify the true indications of
the actual figures in the Tables, it appears to us, that the coincidences in
the amounts of available respiratory and fat-forming constituents consumed
by a given weight of animal, under equal circumstances, within a given time,
and also in those required under equal circumstances to produce a given
amount of increase in weight, must be admitted to be much more striking
and conclusive than a jjriori we could have expected to find them. With
 this general uniformity, however, as to the amounts of wow-nitrogenous
 substance consumed under given circumstances, or for a given result, those
 of the nitrogenous constituents are found to vary, under the same circum-
 stances, in the proportion of from 1 to 2 or 3.

    In illustration of our statements let us examine the Tables for a moment

 somewhat more in detail.
    In Table IV. we have the amounts of the two classes of constituents re-

 spectivelv, which were consumed weekly per 100 lbs. live weight of animal,
 in the case of five different series of experiments with sheep. In all cases
 the experiments extended over a period of many weeks, and in some even of
 several months. Each series comprised several pens, to each of which (except
 in Series 4, in which there were no limited foods) there was allotted a dif-
 ferent description of fixed or limited food, the ad libitum or complementary
 food being (except in Series 4) the same throughout the several pens of the
 same series, but different in the different series. In the Series 1, 2, 3 and 4,
 there were five or six sheep in each pen ; in Series 5, from 40 to 50 sheep in

 each pen.

     In Series 1, the complementary or ad libitum food was Swedish turnips,
 and the limited foods were^

     In pen 1, oil-cake.

     In pen 2, oats.

        FOODS, IN RELATION TO RESPIRATION AND FEEDING. 335

   The oat-straw chafF of pen 4 was given as adding to tlie otherwise only-
succulent matter of the turnip, the bulk of solid matter which seems to be
demanded particularly by ruminant animals. So small a quantity of this
straw was eaten, however, that it need scarcely enter into our calculations.
Turning to the results of pens 1, 2 and 3, it is seen that the weekly consump-
tion of non-nitrogenous matter per 100 lbs. live weight of animal is, with the
oil-cake as limited food, 9"8 lbs.; with the oats, 1 1 '3 lbs. ; and with the clover-
chaff IS'l lbs. Now, of these three descriptions of food, the oil-cake would
contain by far the most of oleaginous matter, the respiratory and fat-forming
capacity of which is about twice and a half as great as that of the starch
series of compounds which would more abound in the oats. Hence we find
that a less actual weight of non-nitrogenous substance was consumed with
the oil-cake than with the oats. But to the reason just given, to which a part
of the result was doubtless due, we might add that there was a compai'atively
large and somewhat excessive amount of nitrogenous matter consumed in the
oil-cake pen, a part of which at least might serve the respiratory and fat-
forming functions. Then, again, in pen 3, where clover-chaff was the limited
food, the animals would consume a much larger amount of effete woody
fibre than with either the oil-cake or the oats ; in this pen therefore a larger
gross weight of non-nitrogenous substance must be eaten to yield the same
equivalent of that which is available for respiratory or fat-forrning purposes

than with either of the other foods. When therefore, allowance has been

made for the different quantities and capacities of the available constituents

in the several foods, it will be seen, that the equivalents of the available non-

nitrogenous constituents consumed in the different cases, are in reality much
moi-e nearly identical, than the figures as they stand in the Table would
indicate. But if we now turn to the column of the nitrogenous substance
consumed under the same circumstances, we find that it varies, comparing
one pen with another in this first series, nearly as much as from 1 to 2\.

   In the second series (Table IV.) we have clover-chaff as the ad libitum or
complementary food in all the pens, instead of Swedish turnips as in Series 1
and again, with the much larger amount of effete woody fibre, we have a
larger gross amount of the non-nitrogenous substance consumed. The
average of the four pens of this Series 2 is indeed almost identical with the
amount where clover-chaff was employed in Series 1. Again, comparing one
pen with another in this clover-chaff series, we have with the larger amounts
of oleaginous matter supplied in the linseed and oil-cake, less of gross non-
nitrogenous substance taken than with the barley or the malt, in which there

is a proportionally larger amount of the starch series of compounds. When

due allowance is made, then, for the different respiratory and fat-forming
capacities of the several foods, we have again a closer coincidence than would
at first sight appear, in the equivalents of the non-nitrogenous substances

--consumed in the different pens of this second series as also when we com-

pare this series with the former one. Turning now to the column of the
nitrogenous substances consumed in this second series, we see that the gross
amounts vary more than in those of the non-nitrogenous ; and more indeed
than, according to any knowledge we at present possess, could be accounted
for by a consideration as to the state in which the nitrogen existed in the
severalpens. Comparing nowthe result of the one series with those of the other,
although in the two cases the description of the larger portion of the food is
widely different, and we have found that there is nevertheless considerable
coincidence in the amounts of non-nitrogenous substance consumed, yet the
columns of nitrogenous substance throughout the two series show a very

--great variation in the quantities of these consumed amounting, indeed, in
--336 REPORT 1852.

the extreme cases, to as much as from one to three and a half. There can be
little doubt that the method of estimating the amount of available nitro-
genous substance from the per-centage of nitrogen must be more or less faulty,

both in the case of the succulent turnips of the tirst series, and in that of the

-- --also unripened produce clover-chaff of the second ; but whether or in

what degree the differences in the amounts consumed in the two series would
be lessened by corrections due to this source of discrepancy, we have not the

means of accurately deciding.
    In the third series, which consisted of five pens, mangold-wurtzel was the

complementary food ; and the limited foods were barley and malt, respectively,
in different states and proportions in the several pens. Throughout this series
the proportion of nitrogenous to non-nitrogenous constituents varied but
little in the limited foods, and being also constant in the complementary foods
of the several pens, we have but little difference in this series in the amounts
respectively of either class of constituents when comparing pen with pen.
Comparing the results of this series with those of the others, however, we
observe that there was a very close coincidence between the amounts of avail-
able mo»-nitrogenous substance consumed ; but in those of the nitrogenous

substances there is little in common when thus taking at one view the results

of the several series.

   In the fourth series we have no supply of limited food. In all the four
pens Norfolk-white turnips only were given ad libitum. Those supplied to
the different pens, were however, respectively grown by very different manures,
and diflFered in all cases very much in ultimate composition and other
qualities. Thus, the per-centage of dry substance and the state of maturity

were greatest in the turnips of pen 1, and diminished in the order of the pens,

they being in pen 4 the worst in both these respects. On the other hand, the

per-centage of water, of mineral matter, and of nitrogen, and the degree of
unripeness or unfitness for food, were in the inverse order. The turnips eaten
in pen 1 were, however, too ripe, and what is called " pithy " ; and those
were in the best condition which were supplied to pen 2.

    In this series there was, with a probably generally lower amount of effete
matter, at the same time a generally less amount of non-nitrogenous substance

--consumed though most where the turnips were known to be too ripe and

pithy. In pen 4; there was a very small amount of ?«o«-nitrogenous substance
taken ; but there is no doubt that here the limit to consumption was fixed by
the unfitness of the turnips as food, and not by their high value in this respect;
 for these turnips were very succulent and unripe, and notwithstanding they
 contained a very high per-centage of nitrogen^ all the animals fed upon them
lost weight. Taking the circumstances into account, then, we have as much
 iiniformity in the amounts of non-nitrogenous constituents consumed as we
 could expect, both among the several pens of the series, and in comparing this
 series with the rest. In the column of nitrogenous constituents, on the other
 hand, there is nothing to indicate any uniformity of demand for the supply
 of them, whether we compare pen with pen, or the results of this series
 with those of the others. It might perhaps be objected, from what we have
 already said of the varying qualities of the turnips used in this series, that
 the nitrogenous compounds themselves would exist in the diffei'ent lots in a
 more or less assimilable condition; and hence probably some of the diflTerences
 in the amounts consumed. Doubtless there were differences in this respect
 in the different lots, but it is seen that there is nearly twice as much of nitrogen
 consumed in one pen as in another ; and we cannot suppose that by any such
 method of correction as has been suggested, so large a difference as this,
 or even that the whole of the lesser ones observed in the other cases, could
FOODS, IN RELATION TO RESPIRATION AND FEEDING. 337

be thus accounted for. It is woi-thy of observation, however, that in this

series the amounts of the nitrogenous constituents consumed are in an inverse

ratio to those of the non-nitrogenous ; and if we are to calculate, that in the

case of a defect of the latter or an excess of the former, a notable portion of

the nitrogenous constituents would serve as respiratory material, such an

assumption in the present case would tend yet more clearly to show the closer

dependence of consumptioii upon respiration, than upon the supplies by the

food of the plastic elements of nutrition, as such.

In the next and last series of experiments to be noticed with sheep, as far

as possible the same description of foods is used throughout; but animals
of different breeds and weights and other admitted qualities are now the

subject of experiment in the several pens. The breeds which have thus been

--compared are, the Hampshire Down, Sussex Down, Cotswold, Leicester,

Half-bred Wethers (Leicester and Southdown), and Half-bred Ewes

(Leicester and Southdown). In all these experiments oil-cake and clover-

chatf were the limited foods, and Swedish turnips the complementary food.

About 1 lb. per head per day of each of the limited foods was given to the

Hampshires ; and taking this allowance as the standard, the other breeds had
quantities of these foods exactly in proportion to their weights. Thei'e were

from iO to 50 sheep in each lot ; and each experiment extended over several

months.  The  experiments  vyere,  however,  not all  made  in  the  same season
                                                                                                                           ;

the turnips were therefore of different growths ; and the oil-cake and clover-

chaff, though chosen as nearly as possible of similar quality, were not always

from the same stocks. These circumstances, then, as well as the intrinsic

differences in the breeds themselves, if any, might be supposed perhaps to

Wehave some share in any variations in result.        see, however, that there

is nevertheless a very striking coincidence in the amounts of constituents
consumed to a given weight of animal among the different breeds. Bui

what is more to the purpose, the amounts of non-nitrogenous substance

consumed to a given weight of animal by these different breeds, and at

different times, are, after making, as before, due allowance for the probable

different equivalents of the foods, exactly consistent with the indications of

the otiier series with all their varied foods. This result, then, further shows that

in all, the respiratory and fat- forming exigences of the animals have fixed

the limit to their consumption of food; and also that these requirements have,

on an average, and under somewhat similar circumstances, a pretty constant

I'elationship to their weights. With this general coincidence in the amount

of non-nitrogenous substance consumed to a given weight of animal in the

several pens of this series, there could not, of course, with foods of similar

composition in all, be much variation in the amounts of the nitrogenous con-

stituents taken under the same circumstances. Of these, hov/ever, we have

throughout this series twice or thrice as much as in many cases of the other

series, which would not happen if the demand for them had been the guide

to consumption ; nor shall we afterwards find that the increase in weight
obtained was by any means proportional to this large amount of nitrogenous

substance consumed.

    In our experiments with sheep, then, whether with different descriptions
of food, or with different breeds of the animal, the amount offood consumed

would seem to be regulated by the quantities which it supplied of the non-nitro-

genous rather than by those of the nitrogenous constitue7its.
    So much, then, for the bearing of our sheep experiments upon the question

of the amount of food consumed according to its composition : but before

entering upon a consideration of the results of these same experiments in

relation to the second question, namely, that of the increase produced, it

--338 REPORT 1852.

will be well to see how far the experiments with pigs afford us similar indi-

cations in relation to the former one.

   The pig requires much less of mere bulk in his food than the ruminant

animal. Indeed, the food of the pig, when on a liberal fattening diet, consists

generally, weight for weight, of a much larger proportion of digestible or

convertible constituents, and contains much less of effete woody fibre than

that of the sheep. Thus, whilst the food of the fattening sheep is principally

composed of grass, hay and roots, with a comparatively small proportion of

cake or corn, that of the fattening pig comprises a larger proportion of corn,

which contains a comparatively small amount of indigestible woody fibre,

and is comparatively abundant in starch, sugar, &c., and in highly nitro-

genous compounds. Notwithstanding the generally richer character of his

food, however, the fattening pig is found to consume a much larger quantity

Weof dry substance in relation to his weight than the sheep.  should at

least expect, therefore, that he would yield a greater proportion of increase,

and this he is found to do. Such, indeed, is the greediness of the animal,

and so much larger is the proportion of the food which he will consume

beyond that which is necessary for the respiratory function, or for the

formation of flesh, and which is therefore employed in storing up fat, that

the amounts of non-nitrogenous matter consumed must obviously, in his

case, have a less close numerical relationship to the requirements of the

respiratory system than in that of the sheep. Hence, no doubt, is in part

the reason that the exact indications of the figures of the Tables are, on the

whole, not so consistent as m ith the sheep. The experiments with the pigs

however bear testimony in the same direction as those with the sheep on

the question now in discussion, and the evidence they afford on the point is,

indeed, very conclusive.

   In the arrangement of the pig experiments the selection of the foods was
made rather according to composition than to cost. In the first series (see

Tables VI. and VII.) the foods chosen were

  A mixture of equal parts of bean and lentil meal, as a highly nitrogenous

food.

    Indian corn meal, as the comparatively non-nitrogenous food. And
    Bran, as containing a considerable amount of woody fibre.
    The series comprised twelve pens, in each of which three pigs were placed.

In the first four pens, the bean and lentil mixture constituted the ad libitum

food ; in one of these it was given alone, and in the others with a limited
amount of one or both respectively of the other two descriptions of food.

In the second set of four pens, the Indian corn meal was the ad libitum food
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and it, in its turn, was in one case given alone, and in the others with a

certain amount of the other or limited foods. In the third set of pens, bran

was the ad libitum food ; the other two then constituting the fixed or limited
food. In this way there was secured a great diversity in the proportion of

the nitrogenous to the non-nitrogenous constituents of the food in the

several pens ; and as the animals were allowed to fix for themselves the limit
of their consumption, the results afford us the means of judging, whether in

doing this, their natural instincts have led them to any uniformity in relation

to their weights, in tlie amounts taken of either of these classes of constituents.

In Table VI. are given the amounts of the nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous

constituents respectively, consumed iceekly by every 100 lbs. live iceight of
animal. In this Table we see at a glance, that although there are some

apparent discrepancies, yet the figures in the column of wow-nitrogenous

constituents are much more uniform than in that of the nitrogenous ones.

And, as to the few apparent deviations from this uniformity, we think it
         FOODS, IN RELATION TO RESPIRATION AND FEEDING. 339

will be much more reasonable to attempt to explain, or even considering the

nature of the subject, to admit as inexplicable, a few discrepant cases, than to

reject on their account the general testimony of much more numerous, more
consistent, and otherwise sufficientlj' conclusive results. Thus in the first
set of four pens in this series, there is, upon the whole, a less amount of the
non-nitrogenous constituents consumed than in the second; and this lessened
amount of non-nitrogenous constituents consumed in the former is seen to be
coincident with excessive consumption of the nitrogenous ones, and it is even

the less the greater that excess. It is also worthy of remark, too, that in pens
5 to 8, where there was this larger amount of non-nitrogenous substance
consumed, it was supplied chiefly by Indian corn meal, which, containing
more oily matter than that of the foods in pens 1 to 4, would also possess a

higher respiratory and fat-forming capacity, weight for weight, than that in

Wethe other cases.  may here suppose, that perhaps a surfeit of the nitro-

genous substances put a limit to the further consumption of non-nitrogenous

constituents which would otherwise have been taken ; or, that being in excess,
the nitrogenous substances have substituted other respiratory material ; and
it is consistent with such a supposition, that with the less amount of non-
nitrogenous constituents consumed, where the nitrogenous are in excess, there

is nevertheless a larger amount consumed of total organic substance than

where there is more of the non-nitrogenous constituents.
   That a larger amount of the complementary food was consumed when it

consisted of the comparatively low nitrogenized Indian meal, was not due

only to a craving for a supply of nitrogen which a less quantity would not

have yielded, would appear, among other considerations, from the fact, that

when, after a time, the pigs in pen 5, where Indian meal alone was given,
had become affected with large tumours breaking out on their necks,

their breathing and swallowing becoming at the same time difficult, we, in
order to test the question as to whether this arose from a defect of nitrogen
or from other causes, supplied them with a trough of wmeraZ sub stances: they
soon recovered from their complaint, and eventually proved to be among the

fattest and best of the entire series of pigs ; at least, a dealer in pork with
a practised eye, purchased by preference one of these animals from among
the whole set of carcases. The mineral mixtui'e that was supplied to them

was composed of twenty parts coal ashes, four parts common salt, and one

part superphosphate of lime ; and for it they seemed to exhibit considerable

relish.

   In pens 9, 10 and 11, a comparatively small quantity of the more digestible
foods was allowed, the complementary food being in these cases bran ; and
as we have before said, the digestive apparatus of the pig is not adapted for

a large amount of bulky woody substance. Here the animals consumed a

less amount of non-nitrogenous substance in proportion as the bran predo-

minated in their food ; and they at the same time also increased and fattened
much less than those in the other pens. In fact, until 3lbs. per head per day

of the limited foods were allowed instead of only two, as was at first given,

several of the pigs lost weight and became unwell ; being as it were paralysed

(gouty ?), and almost deprived of the use of their legs. There can be little
doubt that the proportion of woody matter in the bran, which food only

they had at full command, was too great for the convenience of their sto-

machs ; and that hence, after their respiratory requirements had been fulfilled,
a limit was put to further consumption to serve the mere purpose of fattening.

In pen 12, the several foods, namely, the bean and lentil mixture, the

Indian meal, and the bran, were each put into a separate trough, and the
animals were allowed to take of all or any of them ad libitum. Were it nofc

                                                                              z2

--340 REPORT 1852.

that one of the pigs in this pen was unwell in the same way as those referred

to in the previous pens during a considerable portion of the period of the

experiment, we might have assumed perhaps, that the results of this pen would

have pointed to the proportions of the several foods best adapted to the wants

of the animals; and if such a conclusion were a legitimate one, it would

indeed appeal", tliat their natural demands called for a larger proportion of

nitrogen than was within the reach of the animals in anj' of those pens in

which Indian meal was the ad libitum or complementar}'^ food. Two of the

pigs, however, in this pen 12, increased exceedingly well, and gave eventually

the highest proportion of carcass to live weight, of any in this entire series of

experiments. It is, too, an interesting fact, that as the experiment proceeded,

and the animals matured, their consumption diminished very considerably.

Thus, the proportion of the bean and lentil mixture to the total food consumed

was only two-thirds as great at the conclusion as at the commencement of

the experiment, whilst that of the Indian meal was not three-fifths as much

Weat the commencement as at the conclusion.   have in this fact some indi-

cation of the large proportion of the non-nitrogenous constituents of the food

which is appropriated by the fatting animal.

Reviewing, as a whole, the reults of these twelve dietaries, and carefully

considei'ing the bearing of the various circumstances which must influence

our reading of the actual figures of the Table relating to them, we think it

cannot be doubted, tiiat here, as in the case of the sheep, we have very clear

evidence that it is the non-nitrogenous, raiher than the nitrogenous consti-

tuents of the food, that have fixed the limit to consumption.

In the lower section of this Table VI., we have the results bearing upon tlie

same point, of a second series of experiments with pigs, conducted on a

similar plan to that of the former one. In this second series of pig experi-

ments, we have, as before, the bean and lentil mixture as the highly nitro-

genous food. Barley meal is in this case used as the non-nitrogenous food,

instead of Indian corn as in the former series. Bran, again, constitutes the

third food. h\ this series however, when either the bean and lentil mixture,

or the barley meal, constituted the limited food, the daily allowance per head

was 3 lbs. instead of 2, as in the former series. When the limited food was

bran, lib. only, instead of 2 as previously, was now given. In otlier respects,

excepting that in this series bran was in no case given alone as the ad libitum

food, the arrangements were the same as in the case of the previous series.

The weather during part of the period of this second series of experiments

was exceedingly hot; from this several of the animals suffered considerably

and some, either from this or other causes, became quite ill and died, or were

"killed to save their lives." Nevertheless it is seen, tliat there was, upon the

whole, a larger amount of respiratory food consumed in relation to weight in

this series than in the previous one during the cooler season.

If we compare the column of the amounts of non-nitrogenous constituents

consumed weekly, per 100 lbs. live weight of animal, for this series, as given

in the lower section of Table VI., with that in the upper section for Series 1,

we shall see that there was, upon the whole, a greater uniformity in the former

than in the latter. There are, however, one or two marked exceptions to the

regularity of amount of non-nitrogenous matter consumed in this Series 2,
which, but for coincident circumstances, and the abundance we have of evi-

dence in tiie opposite direction, might lead to different conclusions than those

which we have drawn from the results as a whole ; but at any rate the uni-

formity is still greater here than in the column of the nitrogenous substances.

The more obvious exceptions to the rule are pens 1 and 8 ; but apart from

--any incidental causes which might account for these and in each of these
        FOODS, IN RELATION TO RESPIRATION AND FEEDING. 341

--pens one of the animals died we shall see, when we come to consider the

question of the amount of increase produced by a given amount of food con-
sumed, that although the pigs were satisfied to eat a smaller proportion of
food in relation to their weight in these pens where the proportion of nitrogen
was comparatively large, yet the proportion of increase to the food consumed
was less than whei'e the amount of ??07z-nitrogenous substance consumed
was much greater. Hence, in these cases, if thej-e were a smaller amount
of food consumed, there was also a smaller proportion of increase produced
by it, and there would therefore at the same time obviously be a larger
proportion of it available for the purposes of respiration. These apparent

exceptions are not> then, necessarily adverse to the view t!iat the respiratory

process was the gauge of consumption.

  We have already noticed, that notwithstanding the weather was much hot-

ter during the progress of the second series of experiments, yet that there
was here, upon the whole, a larger amount of non-nitrogenous substance
consumed in proportion to weight of animal than in the first. This apparent
excess, if indeed it show any real excess in respiratory and fat-forming equi-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,

valent, at any rate does not do so in the degree which the bare figures of the
Table would indicate. Tlius, the Indian corn of the first series, of which
a less amount seems to have sufficed than of the barley in the second, con-

tained about 6 per cent, of oleaginous matter, instead of less than 3 per cent.,

as in the barley. And as a deficiency of 3 per cent, in fatty substance would,

for respiratory and fat-forming purposes, require to be substituted by about
twice and a half that amount of the other non-nitrogenous constituents, it
is obvious that the respiratory and fat-forming capacity of the Indian
meal non-niti-ogenous matter was therefore somewhat higher than that of the
barley ; and hence a less amount of it would be required to produce the same

result.

   We could add to the results already given those of further experiments

both with pigs and sheep, as vvell as some with bullocks, bearing upon the
point we have been considering ; but those we have- already adduced are,
we think, sufficient to justify our conclusion, that, in reference to this first
question, at least so far as fattening animals are concerned, the amount of
food consumed is regulated more by its supplies of the non-nitrogenous, than

of the nitrogenous constituents.

  We now come to the second question ; namely, that of the relationship

of the increase in live weight produced to the consumption of nitrogenous
and non-nitrogenous constituents in the food.

   Turning first to the experiments with sheep, we have in Table V. the amounts

respectively of the non-nitrogenous, of the nitrogenous, and of the total or-
ganic substance consumed to produce 100 lbs. increase in live weight.

   In viewing the Tables in reference to this point, we must, as before, read
the indications of the actual figures as modified by the obviously different
capacities for the purposes of the animal ceconomy of the substances, the
amounts of which they in each case represent. Especially, too, when con-
sidering the results with the sheep, we must bear in mind the fact, which we
have ascertained by direct experiment, namely, that other things being equal,
the more succulent the food, the less will be the proportion of real dry sub-
stance in the increase obtained by its means ; and also, that the greater the
amount of fat produced the greater considerably will be the per-centage in
the gross increase of real dry substance. And we must further remen)ber,
that as in the Tables showing the relationship of consumption to respiration,

 the figures also included the increase in weight obtained, so now, in the
 Tables professing to show the relationship of the increase to the constituents
--342 REPORT 1852.

consumed, the figures at the same time include the amounts which have been

expended in the respiratory process.
   Looking down the entire columns of Table V., it is at once seen thatwiierever

clover-ciiaff was employed, that is to say, wherever there was a large amount
of innutritious woody fibre, tlie gross amount of non-nitrogenous substance
consumed to produce a given amount of increase is always great. The ana-
lysis of the excrements of this series showed, indeed, that there was, in re-
lation to the non-nitrogenous matter consumed in the food, a very much
larger proportion of it voided by the animals than in the case of the series
where the amount of woody fibre in the food was less. This, therefore, must
be allowed for in comparing the figures in the column. It will at once be
seen, when due allowance has thus been made, that the amounts oi available
non-nitrogenous substance consumed to produce a given weight of increase,
are at any rate much more nearly uniform than are those of the nitrogenous
constituents. Of the differences which will still remain after the allowance
for woody fibre has been made, many can be again reduced by a consideration
of the different equivalents of the remaining available non-nitrogenous con-
stituents ; as for instance, when in comparable cases these contain, in one
instance, more of oil, and in another more of the starch'^series of compounds.

A less amount of the former than of the latter is required to produce the

same resulting increase in the animal ; and again, less of the starchy series
than of some of the peculiar products of the root crops.

    In the column showing the proportion of the total nitrogenous substance
consumed to increase produced (Table V.), we have a much wider range of
difference than in that of the non-nitrogenous, and much wider, indeed, than
can be explained away by such considerations as have above been alluded to
in reference to tiie latter. It is true that these figures cannot, any more than
in the column of the non-nitrogenous constituents, be taken as showing ab-
solutely proportional nutritious values of the matters represented ; for as we
have before observed, the figures assume the whole of the nitrogen of the
food to exist in the form of proteine compounds, which obviously would not
be the case with the succulent and unripened produce, such as the roots and
clover-chaff ; and hence, this consideration must more affect the correctness
of the statement of nitrogenous constituents consumed for a given result in
the sheep experiments than in those with the pigs, where the foods employed
were ripened seeds. But, as we have observed, the differences in the figures
in the Table would seem to be too great to be satisfactorily accounted for by
the correction of any errors arising from this cause.

    Looking at this Table V. rather more in detail, we see, taking the first two
pensin Series 1, which are comparable so far as the description of the ac?/?toMm
food is concerned, that whilst the non-nitrogenous substance consumed to
produce 100 lbs. increase in weight is very nearly equal in the two cases, yet
that of the nitrogenous constituents varies in the two in the proportion of
from three to two ; but a diffei'ence in the nature of the nitrogenous substance
cannot be supposed to have made a difference so great in the amount of con-
stituents consumed to produce a given result. On the other hand, the higher

capacity of the oleaginous matter of the oil-cake than of the starch, &c. of
the oats, is sufficient further to lessen the but small difference in the amounts
of the non-nitrogenous substance in the two cases. In pens 2, 3 and 4 of

the first series of sheep, we have all but identical amounts of gross nitrogenous
substance consumed for a given amount of increase ; but this would be of the
most highly elaborated kind in pen 2 with the oats, and the least so in pen 4,
with turnips only ; and in the latter, besides having less o{' available nitrogenous
substance, the respiratory and fat- forming capacity of the non-nitrogenous
                                                                                                                               a

         FOODS, IN RELATION TO RESPIRATION AND FEEDING. 343

  substance in the exclusive turnip diet would be less than in the other instances^
 and hence the larger amount consumed for a given result.

     Turning to the results of the second series, with clover-chafF instead of
 turnips as the ad libitum food, we have, with the larger amount of woody-
 fibre, which would become at once effete, much more gi'oss non-nitrogenous
 matter consumed to produce 100 lbs. of increase than in Series 1. This is
 less, however, in pens 1 and 2, with the large proportion of oleaginous matter,
 than in pens 3 and 4. Tiiere is, moreover, in this second series, with this
 greater amount of wo/i-nitrogenous matter consumed for a given effect than
 in Series 1, a much larger amount also of the nitrogenous constituents ; the
 gross amount of the latter, indeed, in this second series, is twice, and even
 sometimes thrice as great as in Series 1.

     In the next series, namely. Series 3, with barley and malt in different states
 and proportions as limited food, and mangold-wurtzel as the complementary
 food, we have, upon the whole, about the same amounts of non-nitrogenous
 substance required to produce the same result as in Series 1, with, besides, a
 small quantity of grain or other limited food and Swedish turnips as the com-
. plementary food, which latter are in great degree comparable with the mangold-
 wurtzel ; and of course, as in Series 1, the average amount is very different
 from that in the second series with the large proportion of clover-chaff.
 Looking to the three total columns, namely, of nitrogenous, of non-nitrogen-
 ous, and of total organic constituents consumed, although it is true the dif-
 ferences are not great, and perhaps such as might be covered by differences
 in the composition of the increase, yet it may be noticed, that larger amounts,
 both of non-nitrogenous and of total organic substance, were consumed to
 produce the same result the larger the proportion in the latter of the nitro-
 genous constituents.

    In Series 4, we have a more marked instance of the result last noticed.
 But, apart from the question as to whether the increase of the fattening
 animal has a closer relationship with the amount of the true proteine com-

 pounds, or, within certain limits, of the available non-nitrogenous constitu-

 ents of its food, we have here a striking illustration of the inapplicability on
 other grounds of the per-centage of nitrogen as the measure of feeding value,
 or indeed of any analytical method, unless a detailed determination of the
proximate compounds, when succulent products, such as in this instance, the

 roots, are the subjects of the experiment. Thus, in the fourth pen of this series,
 where there was by far the largest amount of nitrogen consumed, the animals
 lost weight; and in the other three pens, the productiveness of the food is in
 the inverse order of tlie amounts of nitrogen taken in the food. This arose of
 course from the different states of maturity, and the consequent state of elabo-
 ration of the constituents of the various turnips, the produce of the diffei'ent
 manures. Indeed, we believe that an unusually high per-centage of nitrogen
 in succulent produce is frequently a pretty sure indication of immaturity and
 innutritions qualities. Comparing the results of this series with those of the

 others, we have, considering how small would be the proportion of inert
 woody fibre in the unripe turnips, about twice as much dry substance (in

--pens 1 and 3 at least) consumed to produce a given amount of increase

 difference which could, at any rate in only a small degree, be accounted for
 by any difference in the capacities of the digestible and available portions of
  the foods in the cases thus compared.

      Considering only the ostensible similarity of the foods in the several pens
  constituting the 5th and last series of experiments with sheep, there is, per-
 haps, no more of coincidence in the amounts that have been required to pro-
  duce a given increase in the different pens, than, judging from previous

  results, we might have anticipated. From what we know, however, of the
344 RKPORT-- 1852.

varying character of the several breeds as fatteneriJ, greater differences might
have been expected ; for, in some cases a less or larger proportion of the
gross increase would be solid substance tlian in others ; whilst this solid sub-

--stance itself would be composed of more or less of fat or lean circumstances

which obviously imply the appropriation in the increase, of varying amounts
and proportions of the constituents of the food consumed. Then, again,
though nominally the same, there were unavoidably slight differences in the
qualities of tlie food used in the different cases, and the experiments them-
selves were not all conducted in the same season ; that with the Hampshire
and Sussex Downs being made in the winter of 1850-51, that with the Cots-
wolds in 1851-52, and with the Leicesters and half-breeds in 1852-53.
There is also, upon the whole, a very general coincidence in the amounts of
non-nitrogenous and total organic substance, consumed to produce a given
amount of increase in this series with the different breeds, and the Series
I and 3. At least the general coincidence throughout these several series is
quite as close as the variations in the foods could lead us to look for. Ikit
in the colunm of nitrogenous substance the agreement between this series
and the others is by no means so obvious ; nor, so far as we know, can the
want of agreement in the cases thus compared together be accounted for by
differences in the composition and applicability of the nitrogenous consti-

tuents themselves.

  --Reviewing then the whole of the experiments with sheep, if we consider

that it is the results obtained under the subtle agency of animal life that we
are seeking to measure and express in figures, and if we also bear in mind
the various sources of modification to whicii our actual figures must be sub-
mitted in order to attain their true indications, we think that it cannot be
doubted, that beyond a limit below which few, if any, of our current fattening
food-stuffs are found to go, it is their available non-nitrogenous constituents,
rather than their richness in the nitrogenous ones, that measure both the
amount consumed to a given weight of animal, within a given time, and the
increase in weight obtained.

   But we have still to examine the results of tiie experiments with pigs as to
the latter point, namely, that of tlie relationship of the increase produced to
constituents consumed ; and owing partly to the peculiarities of the animals,
and partly to the nature of the foods employed, the actual figures themselves
even (see Table VII.) bear out the view that has been maintained more ob-

viously at first sight, than those relating to the sheep. Thus, casting the eye

down the column of total non nitrogenous substance consumed, and more
particularly tiiat of the total organic matter, we see with but few exceptions, a
strikingly close coincidence in the amounts required-to produce 100 pounds
of gross increase throughout the two series of twenty-four pens, and as many
different dietaries. Some of the exceptions, such as those where a large
quantity of bran was used, are at once explained by a consideration of the
more obvious qualities of that substance; and many of the minor difterences
by that of the different capacities of those portions of the foods which would
be digestible and available for the purposes of the animal ceconomy ; and in
this way, as we have already noticed when speaking on the first question, we
must account for the generally larger amount consumed with the barley meal
in Series 2, than in the comparable cases with the Indian corn in Series 1.

    Looking to pens 1 and 2 of Series 1, where the food consisted chiefly of
the highly nitrogenous Leguminous seeds, we have comparative!}'^ verj"^ small
amounts of non-nitrogenous substance required to produce a given amount
of increase ; a result which at first siglit appears to lead to conclusions
opposite to those from the experiments as a whole. If we look down the
column of total organic substance, however, we observe that the amounts
FOODS. IN RELATION TO RESPIRATION AND FEEDING. 345

of it in tiie second section of Series i, where the Indian corn predomi-
nated, and where tiie nitrogenous constituents consumed were only about
half as great as in the pens 1 and 2, are genei'ally as small, or even smaller,
than in these two pens. It is not. then, that there was in reality a very great
productiveness in gross increase from a given amount of food in these tAvc»

pens, but rather only that with the large supply of available nitrogenous con-
stituents in the Leguminous seeds, a certain amount of the non-nitrogenous
constituents have been substituted by it. It was observed, too, that although

all the pigs were very fat, excepting the few with an excessive allowance of
bi-an, yet those apparently f/reiv more, where, with no deficiency of other
matters, the nitrogenous constituents were very liberally supplied. Hence
the gross increase obtained might be somewhat more nitrogenous with the

large supply of nitrogenous food ; but it would in that case, according to
some experiments of our own, contain a larger proportion of water, and less
of solid matter, than where more fat had been produced.

But, with the very great regularity of non-nitrogenous equivalent con-

sumed throughout this large series of pig experiments to produce a given

amount of increase, we have, in the column of total nitrogenous substance,
on the other hand, a difference in the amounts required, in the proportion of

from one to two, or three, or even more ; though, since all the foods used in

these experiments were ripened vegetable products, a very trifling error, if

any, can arise from representing, in all cases, the whole of the nitrogen as
existing as proteine compounds. And, there is throughout, a generally

larger amount of total organic substance required to yield a given amount of

gross increase, the larger the proportion in that substance of the nitrogenous

constituents.

It is seen, as has been already noticed, that where the amount of nitrogen

consumed in these pig experiments to produce a given amount of gross in-

crease is comparatively large, it is where a large proportion of the Legumi-
nous seeds have been employed. Some writers who have taken the per-cent-

age of nitrogenous compounds as the measure of feeding value, have recog-

nised, and endeavoured to explain in various ways, the fact that the records

of practical feeding experiments do not award to the Leguminous seeds a

feeding value in proportion to their richness in nitrogen ; and they have con-
cluded, that it is the accepted indications of the practical experiments, and

not the theoretical conclusions, that are at fault. Thus, it has been objected

against the teachings of such experiments, that the variations in the compo-

sition of the same description of food used in different cases has not been

determined ; that the test has been the gross increase or loss in weight; that

the increase may be only fat formed from starch, &c. ; that the loss in weight,
if anj', may be the result of activity, and not of defective diet ; that the food

in the different cases has been employed in different states, that is, coarse or
fine, raw or prepared; that the animals have been vai-iously circumstanced as
to temperature, exposure and activity ; that individual animals have very

various tendencies to increase, and so on. Now we believe that not one of all

these objections can vitiate the comparisons which we have made, unless, in-
deed, in some degree, the one which refers to the difficulty of determining
whether the gross increase obtained be composed chiefly of fat formed from

the starch and oily series of compounds ; or whether of flesh from the nitro-

Wegenous ones.  believe, indeed, from the many direct experiments which we

have made, that in reality, the composition of our domestic animals generally,

but especially that of the gross increase of the so-called " fattening " animals,

Weconsists of a much larger proportion of fat than is usually supposed.

have instituted very extensive and laborious investigations in regard to this

point, the details, or even the general results of which must be reserved for
--346 REPORT 1852,

some future occasion ; before closing this paper, however, we propose to
call attention to a mere summary statement of one of these experiments.

But, apart from the considerations involved in the question of the varying

composition of increase, or from the fact tliat our own feeding experiments

(jvhich, so far as we are aware, are the largest comparable series bearing upon

the point) afford testimony in the same direction, we think there is evidence

of another kind of the probable correctness of the decisions of practical ex-

periments which have thus been objected to. Thus the comparative prices
of the Leguminous seeds and the Cereal grains, may be taken as a pretty safe

condemnation of the measurement of feeding value according to their per-

centage of nitrogenous constituents. In matters of this kind, indeed, espe-

cially when staple and generally used articles of food are concerned, the

market is one of our shrewdest judges, as we shall presently endeavour a

little further to illustrate.

Whilst speaking of the comparative feeding values of the Leguminous seeds

and tlie Cereal grains, we may casually allude to some other considerations
of much interest bearing upon this question, which, however, we cannot in

any degree adequately discuss in this place.

As a general rule, it may be said, that weight for weight, the Leguminous

seeds contain about twice as much of the nitrogenous constituents as the

WeCereal grains.  have elsewhere shown, that in a Leguminous crop, under

equal circumstances of soil and season, an acre of land will frequently yield

twice or thrice as much of nitrogenous constituents as in a Cereal grain ; and

again, that in the latter an increase of produce is not obtained except at the

Howcost of more nitrogen in the manure than is contained in that increase.

is it, we would ask, if this be the case, and if really these foods are valuable

in proportion to their richness in nitrogenous constituents, that according to

the usual state of the market, we can obtain, for a given sum, about twice as

much nitrogenous substance in the Leguminous seeds as in the Cereal grain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

or how is it, on the other hand, that the Leguminous crop does not, much

more than is in fact the case, supersede the Cereal grain in the field, the feeding

Weshed, or even on the table ?     have, it is true, much yet to learn of those

minor diffierences of composition to which is due the greater or less adapta-

tion to the instinctive wants of the system of the various constituents of which

our staple articles of food are made up, but we think that in no considerations
of this kind could we seek an adequate solution of our question. On the

other hand, we believe that in the Leguminous seeds the due proportion of

the non-nitrogenous to the nitrogenous constituents is not observed. It is

obvious, if this be the case, that in the use of the Leguminous seeds, instead

of the Cereal grains, more than was requisite of nitrogen would be taken into

the system before the adequate supply were attained of the non-nitrogenous or

respiratory materials ; nor, as the markets go, would the relative prices of these
seeds and grains be found to interfere with a somewhat lavish use and expen-

diture of nitrogen in the former.

   In the facts which are here briefly stated, we have surely very curious and
interesting matter for reflection ; and we have brought to our view a striking
instance of the mutual adaptations which are everywhere traceable in the

practical operation of natural laws. Thus, then, we have said, that under
given circumstances, the Leguminous crop will give a much larger acreage

yield of nitrogen than the Cereal grain ; and that an increase of produce of
the latter is not obtained except at the cost of more nitrogen in the manui'e

than is obtained in this increased produce ; whilst in point of fact, in the or-
dinary practice of rotation in this country, the growth of the Leguminous corn
or fodder crop, with its large per-centage and actual amount of nitrogen, is
itself frequently either the direct or indirect source of the nitrogenous ma-
FOODS, IN RELATION TO RESPIRATION AND FEEDING. 347

nure by which the increased Cereal is obtained ; and again, this Cereal, ob-

tained at the cost of, but with its lessened jororfwce of nitrogen, is found in

practice to be of equal, or of a more highly feeding value than the more

highly nitrogenized Leguminouu product which perhaps has been expended

to produce it. It would thus appear, therefore, that the demands of the re-

spiratory function which again, more than any other, regulate the consump-

tion of food, would, in point of fact, not be satisfied in the use of the Legu-

minous diet unless by a consumption or expenditure of an amount of nitrogen

beyond that which the due balance of the constituents of food would seem

to require ; whilst on the other hand, in the use of the Cereal grain, its better

proportion of respiratory to nitrogenous constituents has only been attained

by the sacrifice of nitrogen expended in its growth. It would seem, there-

fore, that whether we would seek our supplies of respiratory food in the

direct use of the highly nitrogenized Leguminous seeds, or in the better ba-

lanced diet of the Cereal grains, in either case the end is attained only at the

cost or expenditure of nitrogen ; in the one case, by the consumption of a

larger amount of it in the food than the due balance of constituents would

seem to require, Avhilst in the other this due balance has not been attained
without a loss of nitrogen during growth. The claims of health and na-

tural instinct generally leave little doubt which alternative should be adopted,
in the case of human food at least ; and it becomes us, therefore, to investi-

gate and understand the practical bearings of these curious and interesting

--facts ; for upon the principles they involve depend much for their success

those fundamental practices of the farm, the feeding of our stock, for their

double products of meat and manure, and the adaptation of our rotations.

It would appear, then, from our experiments, that taking our current food-

stuffs as we find them' it is their supply of the ?iow nitrogenous, rather than of
their nitrogenous constituents, which guidesboth the amount of food consumed,
and of increase produced, by a fattening animal. When we consider the na-

ture of the respiratory process, and the large share which its demands must

necessarily have upon the consumption of food, it can scarcely appear sur-

prising that consumption, at least, should be chiefly regulated by the supply

in the food of compounds rich in carbon and hydrogen, rather than nitrogen.
That the amount of increase produced should also bear a closer relationship

to the supply of these constituents than to that of the latter, does not perhaps

at first sight seem so obvious, especially if we supposed, as some writers on
this subject have done, that the amount of nitrogen in the current food of
man and other animals was frequently insufficient to supply the amount re-

quired for the production or restoration of the nitrogenous products of the

Weanimal organism.  believe, however, that a closer examination of the

facts would show that this exceedingly rarely happens ; and we think, more-

over, as we have already intimated, that in fact, that portion of nitrogen which

is stored up in iV^increa^e of a growing, and especiallyof a "fattening "animal,

Weis much less than is usually supposed.  cannot in any degree adequately

discuss this question in this place; but when maintaining a greater relative

importance of the wow-nitrogenous constituents of food than is usually ac-
corded to them, it seems somewhat pertinent briefly to adduce some evidence

in confirmation of our conclusions on this point.

  We propose, therefore, to give a very brief summary of one of our expe-

riments, in which pigs were tlie subjects, which was undertaken chiefly for

the purpose of ascertaining the composition of the increase of the fattening
atiimal; but to obtain also, some clear evidence in reference to the much-

debated question, whether or not more fatty matter is stored up in the

animal, than is contained, as such, in its food.
--348 REPORT 1852.

   Taking first the question of the composition of the increase, we have in the
following table a nummary statement of the composition of tlie foods em-
ployed in (he experiment referred to ; and also of the pigs themselves, both
in the store, and in the fat condition ; as well as that of the increase in weight
during the fattening process, as deduced by calculation.

much the larger proportion, is nearly doubled in the Fat one. Thus, the
increase in weight during the fattening process was found to contain as much

as 72 per cent, of dry substance, of which only 0*4-36 is mineral matter, and
only 1*33 nitrogen, equal to about 8^ of proteine or gelatinous compounds.
There is, however, about 63^ per cent, of fat, or nearly eight times as much
as of dry nitrogenous compounds. Indeed, it is seen in the table, that 88
per cent., or about eight-ninths of the entire dry increase of this Fat Pig, was
pure fat.

   M. Boussingault, in his ' Rural Economy,' estimates that the Ox, the
Sheep, and tiie Pig, contain from 3^ to 4 per cent, of nitrogen ; and more
recently in his paper on the Formation of Fat in the Animal Body (^A)in. cle

C/iemie, vol. xiv. p. 444), he supposes 4 as the probable per-centage in the

Pig. He also states (Rural Economy), that M. Payen estimates the increase

of the fattening pig to contain about 16 per cent, of nitrogenous compounds,
equal to about 2§ per cent, of nitrogen. It will be observed, however, that
only about half of these amounts of nitrogen were found in the direct expe-
riments of our ov.n which we have quoted ; and it should at the same time
be remarked, that the Fat Pig in our experiment was by no means so fat as
is usual, at least in this country.

    It is doubtless true, that other animals, as fed for the butcher, will generally

contain more flesh and less fat than the pig. In a very fat sheep, iiowever,
fed for Chi-istmas, and wliich was indeed too fat, we found a larger per-
centage of fat, and as little nitrogenous substance, as in the moderately fat

pig, whose composition has been given above. Among our experiments on
this subject, it was only in the case of a lean ox, that we found the nitrogen

to exceed 2| per cent, of the entire animal ; whilst in all the cases of store
or lean animals, the per-centage of dry fat was much greater than that of the
drj^ nitrogenous compounds.

   The fact that fat is in so much a larger proportion than lean in the animals
fed for the butcher, would seem not only to be consistent with the results of

our experiments as to the great influence of the non-nitrogenous constituents

--of the food of these animals in the production of increase dui-ing the fattening

process but it indicates also the predominance of this non-nitrogenous cha-
racter in that description of human food (butcher's meat), which is generally
spoken of as the most nitrogenous, and therefore the most nutritive.

    That the fatty matter of the food is not the only source of the fat stored
up in the body of the fattening animal, is illustrated by a further consi-
deration of the circumstances and results of this same experiment with pif^s.
Thus, in the follov/ing table are shown the amounts of Gross Dry Sub-

-- -- --stance of Mineral Matter of Dry Organic Matter of Total iVbn-nitro-

up in the Fat Pig, for 100 lbs. of each of them consumed as food.

350 REPORT 1852.

It may be observed, that in the case of the experiment with this single pig,

the amounts of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous constituents required to

--produce a given amount of increase though nearly the same as the averages
--of the 24 pens, as given at the foot of Table VII. were greater, than in many

of the cases with the better foods. Hence, the quantities of the various con-

stituents, represented in Table IX. as stored up in tliis pig for 100 of each of

them consumed, are less than they would be in many of the other experi-

Wements.  believe, however, that the figures in the Table (IX.) may be trusted

in their general indications; and attention may therefore be called in passing

to the fact, that for 100 of eacij consumed, there is of the total dry substance

little more than 15 stored up in the animal; of the mineral matter, little

more than 2 per cent. ; and of the nitrogenous constituents, about 8^rd per

cent.

   Again, a glance at the Table shows how very much larger is that propor-

-- --tion of every constituent of the food excepting fatty matter which was

expired, perspired or voided, i. e. which was expended in merely keeping in

working order the living mechanism, than that which is stored up in the
animal as increase. Oi fat, however, it appears that there was nearly four
times as much stored up in the animal, as there was of fatty matter ready

formed in the food. There was then, in this experiment, a considerable

formation of fat in the animal body.

As is seen in the Table (IX.), for every 100 lbs. of gross dry substance

consumed as food, only about 15 lbs. were stored up in the animal; and about

85 lbs. expired, perspired or voided. It may be convenient here to show in a

tabular form, the composition of this 15'04 of total dry increase obtained by

the consumption of 100 of total dry matter as food.

pended in the direct production in the animal body of one part of fat. At
any rate, we are safe in assuming this amount for our present purpose, in the
absence of more exact knowledge than is at command on the nature of the
intermediate changes to which the constituents of food are subject in their

--passage through the body. If, then, we suppose, that the starch series rather
--than the proteiue compounds of the food, served for the formation of the

fat in the animal body, it follows, that about 25 parts of these were expended
in the formation of the 10 parts of produced fat. If now we add to this
amount of the non-nitrogenous constituents of the food not fat, the 3|-rd parts
which were fatty matter already formed, and also the Ifrds of the increase
which was not fat, it would appear, that at least 30 parts of the 100 of dry
substance consumed, must have been directly employed in the production of
the 15 only of dry animal increase. It is obvious, too, from the nature of the
chemical change by which fat would be formed from the starch series of
compounds, that the extra 15 of the 30 parts of the dry substance of the
food, which were expended in the direct production of the 15 of dry increase,
would not serve any useful purpose in the respiratory process of the fattening

--animal. And, unless indeed, we were to assume that in the more direct use

of the starch series of compounds as respiratory matter, their oxygen was

--eliminated only in combination with respiratory material and that when em-
--ployed in the production offal it was not so it would appear, that not only

must this produced fat have been obtained at the cost of respiratory material

--expended by the fattening animal which produced it but that it is, at any

rate, not in the amount of respiratory material thus obtained, that there can
be any gain in this conversion by the fattening animal of a given amount of
compounds of loioer respiratory and fat-forming capacity, into fat to serve
as human food, of which it is the most concentrated of the respiratory con-

stituents.

   If, then, as we have seen, so large a proportion as nearly ^rd of the dry
substance of the food of the fattening pig may be employed in the direct

--production of increase and we have reason to suppose that frequently more
--than this is so employed we think that the deviations from uniformity in the

amounts of non-nitrogenous constituents consumed by a given weight of
animal, within a given time, as shown in our tables, will be admitted to be
even less than might have been expected in so extensive and varied a series

--of experiments and to be, by no means such, as to raise any question as to

whether or not, it was the supplies of the respiratory and fat-forming, rather
than the flesh-forming constituents of the foods, which determined the
amounts consumed.

    But to recur to the question of the formation of fat in the animal body.

We believe that such a formation, even to a considerable, and practically

important extent, is demonstrated by the results of the experiments with pigs
last given ; and there is every reason to believe, that it is the starch and other

non-nitrogenous constituents of the food that contribute mainlj', if not en-

tirely, to this formation.

  At one time MM. Dumas and Boussingault maintained that the formation

of fat in the animal body was improbable ; and others have done so more re-
cently. Since that time, however, both M. Boussingault and M. Persoz have

instituted direct experiments in reference to this question. In the course of
these experiments they found a decided formation of fat ; and most probably
from the starch series of compounds.

   M. Boussingault made numerous experiments of a somewhat artificial kind
with ducks ; from which it appeared, that fat might be formed in the body

from other non-nitrogenous constituents of food, and probably from nitroge-
                                                  -- ;;

nous conipouiuls also. He also experimented with pigs, in a manner somewhat

similar to that adopted by ourselves ; and it is a curious circumstance, that

his store, or lean pig, contained almost identically the same per-centage of

fat as our own. The foods lie employed were, however, far inferior in fatten-

ing quality. Hence, though his experiments extended over a much longer

period of time, the per-centage of fat in his y^? pig was scarcely 5 per cent,

higher than in his lean one ; whilst almost the whole of this increased fat had
been supplied by fatty matter in the food. It was indeed mainly upon a

calculation of the fat which had been supplied in the food of the store pig,

that he found the evidence of the formation of fat in his experiments with

pigs. M. Boussingault is disposed to believe, that the nitrogenous con-

stituents of food probably have some considerable influence in the formation

Weof fat in the animal body.  have ourselves called attention to the fact,

that a large supply of the nitrogenous constituents of the food would seem

to replace a relative deficiency of other constituents. The amount of increase

is found, however, to bear a rapidly decreasing ratio to the amount of nitrogen

in the food when this exceeds a somewhat narrow limit ; whilst the composition

of such increase would appear to contain a less proportion of fat. Whether

thei'efore any effect of an excess of nitrogenous compounds in the produc-

tion of increase be due merely to the amounts they contain of certain non-

nitrogenous elements, or to the influence of the nitrogenous compounds them-

selves as such, ill increasing the activity of some of the vital processes, and thus

aiding the production of fat, or whether any increase due to the nitrogenous

constituents in tlie food is more generally not fat at all, may be considered

to be an open question.

In the experiments made by M. Persoz, geese were the animals he operated

upon, and maize the food employed. He found a i\ec\AQd formation of fat;

and apparently from the starch series of compounds.

  We repeat, then, that we believe that the formation of fat in the animal

body, even to a considerable and practically important extent, and most

probably from the starch series of compounds, may now be considered to be

clearly proved. It would appear, therefore, that the theoretical opinions of

Baron Liebig on this point are fully boi-ne out.

We have thus far only alluded to the feeding of fattening animals ; and we

think that tlie results which have been brought forward clearly indicate, that

with them at least, as our current food-stuffs go, both the amount consumed,

and the increase produced, are regidated more by the supplies of the more

peculiarly respiratory and fat-forming constituents, than of the flesh-forming

Weor nitrogenous ones.   have, however, calculated many human dietaries

and this branch of the subject we hope to enter upon more fully on some future

Weoccasion. '  may, however, remark in passing, that from the results of this

inquiry, as well as from a consideration of the management of the animal

body undergoing somewhat excessive labour, as for instance, the hunting

horse, the racer, the cab-horse, and the fox-hound, and also pugilists and

runners, we are led to believe, that in the cases, at least of ordinary exercise

of force, the exigences of the respiratory system keep pace more nearly with

the demand for nitrogenous constituents of food than is usually supposed

and in fact, that the exigences of the animal body are much more correctly

stated in the following sentences by Professor Liebig, than in those wherein

he has attached so much more of importance to the amounts of the nitro-

genous constituents, as the measure of the comparative value of foods.

At page Sli of the 3rd edition of his Chemical Letters, he says:
u * * * It is evident that the amount of nourishment required by an animal
         --;

FOODS, IN RELATION TO RESPIRATION AND FEEDING. 353

for its support must be in a direct ratio with the quantity of oxygen taken

into its system."

   And again at page 322 :

   " But the waste of matter, or the force exerted, always stands in a certain
relation to the consumption of oxygen in respiration ; and the quantity of
oxygen taken up in a given time determines in all seasons, and in all climates,

the amount of food necessary to restore the equilibrium."

  A somewhat concentrated supply of nitrogen does, however, in some cases,

seem to be required when the system is overtaxed ; as for instance, when

day by day, more labour is demanded of the animal body than it is compe-
tent without deterioration to keep up ; and perhaps also, in the human body,

when under excitement or excessive mental exercise. It must be remembered,

however, that it is in butcher's meat, to which is attributed such high flesh-

forming capacity, that we have also, in the fat which it contains, a large pro-
portion of respiratory material of the most concentrated kind. It is found

too, that of the dry substance of the egg, 40 per cent, is pure fat.

  A consideration of the habits of those of the labouring classes who are

under- rather than over-fed, will show, that they first have recourse to fat
meat, such as pork, rather than to those which are leaner and more nitroge-

nous ; thus perhaps indicating, that the first instinctive call is for an increase
of the respiratory constituents of food. It cannot be doubted, however, that

the higher classes do consume a larger proportion of the leaner meats

though it is probable, as we have said, that even with these as well as pork,
more/a<, possessing a higher respiratory capacity than any other constituent
of food, is taken into the system than is generally imagined. Fat and butter,

indeed, may be said to have about twice and a half the respiratory capacity
of starch, sugar, &c. It should be remembered, too, that the classes which
consume most of the leaner meats, are also those which consume the most

butter, sugar, and in many cases, alcoholic drinks also.

It is further worthy of remark, that wherever labour is expended in the

manufacture of staple articles of food, it has generally for its object the con-

centration of the wo«-nitrogenous, or more peculiarly respiratory constituents.

Sugar, butter, and alcoholic drinks are notable instances of this. Cheese,

which at first sight might appear an exception, is in reality not so ; for those

cheeses which bring the highest price are always those which contain the

most butter ; whilst butter itself is always dearer than cheese.

In conclusion, it must by no means be understood that we would in any

way depreciate the value of even a somewhat liberal amount of nitrogen in

Wefood.  believe, however, that on the current views too high a relative

importance is attached to it ; and that it would conduce to further progress

in this most important field of inquiry if the prevailing opinions on the sub-

ject were somewhat modified.

The Rev. Dr. Bryce gave an Account of a Treatise on Arithmetic in the Chinese
Language, by the Rev. Dr. Moncrieff, late of St. Paul's College, Hong Kong.

   The Chinese have for ages had a character (called Ling) corresponding in part to
our zero, but used by them only to fill a vacant place, not to give local value. Thus
they came one step nearer the Arabic notation than the Greeks did. One step how-
ever remained, which Dr. Moncrieff has taken. The Jesuit missionaries to China
had printed Vlacq's Logarithmic Tables in a simplified character, and it has been
said that a copy of their work was presented to the Royal Society about the year
1750. Dr. Moncrieff's letter requesting him to make the present communication,
had only reached Dr. Bryce on the first day after the present meeting ; and having
been pretty constant in his attendance on the Sections, he had not had time to
investigate the matter particularly : however, he had examined all the records of the
Royal Society within his reach, but could find no notice of the work of those reverend
gentlemen. He was therefore unable to say whether they had attempted to introduce
the admirable device of local value, which is the distinctive characteristic of the Arabic
notation. If they had. Dr. Moncrieff evidently knew nothing of their having done
60 ; which is not wonderful, inasmuch as Dr. Peacock, in his learned and elaborate
history of the science (Encyclopaedia Metropolitana), makes no mention of their
work, from which we may infer that it was unknown even to him. At all events,
Dr. Moncrieff found the actual arithmetic of China in the same clumsy condition
in which it has been for ages, their notation quite unfit for making calculations on
paper as we do, in consequence of which they were obliged to perform all arithme-
tical operations on the Abacus*.

    Finding the circle used for another purpose in the written language of China, Dr.
Moncrieff used a triangle for his ling or zero, and employed it to convert the cha-

racters representing simple units, into symbols for tens, hundreds, &c., exactly as in

the Arabic notation. He also introduced our marks of addition, subtraction, mul-

tiplication, division, involution, evolution, &c., modifying some of them to distinguish
them from characters already in use for other purposes.

Helution and evolution ; in short, the general scientific principles of arithmetic.

did not attempt a commercial arithmetic, as that would have required a fuller know-

ledge of their weights, measures,  &c. than  he found  it convenient  to  acquire                              but
                                                                                                            ;

as these are all decimal, it will be easy for any one to do what remains. His main

object was to make arithmetic an instrument of tliat intellectual culture, which, in

common with all missionaries, he deemed of so much importance. With this view
he has given the reasons of all the rules, except that for finding the greatest common

measure of two numbers, and that of Mr. Horner for extracting any root of a number,

which are obviously too difficult for the pupils for whom his book was intended.

   Dr. Moncrieff 's attempt has already had such a measure of success as to encourage
a hope that the stream of European improvement may, with less difficulty than we

have hitherto supposed, be made to flow into the stagnant waters of Chinese science

and literature.

 On Biquaternions. By Sir William R. Hamilton, LL.D., M.R.I.A.

   The author briefly explained the term which he had been obliged to introduce into
this new system ; showed the simplicity and the reasons for the leading operations
in it ; and by a few very simple experiments on the rotation of planes round axes
inclined to each other, explained the simple interpretation of some of those results
which appeared at first to be inconsistent with the principles of the ordinary analysis.

On the Gradient of Density in saturated Vapours, and its Development as a
  ByPhysical Relation between Bodies of definite Chemical Co7istitution .
   J. J. Waterston.

   The object of the present communication was to give a short notice of certain de-
velopments of a general law of density in saturated vapours, which the author had
lately, in a paper laid before the Royal Society, collected evidence from observation
to support. Density is, by him, taken to signify, not specific gravity, but the quotient
of the pressure of the vapour by its temperature, reckoned from the zero of gaseous
tension ; the standard of temperature being that of the air-thermometer. The
general law is, that the temperature and sixth root of the density of a saturated
vapour form the co-ordinates of a straight line. In other words, at the same tem-
perature, or at the same interval of temperature, any two vapours in contact with
their generating liquids, have densities that are either equal, or that have a constant
proportion to each other. The author gave diagrams illustrative of the application
of this law to several vapours. The point of convergence of the right lines he calls
nodes. He gave twenty-four distinct examples of its application to steam, alcohol,
cether, and several other vapours, laid down the formulee by which the computations
could be conducted, and pointed out the method of determining the value of the

constants.

          Notice of a Tree struck by Lightning in Ctandeboye Park,

By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., &, V.P.R.S. Edinb.

During one of the thunder-storms which passed over the county of Down in August

last, a birch-tree of considerable magnitude was struck by lightning. The tree stood

in a thick mass of wood, and was not the tallest of the group. The iightning-bolt

struck it laterally about 15 feet above the ground, exactly at the cleft where the two

Aprincipal branches of the tree rose from the trunk.   large part of the bark and a

piece of the solid wood were driven to some distance, and the electric fluid passed

down the trunk into the ground, splitting the tree in two by a rent throughout the

whole of its thickness. Lord Dufferin was so good as to have the tree cut down

for examination. From a section of the upper branches it was obvious that the

lightning had not entered at the top and passed through the branches into the trunk.

Several workmen, indeed, ih the neighbourhood saw the lightning-bolt moving hori-

zontally before it struck the tree, a fact entirely confirmed by the effect which it

produced. The force of the bolt must have been great, as it was expended in tear-

ing off the piece of the trunk already mentioned, and in rending the tree in two,

without separating the two halves.

The track of the lightning was marked, from its point of entrance to its passage

Ainto the earth, by a darkish brown band, about 2 or 3 inches broad.  portion oi

the wood thus marked will be sent by Lord UufFerin to Dr. Andrews, who will

ascertain if the colouring matter contains any of those mineral substances which
M. Fusinieri, an Italian philosopher, has found to exist in those parts of bodies over

which lightning has passed.

The fact contained in this notice, that an object may be struck by lightning in a

locality where there are numerous conducting points more elevated than itself, shows

that a lightning-bolt cannot be diverted from its course by conductors, and that

the protection of a building from this species of meteor can only be effected by con-

ductors stretching out in all directions.

 % Account ofa Case of Vision without Retina.
         Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S. .5, V.P.R.S. Edinb.

   In the course of last summer I met with a gentleman who had a peculiarity or
vision of a very remarkable kind, and one of which I believe there is no other ex-
ample. While hunting he fell from his horse, and received such a severe blow upon
his head as to deprive him entirely of the sight nf one eye, and to a great extent of
the sight of the other. Neither of the eyes had suffered the slightest local injury
from the blow, and therefore the total blindness in one eye and the partial blindness
in the other arose from the insensibility of the retina caused by the disorganization
of the part of the brain more immediately connected with the origin of the optic

nerves.

   The degree of vision which remained in one eye was such as to enable its pos-
sessor to recognise any friend at the distance of 400 or 500 yards, or more generally
speaking, at a considerable distance ; but in society he could not recognise his most
intimate acquaintances. He could see only the nose, the eye, or the mouth of his
friend j and he was not able to obtain, from the duration of the impression of light,
and the rapid transference of his eye from one feature to another, such a combina-
tion of the separate impressions as to give the likeness which they composed.

   In order to explain this singular result, I must recall the attention of the Section

to a notice printed in the Reports of a former meeting of the Association, ' On the

Visual Impressions on the Foramen Centrale of the Retina*.'
   From these facts it is obvious that the limited vision which we have described,

was performed entirely on the choroid coat and through the /orome» centrale of the

retina.

   In order to ascertain the area of distinct vision, I requested the patient to tell me
the number of letters he could read distinctly, and found that the angle which these

letters subtended at the retina was as nearly as could be ascertained about 4 J degrees,
the angle subtended by the foramen as deduced from the previous experiments which
1 have mentioned.

   The use of the retina is to give sensitiveness, and of the choroid, distinctness.

On the form of Images produced by Lenses and Mirrors of different sizes.
   By Sir David Brewster, K.H, D.C.L., F.R.S., ^ V.P.R.S. Edinb.

   The shape of the images of objects as formed by lenses and mirrors with spherical
surfaces, has been treated of by various optical writers f ; but I am not aware that

4 REPORT 1852.

aay author has treated of the shape of images as affected only by the size of the
lenses or mirrors by which they are formed. This subject is of fundamental im-
portance in the new art of Photography, when the images delineated by the solar

rays are formed by lenses, and sometimes, too, by mirrors of a larger size.
   The images of objects formed upon a plane surface differ from the objects them-

selves, from many causes which it is unnecessary here to enumerate. The most
skilful opticians have striven, and to a great extent successfully, to make the most

perfect lenses for photographic purposes ; but the photographer himself has over-
looked the greatest imperfection to which his art is subject, arising solely from the

size of the lenses in his camera.

According to the geometrical principles of perspective, the correct representation

of any body or object whatever, upon a plane surface, is obtained by drawing lines
from the point of sight, through every point of the body or object, to that plane.
As the pupil of the human eye is little more than two-tenths of an inch in diameter,
we may regard the picture on the retina as a correct representation of external
objects, in so far, at least, as its correctness depends upon the size of the lens which
forms the picture. In like manner we may consider the image of objects formed by

a lens the size of the pupil of the eye as a correct representation of the object.

  Now if in perspective we take a new point of sight two-tenths of an inch distant

from the first, the perspective representation of the object on a plane will be changed,
and the magnitude of the change will increase with the distance between the two
points of sight. In like manner, if we look at an object from two different points,
which are two-tenths of an inch distant, we shall obtain two views of that object

equally dissimilar.

    Following out this principle, let us suppose that a lens four inches square is
employed to produce upon a plane surface the image of any object, and that the

size of the pupil of the eye is two-tenths of an inch ; then, as there will be several
hundred areas equal to that of the pupil in the lens, the image given by the lens will
be a compound image consisting of several hundred perspective views of the object

taken from several hundred different points of sight, each distant two-tenths of an

inch from its neighbour, and all those on the margin of the lens distant three inches

and eight-tenths from those opposite to them. Such a jumble of images cannot,

under any circumstances, be a true representation of the object. This view of the
question, as one of perspective, will be more intelligible if we consider the subject

optically.

Let LL be either the horizontal or the vertical section of a lens, by means of

            Yxs. 1.                      which an image or picture of the object

                                       ABCDE is to be taken either on a plane sur-

                                   ,. face, or suspended in the air, and made visible

                                   to an eye behind the lens. The solid object

                                   ABE consists of a cylindrical portion ABDC,

                                   ABwhose termination  is a circle, and of a

                                   conical portion CDE. If we continue the

                                   lines EC, ED, and CA, DB, they will meet

                                   the lens in the points c, a, d, b. If we now

                                   cover all the lens except the central portion

                                   ABEab, the image of the object  will be

                                   merely a circle, as shown at ab, fig. 1, because

            Fig. 2.                not a single ray from the cylindrical surface

                                   ABDC, nor from the conical surface CDE, can
                                   reach the lens ab. In like manner, if we cover

                                   all the lens except cd, the image of the ob-

                                   Dject ABE will be, as shown in fig. 2, at cd,

                                   its circular termination, and the cylindrical

                                   CDEray from its conical part  can fall upon

the lens cd. But when the whole area LL of the lens is exposed, the whole object

will be seen suspended in the air, as at LL, fig. 2.

If the image is received upon a plane surface behind the lens, the cylindrical part

will be represented by a halo or circle of light surrounding the circle ab, and cor-

responding in size to the section mn, fig. 1, of the cone of rays CccZD ; and tlie

CDEconical part  will be represented by another halo or circle, round the halo mn,

and corresponding to the section op of the cone of rays ELL.

    Results demonstrating the truth of these views have been obtained photographi-

cally by my friend Mr. Buckle of Peterborough, whose beautiful Talbotypes obtained

a Council Medal at the Great Exhibition. The acting diameter of his lens was 3|
inches, and the effect of the combination of the marginal pictures is most distinctly

exhibited.

Let us now apply these results to the photographical pictures of the human bust

as taken in a camera. The human face and head consist superficially of various

surfaces, some vertical, some horizontal, and many inclined at all angles to the

Aaxis of the lens by which they are to be represented on a plane surface.  true

perspective representation of the human head placed at AB, will be that which is

given by a lens ab whose diameter is equal to that of the pupil of the eye, or as

formed by lines passing from the centre of the pupil to different points of the

EDhead. From such a portrait, all surfaces, such as AC, BD, EC,  will be

excluded ; but if we use the whole lens LL, all these surfaces, and all those of an

BDintermediate inclination between AC and EC,  and DE, will be introduced

LLinto the portrait. If, for example,  is a horizontal section of the lens, the right

hand marginal parts of the lens, between a and L, may introduce into the portrait

the left eye, or the left ear, or the left side of the nose, and all other parts of a certain

inchnation to the axis ; thus enlarging all such parts and widening the picture. If

LL be a vertical section of the lens, the lower part of the nose, the interior of the

nostrils, the lower part of the upper lip, and the lower part of the chin will be intro-
duced into the portrait by the lower marginal parts 6L of the lens ; while the top
of the head, the upper parts of the lip and the eyehds, will be introduced by the
upper marginal parts aL of the lens. The same is true of all other sections of the
lens, and a monstrous portrait of the human bust is thus obtained by the photo-
grapher, the monstrosity increasing with the size of the lens. The nature and
character of the portrait will thus vary with the superficial form of the lens, which

may be circular, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, or of any irregular form ; and
in this way remarkable modifications of photographic portraits may be produced

merely by varying the shape of the lens.
   The amount of the deformity introduced into portraits by a lens three or four inches

in diameter may be readily estimated by the fact, that when a portrait is taken from
two points two and a half inches distant, such as those taken as seen by each eye

separately, the difference between the two is so well marked that it can be pointed

Aout by a child.  portrait, therefore, consisting of a combination of portraits as

seen from every point of a lens three or four inches in diameter, must give a form and

expression to the human countenance very wide of the truth.

The hideousness of photographic portraits is universally admitted, and has been

ascribed to the imperfection of the lenses employed, the unsteadiness of the sitter,
and the necessary constraint of features and of limb under which he submits to the
operation. The true cause, modified doubtless by others, is the size of the lens, even

if the lens is optically perfect.

   The photographer, therefore, who has a genuine interest in the perfection of his

art, will receive these truths with gratitude ; and by accelerating the photographic
processes, with the aid of more sensitive materials, he will be able to make use of

lenses of very small aperture, and thus place his art in a higher position than that
which it has yet attained. The photographer, on the contrary, whose sordid interests
bribe him to forswear even the truths of science, will continue to deform the youth

and beauty that may in ignorance repair to his studio, adding scowls and wrinkles
to the noble forms of manhood, and giving to a fresh and vigorous age the aspects

of departing or departed life.

But while small apertures possess such a peculiar advantage as that of giving a

true perspective representation of the object or scene to be delineated, a small lens

possesses still greater advantages. In large lenses much light is lost by the absorp-
tion of rays in passing through a great thickness of glass, and also by reflexion from

the /owr or eight surfaces of the achromatic lens or lenses employed. In such lenses,
too, neither the chromatic nor the spherical aberrations, which increase with the
e REPORT 1852.

aperture, are completely corrected, and no attempt even is made to remove the
influence of the secondary spectrum. With small apertures, too, objects, or
parts of objects, at different distances, will be delineated with nearly the same
distinctness, and a picture produced as nearly resembling the original as it can be
made in the present state of practical optics.

   The same observations, with the exception of those which relate to the achromatism
and the thickness of the refracting medium, are applicable to the images produced
by mirrors of different sizes.

On the Laws of Magnetism and Diamagnetism, in a Letter to Dr. Faraday.
                            By Professor Matteucci.

                                                                                                      Pisa, August 15, 1852.

--My dear Faraday, With much regret, and at the last moment, I am compelled

to renounce the pleasure of assisting at the Meeting of the British Association and

of conversing with you and other friends on scientific subjects. I beg you to present

my cordial thanks to Col. Sabine for the invitation he so kindly sent me. I ask
your permission to address to you an extract of my researches on magnetism and

diamagnetism, which have occupied me for several years : if you think that this

communication can offer any interest to the members of the Association, you can, if

you please, read it to the meeting, as I should be glad in any way to prove my

gratitude to that respectable body.

I have studied, in the first place, the influence of temperature and mechanic action

on magnetic and diamagnetic substances. Thus, I operated on iron in a state of

fusion obtained by the flame of oxyhydrogen gas. In this experiment a small iron

globule is placed in a cavity at the extremity of a horizontal bar of copper wire or

caustic lime, suspended by a cocoon silk in the magnetic field between the conical

poles of a very powerful electro- magnet. Iron in a state of fusion, partially oxidated,

is always attracted by the magnet ; the diminution of magnetic attraction produced
by fusion in iron is immensely great : in one experiment, which I think was suf-

ficiently exact, I found that attraction became at least 15 million times less, passing

from the ordinary temperature to the state of fusion. All the compounds of iron,

and all natural substances containing a portion of metallic iron, suffer a diminution

by heat ; hence it is that the natural or artificial compounds of magnetic and dia-

magnetic substances, such as certain coals and charcoal, clay, impure metals, gold,
copper, zinc, &c., which are attracted at the ordinary temperature, appear to be
temporarily repelled when strongly heated. Passing to diamagnetic substances, I

have found that their repulsive action suffers a very slight diminution by fusion in

phosphorus and sulphur. But this is not the case with bismuth in fusion, upon

which I have verified and completed the observation of Pliicker.

The following experiment is simple, and sure to succeed at the first attempt. Take

a bar of pure caustic lime and suspend it in the magnetic field in the manner

described ;  when the  magnetic power is  developed, the  bar is  repelled                                       and when
                                                                                                              ;

the bar is strongly heated, the repulsion is certainly not less great. Touching lightly
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  7

 the small cavity in the bar of lime with a piece of paper besmeared with oxide of
 iron, one can easily arrange so that the bar is attracted ; and when the quantity of
 oxide is sufficient, the bar continues to be attracted even when strongly heated.
 Fill the cavity with bismuth, 1 gramme, for instance, and the bar will be again
 repelled when the magnetism is developed. But if, before passing the current, the
 bismuth is fused, the bar will be attracted, and will attach itself to the extremity of
 the pole when the magnetism is produced. At the instant that the bismuth becomes
 solid, the bar detaches itself abruptly from the pole, and the diamagnetic repulsion
 of the bismuth prevails.

    It now remained for me to ascertain whether bismuth in a state of fusion was
 indifferent to magnetic action, or whether, on the contrary, it became magnetic.
 For this purpose, I measured by the number of oscillations the diamagnetic force of

 a cylinder of bismuth contained in a corresponding cavity formed in a bar of lime
 suspended by a glass hook to a cocoon silk. Operating with the necessary pre-
 cautions, which are too long to be described here, I have found that the bar of lime,
with its cylinder of bismuth in a state of fusion, made the same number of oscilla-
tions as when without bismuth. The lime being constantly diamagnetic, this might
have masked the change of the bismuth transformed into a magnetic body by fusion.
I therefore suspended between the poles of the electro-magnet a bar of lime, formed
somewhat like a salt-spoon, in order to increase greatly the quantity of bismuth in

fusion compared with that of the lime. In one experiment I employed as much as 57
grammes of fused bismuth, and nevertheless the repulsion continued. Thus, then, the
diamagnetic power of bismuth diminishes suddenly at the point of fusion, and during

the state of fusion the bismuth remains indifferent, without being apparently changed

into a magnetic body.

   I have studied the influence of mechanic action on diamagnetisra. By means of
a copper box provided with a screw, I was able to compress a pure bismuth cylinder,

3 millims. in diameter and 34 millims. in length, so as to reduce it to 28 millims.
I then made two cylinders of bismuth precisely of the same dimensions, the one
compressed, the other in its natural state, and I found that the compressed cyHnder
had a diamagnetic power distinctly superior to that of natural bismuth. I think it
advisable here to call your attention to the fact which Coulomb, and more recently
Pliicker, have discovered respecting feebly magnetic substances ; namel)', that all

cylinders of bismuth have the same oscillation independently of their weight, or in
other words, that the diamagnetic power is proportionate to the weight of the
cylinders. Cylinders of bismuth, varying in weight from 0"576 gr. to 18"600 gr.,
give the same oscillation, I studied afterwards, at some length, the influence of a
powerful electro-magnet upon chemical affinity and cohesion. You have proved
that gases, and even the most magnetic of the gases, do not suffer any variation in
density by magnetic action. I have repeated the same experiments on gases, em-
ploying a glass tube closed or open, such as that of a spirit-level, filled with gas
and different liquids. The gaseous bubble placed between the two polar extremities
suffers considerable contraction and elongation, according to the nature of the liquid
and gas. I think I have proved that these appearances are owing to a simple
change of form in the bubble without variation of density produced by the differential
action of the magnet on the gas and on the liquid. I made a great number of expe-
riments in order to measure the electrolyzation of acidulated water in a very powerful

magnetic field, or independently of this influence. Several precautions, not gene-
rally followed, are absolutely necessary to obtain a uniform result in the use of the

voltameter. These experiments led me to conclude that the most powerful magnetic

action has no influence whatever on the electrolyzation of water. There is however
a phsenomenon which 1 do not think has been observed hitherto, and on which I
must say a word. In electrolyzing water in a powerful electro-magnetic field, and
if the experiment is properly arranged, the streams of gas bubbles which rise from
the two electrodes are violently carried away in certain directions when the magnetism
is put in activity. I think this movement is communicated by the liquid currents

discovered by Davy. By employing a saturated solution of sulphate of copper for

electrolyte, and by blowing into that liquid through a glass capillary tube a stream of
atmospheric bubbles instead of those formed by electrolyzation in water, I could
easily convince myself that the phsenomenon is independent of any peculiar state of
8 REPORT-- 1852.

Ihe gas supposed to be derived from electrolyzation. By a proper application of
Nobili's beautiful experiment of colours obtained by electrolyzation, I was enabled

to demonstrate, that an axis of great magnetic power has no sensible influence in
disturbing the distribution or propagation of the electrical currents, nor the physical
or chemical composition of the body traversed by them. Make a rectangular box, the
longer sides of which are formed of perfectly clean plates of platina. Fill this box
with a solution of chloride of iron, or acetate of lead, or other metallic salts, and place
it between the poles of a very powerful electro-magnet. The coloration of these
plates, produced by the shortest passage of a very feeble current, is found to be exactly
the same at all points, that is, on the line of the magnetic poles, as at the distance of
150 or 200 millimetres from that line. The magnetic power therefore does not
change either the composition of the liquid subject to its action, por the distribution
of the electricity which traverses it. I remember having found formerly' that the
laws of the derived currents on a plate of tin and of the isodynamic lines, were not
disturbed by the influence of a very strong electro-magnet. I have also studied the
influence of the magnetic power of the elements on that of the body resulting from
their combination. Although there are some examples of magnetic compounds,
the elements of which are diamagnetic, such as protochloride of copper, one finds in
general that the magnetical character of the compound results from that of its ele-
ments. Pure copper, which, independently of inductive currents, is decidedly dia-
magnetic, produces protoxide, which is indifl"erent or scarcely diamagnetic, and a per-
oxide which is decidedly magnetic. The same may be said of silver; the protoxide
is diamagnetic, and the binoxide, obtained by the pile, is decidedlymagnetic. Operating
on the various oxides of bismuth and antimony, I measured the variations in the
magnetic power induced by different quantities of oxygen contained in these oxides.

   I have made a great number of conclusive and elegant experiments on the laws of
equilibrium of diamagnetic bodies in the magnetic field, and on the reciprocal action
of diamagnetic bodies. I have employed in these experiments a solution of chloride
of iron in concentrated alcohol, so as to have the same density as olive oil, which is
a diamagnetic body. I could thus fill the magnetic field with this ferruginous
solution, in which floats a drop of oil, more or less large, or I could reverse the
arrangement. At the moment in which the electro-magnet is set in action, the
two liquids are set in movement and place themselves in equilibrium, occupying
distinct places in the magnetic field. By adopting the proper arrangements, one
can easily determine the form of the curved surfaces of separation of the two liquids.
This method is delicate, and fitted for discovering the slightest difference in the force
of the two poles, or in their relative distance from the centre of the magnetic field.
If the magnetic field is uniform, as one obtains it with plane polar surfaces of great
extent, a small piece of bismuth suspended to a cocoon silk, in the manner employed
also by yourself, is in equilibrium in the centre of the magnetic field and in the

greater part of the equatorial line. When the magnetic field is formed by the ferru-

ginous solution, a piece of bismuth or drop of oil floating within the liquid does not
remain in equilibrium in the centre of the field, but flies off to the side following the
equatorial line. The drop changes in form, and is prolonged in axial or equatorial
direction according to its being magnetic or diamagnetic. The constant motion of
the diamagnetic drop from the centre towards the side along the equatorial line and
this, even when floating not at the surface but in the middle of the liquid mass, is
not in evident accord with the beautiful experiments of Reich and Tyndall. I have
remarked on the fact, that the motion takes place when the drop is even in the
midst of the liquid, in order to prove that this motion is independent of the remark-
able elevation undergone by the ferruginous liquid along the line of the poles.
With this method I could easily examine the mutual action of diamagnetic bodies.
For this purpose the base of the square box placed in the magnetic field was formed
one half of marble or wood, the other of bismuth. This base was covered with a
thin stratum of ferruginous liquid, and of oil three millimetres in thickness. The
line of junction of the marble and bismuth was alternately axial and equatorial. I
was never able to discern the slightest dissymmetry in the form of the surfaces of
separation of the two liquids, which might be attributed to the influence of the two
very different substances, marble and bismuth, as regards their magnetic power. In

the same way, I have never been able to discover any mutual action at the moment
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  9

when the electro-magnet was in activity, between two drops of oil suspended in the
midst of the ferruginous liquid, or between a piece of bismuth and one of these drops.
I have therefore reason to doubt whether such movements, which have been con-
sidered as proving the mutual action of diamagnetic bodies, are not rather owing to
the movement of the entire liquid mass of which we have spoken. Although it is
extremely probable that the mutual action of diamagnetic bodies does exist, and,
according to the laws admitted also by yourself, still it must be allowed that this
action is very feeble, and it is much to be desired that an experiment should be made

by which it might be clearly demonstrated.

   I pass over in this extract, which is already too long, my experiments upon the

diflferent inductive power of various metals, on the time of induction in the different

metals, &c. ; but I must finally call your attention to the part of these researches
which I belie-ve to be the most important, and which relates to an experimental

theory of diamagnetic phsenomena.

  A mass composed of very fine powder of perfectly pure silver or copper, the con-

ductibility of which is destroyed by the interposition of a thin film of oil of tur-

pentine, duly suspended in proximity of the polar surface, is repelled at the instant of
the passage of the current, and continues to oscillate like a mass of bismuth. If one
composes other similar suspended matter in which the quantity of metal and con-
ductibility gradually increases, one sees the silver or copper pendulums first repelled
from the pole, then come to a stop after a constantly decreasing number of oscilla-
tions, until at last they present the phsenomenon which you have called revulsion,

due to the production of induced currents. In the same way a small copper

or silver disc, fixed to the extremity of a straw lever suspended by a cocoon
silk near to a pole, is repelled or attracted at the beginning or end of the current
without being subject to any movement of oscillation : if this disc is cut so as to
destroy its continuity as much as possible, to prevent the development of the induc-
tive current, it then exhibits the phsenomenon of oscillation like bismuth. These
phsenomena, and several others which you have described, and which it is unneces-
sary to adduce here, have led you and Weber, with much reason, to admit the
hypothesis of a diamagnetic polarity in reverse direction of that acquired by mag-

netic bodies. I hasten to add, that my experiments do not lead me to reject this
hypothesis, as you, and more recently M. Verdet, have done ; and that, on the con-
trary, it seems to me in conformity with physical analogy to admit that diamagnetic

substances, when subjected to magnetic force, assume a polarity the same in kind
as, but reverse in direction of, that acquired by iron, which polarity has a duration
varying according to the nature and conductibility of the substance, and which,

according to these circumstances, tends to transform itself into an inductive instanta-
neous current. I abstain from entering here into a minute development of these theo-
retical views, which every one can do for himself, and proceed at once to speak

experimentally. It is perfectly true that you, and more recently M. Verdet, have
demonstrated that the phsenomenon discovered by Weber in bismuth can be explained
by simply referring to the inductive currents, and without having recourse to dia-
magnetic polarity ; but the same experiments have not proved the non-existence of

diamagnetic polarity. In the first place, I recollect that oxide of copper is strongly

magnetic ; consequently a mass of copper filings with oxidated superficies cannot,
when it acts on the electro-magnet, develope inductive phsenomena similar to those

of bismuth or pure copper. In fact, I found with my inductive apjiaratus, which is

certainly the most powerful and delicate hitherto constructed, that a mass of copper

filings oxidated at the superficies, such as used in organic analysis, gives inductive

currents as if it were a magnetic body. In order to prove by our experimental

method that diamagnetic polarity does not exist, one must prove that no induced
currents are obtained in the direction demanded by that supposed polarity, when one

makes an electro-magnet act on a diamagnetic body, incapable of conducting in-
duced currents, and in quantity suflScient to induce sensible effects on our apparatus.

To show the superiority of my apparatus, I have onlj' to mention, that a stratum of

500 grammes of cotcothar brought near, but not in contact with the electro-magnet,
and consequently without any apparatus of rotation, produced an induced current of
 10° to 15° and more, according to the strength of the battery. With this same appa-
                                                                    ;

10 REPORT 1852.

ratu3 and a rotating machine, I obtained very distinct phaenomena of induction by the

action of a bundle of varnished bismuth or copper ivires. I have ah'eady observed

that the experiment can be decisive only when one acts on the electro-magnet with

a sufficient quantity of the diamagnetic substance. In fact, it seems reasonable to

admit that the effects of induction, magnetic or diamagnetic, ought to be in propor-

Nowtion with the corresponding effects of attraction or repulsion.  I am not very

far from the truth in admitting that 1 gramme of bismuth is repelled by an electro-

magnet with the same force as 11 milligrammes of colcothar is attracted by the

same magnet ; that 1 gramme of sugar or stearic acid makes equilibrium to 5 or 6

milligrammes of colcothar, and 1 gramme of sulphur to 2 or 3 milligrammes of col-

cothar. I have already said that the inductive action of 500 grammes of colcothar

gives me 10° to 15° of induced current : therefore, to obtain a similar effect by bismuth

(if diamagnetic polarity- exists), one must employ a quantity of that metal, which is

at least a hundred iimes 500 grammes, or 50 kilogrammes. By similar reasoning one

sees what an enormous quantity of phosphorus, sugar and sulphur would have to be

employed in order to obtain a sensible inductive effect, and how far we have hitherto

been from employing the necessary quantity. It is only by the method of rotation

of inductive bodies in presence of the electro-magnet, that one can obtain sensible

effects from small quantities of diamagnetic substances. Using the method of

rotation, as V^erdet has done, with an electro-magnet and inductive coil more powerful

than any which have been hitherto employed, I have succeeded in obtaining distinct

signs of induction from a mass composed of fragments of varnished bismuth. I con-

tinue to vary and extend my experiments in this way ; therefore, for the present,

though I should be grateful to you if you would communicate this note to the British

Association, I wish to be able to arrange these researches myself before publishing

them.

On placing Compasses on Board Iron Ships. By Captain E. J. Johnson,

   B.N., F.B.S., Superintendent of the Compass Admiralty Department of
   the Boyal Navy. (In a Letter to the President.)

   It was my intention to have been present at the Meeting of the British Association
at Belfast, but I have been prevented by my official duties on board some of H.M.

steam-ships which could not be delayed. One of these was the iron steam-vessel

"Trident," and I think it worth while to notice to you a circumstance which oc-

curred relating to the compass observations.
   As a member of the Compass Committee, j'ou are aware that the system adopted

--in H.M. service on board iron ships, is to elevate the compass considerably to

ascertain the deviations and allow for them, and to persevere in a continual series

of observations to ascertain the change of deviation according to the change of the
ship's geographical position, as described in the " Practical Rules" which have been

--issued to all H.M. ships since 1842 ; the said plan being considered safer than the

application of iron or magnets for the reduction of the amount of deviation.
   In placing the compasses of H.M. ships, I have, of course, adhered to the recom-

mendations of the Committee, taking care by a few preliminary observations to fix
upon a position where the deviations were lessened ; but the circumstance to which

--I wish to draw your attention at present is this : While the " Trident" was in the

basin at Woolwich, it occurred to me to try whether a position could be discovered
where the influences of the ship's iron upon the compass were so equalized as to
render the amount of deviation so small as to be of no practical importance.

   The correct magnetic direction of the ship's head having been determined by a
compass on the shore, and that proving to be near to one of the points of maximum
deviation (the standard compass on the quarter-deck there indicating 20° westerly
deviation), I moved the standard compass several feet (urther forward in the centre
line of the ship, and there found the westerly deviation increased to 29°. I now
commenced to move the compass aft 6 or 7 feet at a time, observing the deviation
at each position, and found the zvesterly deviation decreased : and on placing the
tripod of the compass directly over the rudder-head, easterly deviation was produced
and hence it followed that there must be a position somewhere between the two last
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;;

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         11

places of observation where there would be no deviation while the ship's head re-
mained in the same direction.

   This position I practically discovered by moving the compass a few inches at a
time, till it indicated the correct magnetic direction of the ship's head.

   The question which now remained to be proved, was, to what extent the deviations
of the said compass had been lessened (or what they actually were) when the ship's
head was placed upon different points, and I was gratified to find that after swing-
ing the vessel and observing upon the eight principal points, the compass, placed as

before described, proved to be correct within ^ of a point.
    It is necessary to mention that the "Trident" has wooden beams under the

quarter-deck, and therefore it remains to be seen to what extent such observations

may be useful in vessels which have iron beams.
   It will also be requisite to ascertain by actual observation how far a position so

selected shall prove advantageous when the ship changes her geographical position
and as the "Trident" is about to proceed to the southern hemisphere, and is amply
provided with instructions and the means of ascertaining such changes, and as I
shall swing her again at Greenhithe on every point before she leaves, we may hope
for much useful information on this important subject.

   In sending you these remarks, I must observe, that it may not always be practi-

cable to find the position of no-deviation, or where the influences of the iron in the
ship upon the magnetic needle are equalized, because such a point might be found in
a most inconvenient position, or be too near moveable iron work, machinery, &c.

but if we succeed in approximating towards it, and thereby reduce the deviations

within moderate limits, a point of great practical importance will be gained in navi-
gation.

On a peculiarity of Vision. By Professor Powell, F.JR.S.

my1 he peculiarity to which I refer affects both  own eyes, but more especially the

left eye. They have always been long-sighted, but I never used glasses till about

seven j'ears ago. About that time I had, I fear, injured my eye-sight generally by

optical experiments, and have in consequence thought it prudent to desist from them

m a great degree. I then perceived a general indistinctness of vision, which is how-

ever completely removed by the use of convex glasses of long focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    but I have not

that it is produced by the image of every small object, as for instance, a fine dark line

the distance of the object from the eye, nor in placing the line in different azimuths

round the axis of the eye ; the appearance is presented whether I use one ej'e or

both, but is somewhat less marked with the right eye. Conjectures may easily be

started as to the change of form in the lens which might produce such an appear-

ance, but I will not at present do more than simply mention the fact, as it may

perhaps elicit other statements of a similar kind which may tend to throw light on

the question as to its nature.

On Luminous Beams. Communicated by Professor Powell, F.R.S,

Appearances of luminous beams in the sky, of a peculiar kind, agreeing neither

with the characteristics of aurora, nor of the zodiacal light, have been occasionally

--Arecorded.
remarkable instance of this kind was observed by Mr. G. A. Rowell,

at Oxford, July 11, 1850 : "When the sun was just setting, or set, but hidden by

clouds, he saw a bright beam with parallel sides extending vertically upwards from

the place of the sun to an altitude estimated at 15° or 20°." Again, on July 6, 1852,

--Mr. Rowell saw a similar pheenomenon which he describes thus : " About 10 o'clock

P.M., I observed two extraordinary rays of light in the N.N.W., each extending

from the horizon to upwards of half-way towards the pole star, and apparently pro-

ceeding from the sun's place below the horizon, in a direct line towards that star. I

from any aurora I have ever seen ; there was no change to be observed in them, and
they kept their place with regard to the stars. At 11 o'clock they had disappeared."

On Converging Sun-heams. Communicated by Professor Powell, F.R.S.

  A peculiarly brilliant instance of the phaenomenon of the solar rays converging by

the effect of perspective to a point opposite the sun immediately after sunset, was
observed by several persons in and near Oxford, on July 6, 1852, about 8"35 p.m.,
and lasted about twentj' minutes. Mr. G. A. Rowell collected the accounts of dif-
ferent observers, illustrated by sketches, given unknown to each other, and apparently
without their being aware of the real nature of the pheenomenon. He states that
" All agree as to the general appearance being that of five or seven principal rays of
bright light arising from (converging to) a point in the S.E. horizon, just opposite
to where the sun had set. Each ray extended about 65° or 70°, and was widest at
the upper end ; the middle ray being perpendicular. There is a difference in the
statements as to whether there were smaller rays between the principal ones
The observer on Shotover Hill had a clear view of the N.W. horizon, and remarked
that there was not at the time the slightest appearance of rays where the sun had
gone down,"

On the Re- concentration of the Mechanical Energy of the Universe.
         By W. J. Macquorn Rankine, C.E., F.R.S.E.

Mr. Rankine observed that it has long been conjectured, and is now being esta-

blished by experiment, that all forms of physical energy, whether visible motion,

heat, light, magnetism, electricity, chemical action, or other forms not yet understood,

are mutually convertible                                                                                                               that the total amount  of physical  energy  in the universe
                                                                                                                                    ;

is unchangeable, and varies merely its condition and locality, by conversion from

one form to another, or by transference from one portion of matter to another.

   Professor William Thomson has pointed out, that in the present condition of the
known world there is a preponderating tendency to the conversion of all the other

forms of energy into heat, and to the equable diffusion of all heat ; a tendency which

seems to lead towards the cessation of all phsenomena.

The author of the present paper points out, that all heat tends ultimately to

assume the radiant form ; and that if the medium which surrounds the stars and

transmits radiation between them be supposed to have bounds encircling the visible

world, beyond which is empty space, then at these bounds the radiant heat will be

totally reflected, and will ultimately be re-concentrated into foci ; at one of which, if

an extinct star arrives, it will be resolved into its elements, and a store of energy

reproduced.

        On an Improved Form of Reflecting Instrumentfor Use at Sea.

                  By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth, F.R.A.S.

   The peculiar circumstances of an observer at sea, caused chiefly by the rolling of
the vessel, preclude the use of any of the ordinary instruments employed on land
for measuring altitudes, depending as they do on levels or plumb lines for their zero
points ; recourse must be had to the principle of double images by two reflectors,
the method invented by Hadley and Newton. This one necessary principle has been

carried out in a variety of different forms, in the sextant, quadrant, quintant or re-
flecting circle, some more or less accurate or more or less convenient than others
but all of them, under whatever names they are known, are merely different forms
of essentially the same instrument.

   Great ingenuity has been shown in many of these forms, but still the greatest
TRANSACTIONS OF TH6 SECTIONS.  13

degree of efficiency has not yet been arrived at, or the highest degree of convenience

attained for all the various occasions required in practice.

   The naval officers, who know what these difficult circumstances are, unfortunately
are not in a position to remedy the defects of their instruments ; while the makers
thereof, living at home at ease, cannot fully appreciate all the difficulties actually
met with in real practice at sea. This has left room for a person like the author,
who has had some practice at sea and some experience in instrument-making, to

eflFect several minor improvements of a practical character.
   The ordinary form of the reflecting instrument at present in use is the sextant,

in which will generally be found, even as made by the best makers, more or less of
the following little practical drawbacks upon the speedy and accurate employment

of it.

   It is packed in its box in a way difficult to be got out, the handle, by which it
ought only to be touched, being below : also it cannot be laid down anywhere
without a changing of the hands and the incurring of risk in handling parts which

should be sacred from the touch.
   Next there are several loose parts, as the telescope, plain tube, dark glasses, &c.,

which have to be screwed on before an observation can be taken, and time is lost
thereby ; even then too it may be often found with faint stars at night, that the
object-glass of the telescope is prejudicially small, and the reflectors insufficiently

bright, as well as erroneous at extreme angles, on account of the impossibility of

procuring perfect glass, besides giving the nuisance of images from each surface, &c.
    Then, supposing the observation taken, there is such a needless difficulty in read-

ing oflF the divisions, a difficulty not felt by beginners alone, but equally by practised

naval officers, who give that as a reason why the very important class of observa-

tions of stars by night is so little practised at sea.
   Finally, the observation when read off at last is taken merely upon a sextant or

part of a circle, and is therefore liable to errors of excentricity and motion of the
centre, and this to an unknown extent, and not constantly, as they may be influenced
by accidental causes unknown to the observer. It is essential to the accuracy and
the honesty as it were of observations, that they should be taken with some form of
circle with opposite readings ; many such have been brought forward in England
and France, but owing apparently to their greater complexity, size and weight, they
have not obtained a footing amongst practical men.

   The author then exhibited a reflecting instrument which he had had constructed
by Messrs. Adie of Edinburgh, and which appeared to supply all the desiderata, for
it was in the shape of a circle, small, light, and simple, with the delicate parts pro-
tected from injury under all circumstances : the usual loose telescope and plain tubes
were avoided by making them cross through each other and work on a pivot, thus
admitting of instant alteration from one to the other ; the illuminating apparatus
was improved and rendered powerfully effective even with a faint light ; and a small
apparatus was added, which, without sensibly cumbering the instrument, gave, either
by night or by day, a convenient horizontal referring point, visible in the field of

view.

Some Remarks on the Red Prominences seen during the Total Solar Eclipse.

                   By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth, F.R.A.S.

  When the Members of the Association separated last year at Ipswich, it was under

circumstances of peculiar astronomical import, viz. the impending occurrence of the
total solar eclipse in a neighbouring region : many astronomers started to observe
the phaenomenon to the utmost, and more especially everything having relation to,
or tending to throw any light on the physical characteristics of the sun ; amongst
which the "red prominences" were considered the most promising and important.

   The author was amongst the number of observers who started with these objects
in view, but was totally defeated by the occurrence of clouds. Having been pre-
vented then himself from seeing the red prominences, he thought it proper to defer
to the opinions of those observers who had been more fortunate, and who seem in
--14 REPORT 1852.

 all cases to have come to the conclusion that these apparent bodies were really at-
 tached to, and connected with, the sun, and were no less than masses of light-giving
 matter, 30,000 or 40,000 miles in length, and playing of course a most important
 part in the mystery of the nature and the source of solar light, and the whole
 oeconomy of that mighty orb.

    But if we are never to see these bodies but during the rare occasion of a solar
eclipse, and then only for the too short space of three minutes, ages upon ages may
pass away before we ascertain anything very precise upon the subject. In this case
it becomes of the greatest importance to contrive some method of making the red
prominences visible on ordinary occasions ; and a method having been proposed by
 Mr. J. Nasmyth of Manchester, which at least promised well, the author lost no

 time in putting it into execution.
    The method consisted in receiving the image of the sun and field of view, formed

 by a telescope in a dark room, on a white board, in which was a hole just large
 enough to let the sun pass through, and be absorbed on the inside of a black bag
beyond ; the image of the field, and therefore of the sky in the immediate neigh-
bourhood of the sun, could then be examined with the greatest nicety, and free from
the prejudicial effect of the glaring solar image ; while any faint ray of light extend-
ing fiom that luminary into the space beyond could be much more easily appreciated
than before. But although the experiment was carefully tried on all the best days
of last summer as well as the present, not the slightest appearance of red prominences
could be detected. The author however would not presume to say that they did not
therefore exist } for although the experiment in itself was extremely successful, inas-
much as during the very time that the sun was being received into the black bag the
room itself was much darker than the atmosphere at the solar eclipse, yet the light-
ness of the sky, by reason of the reflective power of the air outside the room, was so
extreme, that nothing so faint as the red prominences are reputed to be, could well be
seen on so bright a background. This is a difficulty which can only be got over by
ascending to a great height in the atmosphere, and it would be well worth while to
repeat the experiment on the top of a high mountain.

    Having given this experiment, founded on the opinions of observers, full trial, the
author then thought himself justified in taking up an opposite idea, and supposing
that the red prominences might be some spurious effects of diffraction of the sun's
light at the edge of lunar mountains. He therefore produced an artificial eclipse by
introducing a small opake ball into the telescope, near the focus of the object-glass,
when directed on the sun. The results were, that pink light, similar to that of the
prominences, was thrown off from the edge of the eclipsing ball, in greater quantity as
the polish of the surface was increased, and was broken ujj into more distinct portions
the more irregular the surface. Prominences most similar, nay, precisely like those
of the eclipse, in shape and colour, were produced by an opal glass ball, scratched
and cut on the edge with a diamond.

   There was however still the important failing, that the artificial prominences were
connected with the eclipsing ball as a centre, and not with the sun, as in the case of
the real prominences. In the latter instance, however, tire sun's rays fall on the
moon in a parallel direction, while in the former they converge on the eclipsing
ball. To arrive therefore more nearly at this particular, the author placed a large
tin disc, with spherically curved tangential rim, on the top of the Nelson monument,
and examined the appearance from below, when the sun was eclipsed behind the
disc, with a small hand telescope. The result was that orange and red light were
thrown off the edge ; and in greater abundance, according to the greater proximity
of the sUn behind to any particular side of the disc, and also according to the greater
purity of the atmosphere. This certainly seems to point out the great probability

of a spurious origin for the red prominences at this surface of the lunar mountains
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but this experiment should also be tried on a high mountain, in an atmosphere a
little more nearly approaching that of the moon in rarity and purity.

      On ike Optical Properties of a recently discovered Salt of Quinine.
                        By Professor Stokes, M.A, F.R.S.

This salt is described by Dr. Herapath in the Philosophical Magazine for March 1852,

and is easily formed in'the way there recommended, namely, by dissolvirig disul-

phate of quinine in warm acetic acid, adding a few drops of a solution of iodine in

alcohol, and allowing the liquid to cool, when the salt crystallizes in thin scales re-
flecting (while immersed in the fluid) a green light with a metallic lustre. When
taken out of the fluid the crystals are yellowish- green by reflected light, with a me-

tallic aspect. The following observations were made with small crystals formed in

this  manner                                 and  an  oral account of them was  given at a meeting of the  Cambridge
                                          ;

Philosophical Society, shortly after the appearance of Dr. Herapath's paper.

   The crystals possess in an eminent degree the property of polarizing light, so that
Dr. Herapath proposed to employ them instead of tourmalines, for which they would

form an admirable substitute, could they be obtained in sufficient size. They appear

to belong to the prismatic system; at any rate they are symmetrical (so far as re-

lates to their optical properties and to the directions of their lateral faces) vi^ith re-

spect to two rectangular planes perpendicular to the scales. These planes will here

be called respectively the principal plane of the length and the principal plane of the

breadth, the crystals being usually longest in the direction of the former plane.

When the crystals are viewed by light directly transmitted, which is either polar-

ized before incidence or analysed after transmission, so as to retain only light polar-

ized In one of the principal planes, it is found that with respect to light polarized

in the principal plane of the length the crystals are transparent, and nearly colour-
less, at least when they are as thin as those which are usually formed by the method

above mentioned. But with respect to light polarized in the principal plane of the

breadth, the thicker crystals are perfectly black, the thinner ones only transmitting

light, which is of a deep red colour.

   When the crystals are examined by light reflected at the smallest angle with which

the observation is practicable, and the reflected hght is analysed, so as to retain,

first, light polarized in the principal plane of the length, and secondly, light polarized
in the other principal plane, it is found that in the first case the crystals have a
vitreous lustre, and the reflected light is colourless ; while in the second case the

light is yellowish-green, and the crystals have a metallic lustre. When the plane

of incidence is the principal plane of the length, and the angle of incidence is in-
creased from 0° to 90°, the part of the reflected pencil which is polarized in the

plane of incidence undergoes no remarkable change, except perhaps that the lustre

becomes somewhat metallic. When the part which is polarized in a plane perpen-

dicular to the former is examined, it is found that the crystals have no angle of
polarization, the reflected light never vanishing, but only changing its colour, passing
from yellowish-green, which it was at first, to a deep steel-blue, which colour it

assumes at a considerable angle of incidence. When the light reflected in the prin-

cipal plane of the breadth is examined in a similar manner, the pencil which is

polarized in the plane of incidence undergoes no remarkable change, continuing to

have the appearance of being reflected from a metal, while the other or colourless

pencil vanishes at a certain angle, and afterwards reappears, sq that in this plane

the crystals have a polarizing angle.

   If, then, for distinction's sake, we call the two pencils which the crystals, as belong-

ing to a doubly refracting medium, transmit independently of each other, ordinary
and extraordinary, the former being that which is transmitted with little loss, we

may say, speaking approximately, that the medium is transparent with respect to

the ordinary ray and opake with respect to the extraordinary, while, as regards
reflexion, the crystals have the properties of a transparent medium or of a metal,

according as the refracted ray is the ordinary or the extraordinary. If common light

merely be used, both refracted pencils are produced, and the corresponding reflected
pencils are viewed together ; but by analysing the reflected light by means of a

Nicol's prism, the reflected pencils may be viewed separately, at least when the ob-
servations are confined to the principal planes. The crystals are no doubt biaxal,

and the pencils here called ordinary and extraordinary are those which in the lan-
guage of theory correspond to different sheets of the wave surface. The reflecting
properties of the crystals may be embraced in one view by regarding the medium as
16 REPORT 1852.

not only doubly refracting and doubly absorbing, but doubly metallic. The metallicity,
so to speak, of the medium of course alters continuously with the point of the wave
surface to which the pencil considered belongs, and doubtless is not mathematically
null even for the ordinary ray.

    If the reflexion be really of a metallic nature, it ought to produce a relative change
in the phases of vibration of light polarized in and perpendicularly to the plane of
incidence. This conclusion the author has verified by means of the effect produced
on the rings of calcareous spar. Since the crystals were too small for individual ex-
amination in this experiment, the observation was made with a mass of scales depo-
sited on a flat black surface, and arranged at random as regards the azimuth of their
principal planes. The direction of the change is the same as in the case of a metal,
and accordingly the reverse of that which is observed in total internal reflexion.

    In the case of the extraordinary pencil the crystals are least opake with respect
to red light, and accordingly they are less metallic with respect to red light than to
light of higher refrangibility. This is shown by the green colour of the reflected

light when the crystals are immersed in fluid, so that the reflexion which they exhibit
as a transparent medium is in a good measure destroyed.

   The author has examined the crystals for a change of refrangibility, and found
that they do not exhibit it. Safflower-red, which possesses metallic optical proper-
ties, does change the refrangibility of a portion of the incident light; but the yel-
lowish-green light which this substance reflects is really due to its metallicity and
not to the change of refraogibility, for the light emitted from the latter cause is red,
besides which it is totally different in other respects from regularly reflected light.

    In conclusion, the author observed that the general fact of the reflexion of coloured
polarized pencils had been discovered by Sir David Brewster in the case of chrysam-
mate of potash*, and in a subsequent communication he had noticed, in the case of
other crystals, the difference of effect depending upon the azimuth of the plane of
incidencef. Accordingly, the object of the present communication was merely to
point out the intimate connexion which exists (at least in the case of the salt of
quinine) between the coloured reflexion, the double absorption, and the metallic
properties of the medium.

 --Note added during printing. When the above communication was made to the

Association, the author was not aware of M, Haidinger's papers on the subject of
the coloured reflexion exhibited by certain crystals. The general pheenomenon of
the reflexion of oppositely polarized coloured pencils had in fact been discovered in-
dependently by M.Haidinger and by Sir David Brewster, in the instances, respectively,,

Aof the cyanide of platinum and magnesium, and of the chrysammate of potash.

brief notice of the optical properties of the former crystal will be found in Poggen-

dorff's 'Annalen,' Bd. Ixviii. (1846), S. 302, and further communications from M.

Haidinger on the subject are contained in several of the subsequent volumes of that
periodical. The relation of the coloured reflexion to the azimuth of the plane of in-

cidence was noticed by M. Haidinger from the first.

It has been stated as an objection to the chemical theory of the galvanic battery,

that the chemical action being the same in all elements consisting of zinc and any

less oxidizable metal, their electromotive force ought according to that theory to be

about half that of a zinc and platinum element in the same liquid. Mr. Joule in

1841 gave (in his papei- on the heat of electrolysis) the key to the explanation of all
such difficulties, by pointing out that the heat must be generated in different quan-

tities by the electrical evolution of equal quantities of hydrogen at equal surfaces of

different metals. The author of the present communication, reasoning on element-
ary mechanical and physical principles, from Faraday's experiments, which show

that a zinc diaphragm in a trough of dilute sulphuric acid exercises no sensible

resistance to the continued passage of a feeble electric current, demonstrated that a
feeble continued current, passing out of un electrolytic cell by a zinc electrode, must
generate exactly as much more heat at the zinc surface than the same amount of current

would develope in passing out of an electrolytic cell by a platinum electrode, as a zinc-

platinum pair working against great external resistance icould develope hi the resistance

Awire by the same amount of current.  series of experiments, commenced for illus-

trating this conclusion, were described and a few of the conclusions stated. It was

found that in two equal and similar electrolytic cells in the same circuit, which dif-

fered from one another in one of them having its exit electrodes of zinc, and the

other of platinum, very sensibly more heat was developed in the former than in the
latter, verifying so far the conclusion stated. By separating the two electrodes by

means of porous diaphragms, it was found that, at least with low strengths of cur-
rent, more heat was developed at the negative than at the positive electrode, when
both electrodes were of zinc ; while when both were of platinum, much more heat

was found at the positive electrode than was found at the negative, for all strengths
of current, which gave sufficient thermal effects to be tested in this respect. The last-

mentioned result, which had not been anticipated by the author, appears to be in

accordance with experimental conclusions announced by De la Rive.

Many other results of a remarkable nature were obtained in a series of experi-

ments on the heat evolved in different parts of various electrolytic and chemical

electromotive arrangements, but much difficulty had been found in interpreting
them correctly on account of initial irregularities depending on " polarization,"

which often appeared to last as long as the experiments could be continued without
introducing other sources of disturbance, and which produced marked effects on the

observed thermal phaenomena.

This communication was brought forward principally for the purpose of calling

attention to what may be done if experimenters can be induced to undertake re-

searches on the evolution of heat in all parts of a galvanic battery or of any electro-

thermal apparatus, but partly also on account of the novelty of some of the results

which have been already obtained by the author.

On the Mutual Attraction between txoo electrified Spherical Conductors.
          By Professor W. Thomson, M.A., F.R.S.L. ^ E.

In a previous communication by the same author at the last Oxford Meeting of

the Association, the attraction of a single electrified sphere, influenced by the presence

of another, on any external electric point, was shown to be the same as that due to

a converging infinite series of electric points in determinate positions within it, to

which the name of " electrical images" was given. Hence it is concluded that the

attraction of one sphere upon the other is equal to that of one infinite series of

electrical images upon another, and is immediately expressible algebraically by a
" double series." Another method by which a single series is obtained to express the

required attraction, had been alluded to at the previous Cambridge Meeting, and worked
out to numerical results, which were published in November 1845, in the first Number

of the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal. It was not until 1849 that

the author found a way of reducing the double series to a single one, and so suc«

ceeded in arriving at the same form of result by the two methods. Detailed accounts

of both methods, with all the formulae for completely working out the solution,

including the case of contact for which the series is not convergent, were commu-

nicated by letter to M. Liouville in the month of July of that year, and, not having

as yet been published, are now laid before the British Association. Similar methods

are applicable to determine the whole force experienced by either of two electrified

On certai7t Magnetic Curves ; xoith applications to Problems in the Theories
  of Heat, Electricity, and Fluid Motion. By Professor W. Thomson,

   M.A., F.R.S.L. ^ E.

A method, which had been given by the author in the Cambridge Mathematical

Journal for integrating the differential equations of the lines of force in any case of

symmetry about an axis, is applied in this communication to the case of an infinitely

small magnet placed with its axis direct or reverse along the lines of force of a
uniform magnetic field. Diagrams containing the curves drawn accurately, accord-

ing to calculations founded on the result of this investigation, (corresponding to

series of ten or twelve different values given to the constant of integration,) were
exhibited to the Section. Certain parts of these curves were shown in a separate

diagram, as constituting precisely the series of hues of electric force about an insu-

lated spherical conductor under the influence of a distant electrified body ; and the
other parts, in a separate diagram, as constituting the lines of motion of a fluid mass
in the neighbourhood of a fixed spherical solid, at considerable distances from which
the fluid is moving uniformly in parallel lines so slowly as to cause no eddies round
the obstacle. The circle representing the section of the spherical conductor, in the
former of these diagrams, cuts the entire series of curves at right angles, with the
exception of one curve, which it cuts through a double point at an angle of 45° to

each branch. The circle representing the section of the spherical obstacle in the

latter diagram, along with two infinite double branches consisting of the axial dia-

meter produced externally in each direction, constitutes the limiting curve of the

Aseries shown, and is not intersected by any of them.  series of diagrams (deduced

from the former of these by describing a circle of the same size as that shown in it,

and drawing, on a smaller scale, as much of the curves as lies without this circle,)

was shown as representing the disturbed lines of magnetic force about balls of ferro-
magnetic substance of different inductive capacities, placed in a uniform magnetic

field ; and another series, similarly derived from the latter, (that is, the one repre-
senting the lines of fluid motion about a spherical obstacle,) was shown as represent-

ing the disturbance caused by the presence of diamagnetic balls of different inductive
capacities in a uniform magnetic field. These two series of diagrams are also accu-
rate representations of the lines of motion of heat In a large homogeneous solid

having heat uniformly conducted across it, as disturbed by spherical spaces occupied
by solid matter of greater or less conducting power than the matter round them;
the two principal diagrams from which they are derived being the corresponding
representations for the cases of spherical spaces occupied respectively by matter of
infinitely great and infinitely small conductivity. The author called attention to
the remarkable resemblance which these diagrams bore to those which Mr. Faraday
had shown recently at the Royal Institution to illustrate his views regarding the
action of ferromagnetics and diamagnetics in influencing the field of force in which
they are placed ; and justified and illustrated the expression " conducting power for
the lines of force," by referring to rigorous mathematical analogies presented by the

theory of heat.

On the Equilibrium of elongated Masses of Ferromagnetic Substance in
  unifoi'm and varied Fields of Force. By Professor W. Thomson, M.A.,

   F.R.S.L. <^ E.

   The fact, first discovered experimentally by Gilbert, that a bar of Soft iron, held
bv its centre of gravity in a uniform magnetic field, settles with its length parallel
to the lines of force, is not explained correctly when it is said to be merely due to
the property of magnetic induction in virtue of which the bar of soft iron becomes
temporarily a magnet like a permanent magnet in its position of stable equilibrium.
For exactly the same statement would be applicable to a row of soft iron balls rigidly

connected by a non-magnetic frame yet such an arrangement would not experience
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

any directional tendency, (since no one of the balls in it would experience either a
resultant force or a resultant couple from the force of the field,) unless in virtue of
changes in the states of magnetization of the balls induced by their mutual actions.
Hence the mutual action of the parts of a row of balls, and, as is easily shown, of
a row of cubes, or of a bar of any kind, must be taken into account before a true
theory of their directional tendencies can be obtained. The author of this commu-
nication, by elementary mechanical reasoning founded on what is known with cer-
tainty regarding magnetic induction and magnetic action generally, shows that an
elongated mass, in a uniform magnetic field, tends to place its length parallel to the
lines of force, whether its inductive capacity be ferromagnetic or diamagnetic, pro-
vided it be non-crystalline, because if ferromagnetic it becomes more, or if diamag-
netic, less intensely magnetized, if placed in such a position, than if placed with its

length across the lines of force. But for all substances, whether ferromagnetic or
diamagnetic, possessing so little capacity for induction as any of the known dia-
magnetics, this tendency, depending as it does on the mutual action of the parts of

the elongated mass, is, and probably will always remain, utterly imperceptible in
experiment. All directional tendencies in bars of diamagnetic substance which have
yet been, and probably all which can ever be discovered by experiment, are due
either to some magnecrystallic property of their substances, or to the tendency of their
ends or other moveable parts, from places of stronger towards places of wealcer force,
in varied magnetic fields, or to these two causes combined, and in no respect to the
inductive effects of the mutual influence of their parts. To consider the effects of a
want of uniformity of the force, in a varied field, on the equilibrium of a ferromag-
netic bar, the author quoted Faraday's admirable statement of the law regarding the
tendency of a ball or cube of diamagnetic substance, and referred to former papers,
in which he had proved that, when applied to non- crystalline substances generally,
with the proper modification for the case of ferromagnetics, it expresses with admi-
rable simplicity the result of a mathematical investigation involving some of the
most remarkable principles in the theory of attraction. From this it was shown,
that if we conceive a ferromagnetic mass to be divided into verj' small cubes, each of
these parts would, of itself, tend towards places of stronger force, and therefore
that the bearing of the whole mass in a varied field will be produced partly by this
tendency and partly by the tendency depending on the mutual inductive influence
which alone exists when the field is uniform. The author then proceeded to illus-
trate these theoretical views by a series of experiments. In some of them a steel bar
magnet was used, and small soft iron wires, fixed in various positions on light wooden
arras, were shown to be sometimes urged on the whole from places of stronger to
places of weaker force by their tendency to get into positions with their lengths along
the lines of force. In others, a ring electro-magnet, consisting of insulated copper

wire, rolled fifty times round as closely as possible to the circumference of a circle

of the diameter stated, about 9 inches in diameter, fixed in a vertical plane at
right angles to the magnetic meridian, was used, and a single cube of soft iron,

placed in an excentric position on a long narrow pasteboard tray centrally sus-
 pended in the field of force by unspun silk, was attracted into the plane of the

ring ; but a row of three or four cubes placed touching one another in a line

through the axis of suspension, settled as far from the plane as possible, in virtue

 of the tendency of an elongated mass to get its length along the lines of force.

Two cubes placed in contact are found to be in stable equilibrium in the plane of the

 ring, or in oblique positions, or as far from the ring as possible, according to the

 greater or less distances at which they are placed in the tray, from the point of

suspension. A number of equal and similar bars of a composition of wax and soft

 iron filings of different ferromagnetic strengths, suspended successively with their
 middle points in the centre of the magnet, settled in various positions. Those of

 them which were of greatest ferromagnetic capacity settled perpendicular to the

 plane of the ring or along the lines of force ; others, with a smaller proportion of iron
 filings, had positions of stable equilibrium both in the plane of the ring and perpen-
 dicidar to it ; and others, with a still smaller proportion of iron filings, had their
 sole positions of stable equilibrium in the plane of the ring. The last-mentioned

                                                                                                  2*

experiments illustrated very curiously the diminished proportion borne by the effects
of mutual influence of the parts to those of a non-uniformity in the field of force, in
similar bodies of smaller ferromagnetic capacity.

On an Instrument for exhibiting the Colours ofLiquids by Transmitted Light.
                                 By R. W. TowNSEND.

    This consisted of a short portable trough for containing the liquids, at the ends
of which parallel mirrors being placed, by the reflexion of the visual ray or of
light backward and forward several times, the effect was produced of transmitting the
ray proceeding from the eye (or a beam of light) virtually through considerable
thicknesses of the liquid. The author had been led to construct this in order to test the

common explanation of the deep blue colour of the waters of the Rhone, where they
enter the Lake of Geneva, and in other places. But his experiment with the in-

strument did not lead to the conclusion that the natural colour of all pure water
was blue. Pure spring or rain water when pprfecthj clear exhibited no colour when
thus viewed ; but a sunbeam transmitted thus through the water received a beautiful

deep yellow-green colour. He verified the experiment by afterwards using a very

long trough without mirrors, and found the results the same.

     On Molecular Action. By John Tyndall, Ph.D., F.R.S.

In this investigation the author has examined the influence exerted by the peculiar

Astructure of wood upon the transmission of heat through the substance.                                         sen-

sitive thermoscope was found in a bismuth and antimony couple, and by means of

cushions of mercury which pressed upon the bodies under examination, perfect and

uniform contact was obtained. The bodies were reduced to the cubical form. Four

faces of each  cube  were  parallel  to  the fibre of the  wood                              one  pair of these faces
                                                                                          ;

intersected the ligneous layers perpendicularly, and the other pair was parallel to the

layers. The velocity of calorific transmission was examined in the above three di-

rections, and the following law of action established by experiments on fifty-seven

different kinds of wood, both English and foreign ;
   " At all points not situate in the axis of the tree, wood possesses three rectangular

axes of calorific conduction : the first and greatest axis is parallel to the fibre of the

wood; the second and intermediate axis is perpendicular to the fibre and to the

ligneous layers which mark the growth of the tree ; while the third and least axis

is perpendicular to the fibre and parallel to the layers."

Two  other systems   of    axes  were    pointed  out  by  the  author                       as   existing  in  wood
                                                                                                                                       ;

the axes of cohesion and those of fluid permeability. In order of magnitude and

direction these axes coincide with the axes of calorific conduction, and all three

systems coincide with the axes of elasticity discovered by Savart.

     On Poisson's Theoretic Anticipatio7i of Magnecrystallic Action.
                    By John Tyndall, Ph.D., F.R.S.

Wm.Professor         Thomson has drawn tittention to the fact, that the discovery of

magnecrystallic action by Pliicker was anticipated in Poisson's Theory of Magnet-

ism ; and in a recent number of Liebig and Kopp's Annual Report, the author's

investigations are referred to as particularly confirmatory of this view. Dr. Tyndall,

however, conceives that the hypothesis of Poisson is by no means sufficient to

account for magnecrystallic phaenomena. Poisson supposed that in crystallized

bodies the magnetic elements were possibly ellipsoidal ; and conceiving the larger

axes of these ellipsoids all to lie in the same direction, he inferred that a differential

action, such as that first observed by Pliicker, would be the result. But exactly the

same results are obtained by a peculiar arranyemeiit of the particles of amorphous

Abodies.  wax model of calcareous spar was exhibited by Dr. Tyndall, the deport-

ment of which, as proved experimentally before the Section, was precisely the same

as that of a calc-spar crystal of the same size and shape. Similar experiments were
made with other substances, both magnetic and diamagnetic, and all went to esta-

--blish the result a result assented to by Prof. Thomson, who witnessed the experi-
--ments that the phsenomena in question are not due to the shape of the molecules,

but to their manner of arrangement.

On the connexion between Geological Theories and the Theory of the Figure

               of the Earth. By Henry Hennessy, M.R.I.A.

   As geology may be considered to embrace an examination of the form and struc-
ture of the earth, it follows that every correct geological theory must be capable of

explaining the greater as well as the lesser inequalities in the figure of our planet.
Certain geological theories being incompatible with the supposition that the earth
was originally in a state of fluidity, attempts have been made to account for its
spheroidal figure by the abrading action of the waters at its surface. It has been
shown by Playfair and Sir John Herschel that the earth would from such causes
ultimately tend to assume the form of an oblate spheroid ; but neither of these emi-
nent mathematicians have presented such numerical results as would enable us to
compare the theory with observation satisfactorily. This the author has efi^ected in
a paper communicated to the Royal Irish Academy, in which he deduces for the polar
compression, according to the theory in question, -^^-^f. The compression given by
measurements is -g-^o ; consequently it seems that the theory of the earth's primitive
solidity must be rejected in favour of that of its primitive fluidity, which perfectly
agrees with observation.

   The author also pointed out an inconsistency between the theory of the earth's
primitive solidity and the theory of climates proposed by Sir Charles Lyell in order
to account for the diminution of temperature at the earth's surface since early
geological epochs. This theory would require a gradual transport of matter from
the equator to the poles in order to account for a diminution of the heating surface
of dry land at the equator. Consequently on this theory the earth would tend to
become prolate instead of oblate. The author concluded by pointing out similar
objections to the geological views known as the Neptunian theory and the chemical

theory of volcanos.

                       Proposed Theory of the Origin of the Asteroids.

                         By James Nasmyth, F.R.A.S.

   As the progress of science is frequently aided by advancing hypothetical views in
explanation of the cause of certain phsenomena, JVTr. Nasmyth desires to hazard a
suggestion as to the cause of the break-up of the original planet whose fragments, it
has been conjectured, form that numerous and remarkable group of small planets
revolving between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, some peculiarities of whose path
have led to the supposition that they must have parted company from a parent mass
at the same time and place. In order to render his views on this subject more clear,
he would refer to the well-known toy called a " Prince Rupert Drop," namely, a drop
of glass which has been let fall while in a semifluid state into water, by which the
surface of the glass-drop is caused to cool and consolidate with such rapidity that
the subsequent consolidation and contraction of the interior mass induces so high
a degree of tension between it and the exterior crust that the slightest vibration is
sufficient to overcome the cohesion of the external crust, and by so letting free the
state of tension cause the glass-drop to fly into thousands of fragments. Nor is
--22 REPORT 1852.

this action confined to " Rupert's drop," as we have examples of the same action in
our foundry operations in the case of masses of brittle metal, when the exterior of the
casting, by consolidating (as it always does before the interior) the after con-
traction of the interior of the mass, induces a sort of " touch and go" state of tension,
which frequently results in. such castings flying into fragments in spite of their
apparent strength, either per se, or on the application of some force otherwise

totally inadequate to produce so destructive a result.

  Now let us apply this action (which we find constant in the cooling of all masses

of brittle material) to the case of the supposed parent planet of the asteroids.

   It appears to Mr. Nasrayth that we shall find in such the elements of a very feasible if
not the true explanation of the origin of thisremai'kable and numerous group of planets,
namely, that the parent planet may have consisted of such materials as that by the
rapid passing of its surface from the original molten condition to that of solidifica-
tion, while the yet fluid or semifluid interior went on contracting by the compara-
tively gradual escape of its heat into space through the solid crust, a state of tension
may thereby have been induced, such as that in the " Rupert drop," and that the
crust may have at last given way with such violence as to cause the fragments to
part company, and so pass whirling ofi^ into orbits slightly varying from ?ach other,

according to corresponding variations in the condition of each at the instant of

rupture.

   The remarkable fact that the orbits of these asteroids have one common node or
point of coincidence causes us to look to some such explanation as has thus been
hazarded, and which perhaps may be entitled, in the mean time, to fill up a gap until

supplanted by a better explanation.

ByDrawings to illustrate Recent Observations on Nebiilce.  the Earl

OF RossE. With Remarks by Rev. Dr. Robinson.

   Dr. Robinson stated that he had examined the drawings, which contain care-
ful delineations of several nebulae not previously examined, and certainly the
contemplation of them was well fitted to increase the obligations of the astrono-
mical world to Lord Rosse, as well as to fill every mind with astonishment at the
wondrous revelations of his matchless telescope. Each of them was a new proof of
a former statement of his, that this instrument would probably disclose forms of
stellar arrangement, indicating modes of dj'namic action never before contemplated

in celestial mechanics. He referred to the drawings of M. 51, in which the spiral
or vorticose arrangement of the stars and unresolved nebulae was first remarked in

its simplest form ; and to others already published, where it presents itself under

conditions of greater complexity. He also referred to the important fact that the
class of planetary nebulae might now be fairly assumed to have no existence, as all
of them which have been examined prove to be either annular or of a spiral charac-
ter. Thus M. 97, which was considered by Sir J. Hersphel the finest specimen of

them, and seemed even in his 18-inch reflector a uniform disc, presents in the six-
feet a most intricate group of spiral arcs, disposed round two starry centres, looking

like the visage of a monkey. Among the new ones are H. 2241. It is a ring of

stars with a faiat nebula within, and a fine double star near its edge ; H. 2075, of the
same kind, but with a bright star almost exactly central, and nine others round it,
evidently part of the same group. H. 450 is a most extraordinary object ; the ring
exactly circular, its light mottled and flickering, and within it what is evidently a
globular cluster. Scarcely less surprising, but more magnificent from its association,
is the planetary at the edge of M. 46, which he had seen, though in a night not so
favourable as that must have been when the drawing was made. It is a resolvable
double ring, rather spiral, with a central star ; and from the improbability of two
objects so rare as a splendid cluster, and one of these compound rings being casually
connected, it seems reasonable to think they constitute one system. The double
star, 1 Orionis, belongs also to this class, and he called attention to the absolute
darkness of the aperture in the nebula round the two stars, and that the larger of
them was at its edge instead of being central. He argued, from the remaikable dif-
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  23

ference between these objects as seen in the telescopes of Lord Rosse (even the three-

feet) and those of previous observers, how desirable it was that a complete review
of the nebula should be made without loss of time. Even now much labour and
talent were expended in theorizing on the imperfect data given by instruments, which
though matchless in their time have now been surpassed. Among others he di-

rected the notice of the Section to H. 604, where the two clusters and the associated
spirals are projected into ellipses; and toH. 2205,in which the long-resolved ray, being
the most intense, was alone seen by Herschel, but the magnificent spirals and their
central stars escaped him. M. 65, H. 857, appear to be helices seen obUquely.
But the most curious one is M. 33. of which the centre is a triple star disposed as
an equilateral triangle among a mass of smaller, from which proceed eight or nme
spirals ; and round all is an enormous nebula, in which however no spiral character

had yet been tracedr
   There were several examples of another singular system, nebulas streaked with

dark bands, such as Bond discovered in the great nehula of Andromeda. H. 399, a
wisp ; H, 1393, a long ray of most marvellous appearance ; H. 218, an oblique with
sixteen or seventeen dark transverse stripes; and H. 315, having in the nebula a
cluster nearly insulated by offsets from the broad curved dark band, are among the
most surprising. But the number of these curious objects was so great that
time would only permit him to invite attention to H. 1052 and 1053, where the
cause of spirality had been interrupted by some other forces that bent the system at

a right angle and drew the nebula into a straight ray ; to H. 444, a double resolved

nebula inclosed in a large and faint oval ring ; and above all to M. 27, the " Dumb

Bell " nebula as shown by the six-feet, with its brilliant two clusters of comparafively
large stars, its dark bands and the faint rings which surround it differing even more

from the picture of the three-feet than that does from the figure of Herschel.

    In the name of the Section he thanked Lord Rosse, not merely for the pleasure
which they received from the sight of these wonders, but for the unremitted and
precious gifts which he was conferring on astronomy. Would he also increase their
gratitude by mentioning any improvements which he might have lately made in the

methods of suspending these large speculae in their tubes or in the process of polish-
ing, the latter with reference to the possibility of its being practised with success by
persons who had not the long experience and mechanical knowledge of his Lordship ?

    Lord Rosse adverted to the peculiar conditions of equilibrium which must prevail
in these systems, or rather to the forces which are required to produce the peculiar
constitution which they indicate, and pointed out the difficulties of such an investi^
gation. It could however not be undertaken with advantage till we possess a much
more extended collection of data, to which he would contribute to the utmost of his
power. These drawings were based on measures carefully taken with a bar-micro-
meter (the only one available in such cases), and he believed they might be trusted.
He had already described the improvement effected by supporting the speculum on
its lever by eighty-one balls, and mentioned the striking fact, that with a speculum
weighing 3^ tons a slight pressure of the hand would deform for a time the image
of a star. He had since effected a further improvement by supporting the edge of
the speculum in a hoop mounted in jimmals. As to polishing, he had recently made
many experiments with 3-feet specula in reference to the object of Dr. Robinson's

 question, and in particular had found, that, by increasing the speed of the second ex-

 centric in his machine, the process was rendered so much more certain, that desiring

 one of his workmen, a smith, to perform the whole process without any superintend-

 ence on his part, he produced a speculum, not perhaps absolutely perfect, but capable

 of doing excellent work. He had no doubt that any person of ordinary mechanical
 capacity would be able to do as much with a little instruction, and he would be most

 willing to give that instruction to any observer that might be placed in charge of a

 large reflector.

Account of a remarkable Case of Mirage. By Sir David Brewster, K.H.,

                          D.C.L., F.R.S., ^ V.P.R.S. Edinb.

   On the 21st of August, 1851, Miss F. E. went out on a drive with Mrs. and Miss

H., and leaving them in the carriage, climbed to the top of the Mynydd, a high and

steep hill, rising about 500 feet above the valley of New Radnor, the summit round

and bare, the ground firm.
    It was about half-past 2 p.m., and there was a bright hot sun.
   After picking some flowers on the top of the hill, she went to a spot whence she

could see the road, the carriage and the ladies, and waved to them her " victorine,"
which she held in her hand. Then, turning, she suddenly perceived a figure at the
distance of a few yards from her. It was standing on a wet spot, where there was
a little thin mist (probably steam) rising, and wavered a little, never remaining still
for which reason she did not think it was a real figure, though she says it had " a great
deal of bulk," It was on a level with herself, and formed a species of triangle with
herself and the sun, F. looking toivards the sun, but not directly to it. She thought
at first that the figure might be a delusion ; it stood exactly facing her, and she first
discovered it to be her own image by perceiving that, like herself, it held a " victo-
rine" and bunch of flowers in its hand. She moved the hand with the nosegay, and
the figure did the same. The dress and the flowers were precisely similar to her
own, and the colours as vivid as in the reality. She could see the colouring and
the flesh ; it was like looking at herself in a looking-glass.

    She stood looking at and examining it for two or three minutes ; then, becoming
frightened, turned away from the figure and ran straight down the side of the hill
 (which, though covered with turf, is of almost perpendicular steepness) without look-

--ing behind her, to Mrs. and Miss H., to whom she said that she had "had such a

strange companion on the hill herself." There was no mist around her when she
saw the figure ; it hung only over the one spot.

    Miss H. said, that she and her sister-in-law had remained in the carriage. Look-
ing up, she saw two figures on the top of the hill against the sk}', at a few yards'
 distance from each other. Being short-sighted, and the distance considerable, she
 could distinguish nothing but this fact, and merely observed, that she wondered
 what companion F. had met with. She then turned to talk to her companion, and
thought no more about the matter, until F. came running to them, considerably
 alarmed, to tell them what she had seen. Mrs. H. saw the two figures as well as

 her sister-in-law.

   A little servant-boy who was with the carriage, saw F. run down the hill, falling

 repeatedly, and appearing much frightened.
     Miss F. E. returned a few days after to the same spot to see whether the appear-

 ance would be renewed, but has never seen it again.
    The figure of Miss E., thus distinctly seen by herself and others, was obviously

 produced by reflexion from the mass of vapour rising from the wet ground on which
 she stood. Sir David Brewster stated, on the authority of direct experiment, that
 when the particles of vapour are sufficiently small, such as that produced by breathing
 on a glass surface of nearly the same temperature as the breath, the surface of the
 vapour reflects as distinct a picture as if it were the surface of water. The vapour
 surface must have been considerably extended in the direction of Mrs. H.'s carriage
 in order that the reflected rays might reach it.

                               ternal ones, and give them the appearance

                               and coloured, the dark fringes are dark at

their intersections, and the coloured ones coloured.

  When the needle-point is illuminated by the spectrum, and the fringes viewed by

a lens, which is necessary to see them, we require to approach the lens to the fringes

m'n' on the violet side of the spectrum, and to withdraw it on the red side, in order

to see them distinctly. When this experiment is made with great care, I have
counted twenty external fringes on each side of the shadow, which may always be

seen most distinctly by looking through the margin of the lens.

  When the diffracting body is an exceedingly small wire with parallel sides, the

internal fringes extend far beyond the shadow, mingling with the external ones, and

completely altering their colours and forms.
   The internal fringes beyond the shadow, like those in it, disappear by intercepting

the light with a screen on the opposite side of the diffracting body.
   In former notices on certain dark bands in the spectrum, the author noticed that

they resembled screws or twisted lines ; and he infers from the preceding experi-

ments, that these bands may have a similar origin, that is, that they may be pro-

duced by the intersection of two systems of bands, or by portions of bands produced
by the ragged or uneven edge of the diffracting body.

   In this communication Sir David stated that the bands which in former notices he
had considered as indicating an apparent polarity of light, were merely the internal
diffraction fringes produced by the edge of the plate, displaced, according to M.Arago's
discovery, by the retarding action of the plate itself, and rendered visible through

the action of the prism in one position of the edge more than another. He had seen
the fringes under various circumstances, whether the diffracting edge was towards the

red or blue side of the spectrum, never having any dependence on the aperture of the

pupil or of the object-glass.

On four simultaneous Experiments in the Island of Bombay to determine the
  Fall of Rain at different Heights below 200 feet. By Dr. G. Buist. Com-

   municated hy Col. Sykes.

   Dr. Buist gave the details of the means which he adopted to ensure accurate re-

sults. No satisfactory conclusion could be drawn, because the gauges at the several

heights below and at 200 feet did not give uniform results ; sometimes the most
elevated gauges having the greatest fall of rain, and at other times the lower
gauges having the greatest quantity. Nor did gauges at similar heights receive the
same quantity of rain.

    On Atmospheric Daily and Yearly Fluctuations. By Dr. G. Buist.

   The object of the author was to show from the annual and daily oscillations of
the barometer south of latitude 44° N., that the usually received opinion, that " the
annual range of the barometer increased and that the daily fluctuations decreased as
the equator was receded from," was met by so many instances to the contrary as

to go far to invalidate the rule. Dr. Buist supplies a list of twenty-five stations
from lat. 43° 39' N. to lat. 42° 52' S., in which the annual and daily ranges of the

barometer are given for the year, and for the summer and winter months. With
the exception, however, of Aden, Toronto, St. Helena, and Hobart Town, the stations
are confined to the continent of India and within 22^ degrees of latitude north of the
26 RBPORT-^1852.

equator; and many of the stations are at very different elevations, which it is
known affects both the annual and the daily oscillations. Dr. Buist in his paper
discusses the exceptional cases to the supposed rule, and recommends them for

scientific consideration.

Communication from the Smithsonian Institution ' on the Plan adopted for
                      investigating the Meteorology of North America.'

    Col. Sabine read a letter from Prof. Henry, of the Smithsonian Institution.
Accompanying the letter was a set of charts to illustrate the plan adopted by the
Institution. They gave the atmospheric changes in pressure, temperature, and
wind during a storra which commenced at the close of January 1851. The prin-
cipal object of this communication was to cause the British Association to procure
the establishment of a series of observations in the British possessions on that con-

tinent which may serve as an extension of those proceeding under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution. The general plan is that originally proposed by Prof.
Mitchell of North Carolina, and used successfully by Prof. Loomis in the study of
two storms which occurred some years since. It consists in ascertaining the changes
of the several meteorological elements from the mean of the month in which the
storm occurs, and delineating on a series of charts all the phases and movements of
the atmosphere from the beginning of the disturbance to its end. As many of the
instruments used had not been compared and were not of the most improved con-
struction, it had been feared that no reliable results could be obtained. But this is not
the case : though the absolute mean temperature and pressure are not obtained, yet

facts of equal, if not greater interest, are deducible, namely, the changes from a
normal state. Thus the average (say for a month) can be deduced with sufficient

precision to afford important practical deductions. Though the zero-points may be
in error several divisions of the respective scales, they may give with sufficient accu-
racy the changes which occur at a given time, and thus furnish reliable data for de-

termining the dynamic phsenomena of the atmosphere, though inadequate to furnish
statistical meteorological elements. The whole number of observers immediately
under the direction of this Institution is about two hundred ; and a hope was ex-
pressed that the British Association and the Royal Society would aid by their co-
operation in extending the system by establishing corresponding observations in Her
Majesty's possessions in America.

                On the Aurora. By Lieut. W. H. H. Hooper.

   The author believes the aurora borealis to be moisture in some shape (whether dew
or vapour, liquid or frozen), illumined by the heavenly bodies, either directly or
reflecting their rays from the frozen masses around the pole, or even from the imme-
diately proximate snow-clad earth. This opinion he endeavoured to support by
facts and argument.

Notes on the Meteorology of Ireland, deduced from the Observations made at
   the Coast-guard Stations under the diiection of the Royal Irish Academy.

   By the Rev. H. Lloyd, D.D., F.R.S.

   In the year 1850 an application was made by the Royal Irish Academy to the
Government, requesting that meteorological and tidal observations should be made
by the officers of the Coast-guard Service, according to a prearranged plan, at cer-
tain selected stations on the coasts of Ireland, the Academy undertaking to furnish
the instruments and the instructions for their use. This application was promptly
acceded to by the Government ; and in the course of the same year meteorological
instruments, previously compared with the standards belonging to the Dublin Mag-
netical Observatory, were conveyed to the several stations, and tide-gauges of a new
construction were erected. All the stations were subsequently visited by Members
of the Council of the Royal Irish Academy, who undertook the task of placing and
adjusting the instruments, and of training the observers in their use. At the same

time an application was made to the Board of Trinity College, and to the Heads of

the Queen's Colleges of Belfast, Cork and Galwaj', requesting their cooperation in
the meteorological observations ; and a similar application was addressed to Dr. Robin-

son and Mr. Cooper, and to several private individuals who were known to be in-
terested in meteorological inquiries. These applications were, for the most part,
cheerfully acceded to, and the observations, upon the plan laid down by the Academy,

were commenced everywhere before the close of the year.
   Dr. Lloyd having been requested by the Council of the Academy to superintend

the reduction of the meteorological observations, some of the principal results to

which he has been conducted are given in the present communication.

   The first point to which he invited the attention of the Section was the distribution
of mean temperature in Ireland at the different seasons of the year. On an exami-

nation of the mean monthly temperatures at the several stations, it was found that

those of the inland stations (Armagh, Markree, Portarlington and Athy) were in defect,
as compared with the corresponding coast stations ; the defect being (as might be
expected) least in summer and greatest in winter. The daily and yearly ranges of

temperature are, of course, greater at the inland than at the coast stations.

Upon examination of the results at the coagt stations, it is found that there is a

decrease  of mean yearly temperature,     in  proceeding  northward,  amounting  to  3°*5

                                                                                                         ;

the mean temperature at Castletownsend being 52°-2, and that of Buncrana 48°*7.

The rate of decrease is about 1° in 80 geographical miles.

   Again, there is a decrease of mean yearly temperature, although not so rapid, in
proceeding eastward. Thus from Westport to Dublin, places nearly in the same
parallel of latitude, the decrease of temperature is l°-3 ; the mean rate of decrease
in proceeding eastward being about 1° in 130 geographical miles. In consequence
of this variation, the mean temperature of the western coast of the island exceeds

that of the eastern by about 2°.

The following are the angles which the isothermal lines form with the meridian

at the several seasons of the year :

          Spring                              S. 63° E.
                                              N. 17° E.
          Summer                              S. 27° E.
          Autumn                              S. 47° E.

          Winter

It thus appears that the direction of the isothermals makes a wide oscillation in the
course of the year, viz. through an angle of about 80°, their mean direction for the
entire year being S. 57° E. It appears, further, that their two extreme positions are
in the consecutive seasons of summer and autumn.

   The latter conclusion, startling as it is at first sight, is completely explained by the
form and annual movement of the isothermal lines, as shown in Dove's maps. In
fact, there is a rapid flexure of these lines in the neighbourhood of the British
islands in the autumn and winter months, the lines (as we follow them eastward)

Nowfirst tending to the N.E., and then, after a sudden bend, taking a S.E. course.

this flexure, which is due to the influence of the Gulf-stream, begins to manifest itself

in the month of September, and the maximum advances westward with the advance

of the season ; so that the ascending and descending branches of the curve pass
through Ireland at a short interval. It is to this flexure that we owe, in t}iis country,

the mildness of our winter climate.
   The next point connected with the meteorology of Ireland referred to by Dr. Lloyd,

was the mean elasticity of vapour and the mean humidity. The maximum elastic

force of vapour occurs, as might have been expected, at the southern stations,

Cahirciveen and Castletownsend ; and the minimum at the northern, Buncrana and
Armagh. The mean elastic force of vapour in Ireland, during the year 1851, was
·314 of an inch of mercury; aud the extreme variation depending on position was

·046.

   If we divide the actual elasticity of vapour by the maximum elastic force corre-
spending to the temperature, we obtain the measure of the humidity. The humidity
is, as we know, very great in Ireland ; its mean yearly value for the whole of Ireland
being -86, The driest stations are, as might be expected, on the eastern coast, and

the most humid on the western.

It will be seen from the foregoing table
    1. That there is great diversity in the yearly amount of rain at the different sta-

tions, all of which (excepting four) are but a few feet above the sea-level ; the

greatest rain (at Cahirciveen) being nearly three times as great as the least (at

Portarlington).

    2. That the stations of least rain are either inland or on the eastern coast; while
those of greatest rain are at or near the western coast.

   3. That the amount of rain is greatly dependent on the proximity of a mountain
chain or group, being always considerable in such neighbourhood, unless the station
lie to the N.E. of the same.

   The author illustrated this last position by reference to the map prepared by
Captain Larcom, at the instance of the Land-tenure Commissioners, in which degrees
of elevation, differing by 250 feet, are distinguished by different shades of colour.
Thus, Portarlington lies to the N.E. of Slieve-bloom, Killough N.E. of the Mourne
range, Dublin N.E. of the Dublin and Wicklow range, and so on. On the other

hand, the stations of greatest rain, Cahirciveen, Castletownsend, Westport, &c. are
in the vicinity of high mountains, but on a different side.

   If we assume the proportion of rain at the different stations to be constant, or
nearly so, the preceding numbers may all be reduced to their mean values by multi-
plying by the factor, which expresses the relation of the rain of 1851 to the mean at
any one station. The following table gives the yearly fall of rain in Dublin for the

last eleven years :

On this assumption, therefore, the mean yearly rain at any station will be found

                                                                   / 29-01\
--by multiplying the number of inches which fell in 1851 by 1-1 (  g ,,)· The

greatest mean monthly fall of rain in Dublin occurs in October, and its amount is
3-34 inches; the least mean monthly rain is in February, its amount being 1-74

inches.

   The last point adverted to by Dr. Lloyd, as deduced from these observations, was
the evidence which they afford of the frequent occurrence of cyclonic movements in

the atmosphere. The observations being simultaneous at all the stations, such

movements are at once detected by a comparison of the directions of the wind at the

same moment at the different stations ; and it thus appears that the rotatory move-
ment of the air, which constitutes a cyclone, is by no means confined to the more
violent currents, but may be traced even in the gentlest breeze. The author con-
cluded with some remarks on the physical characters of these aerial movements
and he showed in what manner the results of observation should be combined by
the method of least squares, so as to deduce the direction and velocity of the centre

of the vortex.

of the sea, between it and the promontory of Bengore ; the inhabitants asserting that

many of them had distinctly seen it, crowded with people selling yarn, and en-

gaged in various other occupations common to a fair. The notes to the second book

of Dr. Drummond's poem on the ' Causeway' were also glanced at, as containing an

account of other cases of the Fata Morgana, by the Bushfoot Strand and Tor-point.

So, a person still living (and whose name; &c. were given) conceived that he had a

sight of the floating isle off Fair- Head ; that it seemed to be well -wooded ; and that
he could distinguish upon it the forms of buildings, and a woman laying out clothes,

Mr. M'Farland then mentioned that, in June 1833, he himself and a party of friends,

when standing on a rock at Portbaliatrea, perceived a small roundish island as if in

the act of emerging from the deep, at a distance of a mile from the shore ; at first it

appeared but as a green field, afterwards it became fringed with red, yellow and

blue ; whilst the forms of trees, men and cattle rose upon it slowly and successively

and these continued for about a quarter of an hour, distinct in their outlines, shape

and colour ; the figures, too, seemed to walk across it, or wandered among the trees,
the oeean bathed it around, the sun shone upon it from above ; and all was fresh,

fair, and beautiful, till the sward assumed a shadowy form, and its various

objects, mingling into one confused whole, passed away as strangely as they came.

Further, Morgana had occasionally assumed the semblance of a beautiful bridge

that spanned the Sound between the Skerry rocks and the strand at Portrush,

Aand having people passing and repassing over it.  particular instance of

this was stated, as well as of the appearance of the sea, at Ballintoy, of what

resembled a city with its streets, houses, spires, &c. Two occasions were then spe-

--cified, in which the Fata had been seen in the sky the one in the summer of 1847,

over the Ferry at Lough Foyle, and the other on the 14th of December 1850, near

to the Bannmouth; and in the course of which the images of troops, ships, &c.

were reflected on the clouds. Four other cases of the Aerial Morgana were adduced,

as witnessed about the town and coast of Waterford in 1644, and at the close of the

last and commencement of the present centuries, and taken from the ' Voyages and
Observations' of M. le Gown, Brewer's " Beauties of Ireland " (vol. ii. p. 307, n.),

and the 13th volume of the Phil. Mag., Old Series. Mr. M'Farland considered that

these various exhibitions of the Fata Morgana might all be accounted for by apply-

ing to those parts of the coast on which they had been displayed, the theories of

Minasi and M. Honel, as advanced by them in explanation of similar phsenomena

seen on and about the Strait of Messina. The Northern Channel of Ireland presents,

to a very great degree, the same data as regards shape, indentations, currents, and

bitumen, as that strait does, and on which their theories rest ; and he believed that,

to some extent at least, so did the sea in the neighbourhood of the isles of Arran

and town of Waterford. Where the Marine Morgana was found, the Aerial might

be expected, and the Prismatic was a mere corollary to the first.

On the Causes of the Excess of the Mean Temperature of Rivers above that of
  the Atmosphere, recently observed by M. Renou. By W. J. Macquorn

   Rankine, C.E., F.R.S.E.

   M. Renou having for four years observed the temperature of the River Loir at
Vendome, as compared with that of the atmosphere, has found that the mean tem-
perature of the river invariably exceeds that of the air, by an amount varying from

\^ to 3 Centigrade degrees, and averaging 2°'24 Centigrade ; and a similar result has
been deduced from observations made by M. Oscar Valin on the Loire at Tours.
M. Renou and M. Babinet account for this fact by the re-radiation from the bed of
the river of solar heat previously absorbed by it.

    Mr. Rankine thinks this supposition inadequate to account for the facts ; because
the excess of temperature of the river over the air was considerably above its mean

amount in November, and very near its maximum in December ; and because the
mean diurnal variation of temperature of the river was much less than that of
the air. He considers that friction is probably one cause of this elevation of

temperature ; for if water descends in a uniform channel, with a uniform

velocity, from a higher level to a lower, the whole power due to its descent is

expended in overcoming friction ; that is to say, is converted into heat, as the expe-
                                                                      ;

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                         31

riiflents of Mr. Joule have proved. This must cause an elevation of temperature,
which will go on until the loss of heat by radiation, conduction, and evaporation
balances the gain by friction, and at this point the temperature of the river will
remain stationary.

hygrometer, rain-gauge, atmospheric waves, winds, aurorae, and meteors observed
at Huggate. It also contained a brief notice of eclipses.

   On the Formulafor the Wet-bulb Thermometer. By Capt. Strachey.

   The author stated objections to the principle on which Dr. Apjohn's formula
had been investigated ; affirmed that this formula was foUnd not applicable to
the high temperatures and dew-points observed in India, and proposed a correction
in that part of the process which involves the difference of the number of degrees
of the dry and wet bulbs.

On Tropical Hurricanes. By Dr. J. Taylor.

The author began by stating the observed facts as to these hurricanes. They

Abegin from 10° to 20° from the equator, but are not observed at it.  hot, sultry

and calm state of the atmosphere, with a low barometric pressure, indicates their

occurrence, or immediately precedes them. The force of the wind increases as the

centre of the area over which the action of the hurricane extends is approached.

The author then pointed out the inconsistency of the theory of Mr. Espy and other

American philosophers with the facts observed, and particularly that a ship situ-

ated in a storm of the structure which that theory supposed would find the wind to

bear in either direction indifferently in the northern or the southern hemisphere,

which is contrary to experience ; for the direction of the whirl in the northern

hemisphere is always contrary to the motion of the hands of a watch ,· while in the

southern it was as constantly in the same direction for the true cyclone. He stated

his conviction that the opinion which is alone consistent with all the facts is, that

the movement of the air is one of revolution round a central space which is itself in

a state of progressive motion ; and that the direction of the rotatory movement is

might give rise to such a rotatory movement particularising the hypothesis of Dove

and proceeded to give the theory which he proposed of them, viz. that the partial

vacuum indicated by the low state of the barometer over the area of the storm, and

* particularly towards the vortex, is not the effect of centrifugal force, but the original

cause of the movement, by inducing a translation of air from beyond the boundary of

--the partial vacuum inward towards its centre, a motion which would occur in directly

converging right lines were the earth and air at rest ; but the earth being in motion,

and therefore the area of the hurricane turning round with i-egard to its own centre,

the velocity of such movement being greater for a particle of air at a distance from

that centre than for one nearer, as the particles approach it, they retain their greater

velocities, and thus move not in radial lines, but in diminishing circles or spirals

round the centre, which would be the case were the particles of air only to retain

their primitive velocity of rotation ; but by the principle of the conservation of areas,

the velocity would increase more and more as the centre of the vortex was approached.
32 REPORT-- 1852.

The author then traced the consequences of such combined motions, by supposing the
disturbance to commence first around one of the poles of the earth, and then by
tracing the change of circumstances which must taiie place in other latitudes ; and
asserted, that by calculating by these suppositions, using as data the well-ascertained
dimensions of the area over which cyclones extended, a relative movement of the air
over the earth, even greater than any that had ever been observed in violent hurri-
canes, might result. He concluded by sho^'ing how an experiment which he had
prepared might be performed, so as to exhibit the more striking effects of a hurricane
in water, by giving a whirling motion to a wide vessel of water furnished with a
valve in the bottom, at a distance from the axis, which could be withdra'Cvn. He
also stated his conviction, that the ph?enomena of sea and land breezes would yet be
found to partake of the rotatory character.

On an Instrumentfor Drawing. By Henry Twining.

The use of the instrument is to assist in obtaining correct representations of ob-

jects from nature, by pointing out the different angles at which they present them-

selves to the eye, and by finding out the vanishing points of their retiring sides.

The instrument consists of a graduated semicircular plate placed horizontally

on the top of a rod or pillar, so as to be raised or lowered at pleasure. Above

this plate or dial is placed another having a vertical position, in connexion with

which there is an index or needle, moving vertically on a pivot, and which

sei-ves to mark the elevation and the depression of any point above or below the

horizon. Also connected with the horizontal plate or dial is another index, con-

sisting of three branches or wires placed at right angles, and which is susceptible of

a horizontal motion. Its position is immediately above the horizontal graduated

plate. The straight side of this plate is placed parallel with the picture, the angular

dimensions of which are marked on the graduated semicircle opposite. The cross

wire of the index above the plate is then so directed, that, to the observer's eye, it

will correspond exactly with a given line of any object in nature of which it is

wished to obtain the direction, or, in other words, the inclination with reference to

Athe plane of the picture.  plan recommended by Varley for attaining this purpose,

is to give to one of the limbs of a jointed rule the inclination which any receding
line in nature may appear to have to the eye ; but with the instrument now described

we reverse the method, as it were, for we adjust the direction of a wire which is
level, so as to correspond with the horizontal line of any retiring object, and then we

find out, on the graduated plate connected with the wire, the exact position of the

vanishing points of these objects, that is to say, those points to which their various

horizontal lines converge. Thus the true inclination of all horizontal lines is

obtained by finding out, in the first place according to a simple method, but which

cannot here be fully detailed, the vanishing points of all level lines of objects.        '

The advantages of this instrument may be considered to consist in accustoming

the student to view the perspective of objects theoretically, and in a manner calcu-

lated to impress its principles on the mind ; the horizontal plate and index serving

to convey clear and precise notions of the relations of the vertical surfaces of objects

to the plane of the canvas, whilst the vertical plate and needle serve to give the

angular elevation and depression of objects, or their extension above or below the

horizon ; a correct representation of nature, under various circumstances, requiring
a perfect familiarity with both these principles.

Ow tJie Discovery of Minute Quantities of Soda by the Action of Polarized
  Light. By Professor Thomas Andrews, M.D., M.R.I.A., F.R.S.,

    V.P. Queen's College, Belfast.

The double cliloride of potassium and platinum crj'stallizing in regular octahedrons,
exercises, when placed in the dark field of the polariscope, no depolarizing action
and the same remark applies to the bichloride of platinum in consequence of its im-
perfect crystallization. On the other hand, the chloride of sodium and platinum in

thin crystalline plates is remarkable for its depolarizing power, and a trace of this salt,

which is invisible to the naked eye, may be at once detected by the brilliant display
of prismatic colours which it exhibits under the action of polarized light. The author
applies this property to the detection of soda in the following way. The other bases

having been removed by the ordinary methods, and the alkalies converted into chlo-
rides, a drop of the solution is placed on a glass slide, and a very small quantity of
a dilute solution of the bichloride of platinum added, avoiding as far as possible an
excess of that reagent. The drop is then evaporated by a gentle heat till it begins to
crystallize, and afterwards placed in the field of a microscope furnished with a good

polarizing apparatus. On turning the analyser till the field becomes perfectly dark,

and excluding carefully the entrance of light laterally, the crystals remain quite invi-
sible if either potash alone or no alkali whatever be present ; while the presence of
the slightest trace of soda is at once indicated by the depolarizing action of its pla-
tinum compound. With a drop of solution of chloride of sodium, weighing 0-0015

gramme, and containing j^^^ of its weight of chloride of sodium, a very distinct

effect was obtained. The quantity of soda thus detected was only jj^^g^ of a gramme,

j;^or about  of a grain

       On the Atomic Weights of Platinum and Barium.

By Professor T. Andrews, M.D., M.R.I.A., F.R.S.

   No determination of the atomic weight of platinum having been made since the

recent revision of atomic weights, and the number adopted by chemists for that metal
resting on the authority of a single experiment of Berzelius, the author considered it
of importance, on practical as well as theoretical grounds, to institute some new expe-
riments on the subject. The salt of platinum selected was the double chloride of
potassium and platinum, which, after being dried in vacuo at a temperature of 105° C,
was decomposed by digestion with metallic zinc and a small quantity of water, the
action being assisted by the application of heat towards the end of the process. After
the complete precipitation of the platimim and the formation of chloride of zinc from

the decomposition of the double salt, the excess of zinc was removed by the addition,
first of acetic and subsequently of nitric acid. The precipitated platinum was then
removed by means of a small and carefully washed filter, and the amount of chlorine in

the solution of chloride of zinc ascertained by Gay-Lussac's process, which has been
of late so successfully applied by Pelouze to the determination of several other
atomic weights. The double chloride of potassium and platinum was found to retain

loo^'^''^^ °^^^^ weight of moisture, even when dried at a temperature considerably supe-

rior to the boiling-point of water. In three experiments performed by this process,

the numbers obtained were 98-93, 98-84, and 99-06 ; the mean number 98-94 ex-

presses therefore the atomic weight of platinum.

For the atomic weight of barium, the author obtained from two closely-accordant

experiments the number 68-789, and concluded with some general observations as to

the importance of a systematic series of experiments to settle, if possible, definitively,

whether the law of Prout, that the atomic weights of all bodies are multiples of that

of hydrogen, be universally true. He concluded by reading an interesting extract

--from a letter which he received from Baron Liebig : " It is not certain that Front's

law may not be true for oxygen, nitrogen and carbon, without it being necessary to

assume, as a consequence, that other bodies behave similarly ; that is, their atomic

weight must be exactly multiples by whole numbers of the atomic weight of hydrogen.

The law is certainly not true of all bodies, but it may be true of certain groups, whose

members, in respect to atomic weight, stand in a simple numerical relation to each

other. The atomic weights of silicium, cobalt, strontium, tin, arsenic and lead, are in

the same ratio as the numbers 1:2:3:4:5:7. We do not see the necessity of this

Whyrelation, but only the possibility.                                                                                                                       should fractional numbers only occur, and not

--whole numbers also ? I consider these relations only as facts ; the law of the numbers

themselves is quite unknown tons as unknown as the absolute weights of the atoms."

On the Microscopic Structure of certain Basaltic and Metamorphic Rocks,
  and the Occurrence of Metallic Iron in them. By Professor T. Andrews,

   M.D., M.R.LA., F.R.S.

If a thin splinter of basalt is viewed by reflected light in the field of a good micro-

scope, it is seen to consist of a semitransparent granular mass, containing occasionally

opake crystals of the magnetic oxide of iron and of iron pyrites. The former are easily

recognized by their dark colour, metallic lustre, and the 'triangular and striated facets

of the regular octahedron                                                                                                                         the latter, by their yellow colour and cubical form.  The

two distinct minerals                                                                                                                        one  having  a  resinous lustre, and  in microscopic characters

closely resembling crystallized augite ; the other, colourless and with a glassy lustre,
might be referred to certain varieties of felspar or of zeolite. These remarks apply

to the compact varieties of basalt.

 --The metamorphic rock of Portrush an indurated clay-slate containing the charac-

--teristic fossils of the lias formation, and in external characters closely resembHng

Lydian stone exhibits under the microscope a very different appearance. It is

formed, in fact, of a semitransparent paste of homogeneous structure, everywhere

thickly studded with innumerable microscopic cubes of iron pyrites. These crystals

are very perfectly formed, but so minute that twenty of them may frequently be

counted in the space of yiodth part of a square inch, the sides of the crystals being on

an average not more than ^ oVo<ith of an inch in length. If a portion of any of these
rocks be reduced, in a porcelain mortar, to a tolerably finer but not impalpable powder,
and a magnet be passed several times through the powder, magnetic particles will be
found adhering to the magnet, in greater or less abundance, according to the nature

of the rock. On removing these magnetic particles and placing them in the field of

the microscope, they exhibit distinct polarity and all the other characters of the mag-

netic oxide of iron. This mineral may be separated by the above simple process, not

only from basalt, but from granite, clay-slate, primitive limestone, hardened chalk,

magnesian limestone, and many metamorphic rocks. In short, it is one of the most

widely- diffused minerals in nature, occurring in almost every rock which exhibits

evidence of igneous action. The author was only able however to discover a doubtful

trace in roofing-slate, serpentine and marble.

After referring to the few instances in which metallic iron, not of meteoric origin,

is alleged to have been observed, the author proceeded to describe the process by

which he has succeeded in showing that native iron is by no means an uncommon

constituent of basaltic rocks. The stone is first reduced to powder in a poixelain

mortar, the use of metallic tools being carefully avoided in every part of the operation.

The magnetic portions are then removed, as in the process for separating the oxide of

iron, and placed in the field of the microscope. While in the field, they are moistened

with an acid solution of sulphate of copper, which produces no change on the oxide,

but immediately indicates the presence of the slightest trace of metallic iron by a

deposition of metallic copper. On making this experiment, a deposit of copper occa-

sionally occurred in irregular crystalline bunches, perfectly opake, and with the

characteristic colour and lustre of that metal. With neutral solutions of the copper

salt this deposit very rarely occurred, indicating either that the iron is covered with a

film of oxide, or that it is analogous in properties to the meteoric alloy which precipi-

tates copper from acid, but not from neutral solutions. If instead of the copper

solution dilute sulphuric acid be added to the magnetic particles, a slight effervescence

at particular points frequently indicates the presence of the metallic iron ; and on add-
ing solution of copper while the disengagement of gas continues, the latter is suddenly

arrested, and a bright deposit of metatlic copper appears at the same points. The

largest deposit of copper obtained was about ^^i^th of an inch in diameter. The most

abundant indications of metallic iron were obtained from a coarse-grained variety of

basalt, which forms the hill of Slieve Mish in Antrim, and also occurs at the Maiden

Rocks and other locahties. Indications of its presence in the basalt of the Giant's

   This experiment is liable to the ambiguity that nickel and cobalt, in a state of very

fine subdivision, also precipitate copper, and would also be extracted from a powder
containing them by passing a magnet through it. The extreme improhibility of
either of these metals being present is such, that the author considers it scarcely to
weaken the conclusions at which he has arrived.

who describes it as whitish, of low specific gravity, and of a peculiar odour. He fixes

the fusing-point of the purified body at 51° Cent. (124° Fahr.). He mentions also that

its reaction to litmus paper is acid, and gives for the formula of the acid C33 H33 O4.

     The specimen examined by Mr. Brazier was of a yellowish-white colour, the slight

tinge of yellow being due to the presence of a very small quantity of a yellow oil

pervading the whole mass: its external surface was somewhat friable, but portions

iVom the interior of the specimen might have been selected having an unctuous feel,

and possessing a most peculiar urinous odour. It is nearly insoluble in cold water,

somewhat soluble in hot, but very soluble in alcohol and aether, especially on boiling,

from either of which fluids it is deposited in white granular crystals. The alcohol or

aether separated from the crystalline deposit, which was usually done by expression,

was of a deep yellow colour, and containing apparently a small quantity of the yellow

oleaginous matter above mentioned in solution, and imbibing more powerfully the

urinous odour of the interior of the mass.

  A clear portion of the substance taken directly from the keg gave a fusing-point of

45° Cent. (113° Fahr.), but after repeated purification and crystallization, by means of

alcohol and aether, to free it from all oleaginous matter, the fusing-point was raised to
53° (127°-5 Fahr.). This means of purification was repeated several times, the fusing-

point of the body remaining constantly the same, the substance itself resembling after

fusion ordinary stearic acid. Before subjecting the substance to analysis, I thought

it more advantageous to submit the body to a more rigorous method of purification,

and adopted that of sapcr.ification. With potassa this body forms a beautifully clear

transparent soap, and with the exception of the small portion of yellow oil mixed with

it,  is  readily  soluble  in  water                              by means of  solution therefore the oil and  other acci-

dental impurities may easily be separated. By the addition of hydrochloric acid to

the aqueous solution of the soap, the fatty acid is set free ; this has to be well washed
with large quantities of water and subjected several times to a considerable pressure. In

this state the fusing-point was found to be 127°-5 Fahr., and the same portion of acid

having undergone the same routine of purification a second time, the fusing-point re-

mained constant. An analysis of the body thus purified furnished numbers correspond-

ing to the formula Cgo H32 O4, and for which the name of Butyro-Umnodic Acid is pro-
posed. The acid was subsequently recrystallized from alcohol and aether, when it was

obtained in crystals of a beautifully white-satiny appearance, resembling benzoic acid.

On the Phosphatic Nodules of the Greensand of the North of Ireland.
  By Professor John F. Hodges, M.D., Queen's College, Belfast.

Professor Hodges, of Queen's College, gave an account of his discovery of the

existence, in the greensand of the north of Ireland, of nodules rich in phosphate
of lime, the important fertilizing ingredient of bones. The beds of greensand, he
remarked, occurred immediately under the chalk, and belonged to what was called

the chalk formation. They extended from the neighbourhood of Moira to the Giant's

Causeway, forming in some places a broad belt, and in other parts a narrow stripe,

and presented various shades of colour, from yellowish green to a rich dark green

colour. The nodules which he had analysed were found imbedded ii^ the greensand,

and possessed peculiar interest, as affording the agriculturist a native source of the

phosphoric acid. The beds of greensand contained about 5 percent, of the bone-earth

phosphate, while the nodules afforded so much as from 30 to 50 per cent. He gave

the analysis of a sample of the greensand from the neighbourhood of Kilroot, in

Antrim :                  --\0Q pai'ts were found to contain

the atomic weight for magnesium was 11-95 or quam pros. 12, and the atomic weight
of magnesia as 19-95 or quam proxime 20, instead of 12*7 and 20-7, numbers that have

usually been assigned in chemical works.

On the Estimation of Iodine. By Professor Fkederick Penny, Ph.D.

                                 Andersonian University, Glasgow.

  Among the many applications that may be made of bichromate of potash to the

purposes of centigrade analysis, there is none more convenient or useful than its
employment for the estimation of the amount of iodine in samples of commercial iodine
and of iodide of potassium. In Glasgow especially, which is the principal focus of the
manufacture of potash-salts and iodine from kelp, and where the problems referred
to are frequently presented for solution, an expeditious and exact method for the deter-

mination of iodine becomes truly valuable.
    According to the statements of a party well qualified to judge, it appears, that, in

the kelp season of 18.51, the total quantity of kelp brought to Glasgow was about
6000 tons (22i cwt. to the ton), which may be considered a fair average of ordinary

seasons. On account of the greatly increased demand for potash-sdts, the arrivals in

1850 amounted to nearly 10,000 tons, which is considerably higher than for several
previous years*. The manufacture however is not confined to Glasgow; there are
iodine works at Borrowstowness, Greenock, and Falkirk, in Scotland, at Ramelton

in Ireland, and at Cherbourg and Brest in France.
   The centigrade process, here to be described, for the estimation of iodine, is based

upon the fact, that chromic acid in presence of hydrochloric acid causes the complete
decomposition of soluble metallic iodides, the chloride of chromium and the chloride
of the other metal being produced, while the iodine is thrown down in the solid state.
Bichromate of potash is taken as the most convenient and stable form of chromic acid.

The reaction with iodide of potassium is exhibited in the following equation :

             3KI + KO,2Cr03+7HCl=P+tK.Cl + Cr2C13-t-7HO.

    The action is immediate, and provided that the solutions are kept cool, no secondary
result is formed. The precipitated iodine speedily subsides, leaving the supernatant
 liquid quite clear, though slightly coloured, with a few floating particles of iodine on the
 surface. When the solution of the bichromate is overdosed with the iodide, it becomes

 dark red, from a portion of the iodine being dissolved by the excess of the iodide.
 This change of colour is useful as indicating when the addition of the iodide has been

carried too far.               process  for  iodide  of potassium  is  conducted  as  follows  :--

   Iodide of Potassium.-- Ihe
10 gvs. of bichromate of potash are dissolved in half an ounce of cold water, and half
an ounce by measure of hydrochloric acid is afterwards poured in. An alkalimeter

of 100 measures is then made up in the usual manner with 50 grs. of the iodide of
potassium dissolved in water, and the solution is added to that of the bichromate of
potash until the chromic acid is completely decomposed. To hit the exact point at

which the action is complete, a white plate is spotted with a solution containing a,

mixture of pure protosulphate of iron and sulphocyanide of potassium, slightly acidi-

fied with hydrochloric acid, and by means of a glass rod a small quantity of the bi-
chromate liquor is brought into contact with the mixture on the plate. So long as_a
red colour, or even dark tinge, is communicated to the spots by the application of this
test, the presence of chromic acid is indicated; but when no dark shade is produced,
the action is complete, and the operation is finished. The number of measures used
is accurately read oiF, and the per-centage quantity of iodine in the sample subjected

to trial is found by dividing 5080 by this number, 10 grs. of bichromate being equal

(as will presently be shown) to 25-4 of iodine, and to 33-3 of iodide of potassium.
   Throughout the process the liquid should be kept quite cool, and towards the con-

clusion the iodide solution in the alkalimeter should be added very slowly, in order to
give ample time for the mutual action of the iodide and chromic acid, which should

likewise be assisted by repeated and brisk stirring.

38 REPORT 1852.

   The mode of preparing the mixture of protosulphate of iron and sulphocyanide of
potassium, as well as its extreme delicacy in detecting minute quantities of bichromate
of potash, I have fully explained in a paper published in the Quarterly Journal of the
Chemical Society of London, vol. iv. p. 244. It should be made very weak, and in using
it the precaution should be observed of not spotting it on the plate until the moment
of its being required. The spots moreover should be large, and thinly spread on the
surface of the plate, and care should be taken to bring the drop of the liquor to be
tested into contact with the centre of the spot, which it is allowed merely to touch,
without any stirring or agitation. The colour or tinge is produced instantaneously if
any chromic acid be present. It is not always easy to procure protosulphate of iron
perfectly free from peroxide, and then the mixture prepared with such impure sulphate
has a pinkish colour. This is of no moment when the tinge is light, as it becomes
extremely pale ajai scarcely perceptible on the mixture being spread upon the plate.
In the case of the mixture, however, being dark-coloured from the impurity of the

sulphate of iron, it is better to dissolve a small piece of iron wire in dilute hydrochloric
acid, and to add a portion of the clear solution at once to the sulphocyanide of potas-
sium previously dissolved in water.

   When minute accuracy is required, it will he advisable to add 30 grs. of the iodide,

dissolved in a small quantity of water, at once to the bichromate solution ; then to

make up the alkalinieter with 10 or 20 grs. of the iodide, and to proceed with the
operation as before directed. By using in this way a very weak solution of the iodide,

it is perfectly easy to bring the result within a tentli of a grain of the proper quantity.
    I have tried this process repeatedly upon carefully-purified iodide of potassium,

both in large and small quantities. The results, which never differed more than a
tenth of a grain from each other, show that 100 parts of bichromate of potash are
equal to 333 of iodide of potassium, and to 254 of iodine; and accordingly 10 grs. of
bichromate are equivalent to 25'4 grs. of iodine.

   The following are some of the results obtained by subjecting different specimens
of commercial iodide of potassium to trial by this process :

       Samples.  Iodide of potassium.

                                      6 30-2 ,,
   The last sample consisted chiefly of carbonate of potash.

 --Iodine. When iodine is the subject of examination, it must be first converted into

a soluble iodide. The iodide of zinc appears to be best adapted for the purpose,
from its stability and the readiness with which it may be prepared. 50 grs. of the
iodine to be tested are put into a small flask with some fragments of pure zinc and

half an ounce of water. The mixture is agitated till the iodine becomes completely

converted into iodide of zinc, which is indicated by the solution losing the dark red
colour that it first acquires, and becoming nearly colourless. The solution is then
decanted into an alkalimeter, which is made up to with rinsings from the excess of

zinc.

   10 grs. of bichromate of potash are next dissolved in a small basin with half an
ounce of water, and half an ounce of hydrochloric acid is subsequently added.

   The remaining operations are precisely similar to those directed for iodide of potas-
sium. The iodide solution is dropped into that of the bichromate till no coloration is
produced with the sulphocyanide mixture ; then 5080, divided by the number of mea-
sures consumed, gives the amount of iodine per cent, in the sample.

This process is obviously incompatible with proto-compounds of iron, arsenious

acid, and substances having similar chemical relations but their presence would be
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

--immediately disclosed and their influence easily prevented.
   Kelp and Kelp-liquor. The direct application of the present process to kelp and

kelp-liquors is evidently inadmissible, in consequence of the sulphides, sulphites, hypo-

sulphites and sulphocyanides, which they invariably contain. All these ingredients

act readily upon bichromate of potash, in presence of hydrochloric acid. They may

however be effectually removed by cautiously treating the solution from the kelp with
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  39

 hydrochloric acid, and evaporating to dryness, repeating the operations if necessary,
 Of till the above ingredients are decomposed. In the case of kelp, the following is

--an outline of the mode of procedure : A known Weight is exhausted with water in

 the usual manner, and the several liquors, being mixed, are concentrated by evapora-
 tion, and set aside to crystallize. The mother-liquor is decanted and slightly super-
 saturated with hydrochloric acid, boiled and filtered. The filtrate is then evaporated
 completely to dryness, a little carbonate of soda being added towards the conclusion,
 if it be found that the hydrochloric acid is in such excess as to affect the iodide.
 This will be indicated by the liberation of iodine, and by the solution acquiring a dark
 colour. The dry residue is digested in a small quantity of cold water and filtered.
 The solution is then tested for the presence of the substances before named, when, if
 pure, it is transferred (wholly or in part, according to the quantity of kelp operated
 upon) to the alkalimeter, and subsequently dropped into the prepared solution of
 bichromate of potash and hydrochloric acid, as previously described. If however it
 should still contain any sulphite, hyposulphite, &c., the treatment with hydrochloric
 acid is repeated. It has been found that the extraction of the iodide from the residue
by means of alcohol answers very well when the removal of the incompatible matters
is attended with difficulty. The quantity of iodine in kelp is proportionately small,
and of course subject to extensive variation. The amount extracted on the large scale
from " drift-weed kelp" varies from 5 to 12 lbs. per ton, though larger quantities ai-e
said to have been obtained. From cut-weed kelp not more than 2 to 3 lbs. per ton
 have been extracted; and it is easy to conceive that the produce will be variable
when these two kinds of kelp are mixed together. Not less therefore than 2 lbs. of
 drift-weed kelp should be operated upon, and in the case of cut-weed kelp, it will be
 advisable to use only 5grs. of bichromate of potash in place of lOgrs.

    The method of testing kelp-liquors is evident from the above outline of the mode of
operating upon kelp itself.

                  By Professor G. G. Stokes, M.A., F.R.S.

       On the Koh-i-Noor Diamond, ^y Professor Tennant, F.G.S.

    At the last Meeting of the British Association, Dr. Beke read a paper on the dia-
mond slab supposed to have been cut from the Koh-i-Noor, and stated, that " at the
captui'e of Coochan, there was found among the jewels of the harem of Reeza Kooli
Khan, the chief of that place, a large diamond slab, supposed to have been cut from
one side of the Koh-i-Noor, the great Indian diamond now in the possession of Her
Majesty. It weighed about 130 carats, showed the marks of cutting on the flat and
largest side, and appeared to correspond in size with the Koh-i-Noor." Professor
Tennant was induced to record his opinion of the probability of this being correct.

He had made models in fluor spar and afterwards broken them, and obtained speci-
mens which would correspond in cleavage, weight and size with the Koh-i-Noor. By

this means he was enabled to include the piece described by Dr. Beke, and pro-
bably the large Russian diamond, as forming altogether but portions of one large
diamond. The diamond belongs to the tessular crystalline sjstem; it yields readily

to cleavage in four directions, parallel to the planes of the regular octahedron. Two
of the largest planes of the Koh-i-Noor, when exhibited in the Crystal Palace, were

cleavage planes ; one of them had not been polished. This proved the specimen to
be not a third of the weight of the original crystal, which he believed to have been a
rhombic dodecahedron, and if slightly elongated, which is a common form of the
diamond, would agree with Tavernier's description of it, bearing some resemblance to
an egg.

On Chemical Combination ; and on the Amount of Heat produced by the

 Combination of several Metals with Oxygen. By Thomas Woods, M.D.

   The author endeavoured to show that in chemical combination no action different
from that which takes place in simple bodies when expanding or contracting, when
--

40 REPORT 1852.

heated or cooled, exists. Every substance is an assemblage of particles between which
a definite distance exist?, as shown by every body having a specific gravity and bulk
always the same for the same temperature ; and therefore the matter and space

of a body are related, or have some dependence on each other. Now if two bodies be

brought together at an insensible distance (and this must always be the case before
chemical action takes place), they form, as far as their particles are concerned, one
body ; and therefore these particles behave as though they were particles of a simple
body, that is, the distance between them or the space is regulated by the matter.
But as the matter of the compoxmd body is not the same as the matter of either of
those separately which compose it, the distance between the particles of the compound
must be different from that of the elements. This distance cannot be greater, for
then the particles would be nearer at a sensible than an insensible distance, and so
could not mix at all ; and being less, a particle of each of the elements must be joined
 to one of the other, for if not, the relation of the space to matter could not be caxTied
out: hence what is called chemical combination. And, as where two simple bodies
are brought together they unite, if the distance of the particles is less for the compound
than the simple, so, if a simple and compound body are mi.xed, the former decomposes
 the latter if its particles lie closer to those of either of the elements of the former than
 those of the other elements do, for in every case the relation between space and matter
 must be cai-ried out. But in other papers published in the Philosophical Magazine,
Dr. Woods has endeavoured to show that the distance between particles cannot either
 be increased or diminished without an opposite and equal change simultaneously
 occurring in some other particles ; hence, when in chemical combination the distance
 between the uniting particles is being diminished, other particles expand, and this
 expansion is the heat of chemical combination : and the necessity of this equal and
 opposite movement shows that it cannot beany power of matter, such as attraction, that
 causes particles to cohere, but the absence of expansion going on in other bodies; and
 the same law also proves that the idea o^ repulsion is equally unnecessary. Now, accord-
 ing to this theory, bodies which have the greatest affinity for each other should also lie
 the closest together, and as the more closely they lie the greater the distance their parti-
 cles move together when combining, so the heat or accompanying expansion, which is
 equal although opposite, might be taken as a measure of the affinity of bodies for each

 other.

    To prove whether this idea were correct, the author investigated the " araoimt
 of heat produced by the combination of several metals with oxygen." The method
 of finding the amount of heat is new. Instead of burning the metals in oxygen, as
 formerly. Dr. Woods dissolved them in water (potassium, sodium), or sulphuric or
 nitric acid, and noted the effect on the thermometer. To the number of degrees
 indicated was then added the quantity of heat absorbed by the decomposition of the
 dissolving menstruum ; for Dr. Woods has proved in the October Number of the
 Philosophical Magazine, 1851, that " decomposition of a compound body absorbs as
 much heat as the combination of the elements originally produced." In the follow-

 ing table are the results :

This mineral occurs in the schist rocks of the Mourne Mountains, near their junction
with the granite. In external characters it resembles somewhat the common mag-
netic oxide ; but its lustre is inferior. It occurs both in the amorphous state and in

imperfectly-formed octahedrons. Its composition was found to be,

Sesquioxide of iron              71'41

Protoxide of iron                > 21"59
Magnesia                                                  6'45

+The formula of this mineral is evidently Fe^ O3 (FeO, MgO), a part of the protoxide

of iron being i-eplaced by magnesia. Although not mentioned in any of the published

analyses of magnetic oxide of iron, magnesia appears to be a constant constituent of
this mineral. The author gave the results of analyses of magnetic oxide in which

2-00, 0-71, and 0-09 per cent, of magnesia had respectively replaced an equivalent

amount of the protoxide of iron. It is remarkable that not a trace of lime could ever

be detected in any specimen of magnetic oxide. Oxide of manganese is usually also

present, but in minute quantity. In this analysis a solution of the bicarbonate of

Abaryta was employed to separate the sesquioxide of iron from the magnesia.

solution of this compound, which is readily prepared by passing a current of carbonic

acid into water containing recently-precipitated carbonate of baryta in suspension, the

author finds to eifect a very complete separation of the sesquioxide of iron from the

oxide of manganese and from magnesia, and considers that it may be very usefully
employed in quantitative analyses for effecting the separation of the bases just men-
tioned, presenting many advantages over the insoluble carbonate of baryta, as well as

over the other reagents usually employed for the same purpose.

 Observations on the Diamond. By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S,

  In the course of last spring I was requested by H.R.H. Prince Albert to give my

opinion respecting different forms into which it was proposed to reduce the Koh-i-Noor
diamond, in order to make it an ornamental gem. In the state in which it then was,
it exhibited an inferior display of colours to its glass model, and it was only by sur-
rounding it with a number of vivid lights that its coloured refractions could be de-
veloped. Having had occasion to observe some remarkable phsenomena in small
portions of diamond, an account of which was published in the Transactions of the
Geological Society for 1836, I was desirous of examining so large a mass of diamond
as the Koh-i-Noor before it was reduced in size, and covered with facets which would

not permit it to be examined. His Royal Highness readily granted my request, and

I had thus an opportunity of submitting it to the scrutiny of polarized light. In
place of producing no action upon this species of light, as might have been expected

from its octahedral structure, it exhibited streaks of polarized tints, generally parallel
to one another, but in some places of an irregular form, and rising to the yellow of
the frst order of colours. These tints and portions of polarized light were exactly

the same as those which I had long ago found in many other diamonds, and figured
in the Edinburgh Transactions for 1815 and 1816. In placing the Koh-i-Noor under
a microscope of considerable power, I observed in it, and also in each of the two
small diamonds which accompanied it, several minute and irregular cavities, sur-
rounded with sectors of polarized light, which could only have been produced by the
expansive action of a compressed gas or fluid that had existed in the cavities when
the diamond was in a soft state. In an external cavity, shown in the model, and
which had been used for fixing the gold setting, I observed, with common light, a
portion of yellow light, indicating a yellow substance. Mr. Garrard and others con-

 sidered it as gold rubbed off the gold setting ; but as gold is never yelloiv by trans-
 mitted light, I considered the colour as produced by a yellow solid substance of

unknown origin. Sir Henry De la Beche having suggested to me that it would be

 desirable to make a general examination of the principal diamonds in London, I went
 next day to the British Museum, and found there an interesting specimen, which
 threw some light on the j'ellow solid to which I have I'eferred. This specimen was a
 piece of colourless diamond, uncut, and without any crystalline faces, about three or
 four tenths of an inch broad, and about the twelfth of an inch thick, and on its sur-
 face there lay a crystal of yellow diamond, with the four planes of semi-octahedron.
 This singular fact was illustrated by a large model placed beside it. Upon examining

 the original, 1 noticed a pretty large cavity in the thickness of the specimen, with the
 extremity of which the yellow octahedron was connected; and finding a portion of
 amorphous yellow diamond in the other end of the cavity, 1 had no doubt that the

 yellow crystal had emerged, in a fluid state, from the cavity when it was accidentally
 opened, and had immediately crystallized on the surface of cleavage. I am well
 aware that such an opinion makes a good demand upon the faith of the mineralogist
 but to those who have seen, as I have done, the contents of fluid cavities in crystal

--solidifying and even crystallizing on the face of cleavage, while another portion of

the contents of the cavity escaped in gas to those who have seen in topaz cavities
numbers of regularly formed crystals, sonie of which, after being fused by heat,

--instantly recrystallized the conclusion I have drawn will be stripped of much of its

apparent extravagance. In examining a number of diamonds in the museum of the
East India Company, to which Col. Sykes kindly obtained me access, and showt forty

mox fifty the possession of Messrs. Hunt and Roskill, I found many containing large

 and irregular cavities of the most fantastic shapes, and all of them surrounded with
irregular patches of polarized light, of high tints, produced undoubtedly by a pressure

from within the cavities, and modified by their form. Among these specimens I

found one or two black diamonds, not lilacic from a dark colouring matter, like that
in smoky quartz, but black from the immense number of cavities which they con-
tained. Tavernier has described a large and curious diamond which throws some
light on the subject of this notice. It contained, in its very centre, a large black
cavity. The diamond merchants refused to purchase it. At last a Dutchman bought
it, and by cutting it in two, obtained two very fine diamonds. The black cavity
through which he cut was found to contain eight or nine carats of what Tavernier

calls black vegetable mud !

          Geological Structure of the Counties of Down and Antrim.
                     ^y James Bryce,jmw., M.A., F.G.S.

   The author began by stating that the valley of the Lagan, on which the town of
Belfast is situated, is a great depression on either side of which formations of dif-
ferent ages are confluent. On the southern side of the valley the strata belong
to the older formations ; on the northern side they are the newest that occur in
Ireland. Each of the counties of Down and Antrim is thus almost exclusively occu-
pied with rocks peculiar to itself; those in the one county not including those in the
other. The author then proceeded to describe the leading geological features of the
County of Down. It contains two granitic tracts, which seem to have been elevated
at different epochs. They are separated from one another, and each is wholly enclosed
by a thick band of metamorphic slate, gneissose in its lower part, and passing upwards
into flinty and common clay-slate. Superimposed conformably on these are other
slates of a less crystalline type, whose aggregate thickness is enormous, and whose
upper portions have yielded a few imperfect fossils, which seem to make them refer-
able to the lower Silurian group; but as yet no definite lines have been made out
to justify a classification. Over the slates, but unconformable to them, there occurs
in the N.E. part of the county many strata abounding in fossils, which the author
is inclined to refer to the Carboniferous and Permian systems. Among these no traces
of coal have yet been found ; which is remarkable, seeing that the system is otherwise

so fully developed.

   The formations of Antrim were next described. These consist of triassic beds, lias,
and the cretaceous system, including greensand and chalk ; the whole overlaid by

--vast accumulations of igneous rocks presenting many varieties, basalts, greenstones,

greystones, porphyries, tufts, and ashes with lignites; which the author endeavoured

to separate into distinct flows from certain foci of submarine volcanic action. Many
new pbaenomena connected with the Giant's Causeway were also described; and a
                                                                      ;

tertiary pliocene formation at Belfast which has yielded a greater variety of fossil
species than all the other similar beds in Ireland taken together. In conclusion, the
recent discovery of extensive beds of rock-salt near Carrickfergus was briefly al-

luded to.

    Sir Roderick I. Murchison briefly explained the nature and value of the last re-

searches of Dr. A. Fleming, to whom the Indian government had assigned the task of
exploring (as Director) the salt mines of the Upper Punjaub. The chief results are,

that the salt range is composed, in descending order, of a mass of nummulite lime-
stone, which, forming its peaks, tr.ro\vs off" younger and pebbly deposits, and is under-
laid first by secondary rocks of Jurassic (Oxfordian) age, and next by limestone,
laden with well-known species of Producti of the carboniferous or mountain limestone
the whole being supported by inferior masses of red shale, sandstone and conglome-
rate, to which the salt is subordinate. After a pointed allusion to the great importance
of these discoveries, Sir R. I. Murchison informed the Section that he had acquainted
the author that some of the salt of Russia occupied the same position, or that of the
Devonian or Old Red Rocks.

On the Fossils of the Yelloio Sandstone of the South of Ireland.
                   By Professor E. Forbes, F.B.S.

During the course of the labours of the Geological Survey of Ireland in 1851,

strata referable to the "yellow sandstone," and consisting of compact flagstones of a

very grey and creamy colour, at the hill of Knocktopher in Kilkenny, were found to

abound in fossils of great beauty, and apparently entirely new. They consisted of

remains of ferns and other plants in a beautiful state of preservation, and were

accompanied by a large bivalve shell, which must provisionally be referred to the

       genus Anodon, and may receive the name of Anodon JuJcesii, The ferns belong

I to the genus Cyclopteris, and to a group in that genus among which the aspect of
        Neiiropteris is assumed. Thej' differ materially from any of the members of this

group hitherto described, not only specifically, but also in their general arrange-
ments ; and exhibit some peculiarities not hitherto noticed in fossil ferns. The most

common of these (Cyclopteris Hihernicus) is often tvi'o feet in length of its bipinnate

fronds. Along with these are species of Lepidodendron and Stigmaria ; also curious

cones, formed of loose groups of scales or bracts, each furnished with an exceedingly

long mucro. All of these appear to be new. Great interest attaches to this assem-

--blage : 1st, as an indicat'on of fresh, or at least brackish, water conditions at the

period of the depositions of the beds ; and 2ndlj', as, if we are correct in considering

these strata Devonian, this is the most perfect illustration of the flora of that epoch

yet discovered. Fish remains of the genus Holoptychius, and of the crustacean Ptery-

gotus occur also in these beds.  _^__

             On the Shells found in the Alluvial Deposits of Belfast.
  By John Grainger, Hon. Sec. of the Dublin University ZooL Assoc.

   The author, after referring to the incomplete character of what had been published
on the subject, stated, that the alluvial deposits of Belfast occupied the greater part
of the foundations of the town, and extended three or four miles into the bay, and
that the shells had been found in various levels from four feet in vertical height above
higli-water mark to twenty-four feet below it. The deposits appeared to have the shells
--44 REPORT 1852.

rather diffused throughout them than lying in regular heds. This, together with the fact
that the same species were found at every depth, made it useless as well as impossible

to observe levels to which the species should respectively belong. Besides, the shells
were all of recent species, and thus fixed the formations of one geological age. The
following is a summary of the remarks upon each species.

   Teredo norvegica, Sprengler. A considerable number of tubes were found, tending
to prove the indigenousness of the species. It is not now an inhabitant of the bay,

nor indeed is there any habitat nearer than Povtpatrick in Wigtonshire, a harbour

presenting identically similar geological features to those of Belfast Bay.

   Pholas dactylvs, Linn. A single valve in the sand of the deposits. It exists at

present in some numbers in the harbour.
   P. parva, Penn. Was met with, and in the living state upon the surface.
   P. crisjjcila, Linn. Several huge examples 4^ inches long. Not now common in

the bay.

P. Candida, Linn. A tolerable number of single valves, with a few perfect speci-

mens, one three inches in length. At the present day abundant in the harbour.

ASaxicava arctica, Linn.  few single valves. Still an iuhabitant of the bay.

Mya truncata, Linn. Occurred plentifully. An extremely common species in the

harbour.

   M. arenaria, Linn. Was found everywhere in the deposits. Now a favourite food

with the poor along the neighbouring shores.

   Corhula nucleus. Lam. Was met with but sparingly. It still occurs in the bay.
   Thracia phaseolhia, Lam. A few specimens, but only with separated valves. Com-

mon enough in the harboiu- at present.
    T. 2>ubescens, Pult. One rather fine individual. Has been taken also in the living

state in the neighbourhood.

   T. convexa, Wood. A large nimiber was obtained. Has not been taken in Belfast

Bay.
   Solen marginaius, Pult. Occurred rather frequently. Has been dredged in the

dead state near the mouth of the harbour.
     S. ensis, Linn. Represented by one or two poor examples of the var. magna.

Both the typical form and the var. occur in the living state.
   S. jjellucidus, Penn. In small numbers, and rather local. Dredged commonly

enough in the bay.

   Solecurtus coarctatus, Gmel. A single rather fine example. Not in the harbour as

a living species, but has been dredged in some of the neighbouring estuaries.
   Psammohia vespertina, Chem. One valve only. Still an inhabitant.

   P. Ferroensis, Chem. Rather scarce, and only in single valves. Now dredged in

tolerable numbers alive.

   Tellina tenuis, Da Cos. Was represented by rather fresh-looking specimens. Quite

abundant as a living occupant.

    T. soUdida, Pult. Distributed everywhere throughout the beds. Still a common

shell in the neighbourhood.

   Syndosmya alba. Was well distributed, and occurred in large numbers in company.

It is also an inhabitant in the recent state.
   Scrobicularia piperala, Gmel. Left ample memorials of its former presence; and

does not occupy suitable localities near Belfast. The best specimens found nearest to

the course of the river.
   Mactra elliptica, Brown. Occurred pretty often. Enumerated amongst the inha-

bitants of the harbour.

AM. sid)truncata. Da Cos.  large number of fine examples.  Abundant in the bay

in the living state.

   Lutraria elliptica, Lara. Was imbedded everywhere. It is yet in the harbour a not

unfrequent species.

   Tapes decussata, Linn. Appeared pretty often. Dug living out of the sand near

Belfast.

   T. pullastra. Wood. The typical form was met with abundantly. Extremely
numerous at the present day.

   T. aurea, Gmel. Was locally abundant. In some parts of the bay nothing could

be more plentiful than this as a living species.

design as to suggest the beneficent Author of Nature as the Cause of it.

         On the Lower Meinbers of the Carboniferous Series of Irelund.
                  By Richard Griffith, M.R.J.A., F.G.S.

   Having briefly glanced at the carboniferous series, as it occurs in various parts of
Ireland, he proceeded to describe the yellow sandstones and carboniferous slates,
which, he said, are best developed in the north coast of the County Mayo, extending,
in a western direction, to the undulating quartz rocks and mica-slate at Ballinderry,
and in the north of Ireland, in the counties of Londonderry and Donegal. In the
north, the series is altogether about 6000 feet thick, 3000 feet belonging to the car-
boniferous limestone, and 3000 to the slate and yellow sandstones, so that altogether
the series is about 6000 feet in thickness. The first members of the series consist of
beds of yellow sandstones, with occasional alternating layers of whitish and greenish
coloured shales, red sandstones, and limestones. The beds contain a great number
of fossils ; and it is a remarkable fact, that fossils of the same character occur in each,
and are found from top to bottom. The limestone alone contains upwards of 90 spe-
cies, some remai-kably curious specimens of which were shown by the author; and in
the yellow sandstone there is a large number, including fish-beds and plants, such as
were first discovered by Col. Portlock at Moyola in the County Londonderrj'. Mr.
Griffith next directed attention to various sections in the County Dublin, in which he
pointed out the carboniferous slate beds as having a stratification consisting of impure
argillaceous limestone, and perfectly distinct in character from the lower limestone
and also to sections in the County Waterford, in which the old red sandstone is found
resting unconformabl}' on the Silurian rocks, with carboniferous slates and yellow
sandstone below it. He conceived, that what he called the carboniferous slate and

yellow sandstone might belong to the carboniferous limestone.

    Notices of the Geology of Ireland. By Richard Griffith, F.G.S.

   Mr. Griffith directed attention to the map of the geology of Ireland, on which he
had been so many years engaged, and to the improvements which he had been
enabled to make on it since 1838, acknowledging with thanks the services rendered
to him by Col. Fordyce, and Messrs. Bryce and M'Adam. On looking at the map,

it will be found, he said, that the conformation of Ireland is peculiar, the coast being

mountainous and the interior flat. Taking the line from Dublin to Galway, which
is 120 miles, the summit level is seen to be only 160 feet above the level of the sea;
hence it is that our canals and railways have been made at an expense so com-
parativel)' trifling. Lough Allan, which may be considered the source of the Shan-

non, is 160 feet above the level of the sea ; while between Killaloe and the tide water

at Limerick, a distance of about 12 miles, the fall is only 110 feet. The average fall

is less than six inches to the mile, a circumstance to which we are to attribute so
many sluggish rivers, and the existence of large tracts of country flooded during six
or nine months in the year. The mountain ranges which indicate the strata of Ire-
land run in the north from north-west to south-east, and in the county of Cork from

nearly east to west.

   Beginning with the foundation and going to the top, it may be said that the mica

slate, which forms the basis of all the sedimentary rocks of Ireland, occurs in abun-
dance in the counties of Londonderry and Donegal, where it is found twisted and
contorted in every direction by the protrusion of the granite. Mr. Griffith next

alluded to the stratifications in the counties of Mayo and Galway, which, he remarked,
were chiefly composed of mica-slate, granite rock, and limestone. Granite also
occurs to the north of Galway Bay, where it is succeeded by metamorphic rocks and
mica-slate. To the north of the grand boundary several granite rocks occur, pro-
truding through the mica-slate and limestones. In this district there appears the
green marble, which is only limestone metamorphosed by the action of the granite.

    Passing northward, the mica-slate is found covered by Sihuian rocks. These
rocks contain numerous fossils belonging to the Silurian system, and are succeeded
by enormous masses of conglomerate, containing large pebbles of grey granite, some
of them nearly a ton in weight, and perfectly rounded. The granite thus observed
is quite distinct in its character from the granite of the district, and clearly enough
belongs to an older period. The thickness of the Silurian strata, including the con-

glomerate, may be set down at about 5000 feet. The speaker next alluded to the
slates and Silurian ranges of the promontory at Dingle, in the county of Kerry, and

described similar formations in the counties of Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow.
To the north of Dublin there is another slate district, similar in character to that of
Wicklow and Wexford, and probably belonging to a lower Silurian series, though, as
no fossils have been discovered in it except at the south portion, its exact age remains
undetermined. This is accompanied with the granite at the Mourne Mountains,
which Mr. Griffith conceives to be newer than the slate. One of the most interesting
Silurian districts in Ireland occurs near Pomeroy, in the county of Tyrone.

   Mr. Griffith next described the Old Red Sandstonp, particularly alluding to the large
district which occurs in the county of Tyrone, and which, apparently, has some rela-
tion to the Silurian district at Pomeroy ; and then pointed out on the map several
mountain ranges which are capped by the deposit, particularly the Galtees and
Knockmeledown mountains, Slievenish, in the west of KeiTy, and districts north of
the county of Cork. Mr. Griffith remarked that the old red sandstone is succeeded
by the great mountain limestone district of Ireland, which occupies two-thirds of the
entire country. The carboniferous limestone series, he observed, is altogether about
6000 feet thick, 3000 feet of which belongs to the lower portion of the series, and 3000

to the upper.

   He next described the several coal districts of Ireland, commencing with Ballycastle,

at Fair Head, on the north coast of the county of Antrim. This district, which is of
greater antiquity than any other in Ireland, had, he remarked, been worked to a consi-
derable extent. The coal was worked by tunnels, and the beds, which were affected at
different elevations by the protrusion of dykes of greenstone, have been nearly worked
out, though at Murlough Bay, which contains bituminous coal, or stone coal, there
are some beds, whether exhausted or not he had not information to enable him to say.
The next coal district is that situated near Coalisland, in the county of Tyrone. IX
--48 REPORT 1852.

is very small, and the beds are now nearly all worked out. A third occurs in Leitrim,

Cavan, and Roscommon, stretching to Lough Island, which contains only one bed,
not exceeding two feet in thickness, though in this locality there is the site of the
Arigna iron-works, which, though they are not worked at the present time, formerly
attracted much attention in this country. The shale accompanies the coal with rich
beds of argillaceous ironstone, some of it containing so much as 40 per cent, of iron ;
indeed, the iron that was made at Arigna was found to be of very superior quality.

   Mr. Griffith next described the Kilkenny coal district, which contains, he said, an
unflaming coal, or mineral charcoal alone. There are several beds in this district,
two of which are three feet in thickness, one four feet, and two less than three feet.
The upper beds have been long since worked out; the lower ones still remain,
though they are so impure in quality, and contain so much sulphv.r, that they are not
used except to burn limestone. The Munster coal district was next dwelt upon. It
occupies a considerable portion of Clare, Limerick, Cork, and Kerry, and contains
three beds, some of which are not more than six inches in thickness. The most
valuable portion is found at the south, immediately to the north of the river Black-

water, where several excellent beds of anthracite occur.
    Having remarked that he would not say that a valuable coal bed would not be

found in Ireland, though he believed that no such coal would be had in the country

as is to be found in England, Mr. Griffith proceeded to the New Red Sandstone. The
new red sandstone, he said, is very sparingly developed in Ireland. The most

southern locality in which it is found is at Carrickmacross, in the county of Monaghan,
where, in sinking through it to obtain coal, a bed of gypsum, 40 feet in thickness,
was discovered ; and the districts in which it is found most extensively are in the
counties of Tyrone and Antrim. In Tyrone, it adjoins the coal district, and rests

upon it. It also occurs in the valleys of the river Lagan, in the counties of Down
and Antrim, continues under Belfast, and again displays itself at Carrickfergus. The
strata contain gypsum in thinner beds, however, than those mentioned as occurring
at Carrickmacros.3. Some time ago, when sinking through it to obtain coal, a bed of

salt was discovered.
    The new red sandstone is covered by the lias, which is similar to that in England,

and this again by the chalk, which in the north of Ireland is called white limestone,
owing to being more dense than the chalk found in England. The chalk is covered
by tabular trap, which occupies a large portion of the counties of Antrim and Derry.

     Mr. Griffith next explained the position of the tertiary beds, remarking that an in-
 teresting tertiary district occurs in the south side of Lough Neagh, in the counties of
 Tyrone and Down. It is ten miles in length and four in breadth; a bore was made
 through it, to the depth of 300 feet, with a view to obtain coal, and the strata were
 found to consist of alternations of white ironstone and blue clay, with surlurbrand, or

--wood coal a series similar to that at Bovey, in Devonshire. The level of the bore,

 which was situated not far from the coal-field, and adjoined the coal district, was
 about 70 feet above the level of the sea ; and, as the boring itself was 300 feet deep,
 the depth of the series was 230 feet below the level of the sea, though even at this
 distance it was not penetrated. Mr. Griffith next alluded to the tertiary districts
 situated on the coasts of the counties of Wicklow, Wexford, and "VVaterford, and con-
 cluded by a view of the eskar hills and diluvial gravel which cover so large a portion
 of Ireland, and which appeared to him to have been produced by currents setting in

 from the north-west towards the south-east.

 On the Fossil Remains of the Lower Silurians of the South of Scotland, and

                     their Position. By Robert Harkness.

     The occui-rence of fossil remains amongst the deposits known to the earlier Scotch
 geologists by the name of transition, was a circumstance which excited considerable
 attention even in the days of Hutton and Playfair. The locality from whence these
 were procured was Wrae in Peeblesshire, and this spot for a long time was regarded
  as the only source which affisrded organic remains amongst the Silurians of Scotland.
  Since these deposits have been discovered to be of the Lower Silurian age, they have

 furnished fossils in considerable abundance.
     Prof. Nicol has, from the slate quarries of Greistone and Thornielee in Peebleshire

  and Selkirkshire, obtained Graptolites ; Mr. Carrick Moore, at Cairnryan, has procured
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      49

the same fossils ; Prof. Sedgwick at Moffat also obtained Graptolites ; and Sir Rode-
rick Murchison, in the last year's volume of the Journal of the Geological Society,
has given an elaborate account of the Silurians of the south-west of Ayrshire and their

fossil contents. These Silurians, described by Sir R. Murchison, occupy a higher

position than those which constitute the gi-eat Silurian mass traversing the South of

Scotland from sea to sea.

   In Ayrshire a deposit of limestone makes its appearance, which, both in lithological
characters, and also in its fossil contents, shows an affinity to the limestone of Wrae,

and above this limestone several deposits containing large quantities of fossils occur.

The nature of the fossil contents of this limestone and that of Wrae indicate that they
appertain to the Llandeilo flags. At Wrae this limestone is seen lying upon a breccia
composed of fragments of slate, and at the same locality thick beds of the slate, from

whence these fragments have been obtained, are also seen. This slate extends east-
north-eastwards and west-south-westwards, and is seen at Stobo in Peeblesshire, and in
the summit-cutting of the Caledonian railway, where it shows great thickness. From

thence it extends westwards through Lanarkshire and the north-east of Dumfries-

shire to Cairn Ryan in Wigtonshire ; and in this black slate Mr. Carrick Moore found
Graptolites and other fossils. To the south of the zone occupied by these black slates,

beds of greywacke, sandstones and shales are found, having great thickness ; and
beneath these a band of gray slate is met with. In this gray slate are seen, in some

localities, the graptolites described by Prof. Nicol, and this gray slate band runs nearly

parallel with the black zone. Besides Graptolites, it affords annelid markings and

fucoids, both of which are found in considerable abundance at Barlae quarry in Kirk-

cudbright. Southward of this gray slate the graywacke sandstones and shales again

make their appearance, and in them there occurs a deposit of green and blue shales,

which also contain annelid markings. Beneath these green and blue shales, after a

considerable thickness of graywacke sandstone is passed through, beds of soft black

shale are seen having abundance of Graptolites, of various species, and this grap-

tolite-shale passes into anthracitic shale, in some localities consisting altogether of

the latter mineral. Under the anthracite, graywacke sandstones and shales are

again seen, and these appear to form the lowest beds of the lower Silurians, as they

occur in the South of Scotland. In these low shales evidence of animal life is seen in

the form of annelid impressions, and these are probably the lowest traces which have

yet been obtained of animal existences. The lower beds of grey wacke sandstones and

shales, the anthracite band, and the accompanying graptolite beds, as well as some of

the deposits which succeed them, are repeated three times in that portion of the area

occupied by the Silurians, where they are best developed, viz. in Dumfriesshire.
The gray shale, and the beds which succeed it, together with the higher black slates

and breccia, do not appear to be repeated like the deposits which occur beneath

them, consequently the order of sequence of the deposits in these lower Silurians is

somewhat disturbed. However, between the Beatock station of the Caledonian rail-

way and Elvanfoot a comparatively perfect sequence may be made out, by examining

the sections on the line of railway and the brook courses which fall into the Evan,

the stream which runs parallel to the Caledonian railway. At Ruttenside near

Greskin, about four miles above the Beatock station, the anthracite is seen in the
Evan water, and this can be traced E.N.E. to Hartfell, and from thence into Peebles-

line which separates Dumfriesshire from Lanarkshire, the gray slates were seen,

which contain the Graptolites at Greistone, and the annelid markings and fucoids at

Barlae. Following the railway northwards from Rae-cleugh, we come upon the

greywacke sandstones and shales, which separate the gray slates from the black

slates which occur above them ; and these at the summit-cutting are succeeded by the
black slates, which at Cairn Ryan afford Graptolites and other fossils. The hills of

Crawford in Lanarkshire, which rise to the north of the black slate band, are com-

posed of the breccia already alluded to ; but the thickness of this breccia cannot be
made out here, nor is it seen to be succeeded by the limestone containing Llandeilo

flag fossils, as at Wrae in Peeblesshire. This section on the Caledonian railway is
more than six miles long, and from the great inclination of the beds, which are rarely

less than 70° N.N.W., it would seem to afford a series of deposits about 25,000 feet

in thickness ; and by taking the conglomerate which lies below the limestone, and the

deposits which occur beneath the anthracite beds, it is probable that we may add
5000 feet more to the Silurians which occur below the limestones containing fossils
similar to the Llandeilo flags, making in all a total thickness of 30,000 feet of strata

through which four distinct bands of deposits containing fossil remains are scattered.
    From the mineral character of these Silurians, and also from their occurrence below

the limestone with lower Silurian fossils, it would seem that the great bulk of the
Scotch Silurians are about the equivalents of the Longmynd beds of the governnment
geologist, as shown in North Wales. But the Scotch deposits have, however, one
feature which the Longmynd beds do not possess, viz. organic remains, and they are of
such thickness as to indicate that in them are contained some of the lowest forms of
life, not only as regards the relation of the fossils to animals generally, but likewise
as respects geological position.

    With regard to the fossil contents of these lower Silurian beds, these are remark-
ably simple, and at the same time very characteristic. Graptolites of various species
are the almost exclusive fossils, and they abound more in the lower beds than in the
higher strata. In the shales which lie above the anthracite they occur in great pro-
fusion, and are the exclusive fossils of this deposit. Here, too, the greatest amount
of species is obtained, as well as the greatest abundance of individuals; and as
respects the latter, I know of no deposit in the whole range of the geological for-
mations which can be compared with these black shales, so far as quantity of fossils is
concerned.

    Although these low beds are characterized by this group of fossils, it is not sufficient
to give to them a division distinct from the lower Silurians. Graptolites in some
districts occur in considerable abundance, above beds which are marked by lower
Silurian trilobites, as in Bohemia. Some species of Graptolites extend upwards into
the upper Silurian, amongst which is the Graptolites priodon, Bronn and this spe-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

cies is found in great quantities in the lower Silurians of Scotland, at Greistone, in

the gray slates. But although I have examined many thousand specimens from the
soft black shale above the anthracite, I have never been able to detect this common

Graptolite.

   On the occurrence of Graphite at Almorness Head, Kirkcudbrightshire.
                             By Robert Harkness.

   At Almorness, a headland which lies on the west side of tlie entrance of the estuary
of the river Urr, in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, graphite occurs. This headland
consists principally of syenite and patches of metamorphic lower Silurians. The
syenite is a portion of that which extends from Criffel, a mountain on the south-east
of Galloway, along the southern margin of the county, and crossing the estuary of the
Urr, makes its appearance on the western side. In this syenite the felspar is com-
monly of a white colour ; but when the syenite approaches the Silurian rock, the
felspar becomes reddish, giving the syenite a flesh-coloured tint. This is the case
with that portion which forms the headland of Almorness, and through which veins
of quartz traverse. In one of these, which occurs on the south-west side of the head-
land, the graphite is found. This vein, which is about 4 feet wide, has the graphite
disseminated through it. It likewise appears on the syenite in contact with the
quartz vein. It has been urged by some of the German chemists, that the presence
of plumbago in igneous rocks is due to the decomposition of carburetted hydrogen,
which, passing over matter through veins in a red-hot state, has been decomposed,

the result being the deposition of the carbon, which, uniting with iron in the rocks,
appears in the form of a carburet of iron. So far as regards the former occurrence of
carburetted hydrogen in connexion with the rocks which have been elevated by the
irniption of the syenite in this locality, this is a circumstance extremely probable. In
the Silurians which occur to the north ofthc district occupied by this syenite, there are

seen extensive beds of anthracite; and these beds of anthracite, when acted on by
gnecus matter previous to their becoming anthracitic, would aflbrd abundance of

hydrocarbons.

   Amongst the Silurians which are contiguous to the syenitic district, and which are
much metamorphosed and chloritic, there occur beds, which, from their structure and
position, appear to have originally been anthracite, but which uow contain no traces
of carbon. Probably the action of the igneous rocks on these beds may have been the

means by which the carbiiretted hydrogen was obtained, and the passage of this through
red-hot veins may have produced the graphite at Almorness Head.

An Account of the Researches of German Geologists. By H. Hennessy.

On Devonian Rocks in the South of Ireland. By J. Beete Jukes, F.G.S.

   The object of the following paper is, first of all, to bring before the Section the physi-
cal facts connected with some very remarkable fossils discovered by the Geological Sur-
vey of Ireland during the past year ; and secondly, to take the opinion of the Section
on a difficulty that has arisen as to the classification and nomenclature of the rocks.

    For the first part of the paper, a description of the structure of the south-east part
of the county of Kilkenny will suffice ; for the second, the description nmst be ex-
tended from Kilkenny through Waterfovd into Cork.

   [Mr. Jukes then described this portion of the southern part of Ireland from Mr.
Griffith's map, of the general accuracy and admirable character of which he spoke in
high terms, and from some enlarged sections copied from those constructed by the

Geological Survey.]
   In Kilkenny, the total thickness of the rocks between the mountain limestone and

the Silurian and granite does not exceed 1000 feet. In the neighbourhood of Knock-
topher, south of Thomastown, these rocks are principally composed of red slates and
sandstones. The mountain limestone has some beds of dark shale interstratified with
its lower parts, beneath which are some brown and yellow sandstones, containing casts
of bivalve shells; these do not exceed 150 feet in thickness, and below them are
about 300 feet of red slates, with a few yellow sandy beds occasionally, when we
come to some alternations of red and green " slate-rock," a smooth fine-grained
argillaceous sandstone without cleavage. In these greenish beds are some large
slates containing ferns, and also casts of some large bivalve shells resembling Anodon.
These fossils were discovered by Mr. Flanagan, fossil collector to the Survey, the
country being mapped, and the details of its structure made out by Mr. Andrew

Wyley, my able and zealous colleague on the Geological Survey, a native of Belfast,

and who I regret is not able to be present on this occasion. These red and green
beds are about 100 or 150 feet in thickness, and below them are about 350 feet of red
slates and argillaceous sandstones, below which are 100 feet of coarse conglomerates,

resting on the subjacent Silurian and granitic rocks.
    Reckoning from the base of the mountain limestone to the latter, the beds con-

taining these fossils are about in the middle of the included series :

   In the north part of the County of Waterford, near Carrick on Suir, for instance, we
get below the mountain limestone,

In other parts of Waterford further west, these beds thicken out to a total of 4500

feet, of which the upper, consisting of yellow sandstones alternating with red shales,

is about 900 feet.

In the northern part of County Cork, about the south flank of the Galtee Moun-

tains, and thence to Fermoy, we get a similar section, consisting of,

                                                                             Feet,

Red sandstones and slates passing downwards into thick red sandstones

and conglomerates, resting unconformably on lower Silurian                   2500

   In the central part of County Cork the lower part of the formation is not seen,
but the rocks immediately below the mountain limestone still consist very largely of
yellow sandstones, split up not only by red shales and slates, but also by blue and gray
shales cleaved into slate. In these bluish slates are found casts of marine shells.

                                                                                                                                              4,*

Hitherto, in North Cork, North Waterford, and Kilkenny fragments of plants have
heen the only things found in the yellow sandstone.

   As we go south, the blue and gray slates increase in quantity at the expense of the
yellow sandstones, till south of Cork, especially near Monkstown and Carrigaline, we

get the following section :

Dark gray shales and slates, with occasional bands of greenish-gray         Feet.

  We here lose the yellow sandstone altogether, and get below the mountain lime-

stone, a great series of slate rocks with interstratified beds of sandstone, the prevailing
colour of the upper portion being gray, and of the lower red, with alternating beds at
their junction, marine fossils being found in the upper part, and no fossils at all in
the lower.

    Still further south, about Kinsale, these upper beds acquire a still larger development,
being at the very least 6000 feet thick, without seeing anything like the base of them,

and without any certainty of our having seen tlie top. Of this part, as we have not
yet completed the survey, 1 cannot enter into details ; I have however received a
letter from mj' colleague, Mr. Wilson, in which he tells me that the following section
is admirably seen iu Courtmacsherry Bay :

We here get the yellow sandstone coming in again just above the red rocks, having

a vast series of blue and gray shales and slates above it, bearing out Mr. Griffith in

his threefold division of carboniferous slate, yellow sandstone and old red. The

difficulty we experience in the field is, that all these rocks are so blended at their

junction by alternation one with another through several hundred feet of thick-

ness, and are near their junction, and generally, except in particular spots, so devoid

of fossils, that we cannot hit upon any characters to enable us to draw a clear boun-

dary between them. Starting with the old red sandstone, and calling that Devonian,

there are no physical characters whatever enabling us to draw a boundary imtil we

Wecome to the base of the mountain limestone.  have therefore hitherto foimd our-

selves compelled merely to make a shaded outline, including the upper beds, namely,

the carboniferous slate and yellow sandstone of Mr. Griffith, looking on them in the

light of the upper portions of the old red sandstone. If we can so consider them, we

get the following remarkable result; that on the east, where the old Devonian land

lay, as proved by the conglomerates, the old beaches of that formation, we find

remains of terrestrial plants and freshwater shells ; while on the south and west,
where the rocks get finer-grained, and where therefore the finer silts and muds were

deposited further from the land, or in the deeper water of the sea, there we get marine

shells coming in, and we find the whole formation gradually thickening in that direc-

tion, swelling out from 1000 to upwards of 6000 feet. This increase of thickness, though

it seems great, is nothing remarkable, since to acquire it, it is only necessary to suppose

that the old sea bottom deepened very gradually, its bed inclining at no greater angle

than 1°, or 17 in 1000, or 89 feet (14 fathoms) in a mile, if we take the distance

from Knocktopher in Kilkenny to Kinsale ; or if we supposed that the thickness of the

On the Permian Fossils of Cultra. By Professor Wm. Kmc,Queen's Coll.,

                                                     Galway.

   Before noticing the fossils*, Prof. King made a few observations on the rocks form-
ing the Permian system of tlie norih of England. This system is so called from an
extensive division of the Russian empire bearing the name of Perm, and situated on
the western flanks of the Ural mountains. The name was originally proposed by Sir
Roderick Murchison, who was the first to show that the rocks occurring in that
region are of the same age as certain magnesian and fossihferous deposits largely
developed in the county of Durham. The name ' Permian ' has consequently been
applied to the last-named deposits, and on the same grounds it must also be applied
to corresponding rocks wherever they may exist. The Professor proceeded to prove
that the remarkable patch of magnesian limestone occurring at Cultra, on the shore
of Belfast Lough, is a member of the Permian system, the fossils it contains being
identical with tlie Schizodus Schlolheimi, Pleurophorus costatus, Bakevellia antiqua,
and other species common to the Permian rocks of England and Germany.

        On the Fossiliferous Beds of the Counties ofAntrim and Down.
                         By James Mac Adam, F.G.S.

   These beds were described in descending order. The town of Belfast is in a great
measure placed upon deposits of sand and silt that have been formed in the estuaries
of the rivers Lagan and Blackstaff". Great quantities of shells have been found in
these beds, and a list of them was laid before Section D, at the present meeting of the
Association, by Mr. John Grainger. They are all of species now existing, but some
are not found at the present time living in the bay. These shells occur at levels,
none of which seem to exceed that of present high water. Beds of shells, however,
are found at various elevations. At the Kinnegar of Holywood, four miles down
Belfast Lough, beds of shells similar to the above occur at elevations from 10 to 20
feet; and on the opposite side of the bay, below Carrickfergus, a shell-bed occurs in
a like position. On both sides of the bay other beds may be observed from 60 to 80
feet above the water with similar contents; and they are found also at some distance
inland, up the valley of the Lagan, and in the valley running from Belfast to Comber.
In the latter valley there is a branch of the County Down Railway, and during its
formation many shells were obtained from the cuttings. It is also worthy of being
recorded, that in a cutting near Comber rolled lias and chalk fossils were found, the
nearest beds containing such fossils being behind Belfast, and at a distance of ten
miles. Beds still more remarkable occur at elevations from 100 to 150 feet. One of
 these, at the Belfast Water-works, on the Antrim side, was examined by Messrs.
Hyndman and Bryce in 1842, and an account of it was copied into the Appendix to
 Col. Portlock's ' Geological Report on Londonderry.' Another bed, precisely similar,
was discovered by Mr. Mac Adam in 1850, at the Knock on the Down side. The
 most abundant shell in it is the Nucula ohlonga, and the deposit may be perhaps con-
 sidered as belonging to the newer pleiocene. Some years ago, Mr. Smith, of Jordan
 Hill, described a shell-bed occurring at Port Rush, ont he northern coast of Antrim
 it occurs at an elevation of 10 feet, and contains a great variety of recent marine
 shells mixed with some land ones; a list of them is printed in Portlock's ' Report.'

    In Belfast Lough there are deposits of submerged wood, in one of which, near
 Carrickfergus, hazel-nuts have been obtained, having their kernels replaced by car-
 bonate of lime : this fact had been remarked by the late Dr. M'Donnell, and a note
 of it is entered in the 4th volume of the Geological Transactions. Throughout the

    * The Cultra fossils were noticed by Dr. Griffith in a paper read at the Cork Meeting of
 the British Association (vide Report Brit. Assoc, 1843, part 2. pp.45 and 46).

county of Antrim deposits of lignite frequently occur, as around the shores of Lough

Neagh, at Carnaghliss, between that lake and Belfast, at Libbert near Glenarm, at

Kiltymorris and at Ballintoy ; associated with them is an impure fire-clay. At several

of these places the lignite is covered with trap, proving that this trap is of tertiary or

post-tertiary age, as the wood from which the lignite has been derived was in all

likelihood coniferous. There is also lying under the trap in different parts of Antrim

considerable beds of ochre, which sometimes contains thin seams of impure lignite.

It has been long known that at Lough Neagh, in the alluvial covering that lies upon

the lignite beds, there are found many pieces of silicified wood, sometimes of a con-

siderable size. Between the trap and the subjacent chalk there is very generally a

bed, varying from a few inches to a few feet, consisting in many places of iron-shot

clay and loose flints, and in others of a grayish clay, like impure fire-clay ; in this

last case it sometimes contains lignite.

The Chalk of Antrim contains a number of fossils resembling in a great measure

those obtained from the same formation in England. The upper beds of the Antrim

chalk are not so prolific in organic remains as the under, which are mixed with parti-

cles of greensand ; under these lower beds, and quite conformable to them, are beds

resembling the Fire-stone of Surrey, and lowest of all is a soft bed of pure greensand.

In the upper strata of pure chalk the prevailing fossils are some species of Beleninites,

Amvionites,  Pleurotomaria,  Terebratula  and    Turbo                               also  several  kinds of Echino-
                                                                                  ;

dermata and Sponges, which fossils not unfrequently are found also in the imbedded

flints. In the lower or chloritic chalk are remarked, in addition to the above, Area,

Avicula,  Inoceramus,  Natica,  Ostrea, Pecten,  Pholadomya,                               and  Trigonia                                         and  the
                                                                                                                                              ;

same are observed even in greater abundance in the subjacent fire-stone. Some fine

specimens of Ostrea carinata have been got in the fire-stone, to which rock this fossil

seems to be confined ; also the Exogyra Columha appears in it in great numbers, and

rarely in the upper or lower beds. The Exogyra lavigata is very abundant in the

lowest bed of soft greensand, where it is often the only fossil to be met with : in this

lowest bed there is less variety of organic remains than in the others ; from it however

were procured some teeth and bones of Saurian animals by Mr. Mac Adam ; and in the

Philosophical Magazine for 1831, there is an account of the discovery of saurian

vertebra near Belfast, in lias, by Mr. Bryce ; but it has since been ascertained that

they had been found in the soft greensand bed which immediately overlies lias.

Teeth of the Shark family, sometimes very perfect, occur in all the beds from the

upper chalk to the pure greensand, and some obscure remains of entire fishes of a

small size also portions of Crustacea, and several zoophytes. In some places fucoids
                                                      ;

were got in the fire -stone, and small pieces of fossil wood in the soft greensand.

These lower beds are apparently equivalents of the upper greensand of England.

Thin beds of lias underlie the greensand, but not everywhere, as they are wanting

in various localities. This lias abounds in organic remains, almost identical with

those of the same formation in England. In the beds near Belfast there are several

ammonites, and great numbers of the Cardium striatulum, with a few other fossils.

In the beds near Larne the same fossils are found, and a great variety of others, as

the Gryphea incurva&nA obliquata, Plagiostoma giganteum and puncfa(u7n, Pachyodon,

Mya, Amphidesma, Pecten, Mytilus, Modiola, Area, Lutraria, Avicula, Troehus, Ttir-

ritella, &c. ; also numerous fragments of the Pentacrinus. At Larne a bed of oolitic

structure rests upon lias, and in it are found Avicula contorta and Lima Prohoscidea,

with some others. At Ballintoy, on the north coast of Antrim, there is alias deposit
very rich in fossils, several of which are described in Portlock's ' Report : ' several

new ones have been obtained by Mr. MacAdam from that deposit, some of which

seem not to have been as yet described. In the beds at Larne and Belfast several

fish remains were obtained, and a few saurian vertebrae. The hardened lias of Port

Rush has been often described; it contains many fossils, but they are not easy to

determine from their obliteration ; in all probability they are nearly the same as those

found at Ballintoy.

   Mr. MacAdam has discovered, resting immediately on the variegated saliferous

marls of Woodburn, near Carrickfergus, a bed containing many fish remains, among

which were recognized the Gyrolepis Albertii and tenuistriaius and others, which have

been referred to the upper parts of the Trias. In the marls and subjacent sandstones

no fossils have as yet been discovered.

  On the south, or County Down side of Belfast Lough, at Cultra, there are small

patches of magnesian limestone, in which are found some shells resembling Sckizodus.
Associated with this limestone are red sandstones, supposed to be equivalents of the

rothe-todte-liegende, and containing vegetable remains, as Calamiles, Sigillaria, &c.,
but often too obscure to determine speciKcally. Underlying these are soft calcareous
shaly beds, in which are many fish remains, generally of Holoplychus, and a great
number of Modiola, with a few other shells.

   At Ballycastle and Murlough, in the north-eastern part of Antrim, there is the regu-
lar coal formation, from which Mr. Mac Adam obtained a variety of fossil plants, but
not differing from those of the English coal-fields. There are associated shales in
which a Lingula is frequently found, and there is underlying carboniferous limestone
with the usual fossils. In the County of Down at Castle Espie, near Comber, there is
a small patch of carboniferous limestone, remarkable for the Ortlioceratites it contains,
and several other fossils. On the County Down side of Carlingford Bay there is a
deposit of limestone, which in all probabiUty is the same as that which occurs near

the town of Carlingford on the south side in the county of Louth, but the fossils have

not yet been examined.

   No Silurian rocks have yet been discovered in Antrim or Down, but it is not
improbable that the like may be detected on more minute examination.

On the Stntcture of certain Fossil Fishes found in the Old Red Sandstone
               of the North of Scotland. By Professor M'Coy.

   The Professor exhibited specimens and plates; among others a large species of
lloloptijchms, which he named H. Sedgwicki, showing for the first time, the form,
number, and position of the vertical fins of that genus. He also dwelt on the ana-
tomical structure and peculiarities in the form of the tail, and the ossification of the
vertebral column, which had been supposed to characterize the fishes found in the more
ancient rocks, and which had been used by some recent writers in support of the
doctrine of " Progressive Development." He pointed out that the structure of the
fossils which he treated of disproved these notions, and strengthened the more ordi-
nary geological laws. He described the peculiarities of two new genera, which united-
the two great groups of Saurodipteridse and Coelacanthi.

                              By Professor M'Coy.

    In this communication the fact was announced that the mountain limestone genera
of fossil fishes called Cochliodus and Pcecilodus by Agassiz, and supposed by him and
all succeeding writers to have manifested the most intimate relation to the living
Australian shark, called Cesiracion, had really a strong horny jaw for the support of
the teeth, and that these latter succeeded each other vertically upwards, the young
teeth appearing imder the old ones ; while in the living shark alluded to there was
no horny jaw, and the young teeth followed the old ones laterally from behind for-
wards ; so that there was no such reason, as generally supposed, for quoting the
existence of the Cestracions in the Palaeozoic rocks. The nearest analogy for the
carboniferous fossils was the osseous genus Placodus of the Muschelkalk, though it
differed in microscopic structure.

 amination under the microscope witii a power of ^th, I found one of them extensively
 ornamented with elegantly ramifying figures, not much unhke coralloid bodies. After
 perusing Mr. Morris's paper, Ann. Nat. Hist., Aug. 1851, and comparing the figures

on my fish-scale with those seen in many of the Belemnites from the chalk at Nor-

 wich, I feel persuaded that the figures on both are due to the operations of the same
 tribe of parasites, and I consider that the dissimilarity in their form is suflScient to

warrant my concluding that they are the workings of different species.

     Unlike the borings in the Belemnite, which run in straight lines, and frequently
 inosculate, those in the fish-scale proceed with a graceful curve to their extremities,
terminating in a symmetrically-formed dilatation or cell, and they do not frequently

 inosculate.

    I have with some care endeavoured to measure the calibre of the borings, and I
believe that it ranges from a 3000th to a 4000th of an inch in diameter. Conceive,
 then, the infinitesimal tenuity of the organism that formed them. 1 propose calling

                 On the Lowest Fossiliferovs Beds of North Wales.

   By J. W. Salter, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of Great Britain,

    The great interest always attaching to the search for the oldest types of animal
life, has lately been revived by the zealous researches of M. Barrande of Prague,
who has discovered and announced in various communications*, a succession of
faunas in the Silurian region of that country. The earliest fauna is marked by the
presence of peculiar genera of Trilobites, not found in any of the succeeding forma-
tions. Such are in Bohemia Paradoxides, Conoceplialus, Sao and several other

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

genera of the Olenoid type, together with species of Agtiostus.

   A rare Orthis, a Pteropod, and two Cystidece, are all the other forms this naturalist

has discovered, after many years of patient labour, in his region C.
   The publication by Angelin in the ' Palaeontologia Suecica,' of a considerable number

of Trilobites, confirms these views, and shows the same genera, Paradoxidea, Cono-
ceplialus, and for the most part ^gnostus. to be confined to the lowest members A. B.
of the Swedish system, and with them are the long-known species of Olenus and the
 GraptoUtes of the lower alum slates.

   In 18.51, M. de Barrande paid a visit to this country for the express purpose of
comparing the Bohemian fossils with many unpublished forms of this country. He
recognised with great pleasure that the " Lingula fag " (discovered by Prof. Sedg-
wick to form the lowest fossiliferous zone in North AVales t) was a most satisfactory

--equivalent of this lowest stratum C.
   Lingula Flags. As all the fossils from these strata collected by the Geological
Survey have now been examined, it is thought it will prove interesting to put them
upon record, previousl}' to their fuller publication in the Memoirs of the Survey.

   The beds in question are largely developed in Merionethshire and Caernarvonshire,
appearing sometimes in the form of fine thin-bedded sandstones, and at others of beds
of black slates interstratified with coarse sandstone and conglomerate. In Me-
rionethshire they appear at the base of a great igneous sei'ies, described by Messrs.
Jukes and Selwyn as 1.5,000 feet thick, and the fossil beds alternate with these volcanic
strata throughout their whole extent, at least the Livgula Davisii, which is the cha-
racteristic fossil, is found from the base nearly to the top.

    In the lower part, or the true Lingula flags, the Lingula Davisii is associated with

Olenus micrurus, a new crustacean Hymenocaris hereafter mentioned, and fu-
coids : higher up no fossils have been found except the Lingula Davisii ; and at the
top, but still distinctly in the igneous series, Lingula still occurs, probably of the same
species, but associ;ited with an Asaphus, a Calyviene, and some GraptoUtes.

  For the lower part of this series, which I feel sure M. de Barrande would alone con-

   One of the most interesting fossils is a large Faradoxides, probably P. Forchham-
meri, Angelin ; but most unfortunately the exact locality in North AVales has not
been preserved, though there is great probability it comes from the ' Lingula Flags.'

   In the higher beds, near the upper limit of the igneous series, Prof. Sedgwick and
myself gathered in 1843 the following fossils.

                                                                 also found Lingulae at

    Lastly, at Llanfaelrhys near Aberdaron, South Caernarvonshire, in beds which both
by position and mineral character appear to be the ' Lingula Flags,' although sepa-
rated by great dislocations and obscured by drift, the following fossils occur.

   Asaphus Selwynii, n. sp., mentioned before.

    Lingula atteniiatal

                 , broader species.

    Didymograpsus Murchisonce, and
    Graptolites incisus ? or a new species.
   In all these, except the first list, some doubt may be entertained whether the strata

may not more properly be classed with the second division, the 'etage D' of M. de

Barrande. 'i'he genera Asaphus and Calymene certainly would indicate it. There
is every reason to believe that the Asaphus Selwynii is the same species as one common
in the lowest Llandeilo flags of Shelve in Shropshire, and as such it is considered.

   Therefore, if the zoological demarcations, which are of so much value elsewhere,
hold good in England, it would he proper to draw the line between the fossils which
occur at the base, and those near the top of the igneovs series.

    Professor Phillips has described a formation of black shales occurring at the base
of the Silurian series in the Malvern Hills, which is characterized only by small Tri-
lobites, and these of the genera Olenus and Agnostus; they are Olenus humilis, Phill,

btBoides, Wahl. ? f. 3 (0. spmulosiis ?, Pliill.), and Jgnostus pisiformis, Wahl. Brongn.

t. 4. f. 4.

It is quite possible therefore, as suggested by M. de Barrande himself, that these

shales may be identical with the black slates of Sweden, and belong to the PUage C.

It should however be observed, in conclusion, that Agnoatus in England is ge-

nerally characteristic, not of the first, but of the second zone or true Llandeilo flags
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

known ; that, in the probable equivalent of the ' Lingula Flags ' in S. Caernarvon-

shire, an Asaplnis, the Didymograpsus Murchisona, and perhaps Lingula attenuata,

occur ; that the genus Cruziana, the fucoid described below, is characteristic of beds

in Normandy *, which lie nearly in the place of our Caradoc sandstone ; and that Hyme-
nocaris, the new genus here proposed, belongs to a group of Phyllopod Crustaceans

not hitherto described from strata older than the Upper Silurian. Taking all these

circumstances into account, it would, I think, be premature to pronounce as to the

separate and distinct character of our own lowest fossiliferous zone; and it may

perhaps be necessary hereafter to modify the conclusions drawn by so able and suc-

cessful an observer as M. de Barrande as to the primordial and isolated character of

his earliest fossil group                                                                                                     it may be a local, and not a general phenomenon.
                                                                                                                           ;

It will be borne in mind that the lowest fossiliferous zone in England and Wales

is not quite the oldest known. The purple and green schists of Wicklow in Ireland

contain Zoophytes or Bryozoa {Oldhamia antiqua and 0. radiata, Forbes), and they
have been determined to occupy a similar place with the " Llanberis slates and Har-
lech grits " of Prof. Sedgwick, which underlie the ' Lingula flags,' and which in Wales

and Shropshire are void of fossils.

                    Notes on the New Forms above mentioned.

   I append a short description of the new genus Hymenocaris, and the new species
of fucoid, Cruziana, from the ' Lingula Flags.'

                                                                                                                              Hymenocaris, new genus.

                                                                                                                                                                       ;

--two pairs, short and not visibly jointed ; abdomen as long or longer than the carapace,

of 8 [or probably 9] transverse segments, the last with short unequal appendages.

MSpecies 1. Hymenocaris vermicauda, Salter, Records us. Pract. Geol. ined.

There are four, and may be more appendages to the last segment ; for one crushed

specimen shows two of them, a short and a long one on the dorsal part of the seg-
ment, and two others toward the ventral edge; and it is impossible to say how they

may have been arranged.

The number of segments to the body is also not quite certain, though nearly as

above stated. One specimen shows the 8 anterior, another the 4 or 5 posterior ones and

the appendages. The antennae ? too, are 3 appendages, two longer than the third,

proceeding from the front of the carapace : they show no trace of joints.

The genus is evidently related to the living Nebalia, and diflers markedly from

Cerutiocaris, M'Coy, by the entire convex carapace, not bent along the dorsal margin.

It has, too, a neck furrow running all along the posterior edge. There are no traces of

eyes on the exterior of the carapace. The crust was very thin.

             On a few Genera of Irish Silurian Fossils.
By J. W. Salter, F.G.S., of the Government School of Mines.

                                                         Crustacea.

   Among the many new and interesting forms of Trilobites described by Colonel

Portloclv ill his work on Londonderry and Tyrone, a small species of Asaphus was
recorded from the Lower Silurian of Tyrone, which he named A. latifrons, distin-
guishing it from some other species by the breadth of front included within the curve
of the facial suture. The species is very remarkable for the position of the eyes,
which are placed very far backward and inward, so as to be close to the base of the
small and narrow glabella. This peculiarity of habit is associated with some other
characters which will remove the species from Asaphus, to which, nevertheless, it is

closely allied. It has also some relations with lUcenus.

                                            Stygina, new genus.

Gen. Char. Body ovate and rather flattened. Head and tail large and tolerably
   equal, body of 9 rings. Eyes small, placed far backward and inward, near the
   base of the glabella, which is quite indistinct above, and much contracted below.

    Facial suture marginal along a wide space in front, and below the eyes curved

  outwards, and ending on the posterior margin. Angles of head mucronate. No

   rostral thield. Hypostome ? Axis of body narrow. Pleura without a furrow.

   Tail smooth with a moderately long axis.

   The flattened oval form, long axis to the tail, and head spines, very "much re-
semble Asaphus *, from which the 9 ungrooved pleurae effectually distinguish it. In
the obliteration of the glabella, number of body-rings and course of the facial suture,
it is closely allied to Illcenus, from which its habit differs so much ; but there is enough
of the under side preserved to show that there was no rostral shield, an essential cha-

racter of Illcenus.

   The narrow axis and the smooth extremities of this species, as well as the apparent
absence of eyes in the middle of the head, render it very probable that we have
here a second species of the genus. The facial suture, too, as far as it can be traced,

agrees with that of Stygina.

   The Chair of Kildare,.an interesting isolated patch of Llandeilo flags, discovered
by Mr. Griffith, contains in some parts of the limestone swarms of a minute Trilobite
belonging to the great group of the OlenidcB, but referable to no published type. It
will soon be figured and described in Decade 7 of the Memoirs of the Geological Sur-
vey. In the meantime the characters may be defined as follows :

                                  Cyphoniscus, new genus.

Gen. Char. Body oval and very convex; head large and gibbous; body of 7 seg-

ments ; tail minute. Head half-elliptical, the glabella occupying the greater part

of it     glabella  broadest  in  the  middle,  oval,  and  inflated,  without  lobes                      neck-
                                                                                                        ;

       ;

furrow distinct; cheeks bent steeply downwards, with nearly parallel sides, rather

broadest below, the posterior angles square. Eye-line marginal in front for a space

equal to the breadth of the glabella, then running in an oblique line down the cheeTc,
and cutting the exterior margin very obliquely some distance in advance of the pos-

terior angle. Eyes (minute linear '!) very forward ; free cheeks narrow and linear.

Thorax convex, the axis prominent, and the fulcrum of the pleurae near it. Pleura

   * One species o{ Asaphus, described by Portlock, A.rectifrons, exactly resembles our genus
in the wide marginal extent of the facial suture in front, and in the want of a vertical suture
on the under side. But the eyes are in the usual position, and the blunt extremities and
broad obscure axis show that this species is a true Asaphus, though probably not of the section

Isotelus.
--60 REPORT 1852.

    deeply furrowed, their ends rounded or truncate. Tail small, the axis short of 1
    segment, the sides without furrous.

    The position of the very minute eyes is indicated by a slight indentation opposite
the front of the glabella ; they must have been linear and small, for there is no visible
elevation or appearance of an eye-lobe. In this respect there is some difference be-
tween the form under description and the North American genus Triarthrus, to
which it is, nevertheless, most closely allied. In both genera the eye-line takes the
remarkable course above described, viz. in an oblique and almost marginal line from
the front to the outer edge of the narrow cheeks, and the furrow which runs along
the posterior margin of the cheeks in both genera turns upward towards the termi-
nation of the facial suture. Triarthrus, too, has the ends of the thorax segments
rounded or square, not pointed and recurved as in other Glenoid genera. But the
present genus differs in the gibbous form and inflated glabella without lobes, as well
 as in the fewness of the segments of the thorax, 7 instead of 15 or 16.

Species 1. C. socialis, n. sp. Length about a quarter of an inch. Locality. Chair of
    Kildare, in Lower Silurian.

                                                   Acidaspis, Murchison.

    Of this remarkable genus, one new Irish form has to be added to the list. It was
formerly (Mem. Geol. Surv., vol. ii. p. 1. pi. 9. fig. 5) considered by me the same
 with A. hispinosus, M'Coy, a species distinguished by the possession of two spines
 on the neck. Many species are now found to have this character. The original
 one, described by Prof. M'Coy, is a minute species with a remarkably inflated
 glabella, and a sinuated front. It is from the Chair of Kildare.

    The new species, of which good specimens occur in Waterford (Lower Silurian),
 has a wide and somewhat depressed head, with a straight front, and the glabella
 lobed, and not inflated. It will be figured and described in Decade 7 of the Me-
 moirs of the Geological Survey as A. Jamesii.

                                     ^glina, Barrande. Cyclopijge, Corda.

    This genus, proposed by Barrande to replace the name ^gle, which he formerly
 bestowed on it, exhibits the greatest proportional development of the eyes known
 in the group of Trilobites. They occupy the entire side of the head to the exclusion
 of all other parts of the cheeks, and meet in front (as in the case of many insects,
  especially of the male sex). In this respect Remopleuridcs of Portlock is the only
 genus that can be compared with it; the genus under notice, however, has the eyes
 greatly more developed, and with large lenses quite visible to the naked eye ; few
 body segments, and a rounded tail. The genus must for the present be placed near
 Asaphus. Two or three species are known in Bohemia, all Lower Silurian.

    A new one, yS. mirahilis, has been found at Portrane, Dublin ; and the same, or an

  allied species, in Anglesea and South Wales. It will be figured shortly in Decade 7,

 Mem. Geol. Survey.

                                                     Remopleurides, Portlock,

     As this has just been quoted, it may be well to say, that perfect specimens of R.
  dorsospivifer, Portlock, will also be figured with the above. The remarkable dorsal

  spine, detected by the discoverer of the genus, is very likely a character peculiar to
  the male sex, and it is more than probable that jR. Colbii is the female of the same
  species. Such appendages characterize the male sex in Sphceroma.

      In the Ranopl. dorsosphiifer, the possession of this spine, on the 8th segment, is
  accompanied by a general narrowness of form as compared with R. Colbii, but besides
  this, there is no available means of distinction. Col. Portlock had himself suggested,
  that two or more of these forms might prove to be varieties of one species, and in
   this, after careful examination, I fully concur. Again, except in the possession of
  the lateral appendages (which might be expected in the mature ovigerous female),
  and in a still greater breadth of form, R. laterispinifer does not differ from

  the two above mentioned. And hence these three forms may be respectively regarded,

  as the male, and the young and mature female forms of the same species. While
  suggesting this as probable, and supported by general analogy among the Crustacea
  and other articulate tribes, it would not be advisable to alter the names originally

   given.

is another example of this dorsal appendage. Several of the species that have

been described show something of it when perfect. A fine series of the C. megalops,

M'Coy, from Dudley, in the collections of Messrs. Gray and Fletcher, have in each
specimen a strong spine projecting from the 6th segment, which is the same segment
in which they occur in the recent Sphteroma.

   Encrinurus punctatas, a common Trilobite, has similar spines on the 7th and 10th
thorax segments. Brontes sp'm'ifer, Barrande, and Sao hirsuta, ibid, have short

spines on every segment.
                                                        MOLLUSCA.

   The collections in Kildarehave also yielded a new and very interesting Cephalopod,
of a group common in North Amei-ica, but not in this country. The genus Lituites in
America contains a group of closely-coiled species, the whorls being thicker than
broad (instead of broader than wide, as usual in the genus), the siphon internal, and
the septa waved backwards on the peripheral margin. They are distinguished as the
genus Trocholites. One of these species, the Lituites (T.) planorhiformis, Conrad,
was found by Prof. Sedgwick and myself at Bala, North Wales. The septa in that

have but a very slight backward curvature on the outer margin. A second species,

from the Chair of Kildare, is different from either of the American ones. It is
easily distinguished by the great depth of the backward curvature of the septa, form-
ing a complete sinus. It may be called

                                                 Lituites hibertiicus, sp. nov.

Diameter ^ihs of an inch, thickness nearly half an inch. Whorls 4 (or 5), their
   thickness much greater than the breadth. Umbilicus rather deep. The inner whorls

   much covered by the outer. Surface with faint lines of growth, nearly smooth.

   Septa rather approximate, and with a deep peripheral sinus.

              Pterotheca, new genus.

   I wish to propose the above name for a remarkable Pteropod mentioned in the
Report of the last meeting of the Association as occurring in Canada, Ireland, and
Wales. Of this beautiful fossil, originally described from a Tyrone specimen as a
smooth Brachiopod, better specimens have been obtained in N. Wales, which show
it to have been an animal closely allied to Cleodora, btit distinguished from it and all
allied forms now known by an extraordinary expansion of the sides or wings of the
shell. The cavity for the animal is a compressed triangle, as in Theca, Cleodora, and
others of the order ; but the dorsal lamina is much elevated above the flat ventral

one, and the sides are furnished with a wing-like expansion almost to the curved tip.

Notice ofa Skeleton o/" Mastodon angustidens ybwwd near Montopoli.

                            By Dr. Vallini.

   The countr}' of Montopoli is situated on a group of small hills of the pleiocene de-
posit, which extends north-eastward beyond the Arno, toward the Val di Rievole,
and south-eastward connects itself with the meiocene tracts of the Val d'Elsa, Val
d'Era, &c. The hills consist for the most part of masses of yellow sand, deeply
excavated by the strong action of water. The sands are often rendered coherent by
calcareous cement, and from point to point diversified by gravels of eocene origin.
The shells of moUusca lie in different planes, and most plentifully in the lower part of

the deposit.

   The bones of the Mastodon were found by Dr. Vallini at the depth of about two
feet, in the excavation for a drain, and levelling of a small hill in the south-east part

of the country of Montopoli. In general they were found in the sands simply indu-
rated, but from place to place in a species of conglomerate of sand and shells cemented

by carbonate of lime. AH were found on the bedding surface of a sandy bed, mostly

arranged with reference to their anatomical relations, and surrounded by marine
shells, such as Peeten pleuronectes, Ostrea deniiculata, 0. lamellosa, Cardita pecli-

nata, Venus leevis, V, islaiidicoides.

   The author described minutely the situation of a long chain of dorsal vertebras in
their natural order, directed from north-east to south-west, and connected with the
bones of the pelvis ; at the opposite extremity of the vertebral series, a large tusk, and
near its base the lower maxillae, one still i-etaining a molar, the other showing the
alveolar cavity. Great part of the cranium was found lying a short distance to the
east of the parts already described. To the north-west lay the right femur, and
other bones of the leg of the same side ; and, two metres removed from the western

extremity of the tusk, the left scapula.

A minute description of the dimensions of the bones was appended. The tusk was

in length 2-57 metres; its basal diameter 0-17, at the upper end 0-075. There were

20 ribs, mostly preserving their connexion to the vertebral column ; the longest 0-88

long, and 0-035 broad. Antero-posterior length of scapula 0-33; its height 0-47.

Length of the acromial spine 0-60; its height 0-14. Breadth of the acromial ex-

tremity 026; of the articular cavity 0-14. Length of the ulna 0-60. Diameter of its

humeral extremity 0-28 ; of its carpal extremity 0-13. Len<;th of radius 0-58. Length

of femur 0-87. Breadth from the summit of the articular oall to the trochanter 0-32.

On the Geology of a Portion of the Himalaya Mountains. By Major

     ViCARY of Wexford. Communicated by Sir Roderick I. Murchison.

  A coloured section from the plains in the neighbourhood of Umballa, towards the

flanks of the Himalaya above Subathoo and near Simla, showed that all the formations,
from the youngest tertiary of the tract to the ciystalline rocks of the chain, are in
highly dislocated positions, some of the younger deposits appearing to underlie others
of prior date, probably through the occurrence of powerful faults. Some of the
younger tertiary beds with pebbles and fos.sil bones (the Sewalik strata) are inclined
with the older or nummulilic rocks, and are probably therefore of higher antiquity

than was supposed. Sir R. L Mm-chison passed a warm eulogium on the author,

Major Vicary, a brave Irish officer, who, in the wars of Scinde and the Punjaub, had
sometimes, even in face of the enemy, collected materials which had advanced geological
science, and specially adverted to a most magnificent assemblage of nummulites and

associated fossils, which were about to be described in a separate work by M. D'Archiac.

On the Geology of Saint Ives, Huntingdonshire, and its Neighbourhood.
                                By J. King Watts.

The principal formations in the neighbourhood are the upper greensand, the

gault, and the Oxford claj', with great quantities of drift gravel and sand in certain

localities. The upper greensand is however but ill defined, being only occasionally

met with, as near Woodhurst and at Needingworth, and then but to a small extent.

The gault formation is well defined, and is in some places of great thickness. All

the elevations and hills near this town are composed of it The lower greensand

is seen outcropping in patches a few miles distant, as between Elsworth and Hilton,

and also between Over and Willingham. There is a beautiful outcrop and elevation

of this formation at Haddenham some miles off on the road to Ely, being a further

continuance of the line. The Oxford clay extends to a considerable distance

southward, and a great part of the district towards Fenstantou, Hilton, and Coning-

ton is of this formation. The drift gravels and sand are found in many places

immediately under the top soil ; in some places very coarse, and at others as fine

as quick-sand. In some of those drifts occurred good specimens of Echinus,

many Belemnites and OstrecE, much water-worn. The above-mentioned range of

gault hills are well defined and interesting. At the westward end of the range near

the town, the  gault  passes downward  apparently  to  a great  depth                              and  at  this  place
                                                                                                ;

many Ammonites, Gryphaa, Belemnites, Hamites, and Terebratula are found. The

Ammonites occur of various sizes, some very small, and others weighing many

pounds. Belemnites have been found upwards of a foot in length. This ridge trends

eastward towards Somersham, and about 2 miles from St. Ives towards that place, is

a district of rich land, called St. Ives Heath, which was formerly part of the royal

forests, but disafforested in the reigns of Henry II. and III. This heath was in by-

gone times of celebrity, on account of its medicinal spring or spa, and an establish-

ment formerly stood there for the use of invalids who resorted there for the waters.
An interesting account of the water in the above-mentioned spring was published in

the 56th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, by Drs. Layard and Morris. It

is to be regretted that this spring should have been choked up and destroyed. Fol-

lowing the range of hill, which now turns eastward, we arrive at the cutting on the

Wisbeach and St. Ives Railway, in the parish of Bluntisham. In this cutting iron

pyrites were found in great abundance, a great quantity of selenite, and specimens of

Ostrea and Belemnites, The elevation proceeds on to Holywell, and there breaks off,

the river running below.

On the opposite side of the river, in the parish of Over (Cambridgeshire), is a con-

tinuance of this ridge of low hills, and the Cambridge and St. Ives railway cuts

through the southern side thereof. In this cutting a great variety of fossils were found,

many smooth nodules crystallized within, and large boulders of hard sandstone.

In this cutting, at a considerable depth, was found a large Ammonite, and 17 ver-

tebrae, and a paddle of a species of Plesiosaurus ; and also one vertebra of another

Saurian, which were forwarded to Prof. Owen.

    Ow the Eshers of the Central Part of Ireland. By R. Young, C.E.

    After having described the peculiar character of the country between Dublin and
Galway, and the absence of mountain chains, the sluggish character of the streams, the
immense tracts of bogs, the numerous gravel pits, and the enormous stretch of carboni-
ferous or mountain limestone ; the author went on specially to take up and discuss the

--phsenomena invariably associated with the district gravel, diluvium and bogs. Like

Mr. Griffith, he attributed the growth of the bogs to the gravel hills and diluvium, which

acted as barriers to the free discharge of the drainage from the land, and caused in some
cases extensive lakes, of which we have many evidences in the marl beds and callow

--lands along the Shannon, Suck, Brusna, &c. He divided the diluvial i-idges of the coun-

try under two distinctive forms : 1st, the gravel hills, which, he said, are sometimes
confounded with eskers, from their bearing at times a resemblance to them in form and
composition, though their character is distinct, and which seem to have been thrown

--down from agitated water, as there is little appearance of stratification ; and 2ndly,

the eskers proper well defined, narrow ridges of pure gravel or blue-water gravel

which, when not washed through by pent-up waters, can be distinctly traced, many
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

for 20 or 30 miles, and which, when they traverse a flat country, bear a striking resem-
blance to a railway embankment. Tlicy are invariably found to consist of water-worn
limestone, gravel, associated v/itli boulders botli of limestone and sandstone, also much
worn, and sand without clay. The larger boulders are generally arranged in a bed at
the bottom of the ridge, the interstices often filled up with a marly stalagmite, the
gravel and sand-beds lying above them. Mr. Young went on to describe some
remarkable peculiarities with regard to the form and direction of the eskers, and con-
cluded by stating it as his opinion, in common with others, that the drift had its
origin in the sea currents and eddies, at the same time pointing out on a map which
he has constructed the probable direction of the currents across the depressed tract
between Galway and Dublin, when the country was submerged .500 feet.

On the Development of Ferment Cells in the Warm- Water Flax Steeps.
                     By Professor Allman, 3I.D., M.R.I.A.

The author described a peculiar cellular growth which invariably accompanies the
process of flax-steeping by the warm- water or patent method of Mr. Schenk. It is

strictly analogous to the cells which are developed during the alcoholic fermentation,
and first shows itself in the flax-steeps a few hours after the commencement of the
steeping process, in the form of isolated cells of a nearly spherical figure containing
minute colourless granules, but without any decided indication of a nucleus. These
cells rapidly multiply by a process of gemmation, and ultimately form dichotomously
branched groups which collect on the surface of the steep in the form of a thick
yeasty head. The very peculiar and characteristic odour which accompanies the
process of flax-steeping, appears to be exactly coincident with the formation of the
cells, and to go on increasing with their multiplication.

   The cells appear by their presence to determine in the fluid a peculiar fermenta-
tion, and the consequent decomposition of the intercellular substance which holds
together the fibre of the flax stem, a process which, however generally confounded
with common putrefaction, must nevertheless be carefully distinguished from it.

On a Microscopic Alga as a Cause of the Phenomenon of the Coloration of
     large masses of Water. By Professor Allman, M.D., M.R.I.A.

   It appeared, in little conglomerated gelatinous-like masses, and, when submitted to
the microscope, it was found to consist of a number of fronds. The younger fronds
were nearly spherical, and consisted essentially of a central mass of transparent ge-
latinous matter, surrounded by a crust composed of minute cells, containing a green
colouring substance. The crust being much slower in its growth than the internal
nucleus, it soon burst, and the nucleus then, by an apparent spontaneous action, as-
sumed a regular form, not unlike an hour-glass, which soon separated into two distinct
fronds. Some of them being put into a glass tube, and placed in the window, were
observed to arrange themselves in a mass on the side of the tube opposite to that

              Remarks on the Flora of the South and West of Ireland.

                  By Professor Balfour, M.D., Edinburgh.

   The communication on this subject contained the result of a three weeks' tour
just completed with some of his pupils in the southern and western districts of
Ireland, viz. in the counties of Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Galway. The floras of
these districts belong to Professor E, Forbes's Armorican and Lusitanian divisions
       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                          65

the former containing plants resembling those of Cornwall and Devonshire, and the
French coast at Normandy ; the latter having plants resembling those of Portugal
and of the Asturian division of Spain.

   The mountains of the south and vsrest of Ireland, although some of them
attain an elevation of upwards of 3000 feet, were not found to exhibit an alpine or
Scandinavian flora like the mountains of Scotland. The few alpine species seen
were chiefly Silene acaulis, Draha incana, Dryas octopetala, Saxifraga nivalis
and stellaris, Saussttrea alpina and Polysticlmm Lonchitis. Some of these appear
at much lower elevations than they do in the mountainous districts of Scotland.
The flora resembles in many respects that of the westera coasts and islands of
Scotland. This is shown by the prevalence of such plants as Cotyledon Umbilicus,
Osmunda regalis, Hypericum, elodes, Pinguicula lusitanica, Eufragia viscosa, Ulex
nanus, Anthemis nohilis, Hymenophyllum Tunbridijense and H. Wilsoni. But in ad-
dition to these, there are many peculiar species. The prevalence of Saxifraga
umhrosa^ with its varieties serrati.folia and punctata, as well as Saxifraga Geum, S.
elegans, S. hirsuta, S. hirta, and S. affinis, tend to give a marked character to the
flora of the south-west ; and in the Connemara district. Erica mediterranea, E. Mac-
Jcaiana and E. ciliaris, along with Dabcecia polifolia and Eriocaulon septangulare,

give a remarkable character to that flora.
   The Cork flora has been fully given in a work published by Dr. Harvey at the

time when the British Association met in that town. Dr. Balfour's party noticed on
the sides of the Glanmire river, as well as at Aghada, a species of Hypericum, pro-
bably Hypericum anglicum of Fries, which had not previously been recorded in Ire-
land. The plant abounds in that part of the county of Cork, and appears to be in a
wild state. At all events, if it has been introduced, it has become completely natu-
ralized. On the roadside near Monkstown, Cork, there was observed profusion of

Petasites fragrans, apparently wild. In Killarney, the prevalence of Trichomanes
radicans, Lasfrea Thelypteris and Lasirea Faenisecii, was remarked, as well as Pin-

guicula grandifiora. Arbutus Unedo, and Orobanche Hederce.
    In the large island of Arran there was seen abundance of Adiantum Capillus Ve-

neris, Spiranfhes autumnalis, Sesleria ccerulea, Alsine verna, and a peculiar form of

Saxifraga hypnoides. On the limestone of that island were found many plants
which are common in the trap districts of Scotland.

On the Distribution of the Marine Algee on the British and Irish Coasts, with

Byreference to the Influence of the Gulf-stream.        Professor Dickie, M.D.

There are forms of marine Algse generally admitted to be characteristic of our

northern coasts, and others of the southern. The present remarks have reference

to those generally deemed of southern type; that is, those usually more or less

abundant in low latitudes, and on the other hand absent from high latitudes. Such

--species, natives of our coasts, may be classed under three heads : first, those con-

fined to the southern parts of Great Britain and Ireland ; second, species of more

extensive range, since they extend to the north of Ireland and south-west of Scot-

land ; third, those found abundantly in the south of England, and ranging along the
western coasts of both islands, as far as Orkney and Shetland ; and the species com-

prehended under these three heads, and amounting to at least twenty, are, so far as

Aknown at present, absent from a certain part of the east coast of Scotland.  con-

siderable proportion of them reappear in Shetland and Orkney. The marine vege-

tation in those northern islands in some respects resembles that of the north of

Ireland, though there is a difference between them of from four to five degrees of

latitude. The marine vegetation of some of the north-eastern counties of Scotland,

intermediate in latitude, is of more boreal character.

The drifting of tropical fruits, &c. to the western and northern parts of Britain

and Ireland, is a proof of the course and presence of the Gulf-stream ; the develop-

ment of southern forms of Algaa at the extreme northern parts is a proof of the
same, and an indication of its influence in reference to temperature. Are we to

consider their absence from certain parts of the east coast of North Britain as

owing to a lower sea temperature than in localities where they exist ? The portion

of the coast in question is precisely that which, from the generally understood

course of the Gulf- stream, may be least exposed to its influence. Investigations

respecting the temperature of our seas are, however, still desiderata, and without
 such, an important modifying element has been overlooked having reference to the
climate of the British islands.

  Notice of a Monstrosity o/'Bellis perennis. By Professor Dickie, M.D.

    Each capitulum was surrounded by an involucre of the usual form; the recep-
tacle (as in a well-known variety of the plant) supported numerous secondary
capitula, each having an involucre of three to five pieces, and enclosing generally
three, five, or six imperfect flowers, most of which seemed reduced merely to open
carpellary leaves, and attached to some of them there was an imperfect ovule. The
secondary capitula were either sessile or stalked, and the same was true of the car-
pellary leaves. This vaiiety presented therefore a remarkable example of arrest of
development, the flowers being reduced to imperfect carpels with or without rudi-
mentary ovules.

     Remarks on the Altitudinal Ranges of Plaints in the North of Ireland.

                           By Professor Dickie, M.D.

   The observations were made on Slieve Donard, in county Down, attaining an
elevation of 2796 feet, JVTuckish and Erigal in county Donegal, the height of the
former being 2190 feet, of the latter 2450 feet, and Nephin in the north-west of
county Mayo, its elevation being 2639 feet. Neither of these mountains present
the same richness of vegetation seen on many of those in North Britain. Only one
of them, namely, Slieve Donard, comprehends the upper part of the Mid- Arctic zone
of Mr. H. C. Watson, lying between 3000 and 2000 feet. Only six species attain
the summit of Slieve Donard, three being Monocotyledons, and three Dicotyledons

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

six of the former and twelve of the latter were found on the summit of Muckish
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

Erigal has on its comparatively narrow summit four Monocotyledons and seven Di-
cotyledons ; on the summit of Nephin were observed four of the former and eight of
the latter ; there are only two species common to all the summits, viz. Festuca
vivipara, and Vaccinium Myrtilliis.

   The upper limits of 39 Dicotyledons and of 32 Monocotyledons were carefully
measured. It might have been expected that in general the species noted would
have the upper and lower limits of each respectively, obeying the usually understood
law. Instead of which, it appears that their natural upper limits are, with a very
few exceptions, lower in the North of Ireland than in North Britain.

   The lowest limits of plants usually found at high elevations were next examined,
and those of 20 species in Ireland compared with their recorded lowest limits in
different parts of North Britain ; frorn which comparison it appears that the lower
limits in Ireland are generally much lower than in Britain. It may be stated, in
other words, that in Ireland, with a climate generally mild, plai^.ts usually growing
in the low grounds do not rise so high upon the mountains as in North Britain
with a less favourable climate ; and plants usually growing at high elevations,
descend lower in Ireland than in many parts of North Britain.

Morphological Analogy between the Disposition of the Branches of Exogenous

Plants and the Vetiation oftheir Leaves. By the Rev. Professor M'Cosh, 3LA.

The view which the Professor took of the morphology of the plant might be regarded

as an extension, in the same direction, of the theory of Goethe. According to this

theory, all the appendages of the axis of the plant, including leaves, bracts, sepals, pe-

tals, stamens, &c., are formed on a common plan, of which the leaf may be taken as

the type. It had occurred to him (Dr. M'Cosh) that we may regard the branches

the plant as constructed on one model throughout. Speaking in this paper of reticu-
lated leaved plants, he showed that there is a correspondence between the disposition
of the branches along the axis and the distribution of the venation of the leaf.

    (1.) In some plants the lateral branches are disposed prett)' equally along the
axis, whereas in others a number are gathered together at one point, and the plant
becomes verticillate or whorled. Now, he found that wherever the branches are
whorled, either the leaves of the plant, as in the rhododendron, Jlchemilla alpina,

common barberrj', broom, laburnum, marsh trefoil, or the veins of the individual
leaf, as in the common sycamore, Akhemilla vulgaris, currant, gooseberry, guelder

rose, geranium, maple, are also whorled.

   (2.) When a leaf has a petiole, the tree has its trunk unbranched at the base (as in

the case of the sycamore, apple, &c.), and when the leaf has no petiole, the trunk

--is branched from the root, as in our common ornamental lawn shrubs the bay

laurel, holly, box, &c.

   (3.) He proceeded to show further, that the angle at which the branches go off
from the axis is the same as that at which the side veins go off from the main veins.
His observations during the past summer had been chiefly directed to this point.
He made the measurements by means of a graduated semicircle with a moveable

index. In these measurements he took the angle formed by the main lateral branches
with the axis, and by the main lateral veins with the midrib. The angle of the
veins of the leaf is easily taken. It is more difficult to determine the natural angle
of the branches, inasmuch as the direction of the branch may be altered by a variety
of circumstances, as by winds, its own weight, &c. Still, there is evidently a normal
angle for each species of plant, which may be ascertained by taking the average of

a number of measurements of a freely growing branch. He had measured in all

about 210 species of plants, and found the angle of the branch and of the vein to

correspond. He produced a tabulated statement of these 210 plants, and called

the special attention of the Section to several of them, as under the letter A.

through Unear-leaved and monocotyledonous plants. In conclusion, he remarked,
that these views, if substantiated, would aid in giving us the true science of the mor-
phology of the plant, and in particular show that there is a unity of design in the
skeleton of the plant, similar to the unity of design which has been discovered in the
skeleton of the animal frame. Possibly they might also help to determine the di-
rection of the vital forces as operating in vegetable organisms ; they would certainly
make us better acquainted with what Humboldt would call the physiognomy of each
species of plant, and furnish some additional marks to distinguish genera and species,
and, what was to him especially interesting, enable the student of natural theology
to make successful use of the plant, to illustrate the order which reigns in the uni-

verse.

              On the Transmutation of ^gilops into Triticuin.
                 By Major Munro, 39^/* Regiment., F.L.S.

The origin of all our domesticated animals is still considered by the most cele-

brated naturalists to be unknown, and this is the opinion very generally held with

regard to our principal cereal grains also. The difficulty may possibly have arisen

from looking for an animal or plant bearing too close a resemblance to their culti-

vated descendants. Mythology, hitherto considered an amusing dreamy account of

early history, may come to our aid in this matter also, and lead us, in the fable of

Ceres and Triptolemus, to Sicily as the birth-place of our much- valued grain, wheat.

Certain it is that at different periods it has been believed that some species of
^gilops is the origin of our wheat, the produce of some of the numerous varieties

of the cultivated Triticum. It has also been stated, that the inhabitants of the

neighbourhood of Mount ^Etna used to collect the seed of the JEgilops ovafa which

grows there wild, as food. It is a small insignificant-looking plant, but from a

series of specimens produced to the meeting, it does not require any great stretch of

imagination satisfactorily to trace the gradual alteration the plant assumes in its

various advances towards the state which is commonly called Tonselle wheat. The

still greater external change from bearded to smooth w^heat, and the very extraordi-

nary looking forms called Egyptian and Abyssinian wheats (Tritiaim Polonicum and

composit um) , take place under our own observation daily, especially in cultivating
wheat in India from English and Egyptian grown seeds. M. Esprit Fabre seems

most satisfactorily to have proved that both ^gilops ovata and triaristata pass acci-

^.dentally into  trificoides, and thence into Triticuin. His experiments, as detailed and

illustrated in a pamphlet edited by M. Felix Dunal, appeared to have been carried

on most carefully and regularly for twelve years, commencing in 1838. For seven

3'ears the plants were raised in a garden surrounded by a wall, and for five years as

a field crop, producing an average return with -other wheats grown in the neigh-

bourhood. M. Fabre had no favourite idea to illustrate and enlarge upon, and no

object apparently in his experiments but the interests of science, and was so badly

provided with books, that he had only one, and that certainly a very good one,

Decandolle's jF7ore Francois. He therefore details minutely the gradual change which

took place after each successive sowing in this remarkable progress oi^gilops ovata,

about six inches high, with its brittle head, shedding, as soon as ripe, its few, one to

three, perfect hairy seeds, into good wheat three feet high, producing from each

lasting head often 100 and upwards perfect, almost smooth seeds, remaining in

the spikes till removed by the hand of .man. In proof of the correctness of these

observations, M. Dunal has forwarded a very interesting series of specimens to

England. Still the fact, it is but right to state, is doubted by some botanists, and
especially by him who is considered by almost every naturalist as Botanicorum

facile princeps. The objections appear scarcely sufficiently strong, and the difficulty

of procuring ripe seeds ofJEgilops into England has hitherto prevented some minute

inquiries into the internal structure of the seeds. In making conclusive experiments

in cultivation, it will be necessary first to procure the shoot or varieties of jEgilops

ovata. which is called triticoides, and not simply to cultivate the jEgilops ovata,

which might go on for years reproducing itself without variation. All gardeners

in seeking to produce double flowers carefully collect the seed from the best semi-

double ones.

Fully persuaded, in conformity to the opinion of most botanists, that Tritimm
                               ;

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  69

and ^gilops are identical as a genus, and that M. Fabre's experiments are fullj' to be

depended upon, there is no reason to adopt the notion, that this really very curious
but not unnatural change oi JEgilops into Triticum proves the little value of modern
genera, and leads us to expect that oats can be changed into rye, and wheat into

barley- The latter has been asserted as a fact, and may possibly have taken its origin
from the circumstance, that in 1817 Hordeum trifurcatum or JEgicerus was intro-
duced as Nepal wheat ; but it was soon found to be a real barley, and it may pos-
sibly have been thought that the climate had changed the wheat into barley.

    It certainly is very difficult to define what is a genus, at the same time the beauti-
ful order of God's works in general indicate that he has made some divisions or
groups which naturalists and others call genera, within the wide range of which
species may wander, but beyond which they cannot go. To three such different ge-
nera do wheat, barley and oats belong, and they never will be altered by cultivation

from the one into the other.

   It may be interesting to add, that the observations of a very large number of

monstrosities in abnormal states in grasses (some quite as curious as the one the

subject of this notice), plainly show that there is always a tendency in grasses to
elongate their axis, and increase the number of the flowers in the spiculse, and
never to become fewer-flowered, which would be the case if wheat or oats ever be-

came barley.

TJm Black andGreen Teas of Commerce. By Professor Royle, M.D., F.R.S.

    It was a remarJcable fact, that the subject of the difference between the black and
green teas had been, until recentljs a matter of great uncertainty. The Jesuits, who
had penetrated into China, and Mr. Pigou, were of opinion that both the black and
green teas were produced from the same plant ; while Mr. Reeve believed that they
were manufactured from two distinct plants. Now, as regarded himself, he (Dr.
Royle) had adopted the view that the best kinds of black and green tea were made
from different plants ; and examination of tea samples seemed to confirm that view,
but a repetition of the experiment had not done so. Mr. Fortune, subsequent to the
China war, having been sent out to China by the Horticultural Society of England,
made inquiries on the subject. He there found the Thea bohea in the southern parts
of China employed for making black tea ; and in proceeding as far north as Shanghae,
he found the Thea viridis used in making green tea near the districts where the best
green tea was made. So far, therefore, the information obtained seemed to confirm
the view of two different species of Thea being emploj'-ed to make the two different
kinds of tea ; but Mr. Fortune, in visiting the district of Fokien, was surprised to find
what he conceived to be the true Thea viridis employed in making hlach tea in di-
stricts near where the best black tea was made. He took plants with him from
Fokien to Shanghae, and could find no difference between them. It was still, how-
ever, desirable to get specimens from the district where the black and green teas or
commerce were actually made, and this had latterly been effected. In consequence
of the great success which had attended the experimental culture of tea in the nur-
series established in the Himalayas, Mr. Fortune was again sent to China by the
East India Company. He proceeded to the northern parts of the country, in order
to obtain tea seeds and plants of the best description, as the most likely to stand the
Himalaya climate. Mr. Fortune procured seeds and plants in great numbers, and

sent them to the Himalayas, where they had been since cultivated. When he had
reached Calcutta, the tea manufacturers whom he had brought with him made from

plants in the Botanic Gardens their black and green tea from the same specimens

so that it was evident it was the process of manufacture, and not the plant itself,
that produced the green tea. All now who were acquainted with the difference be-
tween black and green teas, knew that they could be prepared from the same plant
without the assistance of any extraneous materials, though it was a common thing

for manufacturers to use indigo, prussian blue, turmeric, &c. in colouring the tea.
Dr. Royle showed specimens of the Black Tea plant from the Woo-e-Shan, and of

the Green Tea plant from the Hwuychou districts. No specific difference could be

observed between the two specimens.

On a peculiar Annelidun Larva. By Prof. Allman, M.D., M.R.I.A.

The author described a minute Annelidan larva, which he obtained in abundance

in a small towing-net in July last off the coast of the county of Cork. It is vermi-

form, and swam about with great activity, the locomotion being chiefly effected by

the aid of ciliated discs, which are borne on the fourteen segments which imme-

diately succeeded the head. Each disc carries a pencil of very long vibratile cilia,

and four such discs are carried by each segment.

The disc-bearing segments are followed by about twenty others much smaller

and destitute of discs. The terminal segment is encircled by a wreath of very long

cilia. Dorsal and ventral oars are present on all the segments. The dorsal oars

carry cirriform branchial appendages densely clothed with minute vibratile ciha.

The seta- are largely developed ; and in each pencil of setae carried by the disc-

bearing segments there are two stronger and longer than the others, denticulated

Aand beautifully iridescent.  pencil of very large and beautifully iridescent setae

Ais borne by the head.  prominent ridge on the upper surface of the head is set

with thread-cells. The mouth is situated on the inferior surface of the head. The

alimentary canal is straight, dilated into a large sacculus in each of the fourteen

large anterior segments ; in the smaller posterior segments the canal presents but

slight dilatations.

The little larvae were preserved in a phial of sea-water, and after about a week

were seen to be transformed into minute Annelides, nearly resembling Nereis. Their

death shortly afterwards prevented all subsequent observation on their development.

On the Universality of a Medusoid Structure in the Reproductive Gemma:
  of the Tuhularian and Sertularian Polypes. By Professor Allman,

   M.D., M.R.I.A.

   In this communication it was the author's object to show that the Medusoid
structure was not confined to the free locomotive gemmje of the Tubularian and
Sertularian Polypes, but that a similar structure was also possessed by the fixed
capsules of the TuhuluridcB, and by certain fixed organs found in the ovarian vesicles
of the Sertularidoe ; that the Tubularian and Sertularian Polypes therefore produced,
by a process of gemmation, fixed as well as free Medusae, the real office of both being
apparently the production of ova by a true sexual process.

   In the marine Tnhularidce, the capsular bodies which contain the ova consist of a
closed vesicle whose walls are composed of cells, and having a hollow peduncle pro-
jecting into it from the point of its attachment to the Polype-stem, the cavity of the
peduncle being in direct communication with the general cavity of the polypary.
The hollow peduncle here manifestly represents the stomach of a Medusa with the
mouth ])ermanently closed, and the vesicle only requires to be open anteriorly, to
complete its resemblance to the bell-shaped disc. The system of gastro-vascular
canals, which in the ordinary Medusae radiate from the stomach towards the margin
of the disc where the)' intercommunicate by means of a circular vessel, arc, it is
true, here wanting, and the abseijce of this part of the medusan organization may
at first sight appear to invalida'e the view here taken. That the absence of the ra-
diating canals in the marine Tubuhirid^hoyiever affords no real ground for objection,
is proved by Cordylophora, their freshwater representative.

    In this curious genus, the reproductive capsules, altogether homologous with those
of Tubularia and its marine allies, present a well-develcped system of branched tubes
communicating with the base of the peduncle and extending forwards in the walla
of the capsule. These tubes will easily be recognised as the true equivalents of the
gastro-vascular canals of the IWeduste, and at once complete the series of homologies
between the fixed sacs of the Tuhvlaridce and their locomotive medusoid gcmm».

   The contents of these sacs are either bodies presenting all the characters of true
ova, with the germinal vesicle, and in many instances the germinal spot, and ex-
hibiting the phn:noraetion of yelk- cleavage and the subsequent steps in the develop-
ment of the embryo, or else they present no appearance of ova and are merely com-
posed of a multitude of minute corpuscles, endowed in some cases with independent

motion, and which are most probably spermatozoa. The ova-hke bodies are there-

fore true ova, and the bodies developed from them (sometimes polypoid embiyos,

but most frequently resembling the "Planulffi" of Sir J. G. Dalyell) are the product

of a true sexual process, and not, as has been asserted, mere gemmae or bulbillse.
   In the Serf idaridce medusoid bodies have been witnessed by many observers to

escape from the " ovarian vesicles" of Campanularia, and swim freely away ; while

Loven and Lister have observed similar tliough less completely developed medusoids

expand at the mouth of the vesicles of this genus, discharge their ova, and then

wither avvay without ever becoming free. Besides these gemma of obvious medusoid

organization, certain more or less globular bodies are commonly seen in the interior

of the vesicle clustering round the fleshy axis, and described by various observers as

eggs. In these so-called eggs of the Campunularice, however, the author has de-

tected a medusoid structure quite as manifest as in Tuhularia. Each of them is in

fact a fixed Medusa, either developing within it true ova which present a distinct
germinal vesicle and germinal spot, and undergo the process of yelk- cleavage, when
they finally escape as "Planulae ;" or else, as it would appear in some cases (though

this will require further observations for its confirmation), containing spermatozoa.

  Among the Sertularinm no case had hitherto been observed of the production of

anything resembling Medusa-buds, The author has however found the axis de-
veloped in the interior of the " ovarian vesicle " of Sertulnria argentea into a medu-

soid body, which, tliough permanently fixed, presented medusoid structure more

highly developed than in the fixed sacs of the Campanularix and Tttbularidce ; the
peduncle of this Medusa terminated by an open mouth, and the disc was also

open ; the gastro-vascular canals were present ; the ova appeared to be developed

in .the walls of the peduncle.

The facts recorded in the present communication were believed by the author to

be the only ones wanting to harmonise the singularly discrepant observations of the

several trustworthy zoologists who have made these polypes their special study.

   By a careful collation of these (acts, and those already established by independent
observers, the following conclusions may be obtained :

   1. That the Tubularian and Sertularian Polypes are in their young state either
" Planulee " or solitary naked polypoid larvae (" Actinulse ").

   2. That both " Planulae " and " Actinulae " are embryos proceeding from real ova,

the result of a true sexual process.

   3. That these ova are produced in all cases by a proper medusan structure, how-
ever masked this structure may be under the form of a fixed ovisac.

   4. That the free medusoids are not embryos, but buds, and that they are destined,
probably in all cases, as we know them to be in some, to produce ova by a true

sexual process in a manner similar to what takes place in the fixed sacs.

5. That every ? species of the Tubidaridts and SertularidcB therefore produces by

gemmation two kinds of polypes, one hydroid and destined for nutrition, the other

medusoid and destined for sexual reproduction.

6. That the medusoid polypes are either fixed or free, the fixed with a more or

less masked medusoid structure discharging their ova in the immediate vicinity of

the  parent  stock                            and the free  with  a highly developed medusoid structure  and  fur-

nished with active powers of locomotion, by which they are enabled to carry their

ova to a distance, and thus provide for the diffusion of the species.

On a singular Locality chosen for its Nest by the Black Red-Start (Sylvia
                Tithys). By Martin Barry, M.D., F.R.S.

  At the railway station in Giessen, Hesse Darmstadt, in May 1S52, it was found

that a bird had built its nest on the collision spring of a third-class carriage which had
remained for some time out of use. The bird was the Black Red-start {Sylvia Tithys) ;
and the nest contained five eggs. The discovery was made by the " Wagenmeister,"
Jacob Stephanij, who humanely desired his men to avoid as long as possible the run-

ning of that carriage. At length, when it could no longer be dispensed with, the car-

riage was attached to a train, and sent to Frankfort-on-the-Maine, distant between

thirty and forty English miles. At Frankfort it remained for six-and-thirty hours, and

was then brought back to Giessen ; from whence it went to Lollar, distant four or five
English miles, and subsequently again came back to Giessen, having been kept awhile

at Lollar ; so that four days and three nights elapsed between the bringing of the car-
riage into its use and its last return to Giessen. Stephanij, now finding the nest not

to have been abandoned by the parent birds, and to contain young ones, which he

describes as feathered, removed it from the carriage to a secure place of rest which

he had prepared, saw the parent birds visit it, and visited it from time to time himself,

until  at  first  three  and then  the other  two  young  birds had  flown                              none remaining  at
                                                                                                     ;

the end of four or five days. Now, while the carriage was travelling, where were the

parent birds ? It will hardly be said that they remained at Giessen awaiting its return,

having to examine by night as well as by day hundreds of passing carriages in order

to recognise it ; the young birds in their nests quietly awaiting food (!) There seems

little doubt that, adhering to the nest, one, at least, of the parent birds travelled with

the train. Nor, when it is remembered how gently and how slowly an enormous

--railway carriage is pushed into connection with a train, how gradually a train is

--brought into full speed, and how equable the movements are upon a railway, will it

appear incredible that at such a time a parent bird should continue with its nest, that

nest being quite concealed, and containing young. Not until after the above was

written did the author of this communication become acquainted with the important

fact, that while the carriage in question was at Frankfort, as well as during its short

stay at Friedeberg, on the way to Frankfort, the conductor of the train saw a red- tailed

bird constantly flying from and to the part where the nest was situated in that parti-

cular carriage. Is further evidence required that a parent bird did indeed travel with

the train ?

   This interesting species is well known on the west coast of Ireland ; Bundoran
is the most northern locality recorded in Professor E. Forbes's work on the Echino-
dermata ; it has, however, a more extensive range. Mr. Hyndman observed it at
Tory Island ; it has been found by the Rev. Mr. Gallagher in the Bay of Dunfanaghy,
and in July last 1 saw it at Malin Head, county Donegal. It may possibly occur
on the east coast of Ireland, since I found a specimen cast up at Carrickfergus,

of the spines and the habits of this species ; they are generally well-developed in
proportion to its size, and sections of them, viewed under the microscope, present
appearances of greater strength and density than similar preparations of the spines
of Echinus sphai-a, though a much larger species. The following are the results of

Pennant, Bouchard, Gervais and Van Beneden, and Thompson), and those of Medi-

terranean individuals to S. Rondeletii. It will be seen that we have both these species

in the British seas. Owing to the distinctive characters having been entirely over-

looked, it is impossible now to say which kind was intended by British authors who

an odd fish, crouching generally at the bottom like a toad, with its great goggle-eyes

half-closed, and sometimes crawling along by means of its suckers, puffing the

water through the funnel all the time. When it does take to swimming it darts
very quickly through the water and is difficult to catch. When taken out of

the water and placed on the hand, it had recourse to an odd mode of progression,

turning two or three somersaults in regular tumbler fashion; first laying hold

with its arms, turning over, and laying hold again until it managed to get back into

the water. In this species, too, the tentacular arms generally lie concealed within

--the others." Dr. .Tohnston remarks of it, that " although kept alive in a basin of

sea-water for about twelve hours, and repeatedly irritated, it never ejected any inky

fluid, with which it is, nevertheless, amply provided." It is probable, as has already

been remarked, that the majority of British localities of Sepiola relate to this species.

nation two specimens of Sepiolm as possibly distinct. His sagacity did not deceive

him in this, any more than in many other similar instances ; for one of these little

     Catalogue of the Shells found in the Alluvial Deposits of Belfast.

                               By John Grainger.

   The greater part of the town of Belfast is built upon alluvial deposits of sand and
silt. These depositions extend far into the bay, and are extensively exposed at low

water, reaching to Holywood upon the county Down side, and to Whiteabbey upon

that of county Antrim. The localities which were most investigated were the em-
bankments raised for the two railways which run along the sides of the bay, and the
cuttings made during the progress of the harbour improvements. The embankments
of which the railways consist are formed almost entirely of the sand and silt raised
on the spot, and leaving numerous shallow excavations. The cuttings, however, made
to afford a straight channel instead of the old tortuous course of the tidal river pre-
sented shells from much deeper levels. They extended to the depth of nine feet from
low-water mark, and eighteen from that of high water. It affords an example of the im-
portance of seizing opportunities for prosecuting scientific researches, presented by
the progress of altogether different operations, when we consider that these places
will never again be accessible to inspection, the channel being now filled with water,

and the railways traversed by continually passing trains. All these localities pre-

sented vast numbers of shells, which appeared rather scattered everywhere throughout
them, than lying in regular beds. This, together with the fact that the same species
were found at almost every depth, made it impossible to observe levels to which the
species could be said respectively to belong. The shells, no matter at what depth

found, were all of recent species ; thus fixing the whole formation of one geological
age. In addition to these localities may be mentioned the foundations of the town
generally ; the whole affording a range of about twenty feet in the vertical. Eighty

species were enumerated. Of this number not one is extinct ; five a^e not now living

in the bay ; seven occur so sparingly that they can scarcely be called inhabitants of
the bay, but are rather occupiers of some very limited spot in it ; while the great ma-
jority of the remaining seventy species dwell at the distance of several.miles from their
ancient stations, although the latter are still under water. Thus six per cent, of the

former occupants of the harbour have left it, while nine per cent, appear in the fair

way of doing so. The shells Vv'hich occurred in the beds in the greatest numbers

were those of the edible MoUusca.

--Dr. Mathib Hamilton read a paper " On the Lobos Islands." Along the sea-

board of Peru and Bolivia, within the Tropic of Capricorn, countless numbers of

aquatic fowls exist, v\-hich live on fish, and whose excretions are exceedingly fertilising.

In some localities, the number of guanos is enormous, so that when alarmed by dis-

charges of fire-arms, or otherwise, they rise from their nestling places in such masses

as cannot be supposed by those who have never seen these birds darkening the air

like a cloud. Guano producers change their habitation when continuously disturbed,

but they do not permanently leave a locality which has long been frequented by them,

in consequence of a temporary alarm ; for, in such a case, they soon return to their
old haunts, and totally abandon them only when teased by lasting annoyances.

On a Peculiar Organ which occurs on some of the Marine Bryozoa, and
  tvhich appears to indicate a Difference of Sex. By the Rev. Thomas

   HiNCKS, B.A.

   Some of the marine Bryozoa are furnished with a curious intertentacular organ,

first noticed by Dr. Farre in his paper on the ciliobrachiata. It consists of an ob-
long and somewhat "flask-shaped" body, which is placed between two of the arms,
and attached to the tentacular ring. It; has a wide orifice at the top, round which
there is a play of cilia. The neck is somewhat constricted. The interior cavity is
lined with cilia. The organ becomes narrow towards the base, and is closely united
to the sides of the tentacles. It is constant in its position, and (in Memhi-anipora)
is always situated on the same side as the anal orifice. At times it is seen to be ex-
tended considerably, and to change its form.

    It was observed by Dr. Farre on the Memhranipora pilosa and Alcyonidium gela-
iinosiim (Johnston), but he was unable to determine its function. I have also met
with it on the Cyclouiii papillosum (Hassall), and I can find no record of its occur-
rence on any other species but the three which I have named. It is possible, how-
ever, that it may not be confined to these, for it is commonly present on very few
individuals, and might readily escape observation. Dr. Farre states that he was
unable to detect any flow of fluids through it, nor could he ascertain with what parts
the cavity in its interior might communicate. At most times nothing is to be seen
but the regular and constant play of cilia within it and around the orifice. But in
spring I have met with individuals furnished with the appendage, in which Sperma-
tozoa were present in immense quantities, and have witnessed their expulsion from
the cell through the intertentacular organ. In one instance, when examining the
Memhranipora, I observed a mass of the Spermatozoa moving upward from the lower

part of the visceral cavity. On reaching the base of the organ, which I have described.

--76 REPORT 1852.

they were drawn into it, and carried through it by the action of the cilia lining the
interior, and were then ejected and borne oflF by the tentacular currents. This ex-
pulsion went on for three or four minutes, during which time the active filaments
were streaming up from the lower part of the cell. After awhile a single sperma-
tozoon only made its appearance occasionally, and at last none were to be seen. The

ciliated intertentacular organ, then, communicates icith the visceral cavity, and is at

certain seasons the channel through which large quantities of Spermatozoa are ejected
and diffused through the su7Tounding icaier.

   Similar observations were made on the Cycloum. I have never met with Sper-
mato:Loa in any individual which was not provided with the organ (and I have ex-
amined hundreds), while in those which possessed it, they were frequently present

at the proper season in astonishing profusion. The organ occurs on comparatively
few individuals. This has been ascertained by a careful examination of great numbers

at different seasons of the year.

   With the facts now related before us, there can be little doubt that the interten-
tacular organ of the Memhranipora, Alcyonidium, and Cycloum marks a difference of
sex. It characterizes the male individuals, and is a special provision for the expulsion
of the Spermatozoa, which are produced in great profusion in a few of the cells, and
being thence diffused through the surrounding water, are drawn in by the tentacular

currents of other individuals (female), and so fertilize the ova.

   A separation of the sexual organs has also been observed in some of the freshwater
Bryosoa, but I am not aware that any of the latter are supplied with the interten-

tacular organ.

            Researches into the Structure of the Ascidiaiis.

   By Thomas H. Huxley, F.R.S., Assist. Surgeon R.N.

   The author stated that he was desirous of laying before the Section an account of
some investigations into the structure of the Ascidians which he had been led to
make while endeavouring to form a catalogue of those contained in the collection of

the British Museum.

The Ascidians, varied as they are in external appearance, present certain general

anatomical uniformities, which are capable of being represented by a diagram. To

such a hypothetical structure thus represented, the author gives the name of the

Archetypal Ascidian. From this every actual form can be shown to be derived, by very

simple laws of modification. The author particularly desired it to be understood

that he attached no other meaning to the term Archetype than that thus defined.

It has been a matter of dispute which is the dorsal and which the ventral side of

the Ascidians                                                               there can be no question, however, that the heart is upon one side of
                                                                         ;

the axis of the body, and that the nervous ganglion is upon the other ; to avoid all

ambiguity therefore, the author proposes to speak of the " hsemal " and of the
" neural " eides, in accordance with the nomenclature proposed by him in a

memoir ' Upon the Homologies of the Mollusca,' read before the Royal Society.

The Ascidian Archetype differs from all others in the following points :
   1 The intestine is always flexed towards the haemal side. In the Polyzoa it is

flexed towards the neural side, as pointed out by Professor AUman.

2. The tentacles are small, while the pharynx is very large, and serves as a respi-

ratory cavity, its parietes becoming perforated. The author combated the view that
the " branchial sac " of the Ascidian answers to the tentacles of the Polyzoon, or to

the united gills of the Lamellibranchiate Mollusk ; in opposition to the former view,
he endeavoured to show that the tentacles of the Polyzoa are represented by the

tentacles of the Ascidians; and against the latter, he urged, that the gills of the
Bivalve Mollusk have no representative in the Ascidian. The " branchial sac " of

the latter, represents not the gills of the Mollusk, but the perforated pharynx of

Amphioxus                                                          an analogy which has already been noticed by many observers.
                                                                ;

The author brought forward the structure of the peculiar genus Appendicularia,

as fatal to the view that the branchial sac of the Ascidian is homologous with the

united tentacles of the Polyzoa.

   Especial attention was directed to the formation of what the author termed the
" Atrium," under which term he included the cloaca and the space between the
branchial sac and the " third tunic " of writers. The author endeavoured to show
                          --;

                    TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.               77

that it answers to the mantle-cavity of ordinary moUusks ; that its excessive de-
velopment accounts for the presence of the " third tunic " in the Ascidian, and

that Savigny's comparison of an Ascidian to an inverted Patella had very con-

siderable justice.

The author next proceeded to detail many structural points of interest which he

Ahad made out in the genera examined.  minute account was given of the structure

of the branchial sac in Boltenia, Cynthia, Phallusia, Syntethys, and other genera.
The branchial meshes are always true apertures, generally more or less rectangular

or oval in shape ; but in one species described they were arcuated or semilunar, so

as to give the appearance of spiral vessels in the branchial tissue.
   The structure of the dorsal folds and of the " Endostyle," a structure first noticed

as distinct by the author in his memoir upon the Salp<B, was minutel)^ described

and the singular and characteristic variations in form of the peculiar organ of sense

-- --the " tubercule anterieure " of Savigny were pointed out.

   The " Tubular System," described in the same memoir as a peculiar and unique

organ in Salpa and Pyrosoma, was shown to be the form of hepatic organ proper
to, and universal among the Ascidians.

   The reproductive system exhibits remarkable and hitherto little noticed pecu-
liarities, which have led the author to distinguish the simple Ascidians into Mono-

thalamous and Dithalamqus groups, the section Styela (Sav.) being the type of
the latter. Owing to the discovery of a Marsupial Cynthia, that is, of one whose ova

pass through all stages of their development in the Atrium of the parent, the

author was enabled to lay some interesting embryological facts before the Section.
The Cynthia in question has the appearance of a compound form; it does not,
however, become multiplied by gemmation like the true compound forms, but the

originally free, tailed larvae, adhere and become firmly united before the withering
away of their appendages. The mass is therefore an aggregation of distinct indi-
viduals, not one individual represented by many Zooid forms.

The development of the muscular tissue of the tail was described, closely resem-

bling that of the muscles of the tadpole as given by Kolliker.

   With respect to the structure of the test of the Ascidians, the author stated that
he had verified in many new cases the discovery of the presence of cellulose in large
quantities therein made by Schmidt, and extended by Lbwig and Kolliker, and by

Schacht. In other points, the author's results differed somewhat from these of

these writers ; and after pointing out what he considered to be the true structure,

he drew particular attention to the essential identity of the test of the Ascidian with

true bone (if for the calcareous salts cellulose be substituted) on the one hand, and
with vegetable tissue on the other. The physiological distinction betweeit plants

and animals, which authors have endeavoured to draw, upon the ground that the

Ascidians do not form cellulose, but only take it from plants, seems incompatible
with the circumstance made out by the author, that the Ascidian larvae contain cel-
lulose while they are yet a mere mass of cells contained within a structureless mem-

brane, and totally without any organ, except the tail.
   The author endeavoured to show that the Ascidians might be divided into natural

groups, by considering :

    1st, The arrangement of the organs with regard to the axis, whence the animal
may be symmetrical or asymmetrical, according to the relative development of the
neural and heemal regions, and of the branchial sac ; and,

   2ndly, The nature of the tentacles and of the reproductive organs.

   In conclusion, the author stated that the Ascidian type appeared to be sharply
defined from all others, nowhere exhibiting any transition forms.

On a New Species ofAcaleph from Belfast Bay. By George C. Hyndman.

   Dr. J. D. Marshall exhibited specimens of the " Bonaparte's Gull," " Sabine's

Gull," " Little Auk," and some other fowl, all shot in the neighbourhood of Belfast.
The specimen of "Bonaparte's Gull," he mentioned, had been called after the Prince

of Canino ; and is the only one hitherto shot in Europe, having been obtained in the
Lagan in 1848. It is at present in the Belfast Museum.

On the Geographical Distribution of Animals in connection loith the Progress

          of Hitman Civilization. By William Ogilby, F.L.S.

   The author treated his subject in a very popular manner, and pointed to the less
civilized nations of the world, as being so from the absence of animals capable of do-
mestication. America and Australia were the great types of this deficiency. The
following conclusion of his paper will give an idea of the general argument and style.
"Let us now examine the facilities which the natives of Europe, Asia, and Africa
possessed for developing civilization compared with those of America and Australia.
The former had those great collaboratevrs in their social progress, they had the horse,
the ass, and the camel, for beasts of burden ; and they had the sheep, the ox, and the

--goat, for food and a thousand other useful purposes. The consequence of this was,

that, at a very early period at a period of which there are few authentic historical

--documents extant the nations of Western Asia had advanced in civilization to an

extent which is now only beginning to be thoroughly understood and appreciated.
The researches of such eminent men as Dr. Layard into the antiquity of Assyria and
Egypt, prove this beyond question ; and show that those nations had advanced to a
power which in modern times has scarcely been equalled, and that we are only now
in the same state with regard to civilization that they were three or four thousand
years ago ; whilst the less fortunate inhabitants of America and Australia would be
obliged, by the want of those facilities possessed by the former, to remain in their

original condition for eternity."

                          By Wyville T. C. Thomson.

   Mr. Thomson's remarks were confined to the pointing out of some of the most re-
markable peculiarities in this very numerous class of zoophytes. He described their
appearance and the circumstances under which they are found ; and exhibited bottled
specimens of most of the species found along the Aberdeenshire coast. With regard
to the specific distinctions of those species, he conceived that the standard of classifi-
cation hitherto adopted was by no means a safe one. As an instance of this he referred
to the Seriularia I'osacea and Serlidaria margarita, which had been described by na-
turalists as belonging to separate species ; but on recent and minute investigations it
hasbeen found that there is no specific distinction between them, and that they belong
to a third, Serfularia pinasta. He suggested that, instead of the ovigerous vesicles
being regarded as the principle of comparison in determining the species, the stem and
general skeleton should be adopted as being more fixed and invariable.

        On a Neio Effect produced on Muscles by the Electric Current.
                          By Dr. E. du Bois-Reymond.

  Last spring. Dr. Bence Jones of London, whom I am proud to call my friend,
published a short abstract of my Researches in Animal Electricity. To those who
TRANSACTtONS OF THE SECTIONS.  79

have perused this little volume, the name of the electrotonic state of the nerves will
be familiar. I have ventured so to call the altered condition of the nerve which is
induced by any electric current pervading any portion of it, however short, and
which denotes its presence by a most strilving change in the electromotive action of
the nerve. The nerve, when in its natural state, produces electric currents accord-
ing to the law of the antagonism of the longitudinal and transverse section, the
former one being positive, the latter negative. The nerve, when iu the electrotonic

state, in addition to its usual electromotive action, produces electric currents accord-
ing to tlie law of the voltaic pile. Every portion of nerve, however short, acquires
an electromotive power such as to produce a current in the direction of the exciting

current. This new condition of the nerve begins and ends as soon as the exciting
current itself. I have endeavoured to account for it in the following way. The
ordinary nervous current I consider as being produced by peripolar groups of dipolar
electromotive molecules. According to Grotthuss's well-established theor)', the ex-
citing current may decompose these groups, so as to make all the dipolar molecules
turn their positive poles in that direction in which the current goes. If it be ad-
mitted that this new arrangement extends with decreasing regularity over the whole
length of the nerve, all the phsenomena of the electrotonic state of the nerves could

easily be explained.

   In the second volume of my large book, I have stated that the muscles do not ex-

hibit the phaenomena of the electrotonic state. Indeed no change of the electromo-
tive action of the muscle is perceived, when that portion of it which extends beyond
the ends of the galvanometer is submitted to a constant electric current. Neverthe-
less, I have succeeded in discovering a mode of action of the electric current on the
muscles, which undoubtedly corresponds to that action of the current on the nerves

which I have called their electrotonic state.
    If a muscle, while in the state of life, is submitted to a strong electric current, of

any kind whatever, and if directly afterwards it be placed in the circuit of the gal-
vanometer, the very portion of it which was comprised between the electrodes is
found to have acquired a new electromotive power, such, indeed, as to produce] a
current in the direction in which it was pervaded by the extraneous current. This
new electromotive power is the greater according to the intensity of the extraneous
current. It rapidly decreases so as to become insensible after a certain lapse of time,
the length of which, of course, depends on the original amount of the electromotive
power induced, as well as on the sensitiveness of the galvanometer employed.

   This new effect produced on muscles by the electric current is quite different from
that which was discovered b)^ Peltier, who found that muscles, when for a long
time exposed to an electric current, acquire an electromotive power in the contrary
direction to that in which they were pervaded by the current. These two effects,
that observed by Peltier, and that now denoted by myself, both coexist, so as partly
to counterbalance each other. But the contrary electromotive power, induced in
muscles by electric currents, is analogous to that which is engendered by passing a
current through metallic electrodes irnraereed in any electrolytic liquid. On the
contrary, the electromotive power, which keeps the same direction as the current
by which it was induced, owes its origin to the peripolar groups of dipolar electro-
motive molecules in the muscles being decomposed by the current, and the dipolar
molecules having their positive poles turned with more or less regularity in that
direction in which the current goes.

    The electric current, therefore, acts in the same way on both nerves and muscles,
viz. it decomposes the peripolar groups, and forces the dipolar molecules into a
certain arrangement different from the natural one. In the nerves this preter-

natural arrangement extends on either side of the portion submitted to the current,
and even, though with decreasing regularity, over the whole length of the nerve,
but it vanishes as soon as the exciting current itself. In the muscles, on the con-
trary, the preternatural arrangement does not extend to any sensible degree beyond
the portion immediately acted upon by the exciting current ; but, instead of it, the

arrangement continues to prevail a certain time after the exciting current has ceased.

Hence it appears that the production of the new electromotive power in a nerve
and that in a muscle, by means of an electric current passed through their substance.
--80 REPORT 1852.

bear to each other a similar relation as the production of magnetism in a bar of per-
fectly soft iron and that in a bar of steel, by means of an electric current passed
through a coil surrounding the bar. Suppose, indeed, that a current be passed
through a coil surrounding a very short portion of a long bar of soft iron, the bar
will directly prove magnetic in its whole length, only the intensity of its magnetic
force will decrease from the coil to the two ends of the bar. As soon as the circuit
of the coil has been broken, the bar would be found quite bare of any magnetic power,
provided the iron be perfectly soft ; in making the experiment, however, there will
still be some magnetism left. Again, suppose that the same coil were placed in the
same manner on a similar bar of steel, instead of soft iron, then its action would
not extend over the whole length of the bar, only the very portion surrounded by
the coil, and those placed in its immediate neighbourhood, would become magnetic;
but in this case they would remain so even after the circuit of the coil had been
broken.

    This diiference in the magnetic phsenomena elicited in steel and iron by the electric
cuiTent, philosophers are in the habit of ascribing to a coercitive force possessed by
the former substance, by which force the magnetic fluids are prevented from moving
freely so as to require a certain amount of force to be separated, and to remain so
afterwards ; or by which force, to speak in accordance with Ampere's theoiy, the
molecules surrounded by currents, on which the magnetic phaenomena are admitted
to depend, are kept in the positions in which they once have been put by any pre-

vious action. It therefore may be concluded, that with respect to the mobility of

their electromotive molecules, the muscles and nerves differ from epch other in the
same way as steel and soft iron ; or that the muscles possess a coercitive force which
prevents their electromotive molecules from moving as freely as they seem to do in
the nerves.

   This statement appears the more important, as I had hitherto not succeeded in
pointing out any essential difference between the electrical pheenomena of muscles
and nerves. Yet such a difference ought to exist, if any relation be admissible be-
tweer the electrical phsenomena of muscles and nerves, and their other vital properties,
which present such striking discrepancies.

                       On the State of the Mind during Bleep.
                        By Richard Fowler, M.D., F.R.S.

   What is the state of the vital and mental forces during sleep, dreaming, trance,

asphyxia, coma, compression of the brain, intoxication ?
   The body of an animal is its coil ("mortal coil "), and this, like a federative re-

public, of which the brain coil is the chief, is composed of a congeries of coils (organs
of sense, glands, &c.), and, above all, of a muscular apparatus so adjustible as to
enable the mental force to form it into coils for occasional purposes, for expression
by speech and gesture, execution of works of art, &c.

    In its waking state, the mental force has indirect perception of the adjustments
of the muscles by the muscular sense, rendered more sensitive by the blood accom-
panying every retransmission to the muscular and nervous fibres.

    The mental force has, in addition to perception and volition, a power to modify
the adjustments induced by sensations and conceptions. It has its sense of buoyancy
 and fatigue from the different degrees of compression felt on the sentient extremi-

ties of the muscular nerves, hence the idea of power. Hume challenged the as-
 sertors of our having an idea of power to adduce the impression from which it may

 be inferred ; and here is an adequate impression.
    That mind and vitality are forces, is ascertained by the resistance they can oppose

 to all the physical forces, to those of gravitation and motion, by mounting a hill or
 swimming against a rapid stream, by the heavier weight sustained by a living than

substances. Dead fishes are disintegrated by being frozen ; but Sir John Franklin's

six hours. Men have resisted the effects of temperature which roasted and boiled

butchers' meat.

presence of the coil ensures the presence of the force, and the more perfect the coil

the stronger the force (coil for atmospheric electricity)*.

 --When asleep, our coil is like a drum unbraced, or harp unstrung unadjusted,

whether for sensation or action. But what is its state when we dream ? Then

some of our organs retain such a state of tension as to be excited by impressions or

conceptions, and impressions upon vital coils induce definite adjustments (probably

by retransmission). If the lips of a comatose patient be rubbed with a spoon before

its contents are put into the mouth, the adjustments of deglutition are so accurately

Howmade as not to risk suffocation. It is thus intelligible.      suggestive touches

induce retransmissive adjustments, by which sleepers, the blind and deaf (feeling

by the touch), are enabled to interpret the meaning of others ; and questions to
persons asleep are suggestive of the adjustments by which they are answered. This

is analogous to the suggestive effects of questions in ordinary conversation, but still

more palpably of leading questions in courts of justice.
   The less the relaxation of tension (as in the morning) the more vivid the dream.

Our belief in our dream (as in the diorama) is not contradicted by objects outside.

     When conceptions are vivid, such as belong to the passions, they produce retrans-

--missions to the parts to which the conceptions belong.
   Again That the adjustments required for sensation are the same as those by

--which conceptions are formed, is proved by various cases--by the experiment of

Banks t by the murderer, suffering from remorse, having always the image of his

murdered child before him.

   It is contrived by Benevolence, that like adjustments induce like conceptions.

Many repetitions are required to form accurate conceptions. And we must do to

know, for it is not wetill have done that we get the conceptions which form the
painter, sculptor, orator, singer, &c. Sir J. Reynolds says, that it was not till he

had been at Rome a year, that he began to appreciate the works of Raphael.

  We know how vibrations induce definite diagrams. Thus are also definite adjust-

ments induced, and thus identity is recognised, by the likeness of this object to our

previous conceptions of it.
    Unadjust the coil, and the force disappears. This is the sleep of the coil, not of

the force. In man, who is, as we have said, a congeries of coils, they do not all

sleep.

     Feeling in the body, and conception from abiding adjustments of past sensations,

are the instructive interpreters of new sensations. Thus the conception of a ship

near to us, interprets the perspective appearance of a distant sail. Every known

Apart is suggestive of its whole.  conception already in the mind retransmits such

adjustments to the ear, that it interprets the sound of the words sung in music.

(Men "walking in darkness." Chant.) ·
   Some persons seem to live in a dreaming state, unadjusted by attention. They

do not observe what is passing ; for we must look to see, listen to hear, &c. Their

impressions and conceptions induce no definite adjustments, and adjustments are, to

the perceptive mind, signs of thought.

   In profound sleep, we are not aware of more than suspension of consciousness,

and are without dreams. In what, \hen, does this differ from death but in time ?

force acting as physical forces do, each through the medium of its appropriate coil,

   Where, then, is mind, when its mortal coil is perishing in the grave ? Where are
the physical forces when the instruments which they actuated (the.pendulum of a

clock, a steam-engine, a voltaic trough, or a Leyden phial) are broken ? Gravita-

tion, motion, heat, and electricity do not cease to exist. They existed before their

coils were invented, and will continue to exist when this earth and all material or-

ganized structures shall have ceased to exist ; and that this will be the condition of
the mind, we have abundant reason to expect. It is the mansion, not the tenant

that is changed. Mind may still live as distinct from flesh and blood, which is

sustained by food, as is the swimmer from the flood.

On the Misapplication of the terms Evolution and Development, as applied
   by Ethnographical Philologists to the Inflexions of a Language. By
   Richard Cull, Felloio and Hon. Sec. of the Ethnological Society.

This paper is more of a critical character than fraught with new facts, as indeed

its title conveys. Philologists speak of a language developing its inflexions, or

having its inflexions evolved. It appears to the author that Home Tooke clearly

pointed out the nature of the inflexions of languages, that the researches of all

philologers have confirmed his view, and yet we continue to speak of evolving
inflexions. Many persons attribute a vast mental superiority, at least in language,

to certain nations of antiquity, for having developed inflexions in their language
and deem the descendants of those same nations to be inferior, because they have
not only not developed any inflexions, but have been unable to maintain those which

were developed by their ancestors. If the views of Home Tooke be sound, the idea

of developing, in the sense of opening or unfolding, is erroneous.

  A change in the form of a word to express a difl^erent meaning is called an inflexion.

The form of a word can be changed in two ways.
   1. By adding one or more sounds, or even syllables to it, as love, loved, loving.
   2. By a change in the word, as speak, spoke; and both methods of changing the

form may occur in the same word, as speak, spoken.
   The word loved differs both in form and sense from the word love. The word

spoke also differs in both respects from the word speak. And the word spoken differs

in both respects from speak.

   What is expressed in one language by such a change, called an inflexion, may be

expressed in another by a different method ; thus the Latin dominus, a lord, besides
its other changes of form, has one which gives it a feminine signification, domina, a
                                 --

               TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                              8^

lady ; but the English word lord Has no feminine inflexion. Thus while in Latin a
part of the word only is changed, in English another word is adopted. The word

lady is not an inflexion of the word lord. Languages differ greatly in regard to
inflexion ; some abound in inflexions, while others have but few. They are numerous
in Sanscrit, Greek, Latin and the Sclavonic languages, less so in English, and at the

lowest in Chinese.

  We know how these inflexions were produced. They are not produced by any

opening as a bud opens into a flower, but by the coalescence of another word, or

fragment of a word, with the original word.

  We can show in many languages the word whose fragment is coalesced. Now a

junction of two things, even when well incorporated, together cannot with propriety

be called a develepment or evolution.

   In the Hebrew language the personal pronouns are termed separable and in-
separable. The separable pronouns represent the person to be in the nominative
case. The inseparable exhibit only some fragment of the separable pronoun com-

bined with some word.

In the Malay the plural is formed by adding some word or words which signify

much, many, or the like, or by repeating the same word, as oran baniaJc or oran orati,

many man, or man-man.                                       ,

In the Coptic the syllable ni or na, which is prefixed to form the plural, is, no

doubt, says Professor Lee, the word na or naa, which means much, many or great.

In Lee's Hebrew Grammar the subject of the coalescence of words with fragments

of other words is treated in a masterly manner.

   If we study human speech for ourselves, by closely observing what is going on,
instead of merely reading books on the subject of grammar, we shall detect the

process by which inflexions are formed. The formation of inflexions, like other
changes in language, are not the result of a committee of learned men sitting in
solemn council. There is no deliberation whatever in the matter. Learned men

and grammarians do not make the changes. They only observe and record the

changes that are taking place in the language of the mass of the people ; and all

these changes are made in the spoken language.

The two objects of language are

1. To convey ideas, &c.

2. To do so rapidly.
In our common speech we are ever striving to convey our thoughts with rapidity,

and in our efforts to do so, we involuntarily abbreviate many words and join those
abbreviations or verbal fragments to other words. In this way we oeconomise sounds,

syllables, and sometimes words. The word them is commonly imperfectly uttered

in the rapidity of familiar discourse. It is abbreviated by cutting off the theta in

such phrases as, / gave 'em instead of / gave them. This was observed above a

century ago, when an attempt was made to render the written language a transcript

of the spoken by printing the abbreviation 'em for them. The first edition of Lord

Shaftesbury's Characteristics was so printed.
  Again, in famihar talk we say / aint for / am not ; I wont for I will not ; I shant

for / stiall not. These examples, so far from being exhaustive, are merely instances

from groups of such abbreviations. The act of subordinating an auxiliary verb to the

principal verb of a sentence seems to crush the auxiliary into a mere fragment, as in

the sentence I have done, which is in rapid talk broken down into I'v done. Such

cases illustrate the formation of an inflexion, and is what is passing under our daily

Aobservation.  number of reasons prevent the transfer of these colloquialisms from

being transferred to writing, but no one who has studied the subject will doubt, that
if our language were an unwritten one and now about to become a written one, such

forms of inflexion would be noted and written as a part of the language.

The author has observed similar phaenomena in several European languages.

Hence the causes that produce such phsenomena in our own language are also

operating with similar results in certain other living languages, and it is to such

causes alone that we can refer the formation of inflexions in the Hebrew and other

ancient languages. The fonnation of inflexions, then, is not by developing some-

thing out of a word, but by adding something to that word.

         Notes on Blumenbach's Classification of the Human Race.

        Description of a Samoied Family seen at Archangel, in a letter to

                      Dr. Hodgkin. By John V. Giles.

   During my late visit to Archangel I had an opportunity of observing a family of

Samoieds, and beg to offer a description of them. They consisted of five individuals,

the father, mother and their children, and my interest was chiefly enlisted in them

by their exceedingly diminutive stature.
    In beating about the coast of Lapland for some weeks and roun^the North Cape,

 I had accustomed myself to the low stature of the Laplanders, but the height of
these poor wandering Samoieds approached dwarfishness.

    The mother, who was about three inches taller than the man, was scarcely four
feet high. The next most striking peculiarity I observed in them was a close re-

semblance in features to the Chinese, or to such of the Chinese people as I have seen

about Lintin, Whampoa and Canton, who are, I believe, a race between the Chinese

and Tartars. The chief point of resemblance was the oblique set of the eyes in the
 head, they b«ing also small, dark and piercing ; cheek bones high ; hair long and
black ; complexion dark and swarthy. There appeared to be much labour expended
 upon their dress, which consisted of an infinite number of very small pieces of deer
 skins, cut into the shape of lozenges or diamonds, closely and rather neatly sewed
together, the fur side of the skin turned inwards. Much pains seemed to be taken
 to ornament them, by plaiting and working up strips of skins into tassels.

    The upper vestment resembled a strait jacket, having long sleeves closed at their
 extremities, which appeared to be used as a scrip, for when anything was given to
them they released the arm through an opening made under the armpit, and then
 drew the arm in again, depositing the article in the nether extremity of the sleeve.

    The lower part of their dress terminated in and was joined to a sort of mocassin,
 made also as the upper portion, of an infinite deal of patchwork. I imagined they
 had been in the habit of exhibiting themselves to English vessels, for they had learned

a few words in our language, and could ask for tobacco, biscuit and beef. To my

 repeated inquiries as to where they came from, they pointed to the north-east.
    They made me several visits during ray stay, seemingly very much pleased with

 the gifts of tobacco and biscuits they received from me, but would never come on
 board the ship. Unlike the people around them, they would not drink raw spirits.

    The youngest of the children I judged to be about three years of age. The man's
 features were regular and tolerably well-looking, but in the woman I discerned
 the marks of premature old age ; she was wrinkled and had lost some teeth.
 Upon first seeing them I had taken them all for children from their size, until I came
 to look into the woman's face, when seeing the marks of age, and making inquiries
 as well as I could, they made one understand their relationship.

    As they are a people not much known, I have imagined an account of them, how-
 ever short, by one who had personally met with them, might contribute to your

 researches in ethnology.

        Notes upon a Collection of Irish Crania. By John Grattan.

    On placing this collection of ancient Irish crania before the Section, the author

 offered a few remarks as to whence they were obtained, and as to their probable an-
 tiquity. For some years Mr. Grattan had been associated with Mr. Getty in his
 examination of the round towers in Ulster, having for his special object to rescue
 from destruction any crania that might be brought to light during Mr. Getty's pro-
 ceedings. Ten round towers were examined in which various osseous human re-
 mains were found, including eleven crania. In all the towers, except that at Trum-

--mery, upon removing a greater or less depth of heterogeneous materials, evidently
 --the slow accumulation of ages, a flooring of lime, apparently the result of the acci-

 dental dropping of mortar during the building of the tower, was reached, from which
 downwards the offsets that constituted the foundations of the tower extended, the
 interior being filled up with soil similar in all respects except compactness to the
                                               .

virgin soil upon which the foundation rested, and in this soil and under the lime
floor, without any exception whatever, the remains when present were found.

    The skulls so obtained were with one exception in so frail and crumbling a con-

dition that it was found impossible to remove them, except in almost hopeless frag-
ments, but by carefully saturating them with glue and cementing them together,
they were restored to the condition in which they then appeared (specimens were

exhibited)

   The ten towers examined were Drumbo, Trummery, Clones, Armey, Drumlane,
Rams' Island, Devenish, Island Mahee, Antrim and Torry. Five of these towers
contained human osseous remains ; one had been previously disturbed, and four ex-
hibited no trace whatever of any. At Trummery, a tower of comparatively recent
erection, according to Dr. Petrie,'the osseous remains were found in a carefully con-

structed stone chamber.

Of the eleven skulls discovered within the Round Towers, one was found at

Drumbo                                         one at Trurdmery ;  six at  Clones ;  two at Armoy ;                                         and one at Drumlane.
                                            \

The whole collection (including crania from various other sources) was thrown

into four chronological groups, viz. the Prehistoric, the Remote historic, the Anglo-

Irish and the modern periods. The eleven crania from the round towers were re-

ferred to the second or Remote historic group, which from Dr. Petrie's researches

must belong to a period ranging between the fifth and thirteenth centuries. The tower

of Drumbo not being of later erection than the sixth century, the cranium must have

an antiquity of not less than twelve or thirteen hundred years. Drumlane tower

being of nearly the same period, scarcely so old, its cranium therefore might be one

thousand or eleven hundred years old.

   The collection exhibited unquestionable evidence of the existence in Ireland at
various epochs of strikingly contrasted varieties of the human family. But amongst

the varieties of form attention was fixed upon one fact strongly shown, viz. the

tenacity with which different types preserved their identity through periods of time

which embraced no small portion of the history of mankind.

   The crania of the second group, viz. those found in the round towers, it was sug-
gested, might possibly represent the magnates of their day. The construction of an
elaborate stone chamber under the tower of Trummery would scarcely have been

undertaken unless the individual had been a person of some importance, probably

the immediate progenitor of the                                    erector of        the tower                                        yet,  although  the  interment
                                                                                                                                   ;

took place within the tower, it was not to be assumed that the towers were built for

such a purpose. The decapitation of a slain chieftain, either by friendly or hostile
hands, was a matter of ordinary occurrence ; now with the cranium from Armoy

were found the three superior cervical vertebrae, and no more, precisely so much of

the spinal column as would remain attached to the head when separated from the
trunk. Hence the inference was not unreasonable that it was removed from some
fallen chieftain to rescue it from indignity, and the tower in which it was found

being probably then in the course of erection, was there interred, just as the head of

Diarmid M'Fergus was buried at Clonmacnoise and his body at Connor, as recorded

in the annals of the four masters a.d. 565.

  A hope was expressed that the collection was but the commencement of one cal-

culated one day to afford useful data to science ; and the author concluded by ex-

pressing his own belief, that, though these interesting relics of dim and distant ages

and their congeners of more modern times might present to the eye of the ordinary
observer but few and barren facts, they would be found, nevertheless, when viewed
through the medium of what appeared to some minds a deeper research and more
exact knowledge, to stand forth, voiceless and unsuggestive as they seemed, enduring
hieroglyphs of our race pregnant with meaning of hidden but grave import, and not,

perhaps, of very difiScult decipherment.

On the Ethnological Bearing of the Recent Discoveries in Connexion with
     the Assyriaii Inscriptions. By the Rev. Edward Hincks, D.D.

   Correct ethnological reasoning must be founded on facts, of the present or former
existence of which we have satisfactory evidence ; that is, statements in relation to
them, reduced to writing while they still existed, and that by persons who must
--$6 REPORT 1852.

have been cognizant of the reality of what they recorded. Facts of this nature may
be isolated, or reduced to a system by those who recorded them. Of such a system

we have a good example in the Germania of Tacitus, Dr. Latham's recent edition of

which was warmly commended. Other collections of facts of a somewhat similar

character were alluded to ; but all had the disadvantage of recording much as to

which the collectors had only imperfect information, indiscriminately mixed up

with what they knew ; and again, all such collections have come down to us

through many copyists, ia passing through whose hands they have been much

depraved.

In these respects they must yield to the collection of facts deducible from Egyptian

or Assyrio-Babylonian records, of which we possess autographs, or at any rate

copies made under the superintendence of the authors, while the facts were yet

recent. Nor is danger to be apprehended from intentional misrepresenting. Facts

connected with history, would, doubtless, be presented in a manner more favourable

to the royal authors of the inscriptions than truth would warrant. But, in facts

which most concern the ethnologist, there is in general no room for misrepre-

sentation ; they being facts which come out as it were accidentally, and as to which
national vanity has no place.

The facts recorded in the Assyrian inscriptions are of more importance than those

in the Egyptian, because they are not clouded as the latter are by ignorance in

respect to their chronology or geography. The chronology of the period to which

the most important Egyptian inscriptions and papyri belong is still a subject of

controversy                                                       while it was  stated that the commencements  of  the  reigns  of  Sargon
                                                               ;

and Sennacherib were as certain as those of any of the Lagidse or of the Caesars.

Dr. Hincks had announced in a paper recently read before the Royal Irish Academy,

that the twelve first years of Sargon corresponded with the twelve years assigned in

the Canon of Ptolemy to Mardokempad, which name is a corruption of that of

Marduk Baladan. In the course of July, he had identified the three years of the

Belibus of the Canon (Belib) with the second, third, and fourth of Sennacherib. It

followed from this that the reign of Sargon lasted eighteen years, and that the first

interregnum of the Canon, which occupied two years, is to be referred to the last

year of Sargon, and the first of Sennacherib. Sargon's reign began in 721 e.g.;

Sennacherib's in 703 b.c. Marduk Baladan was three times conquered ; first by

Sargon, in 710; secondly, by Sennacherib, in 703 ; and thirdly, by the same king,

in 700. On the first occasion, Sargon added Mesopotamia to his kingdom ; on the
second, Sennacherib gave it to Belibus ; and on the third, he made his son Assurnadin
king of Mesopotamia and Chaldea, which last country had been left to Marduk

Baladan on the two former occasions. Dr. Hincks identified this name with the

Aparanadius, which is the name of the successor of Belibus in the best MS. of the

Canon of Ptolemy, which is, however, not an ancient one ;. the Greek p being a mis-

take for ss, which might easily have been occasioned by the similarity of these letters.

Before Sargon we have Shalmaneser, Tiglath Pileser, and Pul. Col. Rawlinson,

who had first recognised the name of Marduk Baladan, has recently discovered a

series of annals of Tiglath Pileser. In a fragment of the annals of Pul, Dr. Hincks

discovered the name of Menahem as a tributary, in the eighth year of his reign.

This being fixed by 2 Kings vi. to about 770, his reign must have commenced about

777. Divanubar, the obelisk king, must have begun to reign about 900 b.c, as

Hazael, the commencement of whose reign is known to be about 885, was king in

bis eighteenth year, but not in his fourteenth. Col. Rawlinson has found a series of

annals of the father of this king, in which Ithobal, king of Tyre, is mentioned. It

appears from the Tyrian annals, extracted by Menander, and preserved by Josephus,

that he reigned from 936 to 904, which is in perfect harmony with the date of his

son's reign.

Reasons were then given why the geography of the Assyrian inscriptions was

capable of being better determined than of the hieroglyphic ones ; namely, that the
Egyptian could only go in one direction to Asiatic countries, whereas the Assyrians

made expeditions in all directions ; and the direction in which an unknown country

lay could generally be determined by that of other countries noticed along with it,

if, indeed, it was not expressly pointed out by the king's saying that he went to it

over the Euphrates or the Zab.

  -- --The great ethnological fact respecting Assyria its language was then treated of.

 Dr. Hincks considered the Assyrian language to belong to a family akin to that of

 the Syro-Arabian languages hitherto known, rather than to that family itself. He
 first pointed out what it had in common with all these languages. It had verbal

 roots, which were normally triliteral, but of which some letters might be mutable or
 evanescent, whence arise different classes of irregular verbs. These roots admitted
 not only the simple conjugation, but others in which radical letters are doubled,
 other letters added, or both these modifications made at once. From these roots

 verbal nouns are formed, either by a simple change of the vowels, or by the addition
 of letters, such as are called in Hebrew Heemantic.

     It agreed with the Arabian more closely than with any other Syro-Arabian lan-

--guage in three respects : 1st. In forming the conjugations, consonants are inserted

 among the radical letters, as well as prefixed to them. This takes place regularly in
 Arabic, but in Hebrew only where the first radical is a sibilant. 2nd. The termina-
 tion of the aorist varies as ill Arabic ; different verbs taking different vowels between

 the second and third radicals, while the first radical sometimes terminates the verb
and sometimes takes after it a or u. 3rd. The forms of the plural vary, and the
cases of nouns differ in a manner which resembles, in some measure, what takes

 place in Arabic.

  --The Assyrian language differed from all the Syro-Arabian languages known

hitherto in the following respects : 1st. Where they have h, it has s in a variety of

instances, and especially in the pronouns and pronominal affixes of the third person
su, si, sunu ; su, sa, si, sun and sin, most of which resembles forms in other languages,

 if only h be substituted for s.
    The same difference occurs in the characteristic of the causative conjugation. In

these respects, but not by any means generally, the Assyrian agrees with the
Egyptian, and through it with the modern Berber. 2nd. The Assyrian has no pre-
fixes, such as b for in, I for to, which occur in all the Syro-Arabian languages. In
place of these it has separate prepositions ; and to avoid the awkwardness of joining
these to the prenominal affixes, and perhaps for greater clearness, nouns are inserted,
forming compound prepositions, as ina Jcii-bisu "in its midst " for " in it." Com-
pound prepositions may be used also before other nouns, as ina Mrib biti, " in the
midst of the house " for ina biti. Sometimes the Assyrian uses affixes as substitutes
for prepositions. Instead of ana, to or for, before a noun, ish maybe added. Thus
" for a spoil " is expressed indifferently by ana shallati and shallatish. This last
form has much of the nature of an adverb and has some resemblance to the Hebrew
noun with-ffe locative*. 3rd. The Syro-Arabian languages made frequent use of a pre-
terite, in which the distinctions of number and person are confined to the end of the
root ; but the Assyrian rejects it, or at least uses it in an exceedingly sparing manner.

On this account Dr. Hincks proposed to consider the Benoni participle, masculine,
singular, in regimen as the root. 4. The varieties in the termination of the future are
not connected with any particles that may precede them, but of themselves indicate
different tenses. The termination in u is certainly a pluperfect. Thus where men-
tion is made of " that Marduk Baladan whom I had defeated in my former campaign,"

the verb is askunu ; but whenever " I defeated " occurs in the simple narration askun,

ashuna, or in a different conjugation, astakan is used. This law has been fully esta-
blished. The addition of a seems not to change the sense ; it is added to every verb
when what it governs follows it, and to some verbs even where it precedes it. These

are chiefly such as denote locomotion.

   The resemblance of the most common Assyrian prepositions and of the pronouns
to Indo-European forms is curious, and points to a common though remote origin.

   The Babylonian inscriptions are in the same language as the Assyrian. This was
probably the court language at Babylon ; but the common people most probably
used the Chaldean language, in which some parts of the books of Ezra and Daniel

are written.

   * Since this was written Dr. Hincks has been led to alter his views as to the final ma,

which is not connected with the pronominal affix, but with the verb that precedes it, of which
it modifies the sense ; thus addin-su-ma is not " 1 gave to him," but " when I had given to

--him," or " having given to him." (June 1853.)

On the Forms of the Personal Pronouns of the Two First Persons in the
  Indian, European, Syro- Arabic, and Egyptian Languages. By the Rev.

  Edward Hincks, D.D.

Dr. Hincks began by saying that he now only threw out suggestions, which

might be followed up by others. The question, of which he took a novel view, could
not be settled by considering the pronominal forms exclusively. Many other points

would have to be considered ; and whether the conclusions which appeared to him
to follow with a high degree of probability from these forms, would be confirmed or

pi-oved to be erroneous by the examination of other forms, was what he could not
now say. He only wished to set persons to think. It appeared to him that a cer-

tain theory had been taken for granted, and he wished that it should be subjected to

examination.

The affinity of the personal pronouns in all the Indo-European languages was not

to be disputed ; nor did Dr. Hincks mean to challenge any reasonable opinion re-
specting the absolute antiquity of the Sanskrit. What he called in question was its

antiquity relative to the European languages akin to it. The case with respect to

the pronouns of the two first persons might be briefly stated. The Asiatic members

of this family have a final am which is wanting in the European numbers. Was this
am omitted by the Europeans, or added by the Asiatics ? The former is the received

opinion ; the latter seems more probable to Dr. Hincks. Examples of both processes
are common. The English pronoun we is nearly the same with that in many lan-

guages of Northern Europe. It is admitted by all philologists that this has been

shortened from a more ancient form, wir or wis. This abbreviation has been made

in Swedish within the historic period. In other languages it was made in the pre-

historic period ; that is, we have no written documents of an age before it was made.
Philologists are, however, agreed that the s or r at the end of this form was an ad-

dition, and that there must have been an older form without it ; and the received

opinion is that this form wi or vi was an abbreviation of the Sanskrit viyam. Dr.

Hincks considered this to be a false view. He assumed a form anwis or anus (and

that wi and u pass into one another appears from a vast number of instances ; as the
Latin termination vis, where the Greek and Sanskrit have us ; the Semitic copulative
conjunction, &c., &c.), from which wis and nus (nos) would both arise. This anus
was the Semitic pronoun anu, which was common to the Indo-Europeans and Semitic

races before their separation, in the same manner as anaku and anta or aniu ; and
the Indo-Europeans added s under a false impression that a plural termination was

necessary, the fact being that anu was itself plural. As it is not likely that this mis-
take would be made simultaneously by unconnected nations. Dr. Hincks argued that

the addition of s must have taken place while the Indo-Europeans were one people
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and hence the necessity of assuming an ancient form which would account for both

weis and nos. It was observed that w was peculiarly liable to be attached to words be-

ginning with a vowel. The Irish names of Newry and of the river Nore, the English

noun 7iewt, in which the n has etymologically no place, and the abbreviations, nan,

ned, nol, are proofs of this.

At first, it was assumed that the pronoun of the first person singular in tAie Euro-

pean languages showed traces of the Indian am. The o in ego might be for om, as the

Ain lego certainly was.        trace of this o remained in Sclavonic, and its omission in

Lithuanian and Gothic was evidently a degradation. Dr. Hincks maintained, how-

ever, that this might be otherwise accounted for, the Assyrian form of the pronoun

being an-uku. According to this view, the Indian pronouns aham and viyam are so

far from being the original forms that they are obtained from late European forms

not from the more ancient aJcu and vis, but from the abbreviated ak and vi.

If this philological view be correct, it tends to an ethnological view, which re-

sembles what has been advanced by Dr. Latham. The Indo-European race pro-

ceeded westward through Asia Minor, and over the Hellespont and Bosphorus.

They then dispersed through Europe, and at length an offset from the Sclavonic

branch returned to Asia between the Caspian and Black Seas, overrunning some

countries eastward of Assyria and at length penetrating to India.

The Semitic and Indo-European pronouns of the second person plural are distinct,

having been developed in diflferent manners after these races separated.

The Egyptian pronouns of all these persons take that an at their commencement

which the Semitic pronouns of the first two persons have.

Tlie Origin, Characteristics, and Dialect of the People in the Counties of

   Doion and Antrim. By the Rev. A. Hume, D.C.L., LL.D., F.S.A.

  The district comprising the counties of Down and Antrim, of which Belfast is the

natural centre, is one which has exercised a most important influence on the des-
tinies of the human race in these islands. In Down, the patron saint made his first
convert, and there his ashes repose ; in Antrim, the real Ossianic poems are supposed

to have existed. In Down was the ancient Ulidia, from which the extended name
Ulster is derived ; in Antrim was the ancient Dalradia, the name of which was
applied to a large portion of modern Scotland. Ireland was originally known as
Scotia, or Scotia Major ; and, when the name was superseded at home, it was

retained by our enterprising colonists to Argyle and Lorn, and afterwards extended
to all North Britain, after the conquest by Kenneth in the ninth century. The

line of kings descended from Fergus the son of Ere, not only mingled its blood

with the Saxon and Norman royal lines of England, but afterwards inherited the

sovereignty of Great Britain ; so that Queen Victoria traces an authentic descent

from the petty chieftains of this neighbourhood in the fifth century.
   More than a thousand years afterwards, the debt of colonization was repaid, at

the time of the Plantation of Ulster. The Anglo-Saxon population had been so long

--separated into two branches, the English and Scotch differing in country, laws,
--religion, manners, prejudices, &c. that they must be regarded as two peoples, and

not one. If to these we add the remnant of the native Irish, there are three distinct
elements, from the composition of wiiich, in different quantities and situations, the

inhabitants of the two counties are derived.

 --These localities are the following: the Irish, in the hilly districts, as in the

" Glynnes " [glens] of Antrim ; and the Irish-speaking population in the neigh-

bourhood of Cushendall. There are a few in almost every parish, and several in the

great towns. In Down, few occur north of Downpatrick and Ballynahinch ; they

then converge to the mountains of Mourne, by the parish of Loughin-island. In

the past generation, Irish was frequently spoken in the markets of Downpatrick,
Castlewellan, Dromara, and Ballynahinch ; now it is rarely used as a separate mode

of communication. In the districts of the Celts they preserve their traditional anti-
pathies, though they assimilate in language ; and the terms " Irish," " Scotch," and
" Enghsh," are used currently by the nearest neighbours in reference to ancestral

origin.

  --The Scottish immigration followed two natural routes by the Mullof Cantyre to

the County Antrim, near the Causeway ; and by the Mull of Galloway to the County

Down, by Donaghadee. From the earliest time, coracle skiff and coaster must have

passed in this way, and the two distinct streams ran right across the counties. In
Down, the Scotch current is traceable by Comber, Killileagh, Saintfield, and Anna-

hilt, nearly to Hillsborough ; also, by Castlereagh and Purdysburn, to near Belfast.
In the County Antrim, the course is by Ballymoney and Ballymena, up to the town

of Antrim, and over the back of Devis and the Cave-hill.

The English settlers occupied mainly the low countries, such as the basins of the

Lagan and Bann, and the banks of Lough Neagh. Belfast was originally an English

town, but its external increase has been mainly from the two Scottish districts.

Lisburn was a small English and Welsh colony ; it is now practically an English

town. In one barony of Antrim, of 128 townlands, the population is all of English

origin                          and Aghalee, Ballinderry, &c., look like parts of England.
                             ;

At various points the different races meet, but refuse to mingle. There are English,

Irish, and Scotch quarters in several towns, such as Downpatrick and Carrickfergus ;

and the Lagan, near Lisburn, separates the two races. In one half of the parish

of Hillsborough the people are all Scotch, in the other they are all English. A hill

near Ballynahinch separates the two races ; and the island of Rathlin has its two

promontories occupied, one by the Irish, the other by the English and Scotch.

The religion, habits, customs, &c., may all be deduced from this distribution. In

religion, for instance, the rule is, that the English are Episcopalians ; the Scotch,

Presbyterians ; and the Irish, Roman Catholics. The lines of Scottish population
may be marked on the map by a double chain of Presbyterian meeting-houses, while

in the English districts they are rare or unknown. In fourteen Presbyteries of the

General Assembly, seven of which are in each county, there are upwards of 200 con-

gregations. If to these we add other Presbyterian congregations not connected
--90 REPORT 1852.

with the Assembly, we shall find that fully one-half of all the congregations in

Ireland are situated in these two counties, or connected with Presbyteries that cen-

tralize in them. More than one-half of these are in rural districts, unconnected

with towns or villages, and called by the names of townlands ; showing that the

Scotch were in general agriculturists, and less settled in towns than the English. In

the English dist*-icts the church-and-king feeling is strong, but, from the magnitude

of the parishes and the distance of churches from particular points, the people are

less attentive than they should be to their religious duties. In the Irish districts

the Roman Catholic congregations are large, and those of the two branches of the

Protestant Church are small. In the English and Scotch districts, several parishes

are united to form one in the Roman Catholic arrangements ; and again, Drumgoo-
land, where Protestants are few in number, is divided into two Roman Catholic

parishes. This is in the neighbourhood of Dolly's Brae, and it is said that in two

townlands of Backaderry and Magheraraayo, as well as in several others, there are

scarcely any Protestant families.

The habits of the people, as well as their creed, indicate their origin. In the

English districts there is more comfort and tidiness than we find elsewhere ; for the
man of Scottish ancestiy does not enjoy life so well, though he may be actually

richer. The Scotchman is often more intelligent than his English neighbour, but he

rarely excels him in weight of character. In the English districts the farms are

large, and there is a better kind of house, furniture, stock, food, clothing, &c. The

man of English origin will live and let live. In the markets of Lurgan, Lisburn,
Moira, and Portadown, the Down farmer is known from the Antrim one, or rather

the Scotchman from the English, by his hardness in driving a bargain. The old
English sports and pastimes were kept up till recently at Lambeg ; the May- pole is

still known in Holywood, and tradition leads us to believe that certain mystery

plays have been performed in the district. The custom of hiring servants at stated

fairs  is  followed  in Antrim,  as is  the case  in many other towns and  places of England
                                                                                                                                                 ;

and while those who attend for the purpose at Carlisle cany a straw in the mouth,

those at Antrim carry a little white rod in the hand. The settlers on the Marquis

of Hertford's estate were in general natives of the shires adjoining the Bristol Chan-

nel, and as their ancestral district is the apple district of England, so the barony of

Upper Massareene is the apple district of Ireland. After the lapse of 250 years, the

ancient custom is preserved as if it were of yesterday. The superstitions of May-

eve and Hallow- e'en are still practised, and not one of the ceremonies in Burns's

poem is neglected, even by those to whom the poem is utterly unknown.

The names of persons and of places are also highly illustrative of the people. In

the English districts, we meet with such names as Turner, Standfield, Hull, Moore,

Shields ; in the Scottish, Dunbar, Edgar, Livingstone, Kennedy, Douglas, and
sometimes they undergo curious transformations. In the Irish districts, a few names

are used with distinctive terms and epithets, and sometimes Irish names are trans-
lated into English or Anglicised ; M'Shane becomes Johnston, and Ginnif, Sands,
while M'Gurnaghan is altered to the more euphonious Gordon. Names of places

are often derived from those of persons, as Hill-town, Hill-hall, and Hills-borough,

from the Downshire family ; Gill-hall and Gilford from the M'Gills ; and similarly
Warings-town, Ross-trevor, Echlin-ville, Mount-stewart. Grooms-port is Graemes'-

port, and Ballymcarrett the village of M'Art. Many names are less distinctly

known, as Bryan's-ford, Lyle-hill, Randals-town ; others allude to the original pos-

sessors, as Acre M'Cricket, Taggart's-land, Douglas-land, Dobbin's-land, Bally-

copeland, Bally-french, Bally-gilbert.

  Dr. Hume concluded his remarks with a viva voce description of the Hyberno-

English dialect in these two counties, and showed, by various quotations, its local
characteristics, and also its usefulness. From the fusion of many peculiarities and

the mingling of provincialisms from various parts of the United Kingdom, it is par-

ticularly useful in the illustration of our old English literature.

     Heads of a Paper " On theprese^it state of Medo-Persic Philology."
        By Professor MacDouall, M.A., Queeiis College, Belfast.

   Tendencies have been lately exhibited, in works treating of comparative philology,
to disturb, whether by contraction or by enlargement, the relations which profound
researchs was upposed to have definitively settled between the Indo-European

languages and those of other families, and also to question, on various points, the
principles on which the present arrangement of the members composing the Indo-

European class itself reposes. In particular, the position usually assigned to the
Medo-Persic element has been assailed ; and not merely has the registry of its
functions and claims been thought to demand revision, but a disposition has been
evinced to jostle it altogether out of its existing connexion. Although it vi^as not
to have been expected that such theories as those formerly advocated by Othmar
Frank on one side, and Col. Vans Kennedy on another, would be reproduced after
the natural history of languages had been traced by Schlegel, Humboldt, and their
coadjutors, yet that the present attitude of Medo-Persic philology is a retrograde
one, might be inferred from such surmises as those which, having been propounded
by an authority like Dr. Latham, drew upon him unmeasured censure in a recent

number of the Edinburgh Review. If it be not certain, after ail, that the Iranian

--speech is cognate with the Sanskrita, if it be still possible that the organisation of
--any of its dialects may pass for Seriform, then it is certainly high time that the

notions generally current in reference to it should be reviewed, and, if requisite,

corrected. A resume of the progress already made may be useful as a preliminary

to prospective steps in this direction.

  --The Languages spoken by the subjects of the Achsemenian Kings preserved

through past ages on rocks, bricks, and slabs of stone, in the Cuneiform Inscrip-

-- --tions are now partially resuscitated. One of these generally known as "the
--third " is admitted by all decipherers, with the (probably) solitary exception of

Grotefend, to come under the Semitic category, like those of the Inscriptions of
Assyria and Babylonia. The " second " type has not yet been so definitely classified :
the designation at first given to it, " Pahlavi," has been given up, and that of
" Median " has been substituted provisionally ; but, while some consider it Aramaic,

--others are at a loss whether to treat it as Arian, or as Turanian, and in either case
--disguised by foreign accessions, or as a hybrid offspring, and one of uncertain pa-

rentage. Only the " first " of these monumental languages is admitted by all to be
Arian, and by nearly all to represent the " Old Persic." Not only its orthography,

but its lexical and grammatical constitution, has been already to a great extent

-- --elucidated ; and, what it is here of importance to observe, it has been shown to
--resemble very closely the Old Sanskrita, that of the Vedas.

  --Distinct from the Languages just noticed, and likewise from each other, are those

preserved in the Sacred Books of the Parsis whether thoseof the Sipasi heretics, or

those of the orthodox Zoroastrians or Mazdaya9nis. It is true, that not only the

antiquity and genuineness of those books has been questioned by European criticism,

--but that the very languages, both of that oracle of the Sipasis the Basdtlr, and of

those Zoroastrian books which are represented as the oldest and as the prototypes of

--the rest, have been regarded as fictitious products, travesties of real but recent

tongues, or else as mere gibberish. Whether, however, that in which the so-called

version of the Dasdtlr is composed represents the vernacular of Persia about the

--time of the Moslem conquest, or is some centuries later, and whether that of the

so-called original, the Asmanl Zaban, be such a fabrication as the Balai-Bolna

of the Sufis or the Formosan of Psalmanazar, or after all be, as suggested by

--Von Hammer and Troyer, the relic of some old local dialect, are points which, on

the one hand, cannot be regarded as finally decided, and, on the other hand, do not

furnish available data in the present inquiry. But it has come to be generally

acknowledged, in respect to the Mazdayafnian Books, that they in reality belong to

--three distinct epochs : the originals being fragments of the revelations attributed

--to the undated Seer, Zarathustra; the proximate versions or imitations of these,

--with some commentaries on them, being of the Sasanian age ; and the versions of

those versions, with other pieces founded upon and referring to them, coming down

-- --as far as and in some instances even below the era of Yazdajird. And the history

of the three Languages, in which these three classes of Books are composed, requires

now to be traced with the utmost attainable accuracy.
    I. The First of them has been variously designated the Language of the " Mana-

thar " (=" Invocations "), or " of the Avestd " (:=" Text, Discourse," or perhaps

=primarily " Appointment, Decree "), or " of the Zend " ( " Book," or perhaps

" Gnosis, Science "), from the documents in which it has been preserved. The tiiird

of these names is the one most usually employed ; though Spiegel and some other
scholars have lately questioned its propriety, conceiving it to designate the more re-
cent version, in an Aramaising idiom, which will be noticed under the next head.
So long as this language could he studied only in the specimens exhibited by An-
quetil Duperron, its character and rank were vei-y imperfectly apprehended ; but
now, that its genuine physiognomy has been portrayed by the happy ingenuity
of Rask, its framework rebuilt and reanimated by the master-hand of Burriouf, and
its relations elicited by the comprehensive analytics of Bopp, it has assumed its
rightful stand-point as one of the primary members of the Indo-European family.

--As yet, however, opinions remain divided in reference to its original locality, its
--growth, progress, and decline, the age, authenticity, and mutual relations of its
--literary muniments. The idea of Anquetil, Kleuker, and Herder, that the Zend-

books were composed under Darius the son of Hystaspes and succeeding kings of
the Achsemenian house, has been advocated by Adelung, Rask, Malcolm, and Klap-

--roth : Wahl likewise concurred, although he held that their language was merely

a hieratic vehicle, gradually refined from the one in popular use by the sacerdotal
caste : and the late Dr. Prichard adhered to the same chronology, without pronouncing
decidedly for Wahl's theory, but evidently well inclined to it. Foucher and Tychsen,
however, believed the ground v^'ork of the liturgy to date from the reign of the Mede

Cyaxares I., above 600 years B.C.; while they allowed that expositions of various
parts, with additional prayers and tracts, composed under the Achaemenids, must have

been incorporated with antique fragments in the existing compilation so lately as
under the Sasanian dynasty. Rhode and Heeren went still farther back, making
the age of Zarathustra anterior to the Median empire ; and this hypothesis has been

--stamped with the sanction of Burnouf, Lassen, and Pott. For the locality of " the

Zend-folk," the older inquirers had pitched upon the North-West provinces of Iriin,
between the Caspian and Black Seas, and supposed the vocabulary to have been
that of Northern Media : philological affinities were therefore sought, by Anquetil,

--Kleuker, and Wahl, in the subsisting dialects of Armenia and Georgia ; but more
--discreetly by Klaproth and Rask, in the speech of the Caucasian Iron or Osl,

whose descent from the old Medes had been traced through the Alans of the middle
ages. An antagonist theory points to the North- Eastern provinces, those bounded
by the Caspian and the Himalayan range ; and, styling the speech of the Avesta
" Sogdo-Bactrian," makes it intermediate, as to local habitation not less than age,
between the " Medo-Persic " of the Achcemenian Inscriptions and the Sanskrita of the

--Vedas. And this latter theory, first suggested by Foucher and Tychsen, afterwards
--maintained by Rhode and Heeren, is now commended by Burnouf, Lassen, Pott,
--Spiegel, and Westergaard ; while Prichard, after a show of resistance, has virtually

 capitulated in its favour. The definite conclusions of Westergaard on other points

have not yet been announced ; but, in 1843, he proposed to keep in view, throughout

his forthcoming Grammar and Dictionary, certain ideas, previously thrown out by

-- --Mr. Erskine of Bombay, viz. that in the extant rifacciamenio of the Parsi books

but a small residimm of the old Bactrian oracles can be detected, and that their
 language is in a condition of decrepitude and semibarbarism. Col. Rawlinson, in

different papers, oscillates between Erskine's notion and that of Wahl ; but his
 latest statement, in 1846, is opposed to the belief that these books conserve any
 tongue which was spoken under the ancient monarchy. Finally, Spiegel's acute

--criticism has not only dissevered the relics of most hoar antiquity from the recent

 Sasanian accessions, has not only detached from both extremes various specimens

--of the literature which partially bridged over the wide gap between, but has dis-

 parted the " Old Zend " itself into two distinct dialects, and referred to each of these

-- --such of the extant documents as exhibit their respective peculiarities. What if this

 distinction,- which Westergaard homologates, was one of locality rather than of

 age .' What if one-half of the book Yapia was composed on the Western or Median

 side of the Caspian Lake, and the other on its Eastern or Bactrian border ? If so,

we may amicably close all controversy about " Media " or " Bactria," as the home

--of the Zend speech which must thus have been " Medo-Bactrian," and as the
--cradle of the Zend people in whose sagas the spiritual and secular powers were

 symbolised, respectively, by Zarathustra, the Seer born in Urumiya, and Vishta9pa,
 the Monarch enthroned in Balkh.

    II. Under the early Sasanian kings the First Book-language had become obsolete,

--and the Second, called by the Parsis "the speech of Huzvaresh" ( = " Auspicious

--Heroism," as it used to be rendered, or rather, as it is now understood, " Acceptable

Sacrifice"), became the hieratic vehicle. In this appeared both versions of the old re-
velations, and also some new works designed to facilitate the restoration of Magian
worship, such as the Vlraf Ndmah, the Bun-Dehesh, the Mino-Khirad, the Dm-Kard,

&c. That any secular works were composed in it, or indeed existed at that epoch, there

is no evidence. In it, however, are expressed the legends upon the fire-altar-coins

struck by the early Sasanids, and also the vernacular portions of bilingual inscrip-

tions upon various monuments at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Naqsh-e-Rajab, and Karman-
Shah, belonging to the same period. This fact was discovered, as is well known, by

the illustrious Silvestre de Sacy. TThe labours of successive numismatists and de-
cipherers have gradually, though still but imperfectly, elicited the laws and charac-

teristics of the language : they have been most clearly expounded in an essay of
Joseph Miiller, and the publications of Spiegel and Westergaard are now rendering
them at once more definite and more widely known. All inquirers continue to agree
that it is isolated, among the Arian kin-tongues, by a copious Aramaic infusion,

neither inherited from its predecessor nor transmitted to its successor, which has im-
parted to it a hybrid and abnormal aspect, and which at the same time assures us
that this is the " language of Zardusht" described by Abu-'l-Faraj as an admixture of

--Old Persic with Nabathsean or Assyrio-Chaldaic. Now, these circumstances all

-- --harmonise with if they do not absolutely require the hypothesis, that the Huz-

varesh speech must have originated in the Western provinces of the empire, where
the maniform intercourse of Arian and Semitic tribes would naturally produce a
mongrel phraseology. While compatible with Anquetil's view of its being indige-
nous in Lower Media, in the region between Mazandaran and Farsistan, they

rather favour that for which the cogent arguments of Erskine, Miiller, Mohl,

--Lassen and Knobel have secured a general reception viz. that it was formed in

the Border-land along the Tigris, including at first Khiizistan and Iraq-AjamI,
and subsequently also the Northern districts about Hamadan and Kirmanshah.

They decisively preclude the fancy of Quatremere and Pott, that this language
was vernacular East of the Caspian, among the Parthians,--was successfully pro-

--pagated towards the West and South by the dominant Arsacids, and only relapsed

into obscurity after several reigns of the native Sasanians. For, in this case, it

should have been distinguished by a Turanian, not an Aramaic, infusion ; its monu-
mental inscriptions should have been found to the East, not the West, of the Great

--SaltDesert; its coin-legends should have belonged to the "Phil-hellenic" Arsacids,

whose mintage however is purely Grecian, not to their Sasanian successors, whose
policy would naturally have discouraged its use. Equally inadmissible is the idea of
Anquetil and his immediate followers, that this dialect so early and so extensively
encroached upon the domain of others, as to have been adopted, under the Kaianian
dynasty, as the speech of the court and the empire, and to have maintained that
rank at least 900 years, including the most brilliant and palmy period of Persian
ascendency, and reaching down almost to the Moslem invasion. It is suificient to

--remark, without mentioning the historical and geographical difficulties which hence
--arise, first, that it is not this language which supplies the words adduced by

 Greek and Latin writers as exemplifying the classical Persic of their day ; and,
 secondly, that its structure does not accord with the intimations of FirdausT, Nizami,
 and other Moslem authors, that the speech of the ancient monarchy had survived the
revolution, and had come down to themselves so far exempt from any material change
 that they had no difficulty in consulting the chronicles preserved in it

  --III. In respect to the third Book-language, the prevalent and, as would appear,
--well-founded belief now is, that «Y was the one referred to by Firdausi and Nizami

 that it had been the vernacular idiom of Farsistan, which, under the later kings of
 the Sasanian line, became fashionable and literary ; that it ranked as the Darl or
 " Court-speech" during two centuries, but shrank into the obscurity ofa book-lan-
 guage after a.d, 641, when it ceded its title oi Dart by resisting that influx of Arabic
 terms and phrases which began thenceforward to colour the vehicle of ordinary con-

-- --versation and business. Its analytical character, intermediate between the still com-

 plex though doubtless partially relaxed tissue of Huzvaresh and the consummate^

disintegration of Neo-Persic, warrants the philological soundness of this belief. Its
name, " Parsi," at once recals its original locality, and identifies it as the distant de-
scendant of the language which occupies the first place in the Achsemenian Inscrip-

--tions although, of course, the resemblance between these two has been seriously im-

paired by diversified influences in the wide chasm of time by which they are separated.

--Since in it various holy Oracles were translated from Huzvaresh, if not, in rare cases,

--even from the older hieratic tongue, and since expositions and devotional pieces by

revered Mobeds were preserved in it by those who adhered to the old faith after the

--triumph of Islam, it is now found to be largely saturated with the spirit of those

uncongenial idioms, especially the latter of them, with which il was in more imme-

=diate contact. Hence too it has been designated the speech of" Pa-Zend" " the
=Commentary," and of " Buzurgun-e-Bln" "the Doctors of Religion." But,

though the literary memorials now extant in it are, probably without exception,
religious, others, now lost, are recorded to have been composed in it on secular sub-

--jects ; such as the Zafar-NdmaJi^=" Book of Victory," by Buzur, the Vazir of
--Nushirvan, the far older Kar-Ndmah =z "Journal," of uncertain authorship,--^

and a work on Morals by Ardshir Babagan. Further, it must be this same ParsI or
Old Darl which Mohammedan writers term "Pahlavi," while stating that in it,
under the patronage of Nushirvan and his successors, were composed the Bdsidn-

=JSdmah " Old Hero-book," and also sundry versions as well of Sanskrita collections

of apologues as of treatises by Plato and Aristoteles.
    Although, in the present abstract of a long paper*, the disputed appellations Avesta,

Zend, Darl, have been passed without discussion, yet it is necessary concisely to
review the history and circumscribe the import of the name just mentioned, Pahlavi,

--because it has been bandied about, in reference to unconnected and alien objects,

with such latitude as to have involved the whole field of Medo- Persic philology in a

perplexity truly tantalising.

   From the time of Hyde and Anquetil, European writers, with the sanction and
concurrence (as would appear) of the ParsTs themselves, have designated the Second
Book-language " Pahlavi." And, in accordance with the different views which they
have taken of the origin and history of that language, they have espoused different
derivations of this name. Some have deduced it ivorapahlu =z " vigour," or pahlau

= " strong, hero," as if it were strictly synonymous with Hu-zvaresh (according to

the etymology put upon the latter term until lately), and representative of the speech

--in which the Pahlawdn-e-Jahdn those Paladins who upheld Iran, while its sway was
--most extended-- embodied their conceptions; others, from Pahlava as applied to

the Parthian tribes, or from Pe/dev as indicating the old battle-ground of Rustara and

--Afrasiab ; others, from Pahlu, as restricted to the Border-land between the purely

Persian and the Arabo-Chaldaic territories. But Pahlavi is defined by some Moslem

=authorities as simply " ancient Pdrsi ; " and by all of them this is employed as the

ordinary designation of the tongue which they describe as having been the national

--one down to the Saracen conquest, or even later. Numerous words noticed by

Firdausi as Pahlavi are purely Iranian not of Semitic parentage, as many of them
at least must have been, if really Huzvaresh ; and it has been observed likewise, that
that poet commutes Pahlavi and Pdni as epithets distinctive of his own phraseologj'.
The truth then is, that, in Moslem usage, Pahlavi suggests the Tliird Book-language
the one above discussed under the titles Pd-Zend and Pdni ; occasionally compre-

--hending also the Darl, in which the third language came to be absorbed just as the

names Dari and Pdrssi likewise have been sometimes treated as interchangeable.
Before this state of the case was clearly demonstrated by Joseph Miiller, the name
Pa/«?an had been construed, in a/Z Oriental works alike, as referring to mte language,
and that the Huzvaresh ; but the unhappy result had been the perpetuation of such
philological and historical hypotheses, incongruous and untenable alike, as have pre-
viously passed under our review.

   Since, now, the name in question has been ascertained to denote, in one set of

--writers, the Seco7id Book-language one strongly tinged with Aramaism, but, in an-

other set, the Third Book-language-^one of more purely Iranian organisation, it

   * In it the later " Dari phasis" of the language, the modern Farsi, and various Arian
dialects pure and mixed, were also revievved, but not in a way that readily admits condensa-
tion or abridgement.

may be inquired, whether either of its applications favour any of the three etymolo-

gies, which, as was above mentioned, have been proposed for it, or rather a fourth

-- --must be resorted to for it in one or other or both of those applications. Now,

a retrospect at the conditions of the problem evinces that two of the etyraa must be

=summarily set aside. The third, viz. Pahla " Border-land," is suitable to

Pahlavi as denoting the hybrid speech of Khiizistan ; but, manifestly, it is not at

all appropriate in reference to the language of Farsistan and Kohistan, of which the

Dari employed by Tabari and Firdausi was the oiFspring ; and hence it becomes

desirable to find one which may lie at the root of and explain both applications.
=Various reasons recommend pahalam par' uwam =: pdrum, Sac, a word which

probable, that the Pahlavas and Pahalwaii are so designated as being " the ancient

tribe," and the Pahlavi as being " the ancient speech." If so, one may collate the

Pelasgoi and the Graioi or Grueci in relation to the Hellenes, as also the Prisci and
the Casci in relation to the Latini ; and this, whether or not " ancient " be likewise

the radical sense of--that much-tortured appellative Pelasgoi, as well as of Casci,

--of Prisci =zpristini, and of Graioi an abridgement of £)'e?-aJoi which is illustrated by

graia and graus. It were needless to embarrass this analogy by suggesting further,

-- --that Pelasgoi, if strengthened from Pelagoi, a sister-form of Palaioi, might not

even serve as an etymological link between Prisci (coll. prius, primunt, prin, paros,

perusi, palai, &c.) and Pahlava or Palhava, through a series of letter- changes, which

separately would be easy, although cumulatively they might appear improbable.

An Attempt to accountfornumerous appearances of sudden and violent drain-
   age seen on the sides of the basin of the Dead Sea. By Capt. W. Allen,

   R.N., F.R.S., F.R.G.S.

   The Dead Sea, the lake Asphaltites of the ancients, is now generally understood
to have a depression of more than 1300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean yet

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

hitherto no satisfactory theory has been given of the cause of the phsenomenon. If

Capt. Allen ventures to offer one, it is because he thinks it right to record impres-
sions forced on his mind, by certain features which arrested attention on approaching
its mysterious shores, by the road of Jericho.

    These features were :
    1 Some indications of lines of alluvial deposit on the sides of the mountains, a little
below the level of the sea ; especially observable on the eastern declivities.

  A2. succession of sand-cliffs on both sides of the Jordan.

   3. Some parallel lines of pebbles, about 50 feet wide, near the Dead Sea, per-
fectly resembling its actual beach, which is composed principally of flat pieces of
bituminous shale, with fragments of Lydiao stone. These lines of pebbles are re-
markable, because previously not a stone had been seen for several miles ; while
between and beyond them the soil is a very soft alluvium.

   4. The precipitous mountains rising from this sea are rent with ravines, and their
innumerable peaks have a tendency to group themselves in a succession of plateaux.

   5. Near the N.W. angle of the sea are some conical hills, with flat summits and

steep furrowed sides. These had all the appearance of sedimentary formation, which,
however, was gradually less observable in ascending the mountain ; and at last the
horizontality of the strata could only be detected in a general sense.

    Similar appearances in terraces and cliffs have been noticed in the Southern as
well as in the Northern Ghor, which both slope downwards to the Dead Sea.

   Now, if these remains of sedimentary deposit be admitted as evidences of occa-
sional subsidence of the waters of the Dead Sea, its surface may be traced by them
to its original level with the Gulf of Akabah, to which it would then have been joined
by a narrow strait, similar to that of Tir^hn, by which this gulf communicates with
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   .

the Red Sea. The actual condition of this strait, Tirahn, would give countenance
to the idea, that it is in process of closing ; for by the chart it will be found that
a well-defiQed bank or shoal is advancing from the nearest opposite points, between
which the channel is unfathomable and is less than half a mile wide.

   The growth of coral reefs *, deposits of sand and gravel, &c., cast up by the sea,
may have, in the same way, closed up the hypothetical strait at Akabah, and cut off
the communication between the two gulfs f. Then the upper basin being of great
extent, evaporation from its surface would exceed the supplies poured into it from
the river Jordan, and other small streams, and would therefore cause it to fall, as

well as to contract its limits.

    If this effect of evaporation had not been modified by other circumstances, it would
have left the whole dry bed of the basin with a uniform covering of alluvial deposit.
But the lines of silt seen at different elevations, the terraces, the sand-cliffs, the
flat-topped hills and the parallel beaches, concur in showing that the subsidence of
the surface was not always gradual, but that it has been subject to occasional and
sudden changes of level, of which these are the monumental records.

   On these assumptions, the lake Asphaltites in its original state was the upper end
of a long and narrow arm of the ocean, extending from the base of Mount Hermon,

or Anti-Libanus, nearly 2000 miles, and gradually increasing in breadth from a
few yards at the north end to about 200 miles at the other extremity

   The undulations in the bed of this fissure divided it by narrow straits into several

basins.

   In the same way the upper basin, or the portion cut oft" from the Gulf of Akabah,
would have had also its undulations in the bed, in other words, irregularities in

   The prodigious evaporation from so large a surface would have brought it down,
soon after the separation, from the upper line in the diagram, to the first i rreaularity
or barrier on the second line ; where the further process of evaporation would cause
a division of the waters into two basins, of which the upper, having the Jordan run-
ning through it, would preserve for a time its level at the second line, while the
lower basin, being still so much larger in proportion to the supply, would continue

to fall.

    Suppose it to have fallen to the third line ; and then, the upper basin being still
at the level of the second line, if the weight of water, or the action of the current of
the Jordan on a soft bed, or their combined effect, forced the barrier, the water of
the upper would have been transferred to the lower basin, with a violence that would
have torn up and scoured the sides of its former bed, leaving marks of its action in
rugged ravines, and traces of its ancient level round the margin.

    But if the lower strata of the barrier had been of rock so solid as to resist the
action of the waters at a certain point, then a part of them would have been retained
in the depression, forming a freshwater lake, as the lake Tiberias.

   The process would have been repeated, dividing at the barriers, or shallowest
parts, successively, which having also been forced by the same action, the same
effects would be produced by the violently retreating waters, leaving vestiges, such
as the monticules or conical hills, with their crowning attestations of former levels,
the sand cliffs of the banks of the Jordan, and the more recently formed parallel
beaches near the Dead Sea.

   As the only solid barrier was at the lower end of the lake Tiberias, this is the only

reservoir of fresh water that has remained ; and the Jordan winds its rapid course
through the Ghor to the last deep central basin, where the excessive saltness of the
water will now be naturally accounted for, since it is a condensation of that, which
having been a part of the ocean, was salt ab origine.

   The process of evaporation and depression would continue, till the Dead Sea
should be reduced to such an area, as would just balance the water discharged into
it ; and then the only variations would be in the oscillations of that balance, caused
by extraordinary floods or droughts.

   From a fact observed by travellers in three consecutive years, namely, that a salient
part of the northern shore is sometimes an island, and sometimes a peninsula, it
would appear as if the point of equilibrium has been already attained. Whether
this be the case or no, could be ascertained by careful observation on this fact, or
by comparing fresh lines of soundings with those taken by Lieut. Lynch, U.S.N.,
in the southern portion of the sea, which is extremely shallow.

A proposed new line for a Ship Canal to the East Indies through the Dead

            Sea. By Capt. W. Allen, R.N., F.R.S., F,R.G.S.

Referring to the communication immediately preceding, the author observes that

the extent or elevation of the fiUed-up strait, the water-shed, in fact, between the
Dead Sea and the Gulf of Akabah, remains still undetermined. The depression is

bounded on either side by mountain ranges several thousand feet above the level of
the sea. Those on the east are continuous from Mount Hermon, or Anti-Libanus,
to the Red Sea. Those on the west are broken only between the Lesser Hermon
and Mount Gilboa, by the low plain of Esdraelon ; which is watered by the brook
Kishon, having its principal sources in the neighbourhood of Mount Tabor in the
N.E., and in the mountains of Gilboa to the S.E. They unite near the middle of

the plain, and flow N.W. between a shoulder of Mount Carmel and a spur of the

Nazareth range of hills, to a little estuary in the most sheltered part of the bay of

Acre.

The swelling of the plain is so gentle, that no precise part can be pointed out as

the watershed ; but it is doubtless near the forks of the river at the village of Afuli.

Its elevation is perhaps less than 200 feet above the Mediterranean Sea on the

west, and about 900 feet above the Jordan, with a rapid slope to the east.
   Thus Nature has furnished a stupendous " cutting " of 200 miles in length, sepa-

rated from a sea at either end, by a very slight barrier, which might be cut through,

at the north end at least, with very little trouble and expense, for the plain of Es-

draelon appears to be an alluvium of great thickness, with no obstructions of rock.

The required length of canal here would perhaps be about 25 miles, the greater

part in the already deeply cut bed of the Kishon.

   By damming up the head waters of the Kishon in reservoirs near the junction of

the principal aflSuents, they might be used to sluice out trenches previously prepared

by loosening the soil with mines of gunpowder, &c., so as to work east and west at

the same time, as there is a fall both ways. When these trenches shall have been

cut to a sufficient depth below the level of the sea, its floods being let in, would, it is

imagined, with the aid of gunpowder, soon force a channel wide and deep enough

for navigation.

   Likewise, if the hypothesis of the " dried-up strait " at Akabah should prove to be
correct, the difficulties of removing the barrier at that end may also be inconsiderable.

Of this at present the data are more uncertain, as they depend on observations of

travellers, not made for such an object. But similar aid might be afforded by the

force of a current from the Gulf of Akabah, backed by the Indian Ocean, to clear the

canal.

These barriers being removed, the now Dead Sea would be restored to its ancient

level, and would be converted into the active channel of communication between

Europe and Asia.

   Such operations would, it is true, involve the submergence of a territory, a city,
and some Arab villages belonging to the Sultan. But the territory is useless, the

city is in ruins, the villages are but mud huts or tents, and it is presumed that His

Highness and his subjects would be amply remunerated for the loss of these, by

1852.                                            7

great revenues arising from transit dues, from the increased value of adjacent and
fertile, but rebellious and neglected territories, and lastly, from the facilities the canal
would afford to the pilgrims, who now have a toilsome and dangerous march of more
than six weeks in the desert, between Damascus and Mecca.

On the Antiquities of the Island Ruad, the ancient Aradus, and on the an-
  cient Harbour of Seleucia in Pieria. By Capt. W. Allen, R.N.,

   F.R.S., F.R.G.S.

Travellers, to whom the maritime renown of the Phoenicians is familiar, cannot

fail to be struck by the disproportion of the means by which it was attained. The

island of Tyre, little more than half a mile long, situated near the dangerous coast

Aof Syria, formed their principal harbour.         colony from Sidon took advantage of

similar circumstances at a more northern part of the coast, in the little island of

Aradus, the modern Ruad, which is still smaller yet it soon became so flourishing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

as to be the parent of colonies, and Strabo describes it as full of inhabitants and

lofty houses. The vestiges which remain show that he did not overrate its pros-

perity. It is situated in lat. 34° 48' N. and long. 35° 51' E. ; the extreme length
is about 800 yards, lying N.W. and S.E. ; so that the side towards the coast presents

tolerable protection from the prevalent S.W. wind.

Considering that this little island may again become a place of shelter for ships

in the increasing trade of Syria, and especially as a convenient coal depot for steamers,

Capt. W. Allen, R.N., made a survey of it in the spring of the year 1851*.

The whole N.E. side of the island is converted into two little ports by three piers,

which all more or less show their ancient construction : the most northern is quite

in ruins ; that to the southward still answers its purpose, but is occupied by a mosque,

and therefore could not be examined ; but the middle pier is almost perfect. It is

constructed with massive blocks of sandstone, 16 feet long by nearly 7 in depth and

breadth, placed transversely ; with large bollards at the extremity of the pier. On
either side are quays of concrete, now " a wash." The length of the pier from the

present waterline is 224 feet. In both ports are also traces of similar quays. From

the base of the northern pier is a fine bed of concrete, stretching across the island,

about 150 yards long by 125 yards wide, very nearly level, the slight inclination

being towards the port, where its margin forms the quay. Pococke, with great

reason, supposed that this was used for drawing up the smaller shipping for shelter.

The concrete round by the west is about 30 yards wide, increasing on the south side.

Its probable purpose here was to increase artificially the dimensions of the island,

which having in its natural state been surrounded on the exposed side by numerous

rocks and islets, the summits of these were leveled, and the interstices filled with

the fragments and squared stones, imbedded in concrete as hard as the rock itself,

which it perfectly resembles. Along the three outer sides of the island are gigantic

remains of the ancient walls, which in two places have still five or six courses of

stones, 15 to 18 feet in length, lying transversely and forming the thickness of the

wall. On the west side, however, the wall, for about 10 feet high, is of the solid

rock, which to seaward, at this part only, is cut in the form of a moat and glacis.

AThe purpose of this, doubtless was to break the fury of the waves in S.W. gales.

small culvert, leading from the " moat," through the wall and the concrete, towards

the port, led to the conjecture that the water from the waves rushing up the glacis

being received in the moat at a higher level, might have been conducted by this cul-

vert to the port for the purpose of cleansing it.

The central or natural portion of the island is covered by the modern town, which

has wonderfully increased during the last century. Pococke in 1738 found very few

houses, except in the castles, which were defended by cannon against corsairs. Fifty
years later Volney says, " there does not remain a single wall of that crowd of houses,

which, according to Strabo, were built with more stones than those of Rome itself."
Now, according to the report of an old man, there are 500. "When he was a chilji

there were very few, and he had heard that 100 years ago, there were only 5 houses.

The present inhabitants retain some of the spirit of the ancient Arcadians, as they

are all engaged in maritime affairs, and shipbuilding is carried on with considerable
energy. There is no room for cultivation on this confined spot, so that all sup-
plies are drawn from the mainland, little more than a mile distant. Thej' depend
for water on cisterns, and do not appear to be cognizant of the submarine fountain

described by Strabo.
   With the same view to the probable requirements of increasing commerce of these

rich countries, Capt. Allen made a little survey of the ancient harbour of Seleucia in
Pieria, situated still further to the north, in the bay of Antioch, near the mouth of
the Orontes, in lat. 36° 8' N. and long. 35° .55' 30" E. This noble work consists of
an iplaud basin, connected with a small sea-port by a canal, and of a magnificent
culvert cut through a mountain for the purpose of feeding the one and cleansing the
other, as well as to avert the destructive effects of the mountain torrents.

   The sea-port, noticed in the Acts of the Apostles as the place whence St. Paul em-
barked, is formed by two massive moles, about 200 yards apart. That to the north
is quite a ruin ; the other has its inner part nearly perfect, constructed with large
blocks of stone placed transversely, some of which measured 25 feet, and one, broken,
29 feet 4 inches. This port, though small, was probably sufficient for the reception
of ships preparatory to their entering the basin, and for the purpose of refuge in

bad weather.
   The inner harbour or basin was probably an excavation, with a strong wall front-

ing the sea. It is retort -shaped, communicating with the sea-port by the neckpart,
a canal about a thousand feet in length, and was possibly at a higher level than the
sea, and entered by locks, as Colonel Chesney saw the remains of hinges of gates.
The basin is about 700 yards long by 450 wide. It is now a swamp, through
which a little stream passes to the sea by a gap in the wall. The great culvert is
nearly 1200 yards long, terminating near the sea-port. Its commencement is at
the turning of a little valley, across which an enormous wall was built for the pur-

pose of directing the torrents towards it. This wall has a great portion of it still
standing ; the dilapidated part being in the middle, where probably there were sluice-
gates to feed the basin. The culvert is for the greater part an "open cutting," in

one place not less than 150 feet deep in the solid rock.
    There are two tunnels of 2^ feet aperture, with a channel for the water in the

middle ; which arrangement was doubtless intended to facilitate the removal of frag-
ments of rock that might have been carried thither by torrents. There is also a
conduit at the side to supply the marine suburb of the city with water.

   Some Greek and Latin inscriptions are to be seen in the culvert, but too much de-

faced by time to be legible.
   The principal object Capt. Allen has in view in describing this ancient and splen-

did work, which had been previously examined by other travellers, and especially by
Colonel Chesney, R.A., is to show the facility with which it could he again ren-
dered available for the reception of shipping : for, although each of the three
members of it is dilapidated to a certain extent, enough remains to justify the belief
that its restoration could be accomplished without much labour or expense.

    Both Col. Chesney and Capt. Allen, by independent calculations, estimated the
cost of cleaning the inner harbour, by manual labour entirely, at about ^30,000 ; but
 Capt. Allen considers that by making use of the appliances left by the ancients to
aid in the operations of nature, the greater part of both expense and labour would

be reduced.

    To this end, whether anciently it was a basin above the level of the sea, and
entered by locks or no, he would now propose to make it so, by raising and strength-
 ening the west wall, which is the only part of the circuit of the basin not bounded
by rising ground, so that any depth required might thus be had, as there is a per-

 ennial stream running through it.

   When full, the immense volume of the basin, a surface of about 47 acres, might be

 used as a " backwater " to clear the canal and the sea-port. The piers of this would
 have to be repaired and carried further out seaward, which would be the principal
part of the expense. The culvert and the great wall with its sluice-gates might be

 easily repaired.

    The examination of the ruins of this once-flourishing city not being the principal
 object, Capt. Allen did not devote much time to them, but he visited some magnifi-

                                                                                                            7*

cent sepulchres, excavated in the mountain through which the culvert is cut. From
their dimensions it is probable that they were of the Seleucidae, especially as the
natives call them the " Cave of the Despot." They consist of two large chambers,
ornamented with arches, pillars and sculptured scrolls, &c., containing two prin-
cipal isolated tombs, with numerous loculi in the walls and in the floor. All have
been rifled and stripped of their ornaments. In the neighbourhood of the city are
many sarcophagi, and some vaulted chambers in the face of the cliff's.

    In conclusion, it is hoped that this fine harbour may again become the outlet of
the unrivalled fertility of the neighbouring countries, and be the fitting terminus to
Col. Chesney's projected communication with our possessions in the East Indies by

the river Euphrates.

        On a Railroad through Asia Minor. By W. F. Ains worth.

    The paper, after describing the route intended to be taken, and remarking on the
engineering difficulties and facilities on the way, proposed to connect Constanti-
nople with its Asiatic suburbs by means of a floating viaduct, or tunnel, such as
they have in Wales at present. The author considered that, in the event of this
great undertaking being attempted to be carried out, the better route through Asia
Minor would be along the coast of the Sea of Marmora, rather than, as some scien-
tific gentlemen had recommended, through the mountains of the interior of Ana-
tolia, which Mr. Ainsworth considers it would be next to impossible to surmount.
The Turks, who just now are very much alive to the great importance of commerce,
are engaged in opening a great commercial road from a port on the Black Sea to
Sivaze, a town in the centre of Asia Minor ; and Mr. Ainsworth considered that
the completion of this undertaking would be one of the greatest inducements to the
commencement of the projected railway. Throughout the land route, only in one
instance was it necessary to allude to a tunnel, and that was where the Fawnes
mountain crossed the route, and this, there was reason to hope, could be passed
without a tunnel. Taking the matter all in all, the author pronounced it difficult to
imagine any country better adapted for colonization or improvement. At present,
the country could not be said to be safe from the predatory Arabs, but the Turks
and agricultural Arabs were well-disposed. The road from London to Bombay is
5500 miles ; for 2600 miles of this distance there is already a railway, and works
could be carried on cheaply in Asia Minor from the facility of procuring labour. The
capital required he calculated at twenty-two millions.

On the Distribution of Common Salt, and other Saline Bodies, with a view
  to show their Primary Origin and subsequent Formations. By William

   BOLLAERT, F.R.G.S.

   The attention of the author of this communication was first drawn to the subject
whilst chemical assistant in the laboratory of the Royal Institution about 1824, and
when in Peru shortly afterwards, the occurrence of so much salt from the level of the
sea to great elevations in the Andes was noticed by him. Subsequently, being in the
north part of Mexico, opportunities offered of making other researches.

    Mr, BoUaert, in apaper to the Royal Geographical Society in 18.51, on "Southern
Peru," in noticing the existence of salts bordering the Pacific Ocean, in the mountain-
range of the coast, in the great plains beyond, as well as in the Andes, said that such
a disposition of things would lead one to surmise, that the salt and other saline mat-

ters may derive their origin from other sources than the ocean, viz. volcanic, and the

decomposition of rocks.

   Dr. Daubeny was one of the first to draw attention to the fact, that salt and
muriatic acid are among some of the most abimdant compounds thrown out by vol-
canos ; and his researches fortified Mr. BoUaert's opinion, formed in Peru in 1 826,
that the greater part of salt found from the Andes to the coast may claim a direct

volcanic origin.

   With reference to the author's own observations made in Peru and other places,
as well as those of others in various parts of the world, and omitting here geogra-
phical, geological, chemical, climatalogical and other details, he offers the following
                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.               101

resume as to the origin of common salt and other saline bodies, adverting only to the
more salient points.

   I. Bay-salt, deposited entirely by solar evaporation from sea-water, particularly in
warm latitudes; in Greenland, however, the heat of the few summer days is so great
as to evaporate the water left by the tide among the rocks, and to reduce it to a fine

salt. There is an important commercial fact connected with bay-salt, inasmuch as
it has been found, particularly at Buenos Ayres, to be much better suited to the salt-

ing of meat (which appears to be owing to its containing the deliquescent chlorides)

than the salt procured from the salt-lakes and plains of Patagonia, the latter being

nearly a pure chloride of sodium ; thus the following conclusions may be arrived at,

that the superficial saline deposits in Patagonia and other inland plains in various

parts of the world are not beholden to the ocean for such deposits.

II. Bay-salt, as procured from sea-water by allowing it to run into shallow reser-

voirs on the surface of the ground, where it is partially evaporated by the sun's heat,

and then by artificial means; a purer chloride of sodium is thus obtained, in conse-

quence of the separation of the bittern from it.

III. Another and a harder species of bay-salt is found near the level of the ocean,

a few feet above the sea, particularl}' on the coast of Peru; here it has been but

recently uplifted above the sea.

   IV. Salt is produced in Russia by the freezing of sea-wafer, and then evaporating
the brine. One effect of the low temperature is to decompose a portion of the salt,

and convert the sulphate of magnesia of the brine into sulphate of soda and chlo-

ride of magnesium.
   The formation of sulphate of soda in this way may be the principal cause of its

existence in Peru and other places, that is to say, the saline lakes in the Andean

and other mountainous regions, would in winter be reduced to a low temperature,
when the chemical cliange would be produced ; as summer approached, the snows

above the lakes would melt, and rains would run into the lakes ; these in time would
overflow, causing streams; some of these waters would find their way into rivers and

then into the ocean, whilst others would run into hollows, low lands and plains; and

in such arid countries as Peru, Mexico, Patagonia, parts of Asia and Africa, and

perhaps in Australia, would yield layers of saline materials, the principal one heing

common salt. In Saxony, Sardinia, and some other localities, water from brine-
springs is evaporated by passing over and through " Thorn Houses."

    V. Salt, having risen with the vapour of sea-water or with the spray of the ocean
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

also with the vapour arising from saline inland lakes, as in Asiatic Russia in par-

ticular.

VI. Rock or Fossil Salt is found constituting portions of mountain ranges; in the

Carpathians in Europe ; in the Sulemien mountains in Asia ; also in Thibet, here in
company with borax and muriate of ammonia ; and doubtless the many brine-springs
in the interior of China have their origin from masses of rock salt. As so much salt

is found in the avid parts of Africa, it is reasonable to conclude that the mountains

Wealso contain it.  know that in the mountains of Morocco there is rock salt. To

the east of this section much carbonate of soda (Trona) is found.

The inland waters of Australia are brackish, and its plains covered with saline

materials ; hence we may suppose that in the interior of that large mass of land

there may be rock salt.

   In North and South America there is abundance of rock salt. In the north,
among other ranges affording it, is the Wha-sacht, which is above the Great Salt
Lake of Utah or of the Mormons; in South America, from the Andean region to the
coast, on either side it is found, and in company with many other curious saline bodies.

   From the small per-centage of saline matter in sea-water, not 4 per cent., we can

hardly look to the ocean as the origin of so much pure or almost pure chloride of
sodium existing in mountain regions, but rather to sources of a volcanic character

at different epochs; sub-marine as well as sub-aerial volcanos yielding it. During vol-

canic eruptions, with vast quantities of snljihur and other volatile bodies, the vapoiu"

of muriatic acid escapes, and salt has been found sublimed about craters as well as
muriate of ammonia. Sea-water may find its way into the igneous interior of the

earth; however, the formation of salt in all probability is mainly due to the direct

union of chlorine and sodium ; salt thus formed from its elements in the bowels of the

earth, then ejected through volcanic vents, at times with steam and water as a hbt

saturated solution, at times with earthy matters, the salt afterwards forming masses,

ot in those peculiar orbicular layers, as seen in Cheshire and elsewhere, and such
operations having gone on at various periods and under different circumstances and

elevations, may account for rock or fossil salt being now found below the level of
the sea, above it, and at great elevations on the surface of the globe. Having now

arrived at the supposed origin of rock salt, the next division is proceeded with, viz.

VII. Saline Lakes situated in the elevated regions of India, Thibet, and other parts

of Asia, as well as at lower levels, including the Dead Sea, which is below the ocean ;

the saline lakes of North and South America. In these cases, as already mentioned,

the Waters of melting snows and rain would dissolve the salt formed in high regions,

washing it down into hollows, and then salt lakes would be formed at all elevations,

and when  these waters   became  saturated salt would               be deposited                                                           in summer some
                                                                                                                                        ;

would dry up, leaving a cake of the substance.

VIII. Brine Springs are met with all over the world ; such being formed by water

percolating through the earth, first at high levels, then coming into contact with de-

positions of salt, producing springs, lakes and streams, from which the saline matters

*re found in some cases to remain in hollows and plains, forming large tracts of surface-

salt.

   IX. The saline matters found in the Steppes of Asia, Deserts of Africa, Pampas of
Patagonia, and other places to the north, in the Desert of Atacama, and along the

west coast of America ; and lastly, in the great saline deserts of Mexico, California,
and the United States. In these cases the salt has been brought down by streams

and springs from higher regions to a lower.

X.     Saline bodies formed  by the  decomposition of volcanic      and                                                                    other  rocks                            the
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

albites or soda granites, so common in the New World; the red granites, yielding

potash, as in India, giving rise to nitrate of potash ; such decomposition would go on

at all elevations, and, by the aid of water, the soluble parts would find their way into

lower regions, and ultimately into the ocean.

Mr. Bollaert then describes the section of country from Buenos Ayres to I'otosi and

Lima, also another in South Peru, from Iquique in the province of Tarapaca, lat. 20°

W.12' S., long. 70° 14'  to Potosi, the latter in particular, as being interesting in regard

to the subject of his observations.

   The now important port of Iquique is in the centre of a region where it seldom or
never rains. No water is found on the coast, except where a rivulet may come from
the Andes; such water-courses being very scarce, and often salt. Under the Incas,

Iquique was a fishing-place, and guano was collected there. There is no vegetation

whatever to be seen, and in early times water had to be brouglU from the interior. When

the celebrated silver mines of Huantajaya were discovered in 1556, a few miles inland

from Iquique, then this port was supplied with water from the ravine of Pisagua,

which is to the north ; but of late years, and since nitrate of soda has been shipped
from thence, stills have been employed for the distillation of fresh- from sea-water,
supplying 1000 to 1200 people as well as animals. In some of the plains near the

coast, bay-salt is met with 15 to 20 feet above the sea, the land having been recently

uplifted from it.

   From the sea-shore in many places there is an abrupt rise of 2000 to 3000 feet, at

which level are plains, hollows and undulations ; and rising out of them ranges of

porphyritic and argillaceous mountains 3000 feet higher. Veins of metallic matters

are abundant, gold, copper, lead, arsenic, &c., the silver mines of Huantajaya having

yielded from 1726 to 1826 more than 15 millions sterling. In the hollows, plains

and undulations are extensive superficial collections of salt, containing a little chlo-
ride of calcium. This coast-range is 30 miles wide, and, having passed it, the Great
Plain of Tamarugal is entered, which is 3000 to 3500 feet above the sea, and some
30 miles wide. In the south is the brackish river Loa, with salt streams running
into it ; in the north there are other saline streams. Where water from the Andes

gets into this plain, and it often runs over its surface, and that water not very salt,

there  a few  Tamarugos  (Mimosa)    grow                           and buried under the soil there is much appa-

rently of the same species of tree undergoing a saline fossilization. The author is

strongly inclined to think, that we must look to this surface-water as the vehicle

that has brought down from great elevations the saline matters, such as afe found
                                                                  ;

Aall over this plain, as well as those in the Desert of Atacama.  Curioiis point

about the greater portion of the water obtained from the wells in this plain is, that

although there is so much saline material on the surface, there is little or none of it in
the water. It is in this plain, where there is so great an abundance of salt, nitrate of

soda, sulphate of soda (Glauberite), carbonate of soda (Trona), sulphate and muriate

of lime, and a newly-discovered salt of borax (Hayesine or Hydro-boro-calcite), this
valuable salt is found with and under the beds of nitrate of soda, and often in company
with Glauberite*. With the nitrate of soda, in particular, there are iodic salts t, and
probably bromic. In the hills, on either side of this plain, are large quantities of

native alum or Pickeringite.
   The formation of nitrate of potash in India, and nitrate of soda in South America,

is difficult to explain. It was formerly supposed that the nitrogen required to pro-
duce the nitrate of potash in India came from the decomposition of organic matters

but as the greater portion of nitrate of potash was found in situations affording none,

this opinion was abandoned, and the nitrogen of the atmosphere was resorted to.
With regard to the formation of nitrate of soda in South America, at least in South
Peru, there are no organic matters whatever in the soil from the Andes to the sea-

shore ; for the whole country is, and has been for ages, arid, rocky, sandy, and marly
saliferous deserts. The nitrogen and oxygen of the air may possibly yield, in some way
or other, nitric acid, when assisted by tropical heat, the chemical rays of the sun and
moisture ; westill, if have to look to volcanic sources for the formation of salt and
other chlorides, why not recur there also for the origin of the nitrates, sulphates,

borates, iodates, &c.^?

  A short remark on the probable cause of the South Peruvian deserts maynot be

out of place here. The S.S.E. wind, having been deprived of much of its humidity

in traversing the continent of America, arrives in the frozen regions of the Andes, so

dry as not to be in a position to deposit any moisture of consequence ; and this dry
or S.S.E. wind blowing across the lands of the west coast, appears to be the main

cause of its present desert character.

   The nitrate of soda has as yet only been met with on the western side of the Pampa

de Tamarugal, and the deposits of it have interruptions or spaces covered with salt.
The nitrate grounds vary in breadth, but are of great length, and in places 7 to 8 feet

thick, sometimes quite pure.

   The Caliche, or rough nitrate of soda, is boiled in water, the nitrate is held in solu-
tion, whilst the salt and earthy parts fall to the bottom of the boiler : the saturated
solution is run into troughs to crystallize, and is then ready for sale.

   The principal occupation of the Province of Tarapaca is in the nitrate of soda trade,

the article being shipped from Iquique to Europe, where it is used as a fertilizer in

the manufacture of nitric and sulphuric acids, &c.
   There is sufficient nitrate for the consumption of Europe for ages to come. The

supply, however, at present for export cannot be much augmented over 30,000 tons

annually, in consequence of the scarcity of beasts of burden in this desert country to

convey it from the oficinas or works to the port of Iquique. Since 1830 to 1851, the

exports have been about 240,000 tons, one of the principal exporters being Mr.

G. Smith, to whom the Province is greatly indebted for his perseverance in esta-
blishing this new branch of trade.

   Having traversed the Pampa de Tamarugal, ranges of sandstone mountains present

   * The boracic acid of Tuscany and borax from India is almost monopolized by one party

in England; the price for British refined being in November, 1852, £4 to £i is. per
cwt. Now it would be important if supplies of the boro-calcite from Tarapaca could be ob-

tained. Mr. Smith fears it only exists in small quantities there, but in which opinion T do
not quite concur. According to his views as to the origin of salt and many other saline
bodies being volcanic, the author would recommend a search for nitrates, borates, iodates,
&c., in those dry and desert saline districts, the more particularly where there are evidences

of volcanic influences.

   t Hayes found in a sample of nitrate of soda, 0*63 iodic salts, composed of iodate of soda
and chloro-iodate of magnesia.

    In November, 1851, dry iodine sold for 6^rf. to Id. per oz., but at the same period, 1852j
it had risen from Is. 3d. to Is. Gd. Thus in these salts from Tarapaca we have another source
of iodine.

themselves, at the base of which there is mucli sulphate of soda and some carbonate,

and a little higher up large quantities of gypsum. Ascending, a broken mountainous

country is attained, where, on account of it receiving some rain, coarse pastures.

Cacti and some brushwood are met with ; here saline matters would be found, but that

the rains wash them into the lower country. In this district there are gold and cop-

per veins in abundance ; and on examination, it is thought that Lavadero or grain-gold
will be met with : and there are extensive plains in the Andes, at 14,000 and 15,000

feet, out of which rise ridges and knots of mountains; that of Lirima is supposed to

be 24,000 to 25,000 feet above the sea.

In this Andean volcanic region there is among others a great salt deposit known as

the Pampa de Sal : it is a few miles to the east of the volcano and town of Isluga. The

volcano  is  in    9°  1 2' S.,  68°  50' W.  The volcano and salt plain was first made known

                 1

hi Europe by Messrs. I3ollaert and Smith in 1827 ; and it was on beholding so large a

collection of salt in the elevated position of nearly 15,000 feet, that so strongly im-

pressed Mr. Bollaert with the idea that we ought to look for the origin of the greater

portions of saline materials to direct volcanic sources.

This Pampa de Sal extends to near Potosi, varying in breadth from 3 to 8 leagues,

the saline matters being 8 to 10 inches thick. In this elevated region there are

many lakes, some containing fish. Many of these lakes are salt; how can they be

otherwise, when saline bodies exist in more elevated regions, ejected in all probability

from craters and fissures, the whole country being pre-eminently volcanic? In this

way we may reasonably account for the large quantities of fossil salt in the mountains

of Chili, Peru, Mexico, and in those of the United States; also in the more elevated

portions of Europe, Asia and Africa ; and ihe melting of snows and rains would wash

much of this soluble material into the sea.

        Observations on the Euphrates Line of Communication with India.

                 By Colonel Chicsney, B.A., D.C.L., F.R.S.

   In compliance with the request of a distinguished member of the British Asso-
ciation, Dr. Robinson, whose continued interest in the subject of the Euphrates line
of communication with India is a source of extreme gratification to me, I have put
together a few obsei-vations for the purpose of showing,-- 1st, what was the past
state of the overland communication with India; and 2ndly, what may be done to

accelerate if not to perfect this intercourse.

   Had not the want of the means promised by Government prevented the appear-
ance of the remainder of my work, it would have been unnecessary for me now to

enter upon the subject of our communication with the East, since the succeeding

volumes would have contained all the details of the Expedition.
    The use of the overland route dates almost from the discovery of India itself.

We find that the far-seeing Elizabeth maintained a fleet at Bir to facilitate trade

along the Euphrates, which being then the high road to India, was constantly made
use of by Balbi, Fitch, and others, who had occasion to pass by that line with mer-
chandize. The route from Europe was by Alexandretta and Aleppo to Bir on the
Euphrates, whence the goods were carried by boats, partly for the use of the inha-
bitants of the country, and partly for India, whither the products of Europe were
conveyed at this period, by way of the Persian Gulf.

   Space and time will not permit us to discuss the latter subject, but I may remind
you that in the time of Herodotus, Mesopotamia was the most productive country
in the world ; and as it still retained a portion of its commercial wealth at the
period of which we have just been speaking, this route was but the continuation,

or rather the remains of the trade, of Tyre, Sidon, Eg}'pt, &c., and not, as has been

frequently imagined, the adoption by the Levant Company, of a new and shorter
line than that by the Cape of Good Hope.

   Up to the time when the East India Company ceased to trade, Bushire, Bassorah,

and Baghdad, were productive seats of commerce. But although their value to
England has greatly diminished in consequence of the cessation of the commercial
intercourse which previously existed, I may just observe, that it appears from official

returns (which are given in my work), that the trade between India and the Persian

Gulf is still about two millions annually.
                               --

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      105'

   The line of the Euphrates, however, had, as it still continues to have, another
advantage for England. The direct line from London passes by Vienna, Constanti-
nople, and Asia Minor, to Aleppo, from v^rhence, by the desert of Arabia, it reaches

Bassorah.

    Messengers in Europe, and Tartars in Arabia, used to accomplish this journey in

from twenty-five to thirty-six days ; and fast-sailing schooners carried the despatches
along the Persian Gulf to Bombay in about twelve days more.

   The route by the Red Sea had been used in the same manner, but being less
speedy by a great deal, the regular transit was continued through Arabia up to the
peace of 1815; and it was considered of such importance, that, on examining
in the archives of Bombay the result of the intercourse by this route in 1836, I
found that instead of trusting to the Secretaries, the communications on this sub-

ject were from the pen of Lord Wellesley himself.

   My acquaintance with Mesopotamia commenced in this way :

    Purposing to assist in the defence of Turkey against the Russians in 1829, I pro-

ceeded to Constantinople in that year ; but arrived, as it proved, almost at the close

of the war, and I consequently undertook a journey into Asia with the object of
examining the proposed hnes of communication with India. Public anxiety on this
subject led to a series of queries being drawn up by Mr. Peacock of the India House,

which fell into my hands, and decided me to attempt the examination of these
routes ; for I was one of those who began to see, in part at least, what might be done

by steam.
    In a lecture at which I was present in 1802, Mr. Walker, in noticing the embryo

--power of steam, made this remarkable prophetic observation : " The day," said he,

" will arrive, when, instead of changing horses, we shall only require to Hght a
coal." Already this grand idea has been realized almost to the letter, and I may

live to see it equally carried out, by means of a railroad and electric telegraph be-

tween England and India.
    But to return from this digression. Provided with Mr. Peacock's queries, I

 examined the route by Cosseir and the Nile, as well as that across the isthmus of
Suez, and a detailed report was made to Government through the Right Hon. Sir

Robert Gordon, allowing twenty-two days between Bombay and Alexandria.
    This, I believe, was the first proposal, at least the first founded on examination,

for opening a steam communication by way of the Red Sea. It is not therefore

 surprising, steam by sea being then in its very infancy, that the Earl of Clare, in

commenting on my paper, should have said, in allusion to the time allowed, " The

misfortune is that Capt. Chesney endeavours to make out a case." I need scarcely
add, that the energy and activity of Waghorn has performed in fifteen, and even
twelve days, that transit for which I had allowed twenty-two.

   In proceeding from Egypt towards the Euphrates, which was my next object,
difficulties and impediments occurred in consequence of my having been carried off

by the Arabs for some time, and over a considerable tract of country. I must not,
however, occupy your time by describing a journey which I still remember with the

 deepest interest.

   On regaining my freedom, I continued my journey across the great desert, and.

 succeeded in reaching the Euphrates.
    The line taken from Damascus was that by Palmyra ; the country was not sandy,

 but part of it had a hard pebbly surface, while the rest was undulating, and covered
 with sheep grass, not unlike the Dorsetshire downs. A slight illness so far dis-

armed the suspicions of the Arabs, as to offer an excuse for my going by the river.;
and having taken leave of my camels, I caused a raft to be constructed of hurdles

 supported on thirty- three inflated sheep-skins, on which, accompanied by three

 Arabs, I was fairly launched on the great river Euphrates.
    The compass gave me the bearings, and the depth of the river was ascertained by

 means of a pole going down from the bottom of the raft, by which means I avoided
 the suspicions that would have been raised by the ordinary method of sounding.
 The raft was kept mid-stream during the day, and was secured to a bank by night,
 and thus made its way to Felujab opposite Baghdad, not however without some
 difficulties and even dangers, such as being fired at by the Arabs from the banks,

and being three times robbed of my money under the name of a tax. The condition
--106 HEPORT 1852.

of an isolated individual deprived of all resources when at such a distance from
Europe, may appear to have been almost desperate ; but, strange to say, I succeeded,
through the influence of the English name, in borrowing funds from the very indi-
viduals who had previously robbed me, and the descent by Babylon to Bassorah, and
ultimately across the Persian Gulf, was happily accomplished.

   I must not attempt more than a very general description of the Euphrates, but I
may observe that I found it deserved even more than its celebrated name as the

fourth river of Paradise.

    It is wide, deep, and highly picturesque, flowing between ancient aqueducts and
irrigating mills, some of which are of modern construction also, with frequent vil-
lages and occasional towns, sometimes seated on islands, at others on the banks of
the river, amidst luxuriant groves of date-trees, and occasionally, as in the neigh-
bourhood of Babylon, surrounded by the richest wheat cultivation.

   I now laid down and sent home, a map of that part of the river which had been
examined ; and recollecting that my temporary captivity had deprived me of the

opportunity of visiting the country between Seleucia and the river Euphrates,
above and below Bir, 1 traversed about 1700 miles of Persia, passing through
Ispahan and several other great cities of that kingdom, to the sources of the
Euphrates, and also travelled over some 1800 miles through Asia Minor, which

enabled me to examine the country between the Mediterranean and the upper part

of the river.

   These explorations occupied three years and a quarter ; their result was a printed
report to Government, submitting at the same time, that a steam communication
with India should be opened alternately by the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. I
believed then, as I do now, that our great kingdom requires a second line, even if
we were free from all chance of interruption and even irrespectively of the mercan-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

tile and other advantages which belong to the route through Arabia.
   This report had scarcely appeared, when I was summoned to St. James's, and

after going into the question in much detail, the King (William the Fourth) took a
lively interest in the comparative merits of the Red Sea and River Euphrates lines,
observing, that as a sailor, he considered that about one-half the distance of open

sea gave a manifest advantage to the latter.
   The subject was next taken up by Lord Palmerston, Ijord Ripon, the Marquis of

Lansdowne, and Mr. Grant, now Lord Glenelg, and after a lengthened examination
by a Committee of the House of Commons, ,^'20,000 were voted for an Expedition
to the Euphrates and Tigris, in the command of which I sailed early in the

year 1835.

    It consisted of two flat-bottomed iron steamers, the fifth and sixth of the kind
that had been built, with a competent staff of scientific and other officers, together
with detachments of artillery and sappers, all of whom, having been originally boiler-
makers, mill-wrights, &c., were prepared to assist in putting up the vessels, which
we carried out in pieces.

   The upper Euphrates near Bir was the place selected for this purpose, as we
considered we should there be less likely to meet with opposition from the Arabs,
than if we had landed with this object at the mouth of the river ; moreover there
are two cities, Antioch and Aleppo, on this line, and many villages which offered great
facilities in men, animals, &c.

   Accordingly the Expedition landed at the mouth of the Orontes, where, contrary
to previous promises and arrangements, we found ourselves stopped by the Pasha of
Egypt, who was then in authority.

   In this dilemma, I determined, instead of sailing away to go round to India, to
disembark the steamers and their equipments, and having formed a camp, about
400 tons of materials were deposited on the banks of the Orontes, and the Co-
lumbine sloop of war and transport which had brought them, took their departure,
by way of proving to Mohammed All that the Expedition was not to be stopped.
Open impediments ceased after a time, but underhand opposition still met us in
every quarter, when we had roads to make, waggons to construct, and men as well
as animals to collect. The delays consequent upon this state of things brought us
to the ordinary impediments of the rainy season ; but at length all difficulties were
overcome, the diving-bell was rolled under the surface of the water to be carried

onward, and the last piece of boiler, weighing seven tons, and drawn by 104 bullocks,
entered Port William under a triumphal arch, and thus the extraordinary energy
and perseverance of the officers and men of the Expedition accomplished, what a
French writer termed " the gigantic operation" of transporting this and the Other heavy
weights a distance of 147 miles, frequently over difficult country, from the Orontes to
Port William on the Euphrates.

   This operation consumed all the funds of the Expedition, and having been told by
Government that no more would be given, I was forced either to stop, or to find the
funds myself. I felt that if I decided on the former course, it would lead to the belief

that we had failed, and I therefore ventured to draw on my friends iX home for Up-
wards of j^2000, and as a compensation for this unpleasant alternative, we had the

pleasure of seeing two steamers floated, one 108 feet long, and both completely
arracJ and equipped for the intended service, with ample supplies of provision and
fuel. The latter is found abundantly of two kinds, viz. mineral pitch, and plenty
of Tamarisk wood, which gave nearly a knot an hour more speed than coal.

   The descent and survey of the river now commenced. For the latter purpose two
boats preceded the vessels day by day, sounding and taking bearings, and the officer
in charge of this party became the pilot of the steamers next day for so much of the
river as he had thus explored.

    In this way our operations were peaceably and successfully carried on, till on one
portentous morning, we discovered a cloud, like a man's hand, coming towards us
with fatal speed. All efforts were made to secure the vessels in time, and the lesser

 one, the Tigris, even reached the bank, but the whirlwind of the desert had reached
 her at the same instant, and though still in its infancy, such was its violence, that
 that unfortunate vessel recoiled from the bank, and was held as if in a vice, heeling
 over. The storm soon attained its greatest power. The Euphrates was backed at

 this moment to avoid a collision with the unfortunate Tigris, and at 1 p.m. we

 floated past as a mere log, in the midst of darkness deeper than that of night, im-
 mense waves breaking over and into the ill-fated vessel, till she was carried to thfe
 bottom in seven fathoms water, the helmsman and all others remaining firmly at
 their posts. So fearftil and so violent had been the effects of this whirlwind from
 the desert, which would have blown a frigate out of the water, that portions of the
 paddle-boxes Were in the fields befote I and seven others reached the shore.

 Twenty of my brave companions had scarcely found a watery grave when a calm
 succeeded the hurricane, which had run its whole course in fifteen minutes. Had it

 lasted eight or ten minutes more, the Euphrates, though secured to the bank with
 chain cables and large jumpers driven into the earth, must have gone to the bottom
 also. The Arabs, however, showed the greatest kindness ; for instead of taking ad-
 vantage of our condition, as is unhappily frequently the case in our more civilized
 country, they gave us every possible assistance by collecting the remains of the
 goods, &c. Our loss however was very, very great; 1100 drawings, and all the
 accounts of the Expedition, all the money, with a large quantity of stores, &c., went

  to the bottom.

     This catastrophe happened at Werdi, about half-way between the Mediterranean
  and Persian Gulf, or nearly 500 miles from either ; at the Very spot where I first
  came upon the river, and also near the place where the apostate Julian lost the
  greater part of his fleet from a similar storm. The Arabs told us they had often
  witnessed storms, but never one such as this had been.

      I had been saved, and therefore I could not despair, though half the river still
  remained to be navigated, I had now the painful task of comnlunicating what I
  had hitherto concealed from the officers and men, the orders to break up the Expe-
  dition as soon as it should reach the Persian Gulf. I announced that I considered
  the late calamity would justify a departure from these orders, and being nobly
  seconded by the officers, who gave up their pay to lessen the expenses, we happily
  continued our survey and descent by Babylon to Bassorah, where we fired seventy-
  two guns, one for every year of our watm-hearted monarch King William.

     The expected supplies had not yet reached the Persian Gulf from India, but they
  were received at a later period, and we renewed our operations by ascending more
  than 300 miles of the river Tigris, to the city of the Kaliphs, Baghdad. The
  steamer everywhere created surprise if not amazement. On one occasion, an Arab,
                    .

108 REPORT-- 1852.

placing his head between his knees, was heard to exclaim, " Has God only made
one such creation"? The Arabs had a kind of prophecy that when iron should
swim on the water, their dominion was to end, and they came in consequence hun-

dreds of miles to ascertain the fact that it really did swim.

   On descending again to Bassorah, we found the Hugh Lindsay with a mail and

passengers from Bombay. We took both on board, and immediately commenced

the ascent of the Euphrates. But when we had reached the distance of nearly 200

miles, the cross-head of the engine snapped, and it became necessary to drop down

to Bassorah, and to send the mail by land to England.

   The officer who took charge of it is now Captain Fitz James, one of those Arctic

voyagers, to ascertain whose fate England is now making such meritorious, and let

us trust they will prove successful exertions.

   I now proceeded to India to urge the continuance of the enterprise, and the

engine having been repaired. Colonel Estcourt, who was left in charge, ascended to

Baghdad, after exploring the river Karun, &c. Fresh orders were however received

to break up the Expedition, and the party returned to England by land, while I

followed taking from Bombay important despatches. With these documents I made

Mya desert journey of nearly 1000 miles from sea to sea.  party consisted of two

Arabs with four camels. The compass guided our steps by day and the stars by

Wenight, and thus the journey to Damascus was accomplished in nineteen days.

occasionally halted in Arab tents, when I heard them speaking of Chesney Beg, who

having shaved oiF his beard was not recognized by them

   On reaching England, I received a communication from Prince Metternich, ex-

pressing his readiness, his earnest desire indeed, to meet the supposed Indian line at

Scanderoon ; but the British Government did not enter into the question at all,
beyond turning it over to the East India Company. Three river steamers were

however afterwards floated by the Company on the Mesopotamian rivers, and Cap-

tain Campbell of the Indian Navy successfully ascended the Euphrates as high as

Beles. Captain Lynch of the Indian Navy (who was one of the officers of the

Expedition), in his descent of the river, crossed by one of the ancient canals flowing

from the Euphrates to the Tigris, into the latter river. The necessities of the ser-

vice during the Affghan war, caused these vessels to be taken to the river Indus, and

the question of their navigation remained in abeyance till last autumn. The Turkish
Government then took the matter up, and after some reference to me, two steam-

vessels of suitable dimensions have been constructed by Messrs. Laird of Birkenhead,

and will speedily be launched on the rivers of Mesopotamia. I feel, however, no

small anxiety lest a great undertaking should fall to the ground from want of

competent management, such as might be found by British enterprise, either on this

or any other line.

Of late the Eastern Steam Navigation Company', in competing with the Peninsular

and Oriental Company, appears to have come to the conclusion that long and

powerful steamers, using both the screw and paddles, might reach India by the Cape

in about thirty-two days, and it is understood that vessels of this description are

now being built. Admitting that the most complete success should attend this

great undertaking, and that a distance of 10,790 miles should be accomplished

within the specified time, it is quite clear that this line will have to compete with

vessels of similar power on the shorter lines, namely, the one of about 5238 miles

by the Red Sea, and that of 4823 miles by the Euphrates.

Of another line, that by America, which is to be brought before this Section, I

know little or nothing, but it seems clear to me that either of the other two must

have manifest advantages. As the communication by the Red Sea has for a long

time been as regular as can he desired, it only remains to notice the facilities belonging

to the line through Asiatic Turkey and Persia, and again by the same line of country,

partly by railroad and partly by steam-vessels.

  A railway already exists from London to Hungary, and ere long it may reach

Constantinople, either by crossing the Balkan partly by means of stationary engines,

or coasting the sea-shore by way of Varna, in order to turn this chain, and thus

reach Constantinople with facility. The great chains of Asia Minor present, as I

know, and as you have seen by Mr. Ainsworth's paper, very serious impediments,

but not such as might not be overcome by the science of the present day; and having

once attained the valley of the Mesopotamiau rivers, the line might be continued
along the southern shores of Persia and the coast of Mekkran to India.

But, although practically attainable, the enormous expense on the one hand, and

the unsettled state of this part of the country on the other, render such a line of

may therefore postpone the consideration of all that is eastward of the Euphrates,
and confine the question to a railway through Arabia, having a steamer to India

from one extremity, and another to Trieste from the other. The line supposed is to
quit the Mediterranean at the Bay of Antioch, and pass from thence by ancient

Aleppo to the Euphrates at Jaber, and so along the right bank of the river to its
estuar)', a distance of 715 miles. Were this completed, with the assistance of
powerful steamers at each extremity, letters might reach Bombay from London
in eighteen or nineteen days, and messages, partly by electric telegraph, in ten

days.

    Seven hundred and fifteen miles of a single lino of railway on the American plan,

might be executed for about ^5,720,000, or with two powerful steamers on the
Arabian, and as many on the European side, for about ^6,000,000 sterling, including
the necessary port in the Bay of Antioch.

    Instead, however, of engaging in the first instance in such a serious outlay, tem-

porary, and by no means costly arrangements can be made. There is, as we all
know, a railway open to Trieste, from whence the Austrian Lloyd's Company
vessels would carry the mails and passengers to Scanderoon, which, as a temporary
harbour, requires no outlay whatever. From thence by the Bir-line, it is but 110
miles to Beles on the Euphrates, between which place and Bassorah small steamers
might be used

    Such an opening as this as a commencement, might be accomplished with a bond
fide capital of .^50,000. or at the outside, .^80,000 ; and if the undertaking were
conducted bj' practical men, I should have no fears as to its result. For the tem-
porary land journey, either camels might be used, with frequent relays, or the car-
riages of the country, called Tack-i-van, which are carriages slung between two
camels or horses ; and the necessary protection from place to place being connected
with the hire of the animals, this would give large employment to the Arabs, and
their interest would go hand in hand with the undertaking.

   During our extensive intercourse with them, the Arabs showed the most favour-
able disposition towards us; and they were not only glad to be emploj'ed, but proved
remarkably faithful, not only in transporting goods and stores, but in money also.
All our stores, and upwards of ^6000 were safely carried in small sums from time
to time by Arab messengers, without any loss whatever, and the existence of com-
mercial intercourse for renturies in Arabia, is the best proof that no great difficulty
can attend more extended relations with this people.

   As the fertility of Mesopotamia greatly exceeds that of Egypt, being capable of
growing indigo, cotton, sugar, grain, and wool to any amount, this country opens
a vast field for agricultural and commercial enterprise, with the safe and productive
investment of capital. Besides the advantages of a postal communication with
India, alternately with that by the Red Sea, a ready intercourse with Southern
Persia, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and Kurdistan, must greatly extend the outlets for
our manufactures, and would probably afford at the same time desirable localities

for colonization.

   The climate is healthy, and it could be easily shown by calculation, that there
would be ample returns for the capital of any company that may be judiciously

organized. One of my officers, Mr. Hector, remained on the Euphrates, and com-

mencing from nothing, has realized a small independence by the occasional freight-
age of a ship from England with cotton and other goods. The natives, both of Arabia
and Asia Minor, are anxious for European manufactures, which, when I was in
Mesopotamia, were chiefly obtained from Russia, and of an inferior quality. These
goods were retailed by the native merchants at an enormous price, their profit being
generally cent, per cent. It is however necessary to consult the taste of the natives
in cottons, muslins, and other manufactures, to ensure success. The Russians have
done this judiciously, and have secured popularity for their goods.

   Much more might be said on the subject of commerce ; but setting aside all these
considerations, let us reflect for a moment on the vast field that would be opened to

scientific research and observation, in countries so rich in remains of early civiliza-
tion, so deeply interesting to the antiquarian and the historian, so fertile in produc-
tions for the naturalist and botanist. To the ethnologist, geologist, .and geo-
grapher also, the opening of this fine of route would be of inestimable value, while
to be the means of re-introducing Christianity and civilization to regions hallowed
by the most sacred associations is surely an object worthy of the best efl^orts of the
British people. The Mesopotamian rivers should not be allowed to remain almost
useless to mankind, and I cannot relinquish the hope that I shall yet see this long-
cherished desire, fully and judiciously realized.

   To carry out the whole project of a railway through Arabia, only ^1,205,000
would be required, and the annual cost would be about ^140,000. The greater
object of a railway to India all the way, would require about j£''33, 800,000. But

my proposal only requires for a beginning .^^50,000 or ,£80,000, to be gradually
increased as success crowns our efforts to a capital of j^l, 205,000; and we may

leave the question of the ,^33, 000,000 for our sons or our grandsons.

      On certain Ancient Mines. By the Rev. Edward Hincks, D.D.

    There are two places in the Cuneatic inscriptions in which mines or quarries are
mentioned. The first is on the obelisk, brought from Nimriid, where the following

--passage occurs. It is Divanubar, king of Assyria, who speaks : " In my twenty-

second year (about 878 b.c), I crossed the Euphrates for the twenty-first time. I

went down to Tabal. I received their tributes from twenty-four kings of Tabal. I
went to the mines of silver, of salt, and of gypsum." The last-named substance is
identified by its being that of which certain colossal bulls are said to have been
made. The country where these mines existed must be a part of Cappadocia ; and,
from the number of its kings, it is evident that it was of considerable extent. It
appears, from the inscriptions, that it bordered on KhelaJcku, which Colonel Raw-
linson has identified with Cilicia. Its name is probably preserved, in a slightly cor-
rupted form, in Tavros, the name given by the Greeks to the mountain chain which
lay in the south of it. So Wararadh, or Ararat, was properly the name of a
country, but is now applied to a mountain in the east of this country. As a more
familiar instance, Mourne is properly the name of a barony, but is best known as
that of a mountain chain which lies in it. In this country, Mr. Ainsworth ha^
                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                 Ill

mentioned two salt mines, one near Kankari, and the other at Tuz Koi, near Neu

Shehr. The latter is described as an imnaense bed of salt, in which a pit was

originally dug, round which shafts are now sunk. G)'psura quarries are found in

abundance in this district, as is also marble ; but of this substance it appears that

no bulls have yet been found. No mines of native silver exist in the country ; such
a mine may have ejiisted formerly, and have been exhausted ; but it is more probable

that the mine was of argentiferous galena, the reduction of which is less difficult

than of copper ore ; and we know that the mode of reducing this was known many
centuries before the date of this inscription. Such a mine exists at Denek Tagh,

about eighty miles north of the salt mine. [M. de Tchihatchef mentioned another

silver mine, lying between this and Sivas, which he thought more likely to have

been visited by the Assyrian king.] The other passage in an Assyrian inscription

is in the annals of Sargon. In Botta's pi. 83, 1. 9, under the 11th year (711 b.c.),

when he took Ashdud, the king of which fled to Egypt, there occur the words,
" Baal Zephon {Bahil Zapuna) the great mine of copper." The preceding and fol-

lowing words are lost. The earliest known copper mines are those in the peninsula

Aof Mount Sinai.     place called Surdhat El Khadeni attracted much attention some

years ago. It was believed to be an Egyptian place of pilgrimage. Some pillars

were found there, containing dates in the reigns of many Egyptian kings, and these

were believed to be tombstones. At length Lepsius visited the place, and ascer-

tained that it was a great copper mine ; and that the pillars contained records of its

being worked at the times mentioned, and invocations of Hathor, the Egyptian

Venus, who presided over the country. This connexion of Venus with copper, in

the worship of both this country and Cyprus, and in the fancies of the alchemists,

was noticed as a curious coincidence that required explanation. On the Nimriid

obelisk are the tributes of five nations, the first and fifth of which offer copper ; and

this was, no doubt, a production of their countries. The name of the first nation is

Gilzan, probably the Gozan of scripture. The name probably signifies the country

of the Gelae, whom Strabo places on the shore of the Caspian sea. It is

the modern Ghilan. Here is the celebrated copper mine of Shichterabad, which

Colonel Monteith says is probably not exceeded by any in existence for richness

and facility of working. It is near a river which is called at this day Ozan. The

second tribute is that of Jehu, king of Israel. The third is of a country formerly

supposed to be Egypt, the name of which very closely resembled its name ; but it is
the hillj'^ country to the east of Nineveh, and not very far from it. The fourth tri-

bute is supposed to be that of a nation on the west of the Persian Gulf. The fifth

is, according to Colonel Chesney, that of the people on the opposite coast of the

Gulf where copper is found. The mode of reading this name is uncertain, the first

character having different values. Dr. Hincks was disposed to read it Shiruiinay,

identifying it with the Sharutana of the Egyptian inscriptions, or the people of

Cyprus ; but the appearance of the people was, according to Colonel Chesney, so

decidedly Persian that he would not press this point. He, however, went on to

state his reasons for believing the Sharutana to be from Cyprus, as it led to some
interesting conclusions. They are called " the Sharutana of the sea," and this is
analogous to a phrase " of the middle of the sea," which, in the Cuneatic inscrip-

tions, is added to certain names implying insular position. This is one of the few

Apoints on which Dr. Hincks and Colonel Rawlinson differ.                                          series of names of

people are mentioned on a great slab at Nimrud, as paying tribute to the father of

Divanubar. This list begins with the Tyrians and ends with the people of Arwad.

Then comes this phrase, which Colonel Rawlinson supposed to apply to all the

people, and to mean that they lived on the sea coast ; but Dr. Hincks supposes it to

belong to the last people only, and to imply that they lived in an island. The same

phrase  is appended  to two  other names                                                           and this difference as to its interpretation
                                                                                                ;

Wehas led to very different views of what these names apply to.                                    have the Yavnay,

who arementioned in several places, and particularly as being employed by Sen-

nacherib to navigate his vessels, along with Tyrians and Sidonians. Colonel Raw-

linson makes them to be the people of Jabneh, in Palestine, but Dr. Hincks believes

them to be the lonians, or people of the Grecian islands. But what is more inter-

esting is, that Luli, the king of Sidon, is said to have fled from Tyre to a place

named, according to Colonel Rawlinson, Yatnan, and supposed by him to be Rhi..
112 REPORT 1852.

nocolura, on the frontiers of Egj^pt. He evidently believes that Luli fled by land.
Dr. Hincks reads the name Yavaii, and believes it to be the country to which the
Yavnay belonged, or the Grecian islands, including perhaps Crete. He observed
that, in the Khorsabad inscriptions, an invasion of seven kings of this country is men-

tioned, and they are said to have been seven days on their voyage. This implies

that they came from Crete, or from beyond it. What makes this matter most in-

teresting is, that the flight of the Tyrians to Yavan, which is represented in the se-
venty-first plate of Mr. Layard's Monuments of Nineveh, seems to be the fulfilment
of the prophecy in Isaiah xxiii. 12. Tyre, the daughter of Sidon, is here passing
over to Chittim. Commentators have looked to the time of Nebuchadnezzar for the
fulfilment of this prophecy ; but here is a more direct fulfilment than could have
occurred then, more than 100 years earlier, and not above fifteen years after the
prophecy was delivered. The sculpture evidently refers to a flight, not to a warlike

expedition, as women and unarmed persons are represented in the ships ; and an
adjoining slab represented the castle of Tyre on the sea shore, and a woman, who
had embarked, receiving a child from a man on the shore. After this digression,

the identity of " Baal Zephon, the great copper mine,' with the place of that name,
before or over against which Pihahiroth was situated, was maintained. Baal Zephon
was supposed to be Surabat el Khadem ; and it was maintained that Pihahiroth
must be on the part of the coast which fronted this mine ; a position which agreed
with that of the coast south of Rds 'Atdkah, but by no means with any part of the
coast north of it. This was considered to refute the opinion which so many have
adopted of late years, that the Israelites crossed the sea in the neighbourhood of
Suez. Dr. Hincks observed, in conclusion, that the truth of the narrative in the
book of Exodus was one for the theologian and not for the geographer. The po-
sition of Pihahiroth, whether close by Suez or to the south of Ras 'Atakah, was a
geographical question. If the former opinion prevailed, another geographical ques-
tion arose, whether a multitude of people could ci.tss the sea in that place, under
any circumstances of wind or tide, without the laws of nature being suspended. But
if the latter opinion be adopted, there is no room for this second question. Every
one must admit, that, below the Cape, if the Israelites crossed at all, they must
have crossed the broad and deep sea, when the water must have stood as a wall on
their right hand and on their left, as the narrative expressly aflSrms that it did.

taking advantage of this clause, Mr. Macleod proposes to open the Niger and the

and source or sources of that river.

          Notes on the Distribution of Animal Life in the Arctic Regions.

                         By A. Petermann, F.R.G.S.

    The occurrence of animals in the arctic regions, and its bearing on the missing
expedition under Sir John Franklin, is a subject which has of late excited a good
 deal of interest, and has given rise to the most conflicting opinions : some have
maintained the existence of animals in the arctic regions in great numbers, afford-
ing abundance of food to man; others as stoutly insisted upon the extreme
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIOX.S.                                  113

scarcit)', if not total absence, of animals. Mr. Petermann then proceeded to state,

that the views hitherto entertained regarding this subject were narrow, circum-

scribed, and consequently erroneous ; that individual observations in particular

localities, comprised within a small space on the American side, had been received

as data upon which to build general statements regarding the entire arctic re-

gions, though in such observations the whole Asiatic side of the polar basin had

been altogether overlooked. Arguments were then adduced, from the geographical

features, and natural history of those northern regions, to prove that the commonly

received hypothesis, that with ascending latitudes there was a proportional descent

of temperature, and a consequent decrease of animal and vegetable life, is a fal-

lacious one. With regard to the bearing of these observations upon the Franklin

--expedition, Mr. Petermann further remarked : The general opinion is that the

missing vessels have been arrested somewhere between Wellington Channel and

Behriug's Straits, and the Siberian shores. Most probably their position is nearer

to the latter than to the former points. As these three regions abound in animal

life, we may fairly conclude that the intervening portion partakes of the same cha-

racter ; and, moreover, that the further Sir J. Franklin may have got from Welling-
ton Channel, and the nearer he may have approached the north-eastern portion of

Asia, the more he will have found the animals to increase in number. The direction

of the isothermal lines corroborates this assumption, as they are indicative of a

higher summer temperature in that region than in any other within the Polar basin.

Those countries being probably uninhabited by man, the animals will have continued

unthinned by the wholesale massacres by which myriads are destroyed for the sake

of their skins or teeth. An interesting fact was mentioned by Lieut. Osborn,

namely, that Captain Penny, in September 1850, had seen enormous numbers of

Wewhales running southwards from under the ice in Wellington Channel.  know

this to be also the case in the Spitzbergen sea every spring, and that these animals

are numerous along the Siberian coasts. This not only proves the existence of one,

or perhaps two Polar seas, more or less open throughout the year, but also that

these seas abound in animal life ; to satisfy enormous numbers of whales, an amount
of food is required which cannot be small. And it is well known among the

Tchuktchi, on the north-eastern coasts of Siberia, where land to the north is said to

exist in contiguity to. and probably connected with, the lands discovered by Captain

Kellett, that herds of reindeer migrate between those lands and the continents.

Taking all these facts into consideration, the conclusion seems to be a reasonable

one, that Franklin, ever since entering Wellington Channel, has found himself in

that portion of the arctic regions where animals probably exist in greater plenty than

in any other. Under these circumstances alone his party could exist as well as

other inhabitants of the Polar regions ; but we must not forget that, in addition to
the natural resources, they would in their vessels possess more comfortable and

substantial houses than any of the native inhabitants. So far as food is concerned,

reasonable hope, therefore, may be entertained that the missing Expedition would

not altogether suffer by the want of it ; their fate, however, depends upon other cir-
cumstances as well, among which that dire scourge of mariners, the scurvy, is pro-

bably more to be feared than any other.

   Lt.-Colonel Sykes, F.R.S.

Col. Sykes referred to a graphic account of the condition of Zanzibar by Lieut.

Fergusson, Indian Navy, derived from the testimony of a Mohammedan merchant.

Nothing, he said, comparatively speaking, was known of these territories, and it

was an unfortunate thing that such should be the case, particularly as the Imaum was

the friend of England, and willing to do anything he was asked. Two missionaries of

the Church Missionary Society had resided on the coast of Africa, opposite Mombas,

for six or seven years, and an account of their experiences appeared in the .Journal

of that Society. From these we learn that several districts in the country referred
to were, owing to their great elevation, very healthy, and that the people on the
coast were Mohammedans. The travels of Rebmann and Krapf in these districts
led to the discovery of iivo snow-capped mountains directly under the equator. This
mountainous region was believed to be the source of the true Nile. The territories
of the Imaum of Muscat were confined to the coast from the Red Sea to 10° south

latitude.

On the most Rapid Communication with India via British North America.
                                  By Capt. Synge.

   Having pointed out that a route towards the North by a line almost direct from
England, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, would be the shortest, the
writer compared the relative advantages afforded in British America and the States
when another line was proposed, and stated that the former possessed superior
facilities. The plan which he suggested was composed of four distinct links of com-
munication, each independent in itself, capable of separate execution, and opening

up important sources of profit. Railways throughout Nova Scotia and New Bruns-

wick, connecting the seaboard with the interior, were essential to the success of the
plan. The Report then entered into details of the project ; which contemplated the
connexion of Lake Superior, Winipeg, the Rainy Lake, and the rivers and lakes in-
tervening, to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, and thence, by creating permanent
dams or reservoirs, to open the passes through those mountains, and regulate the
descent of the waters to the Pacific. The paper entered into the calculations of the
altitudes of the lakes, the highest water being estimated at about 1400 feet above
tide-water ; and having referred to the ascent accomplished in the Welland Canal,
and the necessity of a perfect geographical survey to ascertain the levels with pre-
cision, the writer urged the practicability of the design, and gave elaborate details of
the beauty and fertility of the country to show the important results which might be
obtained from opening up the communication.

On the Present State of the Law of Settlement and the Removal of Paupers
            in Scotland. By Professor Alison, M.D., F.R.S.E.

Having remarked on the difference of this law in Ireland, England, and Scotland,

the Doctor denounced that of the two latter kingdoms as repugnant to justice and

common sense ; and cited various authorities (e. g. Adam Smith, Turgot, and Sir

 Robert Peel) to show that its impolicy, as impeding the free circulation of labour,
and the hardships inflicted by it, e. g. in times of distress in manufacturing districts,
when labourers from thence, knowing nothing of agriculture, were sent back to agri-
 cultural districts merely because they had been born there, had been long since
 clearly pointed out by the most competent judges.

    The law of settlement and removal lately introduced into Scotland had frequently
 frustrated the otherwise beneficial working of the new poor law. Strangers were
 allowed to obtain a settlement in any part of Scotland by five years' residence with-
 out parochial aid ; and this provision he thought equitable, but it was coupled with
 others, often rendering it quite ineffectual for the relief of the poor, and very bur-
 thensome, at least to the charitable amongst the higher ranks. The ill-understood
 boundaries of parishes in towns were one main cause of such evils. Again, a man.

however industrious, after living four years and ten months in one place, might fall
ill, require casual relief, and thereby lose his settlement ; even if an Irishman gave

Scotland the benefit of his labour for thirty years, and acquired several settlements
in the country during that time, he lost all claim to relief if he had not been residing

however respectable, could not gain a legal settlement by her own labour, if deserted

by her husband although an unmarried woman, however profligate, might do so.

And the forcible removal of persons thus denied relief led to much fraud, expense,

concealment of contagious disease, and other evils of which he gave examples.

   He agreed with Mr. Pashley, Q.C., in recommending that the legal right to relief
should take effect wherever destitution might show itself; the relief being admini-

stered, as at present, by local boards, under due supervision from a general fund,
two-thirds of which should be raised throughout the whole United Kingdom, and
one-third only in the district where the relief wrs given, in order to ensure caution

and oeconomy in the administration ; and in this way he thought that much expense
would be saved (now incurred by disputed questions of settlement), and the various

evils above stated be entirely avoided.

 -- --In 1845, the average amount of notes that had been in circulation during the year

ending the 1st of May 1845 ^"6,354,494 was made the fixed or authorized issue.

For any amount beyond its authorized issue each bank was required to hold an equal
sum in gold or silver coin, the silver not to exceed one-fourth of the gold coin. The
Act came into operation on the 6th of December 1845 ; and from that period each
bank has made returns, stating the average amount of notes in circulation during the

preceding four weeks, distinguishing the notes under £5 from those of ^5 and up-

wards, and stating the amounts of gold and silver coin it held in its vaults. These
returns were made by all the banks of circulation in Ireland. The proportion per

From this it appeared, that, if the authorized issue be represented by the number

--100, the actual circulation for the six years, 1846 to 1851 inclusive, will be repre-

sented by the numbers 114, 94, 76, 67, 71, 70. The question occurs "What is the
cause of this falling oiF in the annual circulation since the passing of the Act of
1845 ? The amount of notes in circulation does not correspond with the amount of

gold in the Bank of England ; for the gold in the Bank of England is at the present

time much higher than it was on the 1st of May 1845, although the Irish notes

in circulation are much less. There were three negative laws of the currency in
Ireland, namely, that the amount of notes in circulation is not regulated by the

Act of Parliament, nor by the wishes of the Irish bankers, nor by the stock of
gold in the Bank of England. Notes are issued in Ireland chiefly for the purpose
of purchasing agricultural produce ; it would seem to follow that the amount of

notes put into circulation will be regulated mainly by the quantity of that produce,

and by the price at which it is purchased. If, then, we found that, in the years

since 1845, the quantity of agricultural produce has been less, or the price at
                                                                                                   8*
116 REPORT-- 1852,

which it has been sold has been less, and especially if both these circumstances
should have occurred, then have we an adequate cause for a reduction in the amount
of bank notes in circulation. The annual productiveness of the harvest would affect
the amount of notes in circulation. Again, a bad harvest in one year may, by the
distress it produces, cause a less production of commodities in several following
years, and hence there may be a less demand for bank notes. A bad harvest pro-
duces distress among the farmers, and this distress affects the amount of the circu-

--lation in two ways : First, the farmer consumes his own produce instead of selling

it, and thus does not require the use of notes. Secondly, the distress of the farmer
diminishes the instruments of reproduction. If he has no potatoes, he can rear no

pigs. An abundant crop of potatoes produces in the following year an abundant
crop of pigs. After the failure of the potato in 184G the exportation of swine was
reduced from 480,827 iu 1846, to 106,407. The potato crop again failed in 1848.
The number of swine exported in 1848 was 110,787 ; in 1849 it was only 68,053.
The destruction of the pigs which took place in 1846 would doubtless affect the cir-

culation of notes in subsequent years, especially in 1847, 1848, and 1849, and pro-

bably, also, to a certain extent, in the years 1850 and 1851. He next proceeded to
lay down as propositions, that a reduction in the quantity of commodities produced
may be caused by a reduction in the number of producers, and this would occasion
a less demand for bank notes ; and that the amount of notes that circulate in a

country will also be affected by the quantity of commodities exported, and the quan-
tity imported. After addressing himself to these points, he said that we found that
the reduction in the amount of notes in circulation in Ireland had been preceded or
accompanied by a reduction in the amount of commodities produced, occasioned by
a reduced productiveness in the land actually cultivated, a destruction in the instru-
ments of reproduction by the distress thus occasioned, a reduction in the number of
producers by deaths and emigration, and the exportation of an increased portion of
its capital in exchange for food. But there was another circumstance that concurred
in powerfully producing the same effect, that is, the price at which the commodities

brought to market were sold. He went into a variety of calculations to sustain the

foregoing positions, and then said that, from the whole, he inferred that the difference
between the amount of bank notes circulating in a country at two different periods
cannot be regarded as any correct test of the condition of its inhabitants at those
periods, unless we take into account all the circumstances by which that difference

--is attended that the decline of the circulation of bank notes in Ireland, from the

year 1845 to 1851, is no accurate measure of the distress that has existed in the

country, or that now exists, as other causes besides distress have concurred in pro-
ducing that effect-- that in comparing the circulation of 1845 and 1851 we are

--making a comparison unfavourable to the country, as the year 1845 was a year re-

markable for the high amount of its circulation and that we should indulge in no

desponding inferences as to the condition of the country, even if the circulation
should never recover its former amount. Even the permanent reduction of the cir-
culation to its present amount would be no conclusive evidence of the distressed
condition of the country ; for, though distress first caused the decline of the circu-

lation, yet, from the new circumstances which that distress introduced, the same
amount of bank notes are not now necessary for conducting its operations.

Should our Gold Standard of Value he maintained if Gold becomes

  mdepreciated in consequence of its Discovery Australia and California ?

   By Professor Hancock.

    After a long dissertation on the standard of value in different countries and ages,
that in England being now 5 dwts. 91 grains of gold to the pound (which originally
meant the pound weight of fine silver, that standard having been altered in conse-
quence of repeated depreciations in value, until silver was only one-third of the value

--it was when the standard of value was fixed) after showing how the standard
--might be depreciated, by altering the quantity of gold or silver representing it the

alteration of the purity of the metal representing the standard, by the substitution

--of some other commodity for gold and silver as the standard and from the standard
--falling in value from excessive supply and referring to various tamperings with the

--currency until it was restored by Sir Robert Peel's Act of 1819 the Professor stated

that the last cause of depreciation of the value was the one with which they had

then to deal, from the recent discoveries of gold in Australia and California. When

the large discoveries of gold and silver took place in South America there prices fell
considerably in value ; but though the Government took the matter into serious
consideration, they were unable to find any remedy for the depreciation in the value
of the precious metals arising from their excessive suppl)', though it caused great
confusion in the carrying on of all descriptions of trade, and the collection of tax-

ation. He was of opinion, notwithstanding the theoretical opinions of many writers,
that from the parallel of what took place when the South American mines were

discovered, the gold, if depreciated in value, would cause great confusion in the

country ; and he would therefore suggest that silver, which did not appear likely
to be depreciated, should be taken as the standard of value. Should, however, silver
also be depreciated, there ought to be a scientific inquiry to see whether, from some
combination of metals, a standard of value might not be found which would have
the same effect with regard to the commerce, &c. of the country as the compensating
pendulum had with regard to time.

Are there any Impediments to the Competition of Free Labour toith Slave

            Labour in the West Indies ? By Professor Hancock.

  --The principal conclusions to which Prof. Hancock came were, 1. That, as a con-

clusion of moral philosophy, it was shameful to maintain slavery for a single hour.

2. That, as a conclusion of political oeconomj^ emancipation should be immediate, and
not gradual. This position Prof. Hancock proved by the history of the emancipation
in the West Indies, where the apprenticeship system turned out a failure ; and re-
marked that, where emancipation cannot be immediate, it is the duty of those who
see that the change is inevitable to make such previous arrangements that the deve-
lopment of free labour may arise as soon as possible. 3. That auxiliary measures,
such as education, reform in the courts of law, especially respecting the tenure and
sale of land, are essential in order that the blessings of emancipation may be exhibited
on the community at large. Prof. Hancock showed that these auxiliary precautions
had not been taken. Grants had sometimes been made in favour of education, but

as soon as any pressure came they were withdrawn. He also dwelt on the im-

portance of permanently fixing the law of property in land. 4. That the loss of
property consequent on emancipation should not be thrown on the slaveholders, but
on the community at large, inasmuch as the whole British people had been respon-
sible for slavery. Accordingly, the slave-owners were compensated, partly in money,
and partly in differential duties which had not yet quite ceased. 5. That free labour
requires no protection to enable it to compete with slave labour. In slavery there
was not the same division of labour as in freedom. Again, the invention of machines
proceeded from free labour, freemen desiring to oeconomize labour. The consequence
was, that more labour was wasted in slavery than in freedom to produce equal re-
sults. If free labour could not compete successfully with slave labour, he feared that

the moral question would be in great danger. 6. That the allegations about the negroes
in the West Indies demanding too high wages are untrue, and the imputations on
their character unfounded. It turned out, when inquiries were made into the facts,
that wages were very low ; and Prof. Hancock quoted authorities to show, that
wages were at such rates as 6rf., 4d., and id. per day, so that if the negroes had not
provision grounds, they would often be in great straits. 7. That the state of the
West Indies did not show the impracticability of free labour competing with slavery,
but shows, on the contrary, the folly of the laws which have been passed by the
Colonial Legislatures, the folly of the short-sighted selfishness of the planters, and
the folly of those philanthropists who, instead of seeking the removal of those laws,
demand a monopoly for the planters. In arguing this head at length. Prof. Hancock

--touched upon the following points : the bankrupt state of the West India proprie-
-- --tors before the emancipation the evils of the Coolie immigration the unjust taxes
--on the labouring classes in the West Indies the unfair restrictions on their progress
-- the system of oppressive laws by which a labourer is condemned where a pro-
--prietor escapes and the unsatisfactory tenure of land in the matter of summary

Statistics of ihe Revenues of the University and some of the Colleges of Oxford,

  compiledfrom the Report of the Oxford University Commission. ^^ James

   Heywood, M.P., F.R.S.

    It appeared, as far as could be ascertained, that of nine colleges, the average in-
come of the heads of houses was i^llOO a year ; and as regarded Fellows, taking

in the Canons of Christ Church, the average income was ^234 a year. The total
income of Oxford Universit)' was about ,£^22,000, and of the colleges .152,000
at Cambridge the total income was about ^'133,000, and that of Trinity College,
Dublin, was about ^50,000, making in all about ^'355,000. There were 557 fellow-
ships in Oxford, of which about thirty-five were vacant every year. The revenue

--arising from the University Press, by the printing of Bibles and Prayer-books at

Oxford, was stated to be about ^8000 a year though the amount was not regu-
larly paid over, but only when it had increased to sums of ^40,000 or .£60,000.

Notice of the Progress of the Seived Muslin Manufacture in Ireland.
   Communicated by Mr. Holden, and read by Professor Hancock.

It stated that the trade was introduced into Ireland between 1800 and 1810, but

little progress was made with it until the period between 1820 and 1830. Thejn-

troduction of lithographic printing between 1830 and 1835, instead of the old block

system, was one of the most important elements in firmly establishing the trade.

£& £7The old blocks cost from 3s. 6d. for simple patterns, to or for more intricate,

besides the time (two or three weeks) occupied in the preparation of the patterns,

and cutting them upon the blocks, whilst they could now be produced in a few

hours at about the same amount of shillings as it formerly cost pounds. So exten-

sively had the business increased during the last fifteen years, that there was now

employed in Ulster, and other parts of Ireland, nearly a quarter of a million indi-

viduals. The wages of the young persons were, when they first commenced, only

from &d. to Is. per Aveek ; the more experienced obtained 4s. to 6s., and a few first
class workers 10s. ; and there was now paid between J?500,000 and £600,000 per

annum for the manufacture, exclusive of the cost of the materials ; and moreover,

the employment was afforded in the best manner, being given to young females at

Atheir own homes, under the supervision of their parents.  great deal of good had

also been effected by the establishment of training-schools for teaching the em-

broidery, and the landed proprietors had been very forward in establishing those

schools. Amongst others, the Earl and Countess of Enniskillen established one of

these schools ; and the result was, that the females of Enniskillen were now earn-

ing, from embroidery, no less than £400 a week. The Irish manufacture was

rapidly growing into importance, and, despite of fiscal arrangements, was making

great way on the Continent ; even in France, where the import of goods of this

description was interdicted, a large quantity obtained admission by smuggling.

 On the Productive Industry of Paris. By the late G. R. Porter, F.R.S.

   After a review of the various inquiries which had been from time to time instituted
with a view to ascertain the extent of production and employment within the city of
Paris, the writer proceeded to the detail of the most important points ascertained by
its Chamber of Commerce in an elaborate investigation into the effects of the Revo-
lution of 1848 on the trade of the French capital. The total number of workmen
employed in 1847 was 342,530, which fell, in 1848, to 156,125, being a diminution
of fifty-four per cent. The chief falling off was in furnishing, where the reduction
was seventy-three per cent., and the least was in the preparation of food, which only
fell off nineteen per cent. The latest value of the productions of Parisian labour in
1847, was ^58,543,134, and in 1848 only ^^27,100,964. Although the falling off
of employment in the preparation of food was not great, that in consumption was
very remarkable. The quantity of flesh meat consumed in Paris in 1847 Was 150lbs. per
head ; in 1848 it fell to 874lbs. per head. After affairs settled down again, it rose
in 1849 to 1461bs. per head, and in 1850 reached 158lbs. per head. The difference
between 1847 and 1850 is partially to be attributed to the increase of population.
The statistics on the degree of instruction found among the workmen is very inter-
estingi Out of the entire number of workmen, 147,311, or eighty-seven per cent.,
could read and write. Out of 86,617 women, 68,219, or seventy-nine per cent., were

--able to read and write. The rate of weekly wages was given on an average as fol-

lows: ^Tailors, 20s. 2d.; butchers, 19s. 7c?.; jewellers, 31s. 9d.; bakers, 19s. 7d,;

        On the Progress and Extent of Steamboat Building in the Clyde.
                             By John Strang, LL.D.

   No business during the last fifty years had exhibited so much progress in the

West of Scotland as that of steamboat building. It was a manufacture of home
production, the materials being within themselves, and requiring skill in every de-
partment, the remuneration was higher than in the ordinary manufactures of the
country ; it, in fact, created the districts in which it was established, and gave con-
stant employment to the industrious. It was just forty years since the Comet made
its first trip from Glasgow to Greenock. The Comet was only 30 tons burthen,
and its engine was but 3 horse-power. Dr. Strang then proceeded to trace the dif-
ferent forms in which steam-vessels had been built, and paid a just tribute to Henry
Bell, the first man who rendered steam available for navigation purposes. In refer-
ence to the progress of the trade of steamboat building on the Clyde, he showed
that in the year ending June 1852, the number and tonnage of steamers engaged in
traffic on the Clyde were 93 vessels, of 11,992 tons; the increase on regularly em-
ployed vessels on the river was 26, and in tonnage 5301 tons. But that gave no
idea of the magnitude of the steamboat building and marine engine making. During
the last seven years, there have been constructed, or are constructing, in Glasgow
and neighbourhood, 123 vessels, 122 of which were iron, 80 paddle, and 43 screw,
consisting of 200 wooden tonnage, 70,441 iron tonnage ; 6610 horse-power engines
for wooden hulls ; 22,539 horse-power for iron hulls ; and 4720 horse-power en-
gines for vessels not built in the Clyde. At Greenock and Port Glasgow, during the

last seven years, there have been constructed, or are constructing, 66 steam- vessels,
13 of which are wood and 53 of iron, 25 being paddles and 41 screws; the gross
tonnage being 47,202 tons. At Dumbarton 58 of iron, 20 paddles and 38 screws,
having a tonnage of 29,761. It would be seen that the wooden hulls are fast giving
place to those of iron, and the screw is more patronized than the paddle. The pro-
portion in 1852 was 73 iron against 4 of wood, and of screws to paddles it is as 43 to
30. Dr. Strang then exhibited the amount of money expended in this branch of
trade, and the quantity of employment it gives. Both were enormous ; taking the

last seven years of building on the Clyde at ^'4,650,652, and the employed at Dum-

barton, Greenock, Port Glasgow, and Glasgow, at 10,820 persons at annual wages
of ,£^450,112, without reference to the very large body of joiners, painters, carvers,
gilders, upholsterers, sail-makers employed by this trade.

              On the Census arid Condition of the Island of Bombay.

                       By Lieut.-Colonel Sykes, F.R.S.

   The author observed that on the night of the 1st of May 1849, the government

obtained a census, as to population and as to the distinctive castes into which the
population was divided. The entire population of the island, which is only seven
miles in length and not more than twenty miles in circumference, was 569,119.
Of this number, 354,090 were males, and' 212,029 females. The Hindoos com-
prise more than one-half of the population. The Mussulmans are more nume-
rous than the Parsees, the descendants of the ancient fire-worshipers; who, even
in the present day, observe the old form of worshiping the sun, and the old cere-

mony of exposing their dead as food to fowls of the air. They construct towers,
on the top of which the dead bodies are placed. The Parsees have newspapers,
printed in the Guzerat language; and on one occasion they published a life of Mo-
hammed, with an engraving or likeness of him. The Mussulmans, regarding this as

a caricature of their prophet, rose against the Parsees, and threatened to exterminate
them. The feud was only put a stop to by the intervention of the military. The
Europeans, Indo-Europeans, native Christians and .Tews are 20,426 ; and all are
subject to the same social and political influences and laws. In the Bombay tables
                                                                                                           --

there is nothing to indicate the extent of vagrancy, or the number of houses. One

--great feature is presented in the tables tlie excess of males over females. The

contrary is the case in Europe, where the females are much in excess of the males.

The disparity between the sexes in India was attributed to the crime of female in-

fanticide                                    and  so great was the evil  in Kattywar, that the government  encouraged
                                          ;

a marriage fund from which portions might be given with the daughters of the

chiefs and others, so that the inducement to destroy their infant females might be

lessened ; and the result has been very satisfactory. In Bombay female infanticide

never did exist, and the disparity between the sexes is owing to the Persian Gulf and

Red Sea traders and immigrant labourers leaving their females at home. Among

the Hindoos the females number 48 per cent. ; among the Mussulmans, 48 per cent, j
and among the Parsees, 82 per cent. The youth of both sexes in the Parsee popu-

lation are as 23'4 per cent, of the population; Mussulmans, 17"7 per cent. ; and

-- --Hindoos only 10"8 per cent. Bombay had anciently been considered the grave of

Europeans the Sierra Leone of India owing to the high tides which divided the

island into six or seven parts ; the water formed morasses, giving rise to pestilent

miasmata ; however, means have been taken to prevent the influx of the tides, and

the best results have followed, in a sanitary point of view. In Great Britain the

mortality is as one in forty-seven ; and it is represented in the tables to be now

only 2'1 per cent, in Bombay, though the view is thought to be too favourable.

     mStatistics of the Deaf and Dumb Ireland. By W. A. Wilde.

   This was an abstract of the Report on the condition of the Deaf and Dumb in

Ireland taken in connexion with the Census Commission of 1851. In a series of
tables amounting to no less than sixteen in number, Mr. Wilde furnished a variety of
datafor judging of the conditions under which this form of permanent disease exists

and is perpetuated. Among these, were tables showing its proportion to the general

--population, and relative proportion of the sexes affected their education, and sus-
--ceptibility to education, both literary and industrial the class of the community
--which the malady chiefly afi'ects and the localities where it principally prevails

with a view to seeing whether geological position, soil, aspect, elevation, humidity,

dryness, salubrity or insalubrity of climate, density or paucity of population, un.
healthy crowded cities or open fertile plains, acquired disease, hereditary predispo-

sition, family peculiarity, or the consanguinity of parents, may have conduced to
the development and propagation of this disease. Mr. Wilde stated generally, that
while in Europe the average of deaf and dumb was one in 1593, 4449 deaf mutes

were returned for all Ireland, or one in 1580.

                        MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

              On Telegraphic Commmunications by Land and Sea.

                              By F. C. Bakewell.

Mr. Bakewell took a general review of the progress which has been made in this
important medium for the transmission of intelligence, and examined the accidents
·which have still interrupted the perfection of the medium, with a view to suggesting
remedies. The principal remedies suggested referred to the formation of submarine
telegraphic communication. Instead of employing several thin copper wires enclosed
in a protecting wire cable, he recommended the vise of a strong self-protecting iron

                       On the Permanent Way of Railways.
                             By James Barton, C.E.

    After a brief review of the steps by which from the first wooden rail about the year

1676 at Newcastle, the railroad advanced; next to tram -plates, and lately to the pre-

sent forms of wrought-iron rail secured to wooden sleepers, which are now in com-

mon use, the paper proceeded to consider what the defects were in the present

system, being generally describable under two heads, the imperfect joint, and the tem-

porary nature of the wooden substructure.

    To remedy, these evils, those whose professional duties had brought this subject

prominently before them, had devised various improvements, and several patents were

taken out;    amongst  which,  four      were  described                                             the    first,  that  of Sir  John  Macneill,
                                                                                                  ;

which consists of a cast-iron sleeper upon which the bridge form of rail beds evenly,

and to which it is riveted, the proper gauge and bevil being secured by cross-bars set

on edge, and upon which two opposite sleepers are cast. The second is a cast-iron

sleeper applicable to the edge rail, as patented by Mr. Peter Barlow, and in which

each sleeper consists of two parts, which when bolted together by a horizontal bolt

requires no key or other fastening. The third consists of an improvement for the joint

of the edge rail on ordinary timber roads, and is a fishing of the joint by bars laid in

the hollow of the edge rail and i-iveted through its vertical web : this is a patent of

Mr. Samuel's. The fourth is a patent of Mr. William Henry Barlow, and consists of

a wrought-iron rail forming its own sleeper, being rolled wide enough to be its own

base; it is of the bridge form, and eleven, twelve, or thirteen inches wide, according

to weight ; the connections are formed by a chair of wrought iron, the external form

of which exactly coincides with the inside of the rail, to which as a joint cover both

are riveted, the cross-ties being angle irons, bent to give the bevil for the carriage

wheels to the rail, and secured by the same rivets which hold the chair.

    The author has laid some of each of these kinds of permanent way, except Mr.

Samuel'a, and tried a number of experiments thereon, both as to strength, smooth-

ness, and cost of maintenance ; and the experimental lengths of each kind have been

under the regular traffic of the Belfast Junction Railway for the last year and a half.

Of the first kind. Sir J. Macneill's, the Drogheda Railway Company have taken some,

their rails being still quite sound but their wooden sleepers decayed ; the second, Mr.

Peter Barlow's, has been largely laid in England on the South- Eastern, and Ashford

and Hastings ; and in Ireland, on the Londonderry and Enniskillen. The last de-

scribed, that of Mr. VV. H. Barlow, is now being extensively adopted by Mr. Brunei
in England, and Mr. Hemans in Ireland ; and the author has laid seven miles, and

ordered materials for twelve more ; this being the total at present required on the

Belfast Junction Railway. The result of the experiments was the adoption of this rail

as  the best  when  the rails  are  not  already  purchased                                                 it was  found  by far  the strongest
                                                                                                         ;

and considerably the cheapest. The cost of the different kinds are given in the an-

nexed table, the estimates being either from the author's own knowledge, or when

they refer to maintenance for a term of years, are taken from actual tenders made to

him for the work. This rail thus gives a first cost saving of £360 per double mile, and

an annual saving of £56 ; the cast-iron sleepers show an increased cost at first of about

igieo, but an annual saving of about £50.

Broad-flanged rail, W. H. Barlow's

    It is proposed to rivet together these rails at the joint ; and the paper proceeded to

discuss the question of the feasibility of riveting together a continuous line of rails;
directly opposite opinions have been given on this point, and amongst those opposed

to it were Professor Barlow in 1835. The matter is, the author would submit, one
capable of being considered philosophically, and is dependent on the amount of ex-
pansion and the strength of the iron ; he showed that the contraction by cooling a
rail through the whole of our range temperature, say 75°, would cause a tensile strain

on the bar only equal to five tons per sectional inch, which the bar is quite capable
of bearing. The practical fault appears to be, that the rail when riveted at a low
temperature gives way by flexure and gets out of line, acting as a pillar, and so
bearing, not as in tension according to its sectional area, but the cube of its width,
and inversely as the square of the length unsupported. It would therefore appear

perfectly safe to rivet together a line of rails, but it should be done at a high tempe-
rature. The effect of change of temperature of the air is moreover largely reduced
by the rail being bedded into the ballast instead of placed upon a non-conductor of
heat like the timber sleepers.

   When the author recommended the adoption of the broad-flanged rail to the Com-
pany for whom he tried the experiments, he did not do so on light grounds, as in

doing so he took the responsibility of recommending a large outlay on a system
hitherto untried except by the patentee ; in now however bringing it before the Sec-
tion, he has the concurrent opinions of a number of the most eminent of his profes-
sional brethren. This road having been objected to for a supposed sensation of
hai-dness in passing over it, diagrams of the motion of a carriage over it and other
descriptions of road were exhibited, taken by an instrument called a salograph, and
which appeared to shovv the wrought iron had less motion than any other rail.

    Tables of experiments were annexed to this paper.

On the Calculation of Strains in Lattice Girders, with practical deductions
                     therefrom. By James Barton, C.E.

   The author commenced by showing, that notwithstanding the large and valuable
investigations of late years into the theory and forms of wrought- iron girders for large
bridges, yet the nature, intensity, and directions of the strains in the vertical web
or portion of the beam which separates the top and bottom were comparatively
neglected, or conclusions drawn without correct theory ; and having shown the large
amount of material used in this portion of girders, the sides in the Britannia tubes
weighing 3454 tons, whilst the top is 2962 tons, and the bottom 2944 tons, and
therefore the oeconomic importance of this investigation, he proceeded to explain the
mode in which he had arrived at accurate results as to these strains in the case of

lattice girders. He had investigated the subject, and tried some experiments on a

large scale with tubular and lattice beams, iu connection with some large bridges

which he has lately erected on the Belfast Junction Railway, and especially for the

design for the Boj'ne Viaduct, the calculations for which, and the working out of the

details, were entrusted to him by Sir J. Macneill and the directors of the company :
the results show the high importance of an accurate consideration of the various strains

to which each bar is subjected, and the separate and different efiects of a passing and

constant load. Tlie paper proceeded to explain how these calculations were to be

carried out, by resolving each part of the load into its separate effect of tension and

compression on every bar in the same system, and on the top and bottom, and adding

to these results the constant effect of the weight of the structure, and tlie results or
maxima strains fur every bar were shown in diagrams, as also a geometrical elevation

of the strains ; the general result is, that in ordinary trussed or lattice-bridges the bars

sloping downwards towards the bottom at the centre were subject to a tensile, and

the others to a compressive strain, and that these strains increase nearly in an arith-

metical proportion towai-ds the points of support; but that they pass each other for

some distance at the centre, so that a certain number of bars are subject to a small

amount of both tensile and compressive strain. The geometric elevation showed the

very small proportion the strains in the sides bear to those in the top and bottom,

and therefore the inutility of making the sides solid plates, whilst from the amount

of compression a single plate does not give rigidity. The paper went on to compare

the relative value of single systems bracing with the lattice, and to consider the true

angle of oeconomic bracing which appeared to be 45°; also how far the calculations are

affected by i-iveting together the bars at their intersections. The paper further pro-

ceeded to the practical application, and to the details of construction, explaining

some improvements introduced by the author, both as to the mode of construction of

the compression bars, which by him are made to form lattice beams, as also in the

connection of plates by means of which he proposes to rivet plates with a very slight

Anloss of their sectional area.                                isometrical projection of a lattice beam was also ex-

hibited carrying out the principles laid down.

A series of Observations on the Discharge of Water from actual Experiment.

On, the Evolution of Gas in WaUse?id Colliery. By George Clarke.

                            Communicated by Professor Phillips.

This paper relates to one of the coal-mines in the district of the Tyne which

have been rendered remarkable for the frequent explosion of the inflammable

gas which they yield, and the loss of life which has in so many cases been the conse-

quence. The colliery in question has been wrought for many years in safety, by the

exclusive use of the Davy lamp, though it evolves every moment abundance of gas.

A district of this colliery, covering about fifty acres, was effectually walled up, in con-

Asequence of the immense discharge of gas that was continually taking place.                                             pipe

was led from this enclosed portion up through the mine and for forty feet above the

surface, and from this pipe there has been a constant discharge of gas for the last

eighteen years. This gas has been inflamed, and in the roughest and most stormy

weather it has burned without intermission ; and were it as rich in naphtha as ordi-

nary carburetted hydrogen, it would illuminate the countrj' for miles round. Two

watei'-pressure gauges were fixed, one to the pipe at the surface of the earth, and the

other  at  the  bottom of the  mine                            and  the  results  were  that,  whilst the  pressure  in  the

mine was only T%ths of an inch on an average, that at the top of the pit was upwards

of four inches. From observation in these mines, it appears that discharges of fire-damp,

governed by atmospheric pressure, have taken place before depressions of the baro-

meter, and that as an indicator of danger that instrument cannot be implicitly relied

Aon. fact somewhat similar was first observed by Professor Daniell, in his researches

at the Royal Society, where the water barometer indicated the change of pressure an

hour earlier than the usual mercurial standard barometers constantly employed for

observations.

On the Mechanical Properties of Metals, as derived from repeated Meltings,
   exhibiting the maximum Point of Strength, and the Causes ofDeterioration.
  By William Fairbairn, F.R.S.

    After some preliminary observations, Mr. Fairbairn stated that having been
requested by the British Association, at their last meeting, to undertake an inquiry
into the mechanical properties of cast iron, as deduced from repeated meltings, and
feeling desirous of ascertaining to what extent it was improved or deteriorated,
arrangements were made for conducting a series of experiments, calculated satisfac-
torily to determine this question, and to supplj' such data and such information as
will enable the engineer and iron-founder to ascertain with greater certainty how far
those remeltings can be carried with safety ; or till such time as the maximum of
strength is obtained, and such other properties as appear to affect the uses of this
valuable and important material. Mr. Fairbairn further stated, in connection with
this subject, that it was his intention to investigate another important process, which,
to a considerable extent, affects the stability of some of our most important iron con-
structions, viz. the rate of cooling as it affects the adhesive properties of the material,

and the more complete and effective process of crystallization. On these points it is
well known that a rapid rate of cooling is invariably attended with risk ; that an im-

perfect crystalline structure is obtained, and that irregular and unequal contractions

are not only present, but they are frequently the forerunners of disruption, as well as
exceedingly deceptive as regards appearances, or the dangerous consequences which

invariably follow in cases of rapid cooling and unequal contraction.

Om the Tensile Strength of Unwrought Iron Plates at various Temperatures.

                      By William Fairbairn, F.R.S.

   Mr. Fairbairn said, the experiments were not sufficiently advanced to enable him
to lay before the Section any detailed accoimt of them, in consequence of the appa-
ratus for conducting those experiments having, for the last six months, been pre-
occupied for the Royal Society to determine the temperature of fusion or the laws of
the solidification of bodies under great pressure. Under these circumstances, it was
next to impossible to make much progress with the experiments on the effects of tem-
perature, &c. on wrought iron jjlates. Up to the present time, they must therefore
be considered preliminary j but, judging results obtained on a former occasion from
experiments on bars of iron subjected to a transverse strain at varied degrees of tem-
perature, it is more than probable that some new and interesting facts may be deve-
loped by those now in progress.

         Neiv Tubular Boiler. By William Fairbairn, F.R.S.

   Tliis subject was illustrated by tables and diagrams. The new boiler consists of
two furnaces, the same as the double-flue boiler, but with this difference, that the
cylindrical flues which contain the grate bars are united at a distance of eight feet
from the front of the boiler into a circular flue which forms the mixing chamber, and
which terminates in a disc plate, which contains a series of three-inch tubes, eight
feet long, and similar to the locomotive boiler. These tubes in a boiler seven feet
diameter are 104 to 110 in number, and from the thinness of the metal become the
absorbents of the surplus heat escaping from the mixing chamber and the furnace.
On this principle of rapid conduction, the whole of the heat, excepting only what is
necessary to maintain the draught, is transmitted into the boiler, and hence follows

--the oeconomy of entirely dispensing with brickwork and flues an important deside-

ratum in these constructions.

      Remarks on the Minie Rifle. By William Fairbairn, F.R.S.

   Mr. Fairbairn observed that, until of late years, all the gun ban-els for the army,
and other descriptions, had to be welded upon mandrils, some of them formed by a
--126 REPORT 1852.

bar of iron rolled upon the mandril, in a spiral direction, and then welded by re-
peated beatings from the muzzle to the breech. Others were differently constructed,
by welding the bars longitudinally, in the line of the barrel, and not in the spiral di-

rection adopted in the former process. Now the whole is welded at one heat, and

that through a series of grooves in the iron rollers, specially adapted for the purpose.
This, with other improvements, has rendered the manufacture of rifles and other

arms a matter of much greater certainty and security than at any former period.
Admitting the advantages peculiar to this manufacture, it does not affect the prin-
ciple of the rifle itself, in which there is no alteration, but in every respect similar,
even to the spiral grooves, which he believes are not altered, but are the same
as in the old rifle. This being the case, it has been a question of much interest to
know wherein consists the great diflerence in the practice with the new rifle, as com-
pared with that of the old one. It is not in the gun, and must therefore be in the

ball, or that part of tlie charge which generates the projectile force. But, in fact, the
improvement consists entirely in the form of the ball, which is made conical, with a
hollow recess at the base, into which a metallic plug is thrust by the discharge. The
plug is so constructed, as that when driven into the ball, it compresses the outer edges
against the sides of the barrel, and at the same time forces a portion of the lead,
from its ductility, to enter the groove, and to give the ball, when discharged, that
revolving motion which carries with such unerring certainty to the mark. In the
practice with one of those rifles on the marshes at Woolwich, the following results
were obtained. Out of twelve rounds, at a distance of 700 yards, as near as Mr. Fair-
bairn can remember, only one bullet missed the target, and the remaining eleven
rounds were scattered within distances of about six inches to four feet from the bull's
eye. At 800 yards three shotsmissed the target, and the remaining nine wentthrough the
boards, two inches thick, and lodged themselves in the mounds behind, at a distance
of about twenty yards. The same results were obtained from a distance of 900 yards,
and at 1000 yards there were very few of the bullets but what entered the target.
In these experiments the end of the rifle was supported upon a triangular standard,
and the greatest precision was observed in fixing the sight, which is graduated
to a scale in the ratio of the distance, varying from 100 to 1000 yards, which

latter may be considered the range of this destructive instrument.

                 On Improvements made in the Harbour of Belfast.
                           By Robert Garrett, C.E.

    This paper described the situation of the town of Belfast on the River Lagan, at
its junction with that extensive inlet known as Belfast Lough, and stated that the
 courses of the tides do not tend to the formation of the shoals and bars so formidable

at many harbour entrances. It appears there are fourteen miles square of good an-
 chorage ground, and from two to ten fathoms of water. The particulars of the river
 and the Lough, and the various engineering additions for accommodation were then

--detailed from 1720, when the first quay wall was built, and 1785, which marked

 the commencement of the progress which has continued to the present time. The
 designs suggested for the improvement of the harbour by Messrs. Rennie, Telford,
 Cubitt, &c. were described and compared with that given by Messrs. Walker and
 Burges, attention being in particular directed to the manner in which the tidal action
 had been taken advantage of in the latter design, now so successfully carried out into
 execution by Mr. Smith, the Resident Engineer to the Harbour Commissioners.

                      On Malleable Iron for Beams or Girders.
             By Thomas Murray Gladstone, C.E. of Belfast.

     This paper pointed out the difference between cast and wrought iron for beams or
 girders ; it was shown that cast iron from its extreme brittleness was unsafe even far
 below the test usually applied to it, especially where any sudden impact or force was
 necessary ; that as the nature of the metal was changed from cast to a malleable state,
 its power of bearing tension in the latter condition was increased more than four-fold,
 while its resistance to compression was not sensibly diminished ; that in consequence
 of this increased strength, the lower webs of the wrought iron girder could be proper-

tionably reduced, and thereby one-half the lineal weight saved, which compensated
for the difference of price. The material point which supervened in favour of
wrought iron, was that it gave ample warning by great deflection before the breaking
point was reached, which was not the case with cast iron.

   By experiment it was found that with double T-iron, 8 inches deep, and the top
and bottom flanges each 4 inches wide, the whole f inches thick, and having two
girders 10 feet apart and 10 feet span, with a load of 21 tons, within a radius of
4 feet from the centre, the deflection was only f inches, and immediately on the load
being removed the beams returned back to their original position. Other examples
were given for the Members to see at the Belfast Iron Woi-ks, the result showing

that with the given section the depth ought to be about y-jth the span, and the

thickness of all parts -^^ih the depth of girder, while the best form was for the flanges
to be i the depth.

   The paper was accompanied by drawings showing the different points bearing upon
the advantages of this new feature in the application of malleable iron, so interesting
for security of life and property in fire-proof buildings.

                 On an Improved Cast-iron Sleeper for Railways.

                        By John Godwin, CE,, Belfast.

    Mr. Godwin said that his attention had been a good deal directed to the subject
of laying and upholding the permanent way of railways, from the necessity which
had arisen on the Ulster Railway with which he was connected, of relaying a con-
siderable length on which the timber was decayed, and a large outlay became neces-

sary for its reconstruction.

    'i'he Ulster line is laid on longitudinal bearings of timber, and the rail is of the
bridge-form, of about eighty pounds to the yard ; although this kind of permanent way
has answered exceedingly well, yet the certainty of decay in the timber, and the conse-
quent necessity of frequent reconstruction, inflict a serious outlay on the company,
and renders a large reserve fund necessary to meet such contingences.

    In the hope of obviating this serious and frequent source of expense, he directed
his attention to the cast-iron sleeper for the bridge rail introduced by Mr. Barlow,
and patented by him ; on examining the lines on which this sleeper had been laid,
he thought that an improved mode of fastening the rail to the sleeper was required,
and that the form of the sleeper itself was capable of some improvement.

    In Mr. Barlow's plan the sleeper is flat, and the rail is secured to it by means of
small detached pieces of iron and small screw bolts ; these bolts are liable to shake
loose, and the stability of the line is consequently injured.

    The alteration which he (Mr. Godwin) had adopted in the form of the sleeper is
in making it curved instead of flat, and thus giving it more strength, a better hold
on the ballasting, and effecting a consequent saving in the labour of packing and

adjusting.

    In Mr. Godwin's plan, the chair on which the rail rests is so constructed as to
project over the flange of the rail on both sides, and is secured by a broad wedge
driven between it and the under side of the rail, forcing it upwards against the pro-
jections of the chair : the joints are fastened in a similar manner by a single wedge at
each joint.

    Before Mr. Godwin iiad tested this plan of permanent way, by laying a length of
it and subjecting it to a severe test, he was apprehensive that the wedges would
shake loose, and that it would not remedy the defect of the screw fastenings ; but after
a severe trial of six months he found the line as secure as when first laid, although it
had not been packed or otherwise meddled with ; he found, however, that a few of
the joint sleepers had bi-oken, but withovit in the slightest degree affecting the per-
manence and steadiness of the line.

    In order to prevent a recurrence of this he has determined on laying the joint
sleeper transversely, and thus preventing the possibility of their breaking.

   The advantages to be expected from this kind of permanent way, are its durability,

simplicity of construction, facility of replacing defective rails, and oeconomy in up-

holding.
                                 --

--128 REPORT 1852.

    This kind of chair and sleeper is applicable to lines already laid, and to any pat-
tern of rail, and M-hen it is necessary to relay the line, or renew the sleepers.

   In concluding his paper, Mr. Godwin suggested the possibility of constructing a
railroad in such a manner that the engine and carriages should never rest on a joint,
but roll over a continuous and unbroken line of rails. He thought that this might
be effected by rolling the rail in two halves, and riveting them together in such a way
that the engine would never bear wholly on a joint ; and by adopting the wedge-fast-
ening alluded to above, the strain on the rivets would be relieved and not likely to
shake loose ; indeed, the section of the rail might be so contrived that the action of
the wedge in keeping the rail tight in the chair may also tend to force the half rails
together, and probably render rivets altogether unnecessary ; of course it would be
necessary to provide for expansion and contraction, which could easily be eflected.

On a Dynamometric Machine for Pleasuring the Strength of Textile Fabrics
                  and other Substances. By M. Perreaux.

On Telegraphic Communication between Great Britain and Ireland, by the
  Mull of Cantyre. By W. J. Macquorn Rankine, C.E., and John
   Thomson, C.E.

   The authors recommend the construction of a line of electric telegraph between
Great Britain and Ireland, crossing the North Channel from the Mull of Cantyre to
Tor Point, chiefly on the following groiuuls:

   1. It involves the construction of a much less length of submarine telegraph than
any other line, the distance across the channel in the line proposed being only thirteen
miles, while that from Portpatrick to Donaghadee is twenty-two miles ; from five to
five and a half additional miles of submarine telegi-aph woidd be required to cross
small arms of the sea; but this would be in small detached portions, easily laid and
repaired, and would make the total length of submarine telegraph only about eigh-

teen miles.
   2. It is the most secure of all sites for an electric telegraph between Britain and

Ireland, for no vessel ever casts anchor in the proposed line.
    3. Besides these national advantages, it has the local advantage of connecting the

North-East of Ireland directly with the ports on the Clyde.

   As it may be considered necessary for local purposes that the electric telegraph
should be carried as far north as Larne in Ireland, and as far westward as Dumbarton
and Greenock on either bank of the Clyde, Larne may be looked upon as the Irish
terminus of this scheme, and either Dumbarton or Greenock as the Scottish terminus.
The line from Dumbarton would require 106 miles of land telegraph, the alternative

line from Greenock 93 miles, to complete the communication.
   The authors consider the security of this line of telegraph to be an advantage, in a

national point of view, sufficiently great to warrant its execution, even were the lines
by Portjiatrick and Holyhead in full operation.

JRemarhs on the Mechanical Process for Cooling Air in Tropical Climates

proposed by Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth. By W. J. M. Ranrine, C.E., F.R.S.E.

  --The most improved form of the apparatus proposed by Prof. Smyth consists, 1 . of

a compressing pump, by which the air is to be forced into, 2. a refrigerator, consist-
ing of a long tube, or a series of tubes, exposed to a stream of water, in which the
air will be deprived of the heat generated by the compression, and from which it will
escape into, 3. an expansion cylinder, in which the air will at once become cooled
by expansion to an extent nearly, but not quite, equal to that of the original heating
by compression, and will propel a piston, to assist in working the compressing pump.
The air will be delivered from this expansion cylinder into the building to be venti-
lated. The principal resistance to be overcome in this improved machine will be the
friction. The author gives formula and rules for calculating the dimensions of the
parts of this machine, and the power required to work it, supposing the friction to be

known. It is difficult to estimate the amount of friction beforehand; but supposing
it to be a little greater in proportion than that of a Cornish pumping-engine, the
author calculated that about 25,000 cubic feet of air per hour may be cooled down

from 90° Fahr. to 60° by an engine of 1 -horse power *.

  A Model of a new Reaping Machine, by Mr. R. Robinson, was exhibited by one of

the Secretaries.

          Design for Safety Harbours. By Captain J. Saunders.

   The advantages sought by the author are, durability, cheapness of execution (when
compared with the important object it has in view), and security from damage during
the progress of the work. The sea pavement, which has heretofore been the ruin of
our best harbours, will be by this design dispensed witli, substituting a strong sea-wall
instead. The bell-work to seaward will be constructed on a new plan, diminishing
one foot in each course till it reaches low-water mark, on which the great sea-wall will
commence ; this wall will be supported from the interior by horizontal arches and
sectional walls ; the horizontal arches will be filled with concrete and small stones to
high-water mark. The contractor may undertake, with a small capital, a large work
without any risk or danger, as each section can be completed before another is com-
menced, as particularly described on the design and model ; the cost of execution will
be less, and the permanency greater, than by the usual mode of construction, and the
design may be adapted to any situation or scale of magnitude.

On the Natural Peculiarities and Advantages of the Mineral Field and the
            proposed Harbour of Fair Head. By W. H. Smith.

   This was a proposal to erect a harbour at Fair Head, the extreme point on the
north-eastern coast of Ireland, and establish a submarine telegraph between it and
the Mull of Cantyre, which is only twelve miles distant on the Scottish coast, and is
the principal point to Glasgow. Having pointed out the variety of mineral wealth

and natural products, consisting of coal, iron, sulphur, copperas, ochre, building-
stone and limestone, and other valuable substances which abounded in the district, but

--could not be turned to fiill advantage in consequence of the want of a harbour, while

--shipwi-ecks on the coast have occurred annually since the old harbour of Ballycastle

adjoining was allowed to fall to decay, the paper stated, that a harbour at Fair Head
would be a permanent protection to shipping, and besides increasing the spirit of com-
mercial enterprise, would in some cases be the means of shortening the passage to
America by several days. The harbour was proposed to be constructed on the recoil
principle, being formed of a framework fastened to piles, with counterbalancing weights

attached, so that it would yield to the waves and yet recover its position continually.

A lighthouse on the same principle was proposed to be attached.

                  On Penrose and Bennett's Sliding Helieograph.
                     Communicated by Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.

  The author, Mr. Penrose, observed, " I was led, during my researches on the subject

of the refined curves of the Greek mouldings and ornaments, to consider whether it
would be possible to contrive some method of describing the volutes and scroll-work at
once more ready and more satisfactory than the tiresome approximations, by means of
circular ones, which have generally been used. 1 invented an instrument for this pur-

   * From calculations made since this paper was read, it appears. that if the compressing
pump and expansion cylinder be made on the principle of the gasometer (by bells dipping

into a tank of water, as in M. Struve's machine for extracting the foul air from mines), the
power required to reduce tlie temperature of a cubic foot of air from 90° Fahr. down to 60°,

will be about 16^ foot-pounds for the mere reduction of temperature, and about 13^ foot-

pounds additional for friction, or 30 foot-pounds in all ; so that by an engine of one real
horse-power, 66,000 cubic feet of air per hour may be cooled from 90° to 00° Fahr., being

enough for the supply of 264 persons, at 250 cubic feet per hour each.

pose, called the Screw Helicograph. This instrument has been elaborated into the im-
proved form now exhibited. By simply turning round the graduated ring -vfithin the
square frame, this instrument is enabled to draw in pencil or ink any form of the equi-
angular spiral from the circle to the straight line ; and, by alterations in the position of
the pen, or of the centre, with respect to the guide bar, certain variations may be ob-
tained. Also either a parallel line to the first may be drawn by a simple adjustment
of the pen, or a duly converging line, by bringing the whole frame nearer to or farther
from the centre. Expressing the ratio between two spiral radii at an interval of 360°

(viz. a""") by the term ' spiral ratio,' it appears that curves drawn with this instrument
with spiral ratios less than 8 or 10 to 1 are fitted for volutes and scroll-work, and
those which are drawn with liigher ratios form the outlines of vases and other such
figures where a gentle variation of curvature is desired. This quality is ensured from
the property of the curve that the radius of curvature is proportional to the length of
the arc. For figures where great energy is required, curves of a different nature are
more suitable, but no curves appear to surpass these in sweetness of sequence."

On some Properties of TVhirling Fluids, with their application in improving
   the action of Blowing Fans, Centrifugal Pumps, and certain kinds of
   Turbines. By James Thomson, A.M., Civil Engineer, Belfast.

   The author pointed out several properties possessed by masses of fluids revolving
in the circumstances of one of the most ordinary kinds of whirlpools, that, namely,
which is formed when water is supplied at the circumference of a widely extended
vessel, with a very slight rotatory motion, and is allowed to flow away by a central

--orifice in the bottom. Of these properties, the following, in which the influence of

friction is left out of consideration, may be cited :
    The equation of the curve whose revolution would generate the curved surface of

the whirlpool is
                                                                        C»

where y is the depth of any point of the curve below the level of the fluid taken
at any part far away from the whirlpool, where there is no perceptible depression,
X the distance of the point from the axis of revolution, and (J a constant

quantity.

    Every point of the surface of the fluid moves with the velocity which a heavy body
would attain in falling from the level of the surface far away from the whirlpool to
the level of the point. Also every point in the interior of the revolving mass
moves with the velocity of the point on the surface vertically above itself; and it
follows, that the velocities of points at various distances from the centre are in-
versely proportional to the distances. It follows also that the velocity of each point
 in the mass, is the greatest that is possible without an increase of the velocity of
 every other point revolving further from the centre.

   He was led from these and other properties of whirling fluids, to find that the
efficiency of centrifugal pumps for water, and of fans for causing blasts of air, may

be greatly increased by the provision, outside of the circumference of the wheel, of

a space in which the fluid may continue to revolve without any interruption after it
has left the wheel. He mentioned also, that an apparatus termed a " diffuser," and
involving the same principle, has recently been applied with good results, in turbines
of great power constructed in America.

On a Jet Pump, or Apparatus for drawing up Water by the Power of a Jet.
                            By James Thomson, C.E.

    Th« purpose for which the author has designed this new pump, is to clear the
water out of the pits of submerged water-wheels, when access to them is required for
inspection or repairs. This pump may also be used for raising water in other cases
·where an abundant fall of water is available ; as, for instance, for draining a marsh
in the neighbourhood of a waterfall. Its action depends on two principles. One of
 these is the same as that of the steam blast used in locomotive engines, and in the
                                    ;

ventilation of mines. The other is that of the increased flow of water from a pipe,

produced by giving a gradually widening form to its discharging extremity.

  A Asketch of the apparatus is given in the accompanying figure, where is a pipe

which supplies the water to the nozzle B for the jet, and C is a pipe which receives,

at its narrow end, the jet from the nozzle, and on account of its gradually widening
form, causes a suction capable of raising water by the pipe D.

   The various principles brought into action in this apparatus, have, as was stated by
the author, been long known in hydrodynamics ; but their combination in this form

Afor use he believed to be new.. rush of water had been used ])reviously in a some-

what similar way in Italy to draw up and carry off the water of a marsh. In respect
to the method there employed he had not been able to obtain full information ; but
the description of it he had received led him to suppose that it was not so efficacious
as the method which formed the subject of his communication to the meeting.

   On the Production of Cold by Mechanical Means. By W. S. Ward.

   To effect the purposes named in a preceding paper, Mr. Ward proposes a different

method, and the substitution of the vapours of volatile liquids, such as sulphuric

aether in place of air. He believed the theoretical results would be the same, and

some sources of loss diminished ; but although he doubted whether either form of
apparatus would be oeconomically efficient, he felt that interesting results would follow
well-conducted experiments on the subject.

         On Telegraphic Time Signals. By Charles V. Walker.

   The object was, to explain the arrangements that have been completed, as far as
his part in them extends, for promoting the scheme of transmitting Greenwich mean
time throughout the kingdom. On the 5th of August 1 852, the first thne-signal passed
and on August 19th, the clock at Greenwich, which originates the signals, having
been brought to time, and the adjustment elsewhere having been completed, the
regular transmission of signals commenced ; in the first instance, to Dover, at noon,
and at 4 p.m. Mr. Walker then described the appai-atus constructed by Mr. Shep-
herd, and erected at the London Terminus, by which the connexions are made. And,
incidental to this, it is to be understood that in the galvanic- room at the Royal Obser-
vatory is a set of ordinary sand-acid batteries (to be replaced ultimately by graphite
batteries) ; one battery termination is connected with the earth, by means of the gas-
pipes; and the other with a spring contained in Mr. Shepherd's electromagnetic
clock. The Greenwich London wire also terminates in the same clock: and the
connexions are such that, at the last second of the last minute of each hour, this line-
 wire and the battery-wire are placed in contact for an instant; and, consequently, if
 the circuit is completed at the other end of the wire, whether at London, Dover,
 Rochester, the Strand, Lothbury, or elsewhere, a signal will pass every hour ; and,
when the circuit is left open, no signal will pass. To accomplish this, a train of
wheels is connected with the rod of Sir. Carter's large turret-clock, now erected over

                                                                                                       9*

the South-Eastern Terminus. Sets of springs are placed near at hand to some of the
wheels ; the springs are all tipped with platinum, and are respectively connected with
the several wires concerned in the scheme ; and, according as the contacts between
the several springs are varied, so is the time signal led to its destination. Mr. Walker
then explained an ingenious contrivance, by which, at the completion of the circuit at
Greenwich, a voltaic current of instantaneous duration passes from Greenwich to
Dover, and causes one sharp deflection of the galvanometer needle of the usual elec-
tric telegraph. The clerks at the several stations, should they overlook the general
order to cease working, and to be on the watch, are reminded that the time is nearly
due by finding that the telegraph circuit is broken ; which happens during the two
minutes that the spring is lifted by the pin off the earth wire at London. The clerks
watch the signal, and make note of the error of their local clock. The time-signals
will, at set times, be allowed to pass automatically to Hastings, to Deal, and to
Ramsgate, by turning them on the main line by the usual telegraph turn-plates now
in use at junction stations. The signal will be transmitted to intermediate stations by
hand, which can be done correctly to a fraction of a second. The clerk will watch for
the signal while he holds in his hand the handle of a group, or a branch instrument
he will move his hand as he sees the signal, and a simultaneous signal will pass along
the group.

             On Graphite Batteries. By Charles V. Walker.

    After refei'ring to the unfitness of copper, and the too great cost of the superior
metals for the purpose of batteries for telegraphic purposes, Mr. Walker said he had
early sought a substitute, and had found one which seemed to promise all that was
required in the deposit of carbon or graphite from iron gas-retorts.

         On the Neiv Patent Law. By Thomas Webster, F.R.S.

   The author contrasted the facilities which the new law afforded in the application for
and obtaining of patents, and in the protection to such property, with the cumbrous,
expensive, and duplicated pi-ocesscs which characterized the old system. He further

pointed out the necessity of extending further protection to designs according to a

system analogous to that of the new patent law, if the industrial education which the
schools of design were endeavouring to introduce was to be useful to the pupils as
creating a body of educated persons not only dependent on their employers or on

capitalists.

On a New Method of Scutching the Neiv Zealand Flax (Phormium tenax).
  £y Matthew Whytlaw, C.E. of Auckland, Neiv Zealand. {Communis
   cated by Sir David Brewster.)

    After noticing the plan hitherto used in the colony, and pointing out some of its

defects, Mr. Whytlaw went on to show that the principle on which New Zealand flax

ought to be scutched was by transverse rubbing instead of longitudinal beatings as
now in use, and described a very simple machine invented by him, in which this
principle was carried into effect, and which was perfectly effectual for the purpose
and he suggested that a machine on the same principle might be used with advantage
for European flax.
