Report of the Proceedings of the Council in 1848-49, as presented
   TO THE General Committee at Birmingham, Wednesday, September

    12, 1849.

   1, With reference to the subjects referred to the Council by the General
Committee assembled at Swansea, the Council have to report

   1st. That they communicated the recommendation of the General Com-

mittee, for the continuance of the Magnetical and Meteorological Observa-
tory at Toronto to the 31st of December, 1850, to Lord John Russell,
through the President, the Marquis of Northampton. They have the plea-
sure of stating that the Observatory has been continued.

    2nd. Pursuant to the request of the General Committee, the Council have
taken into consideration the expediency of inserting in the Rules of the
British Association a paragraph to the effect that those gentlemen who have
held the office of President of the Association should subsequently be ex-
officio members of the Council ; and the Council now recommend that a
paragraph to that effect should be inserted in the Rules of the Association.

   3rd. The sum of 100/., placed by the General Committee at the disposal
of the Council for the disbursements connected with the Kew Observatory,
has sufficed, under Mr. Ronalds's general superintendence, for the mainte-
nance of the Observatory in the past year as a depository for the books and
instruments belonging to the Association ; and also for the preparation of
the self-registering magnetical instruments, on Mr. Ronalds's plan, for the
       REPORT OF THE COUXCiL.                  XVH

Toronto Colonial Observatory. Mr. Birt lias completed the reduction and

discussion of the series of electrical observations made at Kew ; and Mr.

Ronalds has drawn up a Report describing the modifications and improve-
ments which he has introduced in the self-registering apparatus during the
last year. Both these Reports will be read to Section A. preparatory to a
consideration of any further recommendation which it may appear desirable
to make for the continued maintenance of the Observatory. In connexion
with this subject, the Council liave great pleasure in announcing to the

General Committee, that Her Majesty's Government, on the joint application
of the Marquis of Northampton and Sir John Herschel, have granted to
Mr. Ronalds a pecuniary recompense of £250 for the invention of his method
of constructing self-registering magnetical and meteorological apparatus. It
will be recollected by many members of the General Committee that the
subject of self-registering instruments was discussed at the meeting of the
British Association at Cambridge, in 1845, upon the application for a grant
of money from the funds of the Association to enable Mr. Ronalds to com-
plete an apparatus for that purpose at Kew ; and that a recommendation

--was made on that occasion by the Association to Government which recom-

mendation was concurred in by the President and Council of the Royal

--Society of the expediency of encouraging, by specific pecuniary rewards,

the improvement of self-recording magnetical and meteorological apparatus.
   As the grant to Mr. Ronalds has been made in consequence of that

original recommendation and the favourable reply that was returned to it,
and as the apparatus itself has been constructed, and its successful operation
shown at the Observatory of the Association, of which Mr. Ronalds is the
Honorary Superintendent, the Council have deemed it proper to make this
formal, and as they are sure acceptable, announcement of the favourable
reception which has been given to the application on Mr. Ronalds's behalf;
but they are glad, at the same time, to take the opportunity of expressing
the satisfaction with which they have learned that the ingenious invention of
Mr. Brooke, for similar purposes, has also received a pecuniary recompense

from the Government.
   II. The Council regret that they are still unable to announce the publica-

tion either of Professor Edward Forbes's Researches in the ^gean Sea, or
of the Mountjoy Observations, for which purposes grants of public money
have- been sanctioned by Her Majesty's Government at the recommendation

of the British Association.

    III. The Council have added the following names to the list of Corre-

sponding Members of the British Association:

       Professor Pliicker of Bonn.
       Dr. Siljestrom of Stockholm,
       Prof. H. D. Rogers of Philadelphia.

IV. Prof. Dove, of Berlin, Corresponding Member of the British Asso-

ciation, having offered to supply the Association with as many copies as

might be desired of his Maps of the Monthly Isothermal Lines of the Globe,

founded upon the Temperature Tables printed in the volume of the Reports

of the British Association for 1848, which maps have been partly engraved

and partly lithographed at the expense of the Royal Academy of Sciences

at Berlin, the Council directed that Prof. Dove should be requested to supply

the Association with 500 copies, on the understanding that the Association

should pay for the paper and for taking off the impressions ; and that the

copies thus furnished should be sold, under the direction of the oflficers, to

Members of the Association at cost price, with the translation of a report

1819.                                       c
               ----                                    ----                  ;

Xvlii                                                  --REPORT 1849.

from Prof. Dove, explanatory of the Maps and of the more obvious conclu-

sions deduced from them. The Maps have been completed, but from acci-

dental circumstances the packet containing the first 200 copies, prepared for

the Association, has not yet been despatclied from Berlin, and cannot be

expected to reach England until after the Meeting at Birmingham is over

but copies of the Maps and Report will be forwarded immediately they
arrive to Members who may be desirous of purchasing them, and who give
their names for that purpose in the Reception Room. The cost of each

copy will be 5s. for the three Maps.
   V. The Council has directed that the following additions should be made

to the Regulations, according to which the volumes of the Reports are

distributed to the Members :

1. That Members who have formerly paid £5 as a life composition, and

shall at any future time pay an additional sum of £5, shall be entitled to

receive (gratis) the volumes of the Transactions which shall be published

after the date of such additional payments.

2. That Members shall have the opportunity of purchasing any of the

already published volumes of the Association, of which more than 100 copies

remain, at half the price at which the volumes were issued to the public.

   VI. Tlie Council have great pleasure in submitting to the General Com-

mittee tiie following list of invitations, from which the General Committee

will have to select the place of meeting of the Association in 1850,

a. Invitations received at Swansea by the General Committee, and which

stood over after the selection of Birmingham, 1849 :

From Derby, for 1850.

6. Invitations received since the Swansea Meeting and communicated to

       Society; the Natural History Society ; the School of Design ; and the
       Mechanics' Institution.

From Hull, for an early meeting ; from the Literr.ry and Philosophical

       Institution,

. VII. The Council have received and submit to the General Committee

the following letter from Lieut, -Col. Sabine :

       " To the President and Council of the British Association.

--" Gentlemen,       myI beg leave to acquaint you that it is                intention, at the

Meeting of the Association at Birmingham, to resign into the hands of the

General Commtttec the office of General Secretary, with which I have been

honoured, by annual re-election, for ten successive years.

" I have formed this determination, not from any occurrence which has

rendered me less willing than heretofore, to undertake the duties and

responsibilities of that office, or to make the sacrilice of time, convenience,

and of other interests which it requires ; nor from a fear that the kindness

and indulgence with which my endeavours to discharge its duties have been
REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  XIX

regarded by the General Committee, by the Council, and by the Members
of the Association generally, is in any danger of being exhausted ; but from

the opinion which I entertain that, as a general principle, the disadvantages
of such offices being held by the same individual for several years outweigh

--the advantages, and that in my own particular case it is safer to act on the

general principle than to fancy myself an exception to it.

   " I am aware that in Societies in which, as in the British Association, the
Presidency is held but for a single year, it may be desirable that the next

principal executive officer should be more permanent than when tlie Presi-
dency is held for a longer period. But the office of General Secretary of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science is one which confers
lionour and distinction on the individual who holds it, not only in Britain,
but in all countries where science is enjoyed or its advancement desired;
and as such it may justly be regarded as an object of reasonable ambition.
When the Meeting at Birmingham shall have concluded, I shall have com-
pleted a cycle of ten years, and I consider that the time will then be fully
arrived when, with propriety as regards myself, and with a due consideration
of the interests of others, and pre-eminently those of the Association itself,
T may resign the trust with which I have been honoured, into the hands
from which I received it.

   " I have thought it my duty to give you this early intimation of my inten-
tion, as it will probably be considered right that the recommendation of my

successor should proceed from the Council.
                                                                              " I have, &c.,

                                                                    " Edward Sabine."

      Recommendations adopted by the General Committee at the
                      Birmingham Meeting in September 184 9.

                           General Meetings (in the Town Hall).

   On Wednesday, September ]2tli, at 8 p.m., the late President, The

Marquis of Northampton, V.P.R.S., resigned his Office to the Rev. T. R.
Robinson, D.D., M.R.I. A., who took the Chair at the General Meeting, and
delivered an Address, for which see p. xxix.

   On Thursday, September 13th, the power of Mr. Gassiot's Battery in ex-

citing Light and Heat was exhibited, and Dr. Faraday added some explana-
tion of the Phaenomena.

   On Monday, September 17th, the Rev. Prof. Willis, M.A., F.R.S., gave a

Discourse and exhibited Working Models, to illustrate the result of some
recent Experiments on the Transit of different Weights with varying Velo-
cities on Railways.

   On Wednesday, September 19th, the concluding General Meeting of the

Association was held, when the Proceedings of the General Committee, and
the grants of money for scientific purposes were explained to the Members.

   The Meeting was then adjourned to Edinburgh in August 1850*.

                 * The Meeting is appointed to take place on Wednesday, 31st July.

                                                    BY

 The Rev. THOMAS ROMNEY ROBINSON, D.D.,

                                    M.RJ.A., F.R.A.S.

--Gentlemen, If 1 thought only of myself, the embarrassment which in

taking the place to which you have called me I feel, would be much increased
by the way in which my predecessor has spoken of me. Hitherto it has
been filled by men illustrious in the senate or the field, heads of the societies

which are the centres of our scientific life, and lodestars of the great insti-
tutions which have been through many ages the guides of our nation in the
progress of intellectual cultivation. Against such men, if I weigh myself, I

know how much I shall be found wanting. But I trust I may be permitted
to regard myself as the type of a humbler but not useless class, for whom
this Association was especially devised, and whom it enables to add their

tribute to swell the general store. For it is not like the forbidden ground
of romance, a region where heroes only can tread ; it is not a mere instru-
ment for collecting into a focus the light of the suns of the intellectual sky.
It is rather like those machines which unite the power of many ; singly weak,
but achieving by the union works which would overtask the strength of the
mightiest individual. In one thing only I will venture to take to myself as
not unmerited, the praise of Lord Northampton. In zeal for the welfare of
this Association, in intense interest for the accomplishment of its objects I

yield to none ; and if these may suffice, I hope I shall not be found unworthy

of the trust you repose in me.

   Yet, it is no common responsibility with which you have charged me ; for

this Association is one of the great powers which the altering phases of the
world have called into action. But a few years since it could not have
existed ; and even now some persons are found imable to appreciate its
--XXX REPORT 1849.

results or understand its purpose. In fact, as the invention of a new machine

or process of manufacture is evidence that the old is becoming inadequate to

meet the demand which it formerly satisfied; so the feelings which have so

successfully called into being our Association here, and similar institutions

abroad, maybe regarded as a proof that the existing agencies fo r the develop-

ment of scientific knowledge were becoming unequal to their work, and that

some higher power must be sought, of energy commensurate to the increasing

pressure. Such a power, I think, it is now certain that we afford. It is

possible that the form of this great experiment may receive some modifica-

tion ; for example, that it may involve a yet wider application of the mighty

principle on which it is based, and become a union not only of persons but

of institutions. But we have established beyond doubt that it is a trial in

--the right direction, that its principle is the true one, the principle of Asso-

ciation. It may perhaps seem trivial to attach importance to such an asser-

tion                    in  commercial  enterprise,  in  manufactures,  in  politics  its  truth  is
                     ;

universally confessed ; what then is there new in applying it to science ?

Nothing, assuredly : in fact science, at least physical science, owes to it almost

its very existence, and certainly its progress ; and the wonder is that none
seem to have fully comprehended this before the founders of the British

Association. Observe, that though physical science is of recent birth, physical
knowledge has been an object of desire from the very origin of our race.

Some have followed it for the sake of the powers which it conferred ; and

some from the high instinct which reveals to a noble mind the beauty and

majesty of such pursuits. In the first glimmer of history, the astronomy of

the Assyrian Magi looms through the darkness ; the geometry which might
have been its champion and guide appears in no feeble development even

in the fabulous antiquity of India. The sepulchres of Etruria and Egypt,

the palaces of Nineveh, are giving up to us relics of art that imply in high

perfection the existence of that practical chemistry which was transmitted to

us through their Arabian successors. When we look at the marvellous archi-

tecture of the middle ages, we find a mastery of the principles of equilibrium

and pressure, that fills the mind capable of appreciating it with delight beyond

even what its surpassing beauty inspires ; and we know from the writings of
Roger Bacon and Kircher that many facts of experimental physics were cur-

rent in the cloister. The elements were in existence, but some power was

wanting which could combine them into a body and give it life. That power
was free, open, honest association. Not intellectual energy or acuteness :

the Greeks possessed that to an extent never perhaps equalled by any other

people ; but they were made incapable of steady union for any purpose, by

the strange elements of repulsion which seemed inherent in their nature and

                                                                                                      I

split their philosophers into sects, their nation into fragments. Elsewhere
the separation was still wider ; the priestly casts of old, the conventional
clergy and masonic societies of more recent times, could not coalesce with
the rest of the world in the union which I hold to be essential to the growth
of science. Therefore, however extensive their knowledge (and they knew

more than is generally supposed) it never ripened into general principles
it even became corrupt in the dull stagnation of the mystery in which it was

--buried, an instrument of superstition or imposture, a delusion to its pos-

sessors themselves. Astronomy became astrology,-- chemistry, alchemy

natural philosophy, magic. Brewster has shown how the concave mirror
brought up an apparition when it was needed, and Boutigny has revealed how
the repulsive energies of heat ministered to the iniquity of the ordeal. But

this period of isolated labour, under which the intellectual domain of our

race lay so long fallow, closed at last ; and the principle of association re-

vealed itself, at one of the epochs of that movement which from time to time

stirs up the region of mind, as those of geology do the earth at the com-

mencement of some great formation. To borrow from that science an illustra-

--tion, the reign of reptiles and monsters gave way to higher beings that

soared in the sky ; the dominion of Aristotle and the schoolmen disappeared

before the age of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Bacon. From the fifteenth

century downwards we find the philosophers of Europe beginning to be

worthy of that name, lovers of knowledge. Instead of wrapping up their

discoveries in secrecy, using them as a means of influence over the ignorant,

or brooding on them as food for haughty self-love; we find them forming a

--brotherhood of knowledge, eager to communicate their inventions, applying

to each other for instruction, and even disputing among themselves the

honour of priority in successful research. If the Florentine astronomer

still envelopes in cipher his observations of Venus and Saturn, it is lest a

--rival should anticipate what was necessary to perfect his discovery : while

the Monk of Oxford hides in a similar veil his knowledge of gunpowder to
exalt himself in the opinion of the world, yet keep his secret. The step in

advance was wide, and the onward progress was rapid. It is not merely

that each discovery, which is thus freely communicated, becomes an imperish*

able addition to the treasury of human knowledge, but it is also a source of

others, more numerous as it is more widely diffused,-- like a syngenesious

flower, whose winged seeds would produce little if confined to the neigh-

bourhood of their parent, but bear a thousand-fold when scattered over the

Heland.  who first finds a physical fact or principle often fails to trace it to

sole labourer in the mine, much of its wealth would be lost : it may be too

vast to be explored by the power of one mind, or within the limits of one

life ; or it may require aids and appliances which solitary individuals do not

--possess : to say nothing of what is still more important, the increase of

energy which flows from the sympathy and admiration of a multitude. It
is not too much to say, that the progress of mankind in science during the

two centuries to which I refer, far exceeded what had been made during the

fifty-six that preceded them : yet the force which impelled it was only par-

tially and imperfectly exerted, and it was soon felt to be capable of far wider

application. In this stage of its action the principle of association had ope-

rated on only a few mighty spirits whom the sense of kindred pursuits and
powers linked together ; but from whom their very transcendence kept their

humbler fellows at a reverential distance. It was necessary that these also

--should be included in its bond : and the age of Societies began. By con-

densing into a multitude of local centres the activity which was weakened in

its diffusion, that privilege of labouring to extend the boundaries of know-

ledge, which had been the glory of a chosen few, was extended to a multitude

societies devoted to this object arose in different co\mtries, varying in con-

stitution and form, but all emanating from the same necessity of bringing

united exertion to bear on what every passing year showed to be among

the noblest objects of human existence. And in this they were eminently

--successful: strong in numbers, they were stronger in local concentration;

their definite and permanent organization was a source of life and power ; and
the visible results of their activity were manifest to the world. In many in-

stances they acquired a legal and corporate existence, which gave them a

hold on general opinion and even on governments ; their pecuniary resources
and moral weight afforded them the means of researches beyond the reach

of ordinary inquirers ; and their exclusive character, whether limited by
election or by appointment, by making it an object of ambition to belong to

them, gained for their pursuits a popularity which their intrinsic worth might

-- --Anot so soon have won.
       still more perhaps their most important feature

is the principle of systematic publication, the value of which has gone on

increasing to the present hour, and cannot be overrated. Their Transactions

gave to the world not merely casual observations, which might otherwise

have perished, but elaborate investigations, which probably would never

--have found a publisher in the ordinary course of trade, perhaps never have

been undertaken had not this channel been open to their authors. It would

be foreign to my purpose, even were it possible, to give you an account of

the philosophical societies which have flourished, not merely in Europe, but

in some of the most distant regions which her sons have reached as colonists

Aor conquerors.  tlescription of them would nil volumes,-- a record cf

their proceedings would be the history of scientific progress for the last two

--centuries : I might say of science itself, for, in fact, they began with Newton,

and he stands like the sun in Heaven ; all is luminous after he has risen,

all before darkness or twilight. Yet, while rendering to them the praise

which their services have so well deserved, we must not forget that as they

were called into existence to meet a state of things which has passed away,

so the altered condition of the human mind requires from them now a very

different class of function from those which they discharged at first ; and that

circumstances may occur in which they may retard instead of advancing the

progress of knowledge. That which I referred to as an original element of

--their power is of this number, their restricted and local character ; their

very nature requires that they be placed in large towns or cities, and they

cannot multiply their members beyond narrow limits. This was not injurious

as long as a single room in a tavern was sufficient to hold all the philosophers

of the metropolis, or the means of experiment and instruction were scarcely

--accessible out of its precincts. It is far otherwise now, when we count

more thousands, and those, too, of higher standard in the ranks of science,

than units could be reckoned at the beginning of last century, and when every

day adds to their number. No possible extension of the great societies can

--meet this, even were they disposed to make it, which I believe they are

not. On the contrary, there is among them a tendency to limit their ad-

missions to men of high fame and proved attainments, and thus, in some

degree, form an Aristocracy of Science, What, then, is to become of the

rest?--are they to form provincial societies similarly organized? This, it

seems to me, is but a retrograde step ; a violation of the great principle to

--which we owe our advance, a breaking up into fragments of the energy

which it should be the aim of all our efforts to associate into one mighty unity

and however valuable such societies areas auxiliaries, unless it be found pos-

sible to link them, by some principle of federation, unto our great body, with-

out interfering with their self-government and independence, I feel that much

of the good which they are capable of effecting must be lost. Secondly, the

increasing vastness of the field which we have to cultivate surpasses the

powers of any single body of labourers. Look, for instance, at the most

    illustrious of all, the Royal Society. At first, as we see from its Transac-

I

    tions, it was a mere collector of detached facts and observations, and for

portant to class and interpret than to collect, and the latter part of its office

became subordinate to the other. By degrees, as its accumulating duties

began to surpass its powers, we find dissatisfaction appearing, and complaints

that particular branches of science are neglected to favour others not so im-

portant. At last, the necessity of a division of work becomes apparent ; a

-- --society splits off to devote itself to geology, another to astronomy, others
--to various branches of Natural History, while the parent, like Trembley's

hydra, is more active and powerful than before this division. That this

process has increased our knowledge a hundred-fold, will not be disputed
by any who have watched its progress during the last thirty years ; and yet

it can scarcely be denied that, besides the chance of exciting hostile feelings

between rival societies, it is open to another objection. The different

branches of science cannot well be isolated ; each depends on many others.
Geology presses into its service not merely its special subject, but also the
Geometry of Hopkins, the Botany of Lindley, and the Zoography of Owen

and Agassiz. Astronomy must not only track the unseen with Adams and

--Le Verrier, or fathom the abysses of the sky with Herschel and Rosse, it

must also visit the workshops of the machinist with Airy and Struve. And

so of the rest ; they cannot be disunited : and therefore it is evident that some

system must be found, which, while it leaves unfettered the whole special

organization of each Society, shall yet combine their exertions, not merely

with each other, but also with the great and ever-increasing multitude of

fellow-labourers beyond their precincts. Therefore it was not merely a
happy thought of the good and wise men who were the founders of the

British Association which led to its existence; this, or something equivalent,

was a necessary result of the expansion of that principle whose course I have

been tracing, and which must, ere long, have found some other development

had they not turned it in this direction. It leaves untouched all that was

previously available, and merely adds what experience had shown to be

deficient. Thus we do not interfere in any way with any Society ; on the

Wecontrary, we identify ourselves with them as far as possible.  admit, as

of right, the members of all chartered Societies that publish Transactions

throughout our empire ; the officers and councils of philosophical institutions,
and all their members who are recommended by those councils ; and our

governing power, or General Committee, is almost entirely derived from the

--same source, it is chiefly composed of " members who have printed papers

in the Transactions of any philosophical society, or of delegates from such

Wesocieties or philosophical institutions."  withdraw nothing from their

those publications contain in latter years, have originated in tlie proceedings

of our Sections. Yet, though we have so much in common with them, it

would be a gross error to confound us with them, or to imagine that any

increase of their activity or any change in their management could supersede

Our Office. Not the least important part of it refers to persons entirely un-

connected with them, persons who have struggled after knowledge in dif-

ficulty and obscurity, whose diffidence would shrink from the distinction

belonging to such connection, or even who, without any scientific acquire-
ments, have yet a reverence for them, a perception of their worth. Such

we can count by thousands ; and every one of them, I am confident, has

been profited by the influence which we have exerted on his mind. We

have gone still further, and admitted ladies as Associates ; exciting the

surprise and perhaps scorn of those who think women fit only for household

cares or showy accomplishments ; and we have done well ; for without re-
ferring to Mrs. Somerville, Mrs. Marcet, or others whom I would name

were they not present, I have myself known some whose proficiency in
several of our departments might have put many an F.R.S. to shame, who

were not to be surpassed in all the graces of their sex, and were perfect in

all the relations of domestic life. Man cannot ascend in the scale of intel-
lectual power unless woman rises with him. Another advantage which we

possess above stationary societies is, our mobility ; we can pursue our labours
wherever much is to be learnt or many are to be taught. From the Uni-

versities, the seats of abstract science, we have ranged to the mighty emporia

of GreatBritain, to the treasure-houses of its mineral and melallurgic wealth,

to the marvellous palaces of its industrial art ; and at every step of our

progress, even the most highly gifted and richly stored among us have learned
new facts, seen opening before them new lines of thought, and met new men.

It is a glorious discipline, the very one which Homer attributes to the wisest

of his heroes : noWtSv avOpwTro)!/ 'ilev aarea KUi voov eyvu). And let us hope,

own industry and enterprise, and augment the prosperity and glory of our

country.

   Our Association has been tried during eighteen years, and with a success
which has exceeded by far what its most ardent friends had ventured to

                                                                           d2

anticipate. It would of course be unreasonable to expect that its career

should be at all times equally brilliant, or that an institution, whose roots

spread into every part of the realm, and every order of its people, can be
free from the fluctuations by which their prosperity is ruffled. It must also be

borne in mind, that if we adhere, as I trust we ever shall do, to our rule of
assembling wherever we are called by the interests of science, we must oc-
casionally visit remote and unattractive localities, where the difficulties of
access, and the want of accommodation will discourage many from attending.

--But yet we can truly assert, that in each of these eighteen years and

--assuredly this nineteenth will be no exception it has added largely to our

knowledge, and in no respect fallen short of the objects contemplated by its
founders. These were, as stated to the original meeting at York, " to pro-

mote the intercourse of the cultivators of science with each other, and with
foreign philosophers ;" "to give a stronger impulse, and more systematic
direction to scientific inquiry ; " " to obtain a greater degree of national

attention to the objects of science, and a removal of the disadvantages which
impede its progress."

   Let me request your attention for a few moments respecting each of these.
The first of them may perhaps be undervalued by some, or rated merely as
an intellectual luxury. Even at that low estimate, it is above price ; but it

--is of far higher import. If to visit the field of some high deed to stand
--before the sepulchre of the illustrious dead can fill the mind with lofty

aspirations, and lift it to the noblest emprise, how much more shall it kindle
in the actual presence of one of those great beings who are raised up by our

Heavenly Father to be the lights of our race ! Who could stand before

Bessel without feeling how genius is exalted by industry ! What a lesson of
truth and decision was written on the brow of Dalton ! But our close inter-
course with each other is still more precious, from its tendency to check some
evil elements of our nature. For instance, the bitter disputations and petty
hostility, which have too often disgraced the records of science, and made its
followers contemptible. The most irritable man must feel less disposed to
apply violent language, or attribute unworthy motives to one whom he has
met in kindly intercourse, and whose character he has appreciated, than
when he encounters a perfect stranger in the arena of the press ; or if lie
have offended, how many opportunities of atonement and reconciliation are
offered by a reunion like this ! Accordingly, this fault has nearly disap-
peared ; and when traces of it occur, it is only in persons who have not
fully entered into the spirit of our Association. Nor is it less powerful

--to avert a still greater danger the greatest, in fact, which besets our pur-
--suits that of self-esteem. The true philosopher does not incur it : he

                                                                                  I

knows too well the proportion between his ignorance and his knowledge

but if there be any who, from being the wonder of a limited circle, or from

exaggerating the difficulty of his own attainments, is disposed to exalt him-

self above his peers, let him visit us, and I will answer for his cure. There

is not a man on earth who could try the experiment without finding supe-

riors in some of our departments, and scarcely any who would not find an

equal in that of which he is vain.

   As to our foreign visitors, I need not take the trouble of proving what

--you all feel : the attracting them to our shores the having the opportunity

of knowing such men as Arago and CErsted, Ritter, Encke or Struve, Bache

--or Henry of strengthening by the ties of friendship that brotherhood of
--science, to which I have already referred as of such importance that alone

would be worth an Association to obtain it. Even on this, the first night of

our meeting, we are honoured by several distinguished guests. On another

occasion 1 shall express to them our acknowledgement of the honour with

--which their presence graces us ; but now shall refer only to one the Che-
--valier Bunsen in answer to any who may suppose that an attachment to any

of the various branches of science, in which he is so highly gifted, unfits a

man for the most energetic discharge of the active duties of publicJife.

  --In the second object " to give a stronger impulse and more systematic di-
--rection to scientific inquiry " we have not been less successful. The very

excitement connected with our meetings, is itself such an impulse, and a most

powerful one. Those of our members who have long been known as the

--chief ornaments of our great philosophical societies devoted to science, and
--rich in its triumphs feel it as fully now as when first they joined us. At
--each new occurrence they seem to find a renovation of enthusiasm a flow of
--hope, an increase of resolution among us which send them with fresh

strength to resume their labours ; and will be present to them in the hours

of despondency and gloom, which at times cloud even the firmest spirits, like a

beam of light. Nor is our spell less potent on those yet untried in the race,

--who come forward to communicate the first fruits of their research the truth

which has rewarded their solitary toil. To such, the approbation, the kind

advice, the affectionate warning of their more renowned companions, is like

a horoscope that stamps the future course of life ; more powerful even than

the applause of the multitude, who rejoice at the success of one unknown, and

are encouraged by it to similar exertion. But still more precious is the ex-

citement of plunging into this mighty flow of intellect, to one whose lot is like

--mine, cast remote from the resorts of science with few or none near him to

understand or value his pursuits ; nothing but his own fixity of resolve to

disperse the listlessness which thus gathers on the mind and clogs its wing.
xxxviii  REPORT-- 1849.

To him you are as an oasis to the travellers in the Desert, whose palms and
fountains make him forget the waste which he has left, and store him for

another journey with the means of life. But we not only give this impulse,

we also guide it ; and by guiding it, sustain and increase its strength, as well

Aas by removing the difficulties which resist it.  small part of what we

have thus accomplished you find in the volumes which we have published
the most important, as I already stated, is to be found in the Transactions of
various Societies or in separate works. Let me select a few instances, for
rapid notice, as time will fail for more. To begin with the science to which

--I myself am specially devoted Astronomy : it has been above all others

patronized by nations and individuals ; in our own country a Society of high

fame and influence has been established for its advancement ; and yet it has
remained for us to render it services of no common order, which I may be

permitted to explain in some detail. In it, as in many other physical sciences,

the observation of facts is merely the crude ore, which must be sorted, and
sifted and passed through the furnace to make it yield the metal which we
seek. The mere task of making the observations is generally a pleasure
but it is far otherwise with the subsequent process. The arithmetical opera-
tions whjch it requires, demand much more time and involve much more

labour ; that, too, rather intellectual, and involving at every step liabilities

to error. Take a simple instance : you have determined with minute pre-

--cision the apparent place of a star in the sky if you stop then, you have

done nothing. The place you have obtained is not the true one : the atmo-

sphere has bent the line of sight ; while the light travels down your telescope
you and it have been moving ; and the sky-marks by which you map the star
are themselves disturbed by various and complicated motions. For all these

you must allow ; but to do so requires, on j^n average, even in the most im-
proved method of modern times, the writing of 400 figures and the perfonn-

ance of 50 arithmetical operations. But the numbers themselves employed

are the result of other complicated operations ; nearly half are constant for
the same star, but an equal number have relation to the sun and moon, and
therefore vary from day to day. Were these also to be calculated, it would

add an equal amount of work. But even this is insufficient, for we must

compare what we thus obtain with the results of former astronomers ; and

this also cannot be done without bringing them together by the same arith-

metic talisman ; so that were the whole to be performed by the one calcu-
lator, I have found that, however expert he may be, he must expend an hour

at least in obtaining each result. Now, from most of this drudgery in the
case of more than 8000 stars, he is relieved by the Catalogue which the

Association has given to the world. It contains for each the constants already
ADDRESS.                                  XXXIX

noticed ; and gives the prompt and easy means of making the comparison
so easy, that probably before its epocli, 1850, is past, every one of those
places will have been verified in the sky. Such an undertaking could have
been effected only by such a power as ours, which could at once engage the
services of such men as Baily, Herschel, Stratford and their fellow-laboui-ers,
and devote to the inferior part of the work an expenditure exceeding 2000/.
In fact, had we done nothing else, I say fearlessly that this work alone would

have secured us an enduring claim on the gratitude of science. Let me here
remark, that there are many other departments in which we could render

most important service by the mere collection of the Constants that belong
to them ; as we have done in this case and in that of terrestrial magnetism.
Constants are the framework of knowledge, the concentration of power
they belong peculiarly to our domain, and were marked out as such long
since ; but though unfortunately this work was not executed by that power-

ful mind to whom we entrusted it, I hope the subject will not be forgotten,

I might tell you of the theory of the tides, which Laplace might well style
·' the most thorny of problems," but of the greatest interest to a nation

" Whose march is o'er the mountain wave,
     Whose home is on the deep."

I might tell you of light thrown on it by observations obtained by our influ-
ence, reduced at our expense, and unravelled by one worthy of going be-

yond the steps of Newton and Bernouilli. To the same philosopher we owe

--the execution of another important task, the determination of the plane which

marks the level of the sea unvarying with the changes of the tide ; a precious

gift, as but for it in a few years the absolute levels of our great national sur-
veys would have become a delusion. In Ireland, for example, they referred
to the low'water of spring-tides ; a mark which could not be recovered, as

it varies both with time and place. I know not whether this has been yet

corrected, but I trust it soon will, as Airy's observations afford the data. It

would be tedious to tell you all of this kind that we have effected ; and I

--leave the subject, with a reference to one more example, the investigation

of the motion and nature of waves which we owe to Mr. Scott Russell.
These lead by an unexpected line to one far more interesting in a practical

view, the resistance and the form of ships. On this subject it appears that

valuable information has been collected for us ; and it cannot but be matter
of regret that materials obtained at so great an expenditure of money (more
than 1000/.), of labour and thought should remain unavailable, especially
considering the present imperfect condition of naval architecture in reference
to science. In many instances we have aided inquiries of inestimable value,
--xl REPORT 1849.

--though we (lid not originate them: as the Fossil Icththyology of Agassiz,

and those of Owen on Fossil Reptiles and Mammalia, which perhaps but for
us would never have been completed ; and in fine I may mention as an ap-
proximative measure of the impulse which we have given to science, that we
have expended in this way 15,000/. Observe, too, that to this must be
added whatever is the pecuniary value of the labours of those members of
tiie Association who have given us their services. That all is gratuitous ;
and if you consider who many of them are, you will find it not easy to assign
its price. But I regard as even more conducive to the advancement of

--science, another part of our labours, peculiarly our own, I mean the reports

which place before us the actual boundaries of our knowledge. Much intel-
lectual energy is wasted in inventing what is already known ; much spent on

objects comparatively unimportant for want of a due estimate of their worth,
many walks untrodden because it is supposed they have been sufficiently ex-

plored. For all this a remedy is found in those admirable surveys, so many
of which are found in our volumes ; they are as it were a " taking stock " of
our intellectual wealth, and tell us how much of it is real, bow much doubt-
ful, how much wanting. Whether we consider those which embrace a whole

--science, as those of Airy on astronomy or Forbes on meteorology, or those

which include some one of its divisions, as those of Sabine on terrestrial
magnetism, Lloyd on physical optics, Rennie on hydraulics, those by the
Dean of Ely and his compeers on parts of mathematical analysis, or those of

Owen and his fellow-labourers in natural history, with a multitude of others,

--it is scarcely possible to over-estimate their worth. You find there con-

densed into a few pages the essence of many volumes ; the chaos of clashing
statements and conflicting opinions reduced to harmony and order ; truth
winnowed from error, facts from conjecture. They place within the reach
of the most secluded student, a treasure of certain information which it
would be hard for him to obtain, even had he access to the libraries and in-
stitutions of the metropolis ; and even to the mind that is best stored they
save time,--and time is power. Such reports we shall I trust continue to
receive in increasing numbers ; and as long as we do, we prosper, for they
are the surest index, though not the most showy, of our usefulness.

  --I have left myself but little space to consider how far we have fulfilled the

third of our objects " to obtain a greater degree of national attention to the
objects of science." Most assuredly it was needful ; for nowhere in the ci-
vilized world is less honour paid by a nation to science, though nowhere is
national prosperity more connected with its progress, nowhere are heavier

penalties paid for its neglect. I do not now refer to the remarkable fact that in
Britain alone, men whose scientific fame fills all Europe were seldom thought
ADDRESS.  Xli

worthy of any honorary distinction by their government. As it relates to

themselves, this is of no importance ; but it is of deep concern to the honour
of this country. The true votary of science loves it for itself: in its posses-

sion he has a higher honour, a nobler decoration than tnan can give. He

--does not require to be bribed to follow it by titles or ribbons, the baits for

meaner spirits, the lure to lower achievements. But he knows that though
he despises such gauds, those who bestow them hold them precious ; and
they serve him as a scale, by which he finds that great men once placed a

Herschel or a Brewster nearly on a level with a third-rate soldier, or the an-
nual magistrate of some town that might be honoured with a royal visit.

Nor do I refer to the miserable oeconomy which permitted such men as Ivory

and Dalton (to speak only of the dead) to waste, in the drudgery of earning

a precarious subsistence, the years, the powers, the hopes which could have

borne light into the remotest and darkest recesses of the realms of inquiry

though it does contrast painfully with the munificent provision which repub-

lican France, and despotic Russia, heap on such men when they can find them.

--Both these spring from the same root, the gross ignorance in this depart-

ment of intellect, which up to the beginning of this Association, and long after-
wards, prevailed in the land. The industrial classes of our countrymen were

wont to rely in their pursuits on the unenlightened dexterity and empirical

success which resulted from experience, and to scoff at the idea of learning

anything useful from a mere theorist ; those, whom wealth and independence

permitted to choose, seldom sought employment or pleasure in this unfashion-
able region, their education, though the best then current, having given them

very little cognizance of what it might contain. And to ascend still higher,

even to the executive and legislative bodies, they "cared still less for science ;"

the tension of political life engrossed all their faculties : they disliked philo-

sophers as meddlers, or despised them as dreamers. The head of a great
military department once said that he hated scientific officers ! Any one of
his engineers might have told him that more money had been wasted, and
lives lost in that department, from sheer ignorance of science, than any one
could think of without shame and sorrow. The question which I know to
have been asked by another in " high places," though milder in expression,

--was not less scornful " Of what use is science ? " He who asked it ought

to have known better. Whatever tends to raise man above low and sensual

--pursuits whatever to lead him from the partial and present to the general
--and the future whatever to exalt in his mind the dominion of order and the
--supremacy of truth, that must be useful to the individual, useful to the na-

tion. Even had he been incapable of rising above the gross measure of pe-
cuniary value, he ought to have been able to give a mighty answer to his own

inquiry. There is not a single element of our commercial prosperity in which
the vivifying power of science might not be felt, in which the loss arising from
want of that certainty of action which mere unenlightened practice can never

·attain, does not readi an amount which, if stated in figures, would astound the
most thoughtless. For instance, the causes which in our great cities hasten
the death and debase and embitter the life of so many, have at last been

forced by chemists and physiologists on the notice of the public, Look at

Dr. Smith's report on tlie air and water of towns, in this volume ; and when
we think that the victims of the deadly influences which are there revealed

are chiefly found among the people whose industry is the foundation of our

--greatness, that every year cut off from the life of each of these is so much

--subtracted from, national wealth, even were all moral sense or religious

feeling dead in us, we must confess that the knowledge which is caipable of

^verting them " is of use." And the ships that bear the treasures produced

--by this industry through the world are lost to a fearful amount nearly three
--daily. What are they worth ship, cargo, men? and most of them perish

from want of nautical science or from unscientific construction. How many

men have been ruined by searching for minerals, when the merest smattering
of geology would have dispelled their delusion ! On the other hand, the

agricultural produce of our islands might be doubled by a more perfect ap-

plication of the principles of botany and chemistry. The manufacture of iron

has been augmented sixfold by the use of the puddling furnace and the hot"

we excel the world owes its present perfection to mechanicians who are con-

beyond that I need not go. But we live in better times ; for no statesman

only from a few scattered points ; if our meteor-like presence be short it is

also bright ; and as the meteor is remembered when the stationary lamp is

few will forget the impression which it made on them, and fewer fail to feel

that this impression ennobled and exalted their understanding. It is evident

that science now has a far more powerful hold on public opinion than when
we began our course. No other proof is needed of this than the fact that

many new branches of it are finding their way into the course of University

instruction. Without referring to the recent changes in those of this island,

-- --I rejoice to say that in my own that of Dublin within the last year che-

mistry, thermotics, electro-magnetism, and others, have been made a portion

of the under-graduatQ course ; while one of our own valued members has

introduced into primary schools a manual of zoology, of which the spirit is

as good !(s the substance is attractive. But there is another evidence, not

less satisfactory in reference to this our third object, and I name it with

--pleasure, the prompt and liberal attention which our government now pays

to the requests of the Association. It is true that we have never applied to

it except for matters of paramount importance and unquestionable useful-

ness ; but in times past it would have been no easy matter to force a con-

viction of this  on the guardians of the                      Treasury                                            and we  may   therefore feel

assured, not only that they personally take an interest in what we bring be-

fore themi but also that the whole nation aympathisses with us ; for some of

these concessions are of no ordinary magnitude. The completion of the

--Ordnance survey of Scotland the enlarging the scale of part, perhaps all,

of that of England-- and the adding lines of level to that of Ireland after it

--was apparently completed are very formidable items in a budget. At our

demands, the observatories from which such splendid additions have been

made to our knowledge of magnetism and meteorology have been establislied

--far and wide throughout our dominions : a precious gift, not only for itself,

but for what it has produced. The example was followed, on their usual

princely scale, at four stations by the East India Company (always, be it said,

munificent patrons of science), and still more extensively by Russia-^with

what success must be fresh in the memory of those who were present at the

WeMagnetic Congress.   obtained the antarctic expedition of Ross, so fertile

in its geographic fruit--so invaluable for the wide extension which it gave to

Wethe domain of terrestrial magnetism.                             procured the expenditure of large

sums for the reduQtipn of the Greenwich lunar observations, and for publish-

voice has been raised in opposition to these grants. It seems as if our

the intellect ; and it loses all its glory unless it act in furtherance of the great
end of man's life. That end is, as both reason and revelation unite in telling
us, to acquire the feelings and habits that will lead us to love and seek what
is good in all its forms, and guide us by following its traces to the first Great
Cause of all, where only we find it pure and unclouded. If science be culti-
vated in congruity with this, it is the most precious possession we can have
the most divine endowment. But if it be perverted to minister to any wicked

--or icrnoble purpose if it even be permitted to take too absolute a hold of the

mind, or overshadow that which should be paramount over all, the perception

--of ri^ht, the sense of Duty if it does not increase in us the consciousness
--of an Almighty and All-beneficent presence, it lowers instead of raising us

in the great scale of existence. This, however, it can never do but by our
fault. All its tendencies are heavenward ; every new fact which it reveals
is a ray from the origin of light, which leads us to its source. If any think
otherwise, their knowledge is imperfect, or their understanding warped, or
darkened by their passions. The book of nature is, like that of revelation,
written by God, and therefore cannot contradict it ; both we are unable to read
through all their extent, and therefore should neither wonder nor be alarmed
if at times we miss the pages which reconcile any seeming inconsistence. In
both, too, we may fail to interpret rightly that which is recorded ; but be as-
sured, if we search them in quest of truth alone, each will bear witness to the

--other, and physical knowledge, instead of being hostile to religion, will be

found its most powerful ally, its most useful servant. Many, I know, think
otherwise ; and because attempts have occasionally been made to draw from
astronomy, from geology, from the modes of the growth and formation of
animals and plants, arguments against the divine origin of the sacred Scrip-

ture, or even to substitute for the creative will of an intelligent first cause the

blind and casual evolution of some agency of a material system, they would

reject their study as fraught with danger. In this I must express my deep

conviction that they do injury to that very cause which they think they are

serving.

   Time will not let me touch further on the cavils and errors in question
and besides they have been often fully answered. I will only say, that I am

here surrounded by many, matchless in the sciences which are supposed so
dangerous, and not less conspicuous for truth and piety. If they find no
discord between faith and knowledge, why should you or any suppose it to

exist ? On the contrary, they cannot be well separated. We must know
that God is, before we can confess Him ; we must know that He is wise and

--powerful before we can trust in Him, that He is good- before we can love

 Him. All these attributes, the study of His works had made known before

He gave that more perfect knowledge of himself with which we are blessed.

Among the Semitic tribes his names betoken exalted nature and resistless

power ; among the Hellenic races ihey denote his wisdom ; but that which

we inherit from our northern ancestors denotes his goodness. All these the

more perfect researches of modern science bring out in ever.increasing splen-

dour ; and I cannot conceive anything that more effectually brings home to
the mind the absolute omnipresence of the Deity than high physical know-
ledge. I fear I have too long trespassed on your patience, yet let me point

out to you a few examples. What can fill us with an overwhelming sense of

His infinite wisdom like the telescope ? As you sound with it the fathomless

abyss of stars, till all measure of distances seems to fail and imagination alone

gauges  the  distance                            yet  even  there as  here  is the same divine harmony of
                                              ;

forces, the same perfect conservation of systems, which the being able to trace

in the pages of Newton or Laplace makes us feel as if we were more than

men. If it is such a triumph of intellect to trace this law of the universe,

how transcendent must that Greatest over all be, in which it and many like

it, have their existence ! That instrument tells us that the globe which we

inhabit is but a speck, the existence of which cannot be perceived beyond our

system. Can we then hope that in this immensity of worlds we shall not be

overlooked? The microscope will answer. If the telescope lead to one verge

of infinity, t^ brings us to ihe other ; and shows us that down in the very twi-

light of visibility the living points which it discloses are fashioned with the

--most finished perfection, that the most marvellous contrivances minister to
--their preservation and their enjoyment, that as nothing is too vast for the

Creator's control, so nothing is too minute or trifling for His care. At every

turn the philosopher meets facts which show that man's Creator is also his

--Father, things which seem to contain a special provision for his use and his

happiness : but I will take only two, from their special relation to this very

district. Is it possible to consider the properties which distinguish iron from

other metals without a conviction that those qualities were given to it that it

might be useful to man, whatever other purposes might be answered by them ?

That it should be ductile and plastic while influenced by heat, capable of being

welded, and yet by a slight chemical change capable of adamantine hardness,

--and that the metal which alone possesses properties so precious should be
--the most abundant of all, must seem, as it is, a miracle of bounty. And

not less marvellous is the prescient kindness which stored up in your coal-

fields the exuberant vegetation of the ancient world, under circumstances

which preserved this precious magazine of wealth and power, not merely till

civilization and energy might be wasted or abused. But I must conclude
with this summary of all which I. would wish to impress on your minds
that the more we know His works the nearer we are to Him. Such know-
ledge pleases Him; it is bright and holy, it is our purest happiness here, and

guide us in its pursuit ; and in particular, may this meeting which I have

attempted to open in His name, be successful and prosperous, so that in

future years they who follow me in this high office may refer to it as one to
be remembered with unmixed satisfaction.

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

A Catalogue of Observations of Luminous Meteors; continued from

   the Reports of the British Association for 1848. By the Rev.
   Baden Powell, M,A., F.R.S. ^c, Savilian Professor of Geo-

    metry, Oxford.

In endeavouring to carry on the design of collecting in one record the obser-
vations of Luminous Meteors made in all parts of the world, commenced last
year under the auspices of the British Association, I have received valuable
aid from the communications with which I have been favoured by various cor-

respondents ; among whom I cannot omit to acknoM'ledge my most particular

obligations to Dr. Buist of Bombay, and, for by far the most extensive series
of observations (both of his own, and collected from several friends), to
E. J. Lowe, Esq. I have also occasionally derived other important materials
from several journals. The following Catalogue, besides observations of a

date subsequent to the conclusion of my former list, fills up some of its de-

fects by observations contemporaneous with it, and others belonging to former
years. I have also been enabled to prefix some notice of still earlier phaeno-
mena of this class.

    In ordinary cases the original statement has been entered in the Catalogue
with only slight verbal abridgements : but where there is a description of any
physical appearance I have alw'ays retained the words of the author ; and in
cases where there seemed to be any peculiarity, the original document at
length is given in the Appendix. The time is usually no more than the com-

mon clock time, unless otherwise stated : but in all Mr. Lowe's observations
it is Greenwich Mean Time.

  A continuation of communications is earnestly requested, addressed to the

author at Oxford.

AI. valuable collection of records of Luminous Meteors and Star-showers

   from ancient chronicles, extending from a.d. 338 to 1223, is given by M.
   Chasles in the Comptes Rendus, March 15, 1841.

On a comparison of the results, M. Chasles remarks the absence of anj'

periodical showers in August or November. But in the earlier years there

appears such a periodicity in February, and afterwards in March and April.

He conjectures that the meteoric matter may form a ring, the plane of which

changes continually ; and thus the same matter may in later years have caused

the occurrence of the November meteors.

                        1833. Note from W. W. S-MYTH, Esq.

1. On the evening in question, the appearance of a brilliantly luminous

meteor was accompanied by a loud report like that of a cannon, followed by

a sound like the fire of musketry. M. Reichenbach obtained information

from various quarters as to the angle under which the meteor was seen, and
then searched diligently with sixty or seventy men for what they supposed

must have fallen, till on the 1 1 th day they discovered a meteorite, and after-

wards two smaller stones. Their external colour was black, the internal gray ;
the structure granular and full of metallic specks : they also attracted the

magnetic needle.

  A2. meteorite which fell near Stannern in May 1808, was analysed by

Von Holger, and was found to contain, though in very small quantity, tin

and cerium, which had not before been discovered in similar bodies. The

result of five analyses was as follows :

       No. 2. Meteorite of Braunau. Note from W. W. Smyth, Esq.

   M. Beinert of Charlottenbrunn, read before the Breslau Society an ac-

count of the fall of meteorites at Braunau in Bohemia, and exhibited plans
of the locality and a portion of the iron. Schles. Arbeit. 1847.

   On the 14th of July, at a quarter to four a.m., the inhabitants of Braunau

were roused by two violent explosions like heavy artillery, and as closely
consecutive as the reports of a doubled-barreled gun, after which a rushing
and hissing sound was audible for some minutes. The sky was very clear
but above the village of Hauptmannsdorf there was formed a small strip of
black cloud, which suddenly seemed to grow red-hot and to dart out flashes
of lightning in all directions, whilst at the same moment two fiery streaks
seemed to fall to the earth. The cloud now assumed an ash-gray colour
and rosette form, and after some time divided towards the N.E. and S.W.,
forming thin streaks which gradually disappeared.

    It was soon found that the " lightning" had struck the ground near Haupt-
mannsdorf, about 1200 paces N.E. of Braunau, and there in a hole three feet
in depth was a mass of iron which at ten a.m. was too hot to be touched with
impunity. One Joseph Tepper, living in the village, had seen it fall, and
gave his evidence on the subject before the authorities of Braunau. This

piece of meteoric iron, weighing 42 lbs. 3 oz. Austrian, was sent to the Imperial
Cabinet at Vienna. Its form is an irregular parallelepiped, and the exterior
surface is covered with concavities, the deeper parts of which exhibit a smooth

yellowish brown coating.
   It was soon afterwards found that the "lightning" had penetrated the do-

minial house called the Ziegelschlag, situated at a short distance from the
town. Mr. Pollack, the chief forester, describes that he found a hole as large
as the head in the roof, and a mass of broken lath and plaster in the bed-room
of three children, who, when terrified by the crash, were unable to escape.
The piece of iron which was found here under the ruins, weighed 30 lbs. 8 oz.,
and diflPered from the other only in form, inasmuch as it has some resemblance
to a colossal oyster-shell. In breaking through the plaster, the melted sur-
face carried off some unconsumed straw, which gives it at a distance a gold-
like appearance. The chief forester Pollack calculated the height of the
cloud from which the two fragments diverged at 29,351 Vienna feet=29,562
Prussian feet* ; the distance asunder of the two places where they fell being

6507 Vienna feet.

"I have just met with a curious fact, viz. the presence o{ phosphorus in

certain meteoric irons.
    " Berzelius found in the meteoric iron of Bohumilitz certain steel-gray lami-

nettes and grains, which he proved to be composed of iron, nickel and phos-

phorus. Lately, my friend Patera at A'^ienna has analysed a similar mineral

in the meteoric iron of Arva. It was observed in small leaflets, which are

flexible, and have a strong eflTect on the needle ; the hardness=6*5, the spec.

        -- " Bombay, July 22, 1849.

" Dear Sir, I now enclose some notices of those meteors of lesser magni-

tude and greater frequency noticed at Aden, by Mr. Moyes in 1843, and by

my assistants wliile in charge of the observatory here, in 1843 and 1844.
   " I am at present in communication with observers at thirty different stations

scattered over India, from latitude 10° to 33°, and am making arrangements to

get returns from every spot where an European is stationed in the service of

government. By these means, I shall, 1 hope, have it in my power to furnish

you with a long and minute catalogue of meteors every year. Careful simul-

taneous observations along chains of stations will soon come to give us the

relation of diiferent meteors to the stars and constellations they seem to ap-

proach or traverse, and furnish us with the elements of computing their size

and distance. The newspapers I have already sent will have given you all

the information I possess in reference to the larger meteors; in the " Times"
now forwarded, is a description of one seen at Kurrachee on the 25th of June

(our sky at this season is covered with clouds), which, like that of the 19th

of March, was heard to explode.
   " The leading characteristics which distinguish our larger and lesser aero-

--lites are the following : the larger generally appear as luminous as a star of

the first, the lesser scarcely so much as a star of the third magnitude.

   " The light of the larger meteors is generally orange, bluish or greenish,
hardly ever white. It resembles that of a star of a Roman candle, as if given

out by a considerable mass of matter : it never exhibits rays like a fixed star

or the light from electricity ; it is never at all dazzling. The meteor always
seems to increase in velocity and bulk as it proceeds in its path, the result

probably of perspective ; and when approaching the termination of its course,
it commonly flames out witii unusual brilliancy ; there are about as many

which disappear at once, as if extinguished, as those which burst and fall in

fragments. The fragments always cease to be visible at some 5° to \b° from
the ground. The only meteors that have been heard to explode this season

were those of the 19th of March, heard at Aurungabad, and 25th of June,

heard at Kurrachee.

" From the 1st of June to the 1st of September our sky is thick and cloudy.
" If meteors fall over the twenty-four hours indiscriminately, the number

entering our atmosphere must be immense. They are not visible till after

sunset, and by eight or nine o'clock we are all indoors, by ten we are in bed

Wetwo hours thus is all the time allowed for observation.  expect to derive

the greatest advantages from the services of European sentries on duty, as
we are now striving, with every hope of success, to engage the army in our

service.

   " Our November meteors cross the sky in all directions : they very much
resemble fire-flies, only they are much more swift and rectilineal in their

movements. They do not alter either in apparent speed or size as they pro-

ceed ; they never flame out or appear to burst ; they very rarely approach the
horizon, and having traversed ten or twenty degrees of space, become lost in

darkness.            " I ever am,
                             " Most faithfully yours,

   " On the 7th of September, about half-past six p.m., a large fire-ball was

seen at Poona to shoot from nearly north to south : it then made a sudden

sweep, and proceeded nearly at right angles to its previous path. After being

visible for five or six seconds, it split into a number of large fragments, which
                                                                     ----:

rapidly descended towards the earth ; and tliese again broke up into lesser
fragments, till they appeared to descend in a shower of sparks. Before the
first bursting, the meteor was of exceeding brightness, of an intense blue co-

--lour, and at the instant of explosion it changed into red : it seemed to light

up the whole heavens, though the moon was shining, so as to render the lesser

stars visible."

   From the Bombay Times, November 1, 1847.
   " On Sunday evening (Oct. 30), about seven o'clock, a magnificent
fire-ball was seen to shoot across the air from nearly west to east, when its

horizontal motion suddenly ceased and it seemed to drop perpendicularly
into the sea betwixt Mazagon and Sewree. At the time of its explosion

--for such we may take that of its change of direction to have been its

illuminating power was equivalent to that of an ordinary- sized blue light
it dazzled the eyes of those near it and who looked at it directly ; and though
the evening was at the time perfectly dark, the most minute objects in the
landscape were for ten or fifteen minutes made visible by it. It appeared to
become extinguished some three or four hundred feet before touching the

water. It left a long train of light behind it, which was visible for the space

of nearly half a minute."

--No. 5. From the Bombay Monthly Times, June 18, 1848.

" At a meeting of the Bombay Geographical Society, the following letter

was received from Captain George Wingate, of the Bombay Engineers :

. " ' I beg to transmit two fragments of an aerolite, which fell about one o'clock

P.M. of the 15th of February last, 1848, in a field to the south of Negloor, a

village situated within a few miles of the junction of the Wurda and Toom-

boodra rivers, and belonging to the Gootul division of the Ranee-Bednoor

talook of the Dharwar coUectorate.

A" ' The fall of this aerolite is most satisfactorily established.  cultivator

of Negloor, named Ninga, was driving his cattle out to graze close by where

it fell, at the hour above mentioned, when he suddenly heard a loud whirring

rushing noise in the air, but on looking up could see nothing. An instant

afterwards, however, he observed a cloud of dust rise from a spot in an ad-

joining field, as if something had struck the ground there with violence. At

this time several other villagers were standing by a threshing-floor close at

hand, who also heard the noise, and one of them called out to Ninga asking

whether he had also done so. He replied. Yes, and that something seemed

to have fallen in the next field, where he saw the dust rise, pointing at the

same time to the spot. The whole party then immediately proceeded there,

and found to their astonishment the aerolite broken into fragments, of which

those now forwarded were alone of any considerable size. The stone, from

--the velocity of its descent, had made a hole of several inches in depth, like

the print of the foot of a young elephant, as the villagers described it. They

were naturally much puzzled to account for the appearance of the stone, which

altogether differed from any to be met with in their neighbourhood ; but at

length were constrained to conclude it had fallen from the sky. The cir-

cumstance seemed so extraoi-dinary that one of them was immediately sent to

summon the Patel of the village to the spot, who soon arrived, attended by a

crowd of people who had also heard the wonderful tidings. These too una-

nimously adopted the same conclusion regarding the fall of the stone, and the

Patel took into his charge the accompanying fragments, and wrote a report

of the whole circumstances to the Mahalkurree of Gootul, who is revenue and

police officer of the district in which Negloor is situated.

                                                                                 ;

--36 REPORT 1849.

" ' The Mahalkurree thought the Patel's report so extraordinary that he de-

termined at once to proceed to Negloor himself, to inquire as to its truth,

which he did ; and after having examined the stone itself, as well as the

hole in the ground made by its fall, and found all the accounts of the villagers
who were present to agree, he could not avoid coming to the same conclusion
that they did, regarding its fall from the sky. To place the matter beyond

doubt, however, he took statements in writing of the circumstances from the

cultivator Ninga and another, who had heard the rushing noise made by the

stone in its passage through the air, and forwarded their depositions, with

his own report and the fragments of the aerolite, to Mr. Goldfinch, the assist-
ant collector and magistrate in charge of the district, who has kindly placed
them at my disposal.

   " ' Had the evidence in proof of the fall of this stone been less conclusive

than it is, we might still have inferred the fact of its being an aerolite from its

peculiar appearance, so different from that of any rock in the neighbourhood

of the spot where it was found. For miles around the village of Negloor, the

only rocks to be found are primary clay-slate of various degrees of induration,

and occasional dykes, masses and boulders of greenstone, but not a trace of

any volcanic product, or other ftone bearing the remotest resemblance to the

one under consideration. The latter, moreover, tallies exactly with the de-

scriptions given of aerolites. It is coated with the fused crust or film charac-

teristic of these bodies, and is evidently highly metallic. On the theory of

aerolites being planetary bodies which become fused on their surfaces, and

burst by the sudden evolution of heat occasioned by their rushing at immense

velocities into our atmosphere, the specimen now forwarded may be supposed

to have formed part of a globe, or rather a mass approaching the spherical

shape, of somewhat more than a foot in diameter, which burst into fragments

under these circumstances; and the difference in appearance of the position

of the fused film over the rounded part of the specimen, which may be con-

sidered to be a portion of the surface of the original globe, and of that coating

the remaining parts, which according to this view were the rough broken

surfaces of the detached fragment, would seem to favour this explanation.

" ' These remarks, however, are merely thrown out in the way of conjecture,

as I do not pretend to any knowledge that would entitle me to theorize on

Mythe subject at all.  object in writing at so much length has been to show

that the specimen now sent is a part of a true aerolite, and as such, I hope it

will be thought worthy of a place in the new Museum.'

" The mass of stone which accompanied this was somewhat ovoidal : it

weighed four pounds, measuring fifteen inches round the larger, and eleven

round the sliorter axis. It was covered over with a black-looking vitrified

crust about one-twentieth of an inch in thickness. This refused to yield to

the action of muriatic, nitric, or sulphuric acids. One end of it was marked

with impressions such as a slightly softened body might receive on being

thrown violently against the earth. The specific gravity of the crust was a
little over three, or somewhat heavier than marble; it had not been quite

accurately determined, from the difficulty of separating the crust from the

interior. The interior of the aerolite was exactly like softish white sandstone

it crushed between the fingers, and absorbed, when immersed an hour in

water, one-hundredth of its weight. Its specific gravity was 3'5, or a third

heavier than the heaviest sandstone, that of quartz being 2*6. It slightly

effervesced with muriatic acid, giving off much sulphuretted hydrogen gas,

and then slowly dissolved into a glutinous mass. It seemed full of metallic

particles, which shone beautifully under a moderate magnifying power, with
              " ----

a dull light. The following note by Dr. Giraud gives particulars of the re-

sults of the first examination of its characters :

   " ' The stone is acted on by cold hydrochloric acid, with disengagement

of sulphuretted hydrogen. Boiling, but not cold, nitric acid acts on it vio-

HSlently, disengaging             and NO4. The great part of the stone is silica: the

metallic granules consist of iron in equal proportions, with nickel and chrome

in fact meteoric iron. The nickel of course is much obscured by the iron :

the chromine was readily detected, for on fusing the stone with nitre, dissol-

ving the fluid mass in distilled water, and then testing with acetate of lead,

a fine yellow chromate of lead was obtained. On fusing the stone with nitre,

chromate of potash was of course produced. I cannot detect any cobalt,

vhich you know Stenmeyer found in the mixture of iron at the Cape of Good

Hope.'

John Herschel ; I accidentally omitted to forward the account of it to you

with my former catalogue. I may remark that it was noticed at Bath, but

am afraid by no one capable of accurately describing it ; perhaps the insertion
in the British Association Catalogue may be a means of obtaining further in-

My --" ' dear Sir, The parents of a young person residing in our family

(of the name of Atkins) were aroused on the night of March 8th, by a noise,

which induced Mr. A. to get up. At four a.m. he was struck with a great

light; it emanated from a meteor larger than the moon which shot across

above Windsor Castle as seen from Slough (two miles), i. e. looking nearly

southwards. I can get no correct notice of the altitude above the horizon,

which is a pity, as it seems to have been a first-rate one, and its course being

horizontal and from west to east, must have been seen on the French coast,

and probably by seafaring people (who watch nightly) in the Channel. I en-

close a note of explanation from Mrs, A. to her daughter ; perhaps you may
have some corresponding observations, in which case it will be worthwhile to

question further about the apparent altitude as seen from Slough.

the shape of a kite, more brilliant and larger than the moon, passed across
from west to east ; it moved gently ; indeed your father had time to wake me,
and I to get up to the window before it disappeared ; the colo\ir was a strong
blaze of fire ; it shot from the clouds and disappeared in the same. It travelled

from the west of the Castle to the extremity of Datchet.
The stars were shining at the time. The noise that awoke

Mr. Atkins, had not, in his opinion, anything to do with

the appearance. It was of this shape.'"

It began its path somewhat below and to the southward of the ^ , and fell in

esplanade, seemed to issue from a thin streak of cloud overhanging the dock-

yard. It thence rushed in a north-easterly direction, as if over the custom-

house and towards the town-hall. The light it emitted was of a brilliant

green : when it exploded it seemed resolved into a mass of red embers. The

meteor was seen from Poona, Tannab, and probably over a very large expanse

in the interior, and must have been, when it exploded, very much higher in

the air than it appeared."

   In the same journal of March 28, further particulars are given, of which

the following are extracts :
    " Subjoined is a series of notices of the luminous meteor seen on the

evening of the 19th, which now appears to have been a much more magni-
ficent variety of aerolite than was at first supposed. It appears to have been
at a great elevation, and, as suggested by a Poonah correspondent, was pro-
bably some hundreds of miles from the nearest spectator when first seen.
The volume of tire mass, the length of its course, and the velocity with which
it rushed along, may from this be imagined. As formerly observed, when
first seen at Bombay it appeared as if nearly over the dockyard : in this all
the observers who noticed it in different parts of the island concur. Curi-
ously enough, we have not been favoured with a single notice of it from any
one on board the ships in the harbour: from the anchorage we have no doubt

--it would also appear to the eastward. At Poonah lat. 18° 30' N., long. 72°
--2' E. it was observed at a quarter past six at the altitude of about 30° : it

was visible from Poorundhur, twenty-six miles east of Poona. It was ob-
served at Aurungabad, lat. 19° 45' N., long. 75° 30' E., as if to the south;
and from Sholapore, lat. 17° 40' N., long. 76° E., where its appearance was
most distinctly observed, and has been most carefully described, as seen in a
north-easterly direction. It was seen at Jaulnah, particulars not given. It
was also carefully observed at Surat, 21° 11' N., 73° 7'E. It has thus been

--described as visible over an area of above 3° of longitude and 2° of latitude
   from Bombay 18° 53' N., and 72° 49' E., to Sholapore and Aurungabad;
though in ail likelihood it may have been observed over a much more exten-
sive area than this, from which as yet no observations have reached us. From
the explosions heard at Aurungabad, it is possible that in this neighbourhood

it burst.

    " Another meteor, of lesser size, though still of considerable brilliancy, M'as
seen here on the 23 rd."

     -- " To the Editor of the Bombay Times.

   " Sir, The meteor alluded to in your last was seen at this place on Mon-

day, at six P.M., in the E.N.E. quarter, at an altitude of about 30°; descending
obliquely towards the E., it disappeared behind a building. I had only a

glimpse of it myself, my back being towards it at first, but the person with
me described it as being about half the size of the moon, and much brighter.

It was seen also at Poorundhur. Instead, therefore, of being a few hundred
yards distant from your Bombay informant, it must have been certainly more
than 100 miles : how much more we cannot say, not having its exact bearings,
but probably another fifty at least. Should it have been seen at Seroor or
Nuggur, something further may b^ known of it, as it must have been pretty
near those places. If I can collect anything further about it I will let you

know W. S. J."

   " Poona, 23rd March, 1849."

   " On Monday (19th), about half-past six in the evening, a very remarkable

and beautiful meteor was observed at this station. Its course was north-
easterly ; bursting out in the zenith in a most brilliant manner. It appeared
to me to have two succeeding periods of intense brilliancy, with intermediate
diminutions of light ones; occurring on its passage behind a fleecy cloud
near the horizon, it illuminated it like a sheet of summer lightning would,
the colour then assuming a vivid green hue. I have never seen any so
beautiful and striking that I remember as this. Observer."

--" Sir, One of your correspondents I see has sent you an account of a

fire-ball which he saw on Monday (19th) evening last at about half-past six
o'clock. The same meteor was visible here at Surat ; and so much did its

extreme brilliancy and very rapid motion give the appearance of nearness to

it, that we thought it must have fallen close to the tow n. Of course to speak
by the card, we ought to say that at about half-past six we saw a meteor

which, iS'c. &c., but you will see from what follows, that it is not a very rash

inference to conclude it to be the same. If you can get from some of your

friends an estimate of its apparent altitude, and the direction of its motion as

seen at Bombay, the data sent with this will perhaps help you to a rough

approximation to its real height, volume, and path. It passed then from

west to east across our meridian to the south of us ; was about 30° high

when first seen, and perhaps 10° when it vanished (25° perhaps when on the

meridian), and must have had an apparent diameter of 4' or 5' (say for the

sake of comparison with other estimates, about one-eighth of the diameter of

the moon). It was intensely incandescent, the surface appearing as if liquid

with heat (having so large a diameter, one seemed to be able to look well

into the surface); in colour white, with perhaps a slight tinge of green.

-- --(Query the optical effect of contrast with an evening sky?) H."
 --" p.S. A friend accustomed to estimate angular magnitudes, and who saw

the meteor, confirms the account I here give you, but adds that he 'saw the

train distinctly visible about ,5° higher than Canopus.' This, from the posi-

tion of Canopus at the time, would give the meridian altitude about 21°

instead of 25°."

--the evening of the 19th, was also seen at Jaulna at the same hour. G. F."

" Camp, Jaulna, March 24."

--" Sir, The meteor noticed by your correspondent in your last issue was

also observed by several persons at this station on the same evening, and

about the same hour (Monday the 19th, half-past six o'clock). It seemed

to arise a little to the south of, and above Venus, and to travel in a northerly

direction ; I should say N.N.W. About a minute and a half after it disap-
peared, two reports, following each other rapidly, were heard, like the ex-

plosion of a mine at a considerable distance. Asterca."

" Aurungabad, 24th March, 1849."

   I have been also favoured with a sight of a private letter from an astro-

nomical friend to the Editor of the Bombay Times, of which I am permitted

to give the following extract :

                                       " Poona, 2nd April, 1849.

" Can you make anything out of the diff"erent reports of the meteor

of the 19th ult., so as to have even a guess at its whereabouts? I cannot

by any means torture them into an agreement, and have come to the conclu-

sion that there must have been two at intervals of perhaps fifteen or twenty
minutes, and that Ihey have been confounded together; e.g. how could the

same object have passed the south meridian at Surat, at an altitude of 21°

from W. to E., and also have burst out in the zenith of Sholapoor and moved

N.E.? The latter could have been seen only to the east of tlie meridian at

Surat. Also if the interval between the appearance and report at Aurungabad

is worth anything, the distance from that place could not have been much

more than twenty miles, and this does not seem to tally well with either of

the other two. I had no watch about me to note the exact time here, but it

was only a few minutes after sunset, certainly not so late as a quarter-past

six, while at Surat the difference of longitude must have made it a trifle

earlier : so that the times do not agree very well either."

  A" correspondent mentions that about half-past six on the evening of the

26th of March, a meteor of considerable magnitude was seen from Cochin,
travelling in a north-westerly direction. At first it seemed somewhat larger
than the planet Venus, as now visible: it consisted of a nucleus of bright

emerald green, with a long tail of an uniform red colour. It burst into frag-

ments as it approached the earth. Our informant was not aware of any
report having been heard accompanying the explosion."

--No. 11.--Bombay Bi-monthly Times, April 30, 1849.
A"The meteor of the 13th April (Friday).  writer in the 'Poona Chronicle'

gives us a notice of the meteor seen at Hingolee and Bombay on the 13th April,

and completes the chain of evidence, establishing the fact that it was the same

body which was visible at all the three points. None of the observers speak

of its explosion, so we are left to infer that it continued to travel eastward

beyond the reach of vision. It seems to have proceeded from west south-

--easterly the Poona observer having obviously first seen it after it had passed

--him, so as to make it appear in the east : proceeding further easterly, Hingo-

lee is in lat. 77° E., or nearly Bombay 72° 49'. At the former place it was

seen at nine very nearly, at the latter at from twelve to fifteen minutes after

--nine. If it travelled at the rate of thirty miles a second the supposed
--velocity of the meteor of the 19th of March it would occupy ten seconds

from Bombay to Hingolee, assuming the distance to be 300 miles : this is an

amount of time that need not for the present be taken account of; and it

may be assumed to have been seen at the two points simultaneously. The

difference of time due to longitude, taking this at four degrees, would be

sixteen minutes ; and this corresponds very closely with the observed dif-

--ference. The Poona writer, who says he saw it three minutes before nine, is

obviously wrong it must have been twelve or thirteen minutes after, he

means."

Ibid. From a correspondent :

   " Last night as a friend and I were seated in a " Chubooturah," in

front of my house, enjoying a refreshing zephyr that had just sprung up

after a day of intense heat, and as I was contemplating the blue and spangled

vault over our heads, my attention was attracted to a beautiful meteor, to
which I immediately drew my friend's attention. The time, just as the even-

ing gun had sullenly boomed at nine p.m., and its echo had scarce finished
reverberating among the adjacent hills, when this body burst into view a little

to the west and south, just as if the concussion had broken a portion from

off one of the spheres above, and what we saw was the falling debris. From

where we were seated, the apparent nucleus, whence it started, seemed not to

be more than twenty-eight or thirty degrees in height from the to us then

visible horizon. It left behind it a train of most beautiful light, and which

--appeared to us by no means inconsiderable in breadth colour tliat of a most

beautiful 'blue light.' The coruscation lasted for several seconds, when I

--lost sight of it behind my office bungalow. J. J. H."

disappeared at an altitude of about 6°, at which time its azimuth must have
been N. 10° or 11° E. Its whole visible tract did not exceed 7° or 8°, and
it was brightest just before disappearing, but did not then exceed a star of
2nd magnitude. Its colour was dusky red; duration perhaps I5 second.

    Ibid. " Subjoined is an interesting notice of the meteor mentioned in our

last. May not the circumstance alluded to by our correspondent account

for the showers of dust and ashes occasionally observed at such vast distances

from volcanos as to have proved subjects of much perplexity to those trying
to explain them on the assumption of this being due to eruptions? The
appearance of red snow, showers of blood, and the like, would be at once
produced were iron reduced to peroxide by combustion to commingle with
snow or rain during their fall.

   "'On Thursday* evening, at Malabar Point, half an hour after sunset, I

observed a splendid meteor about S.S.W., falling slowly on a plane inclined
at an angle of 80° to the horizon (the acute angle being to the right). Its

angular velocity about 2° per second. Mean time of obs^ervation 6'52\ p.m.

It passed about 2° to the left of a star of the first magnitude (viz. Canopus,

its true altitude being 6° 53', and true bearing S. 27° 28' W.). When first

noticed it was a few degrees above the star, shining with a steady planetary

light like Jupiter. When it had fallen to about the same altitude as the star,

it blazed out with an intensely dazzling white light, brighter than Venus
then quickly fided into a shower of what appeared dull reddish yellow sparks,
and ended its course in a vertical direction, disappearing when about 2°
above the horizon. If this was an extra-terrestrial body, the direction of its
motion in space showed as if it had overtaken the earth or its orbit. If the
blazing out occurred when entering the atmosphere, its distance from Bombay
must have been considerable (probably 150 miles), and its size corresponding
(perhaps thirty yards in diameter). It would be interesting if simultaneous
observations could determine the height of this blazing appearance that
almost all meteors have at some part of their course. I forget if Humboldt
has anything conclusive on the subject. One remark, not to be found in the
· Cosmos' but nevertheless true, is, that if a 32 lb. iron shot played the part
of an aerolite and entered the atmosphere with the velocity of ten miles per
second (a moderate velocity for such bodies), the heat generated by the
resistance of the atmosphere would be suflScient to raise the temperature of
the shot one million of degrees. Such an immense and sudden evolution of
heat would probably not only melt the iron, but oxidize it with an exhibition
of intense combustion, and the splendid meteor would finish its course by
gently descending to the ground in the shape of an insignificant red powder.
Has this been the fate of the young planet of the 19th March?'

   " The meteor was seen at Khandalla a few minutes before seven o'clock,
travelling from N.W. to S.E., and is described as having been of exceeding

brilliancv.

in a direction from N.E. to S.W. The size of the body appeared nearly that

of the full moon. It remained visible about two seconds, moving very rapidly,

then nearly disappeared for a moment, and after being visible about two

seconds more, suddenly vanished. It left behind it a marked trail of light,
which was very distinctly visible for a short time after the disappearance of

the mass. It seemed to have rather a waving motion, but this appearance
was probably owing to the thickness of the fog, which rendered the light
much less brilliant than it would otherwise have been ; as it was, the houses

and other objects were rendered much more distinctly visible than they

would have been by the light of the full moon. The exact situation from
which I had a view of this interesting object was about twenty yards farther
from Birmingham than the Plough and Harrow public house at Edgbaston ;
and the time was, as nearly as I can tell, about ten minutes past seven."

--" Rev. Sir, I furnish you with a written account of what I suppose to

be a meteoric appearance, which I saw some years ago at Palamcottah, in

South India. I am unable to lay my hand at present upon a brief memo-

randum which I believe I made at the time, and therefore cannot furnish the

date more accurately than to say it was in the year 1838.
   " At about half-past seven o'clocii in the evening, two young men living in a

house thirty or forty yards from mine, were taking their tea together, with
their doors and windows all open, as is usual in India, when their attention was
suddenly attracted to a bright light shining outside, which at first they took
to be moonlight; but remembering that there was no moon at that time,
they went outside to see what it could be. They beheld on looking up a
brilliant object in the heavens, shining more brightly than the moon, and

instantly came and called me to see it. By the time I had reached the out-
side of my house, its brilliance had considerably faded, but even then it was

a glorious object. Its position was directly north, its elevation about forty-

five degrees, perhaps a little higher ; its form I well remember, because of its

resemblance to a letter in the Tamul alphabet, and its whole surface, though

different in shape, little less than that of the moon. Its shape and relative

size to the moon may be represented thus. Whatap-

Hpear to me to be its great peculiarities were these : / -_

it was perfectly stationary, never moving for a mo- ( ) ||

^^ment from the place where it was first seen : and it

remained visible twenty minutes from the time I first saw it, becoming more

and more dull and indistinct, till it melted away and was seen no more. I

should add that it was a starlight night, without a single cloud.

(1.) Periodicity of meteors.

The following epochs are known as periods when falling stars are abun-

dant.

   April 22-25, .July 17-26, August 9-11, November 12-14, November 27-
29, December 6-12. To this number I add October 16-18.

   I have found the month of January frequently to have a brilliant display
of meteors, but the day is not stationary. In 1844 they were abundant on
the 26th; 1843, on the 31st ; 1847, on the 11th and 13th; and 1848, on the

4th.

The August epoch rarely ever fails to bring a very abundant display of

meteors. In 1841 Mr. Hind counted at Greenwich seventy -two meteors, be-

tween lO** and IS*'; the greatest number in one hour was from 12'' to 13'',

viz. 24. In 1842, Mr. Hind saw 100 between the ll'' and IS''. The greatest

number in one hour, from IS"* to 14^ viz. 20. This year (1849), about

eighty were counted here in an hour, from 10'' to 11''. The meteors for a few

evenings previous to the 10th, when the sky was in a condition for falling stars

to be seen, gave an increase in number each evening. The 10th was only

clear for an hour, viz. from 10'' to II''.

   (2.) Meteors crossing the sun as dark spots.

  mIn 1839, Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 385, Prof. Erman stated that the

cold days of the 1 1th to the 13th of May and the 5th to the 7th of February,

were owing to the passage of falling stars between us and the sun.

In 1845, the German astronomer Peters had taken observations on solar

spots, which he requested the Astronomer Royal Capocci to have continued.

One of the assistants (M, de Gasparis) being thus occupied on the 11th of
May 1845, observed a black body cross the sun ; he called Capocci's attention

to the fact, and he, together with Dr, Ddtoartini and an assistant astronomer

(Del Re), witnessed great numbers cross his disc. Being on a visit with my

worthy friend Mr. Lawson at Bath (this year), we determined to watch

carefully for these black globules, and accordingly set the 11-foot equatoreal

to the focus of the sun ; a 5-foot to that of Venus; a 3-foot to that of the
moon; and a beautiful defining glass of thirty inches, to 400 miles, thinking

by this arrangement to be enabled to detect these bodies, whatever distance

they might be from us ; unfortunately, from February 5th to 7th, the sun

never shone at Bath ; however, we received a communication from Mr.

Weeks of Sandwich, saying his friend the Rev. Mr. Brown of Deal had seen

Wetwo deliberately cross the sun's disc .in a descending arc.  looked out

again on the 11th, 12th and 13th of May, but without success. Conversing

with my friend Mr. Hind, he informed me that Messier* remarked, that in

1777 one day he had seen 200 small dark bodies cross the solar disc; to say
the least of the phaenomenon, it is worthy of a few years' attention before we

decide this interesting point, especially as the November meteors frequently

fail to give us a rich display.

   (3.) On a point of divergence of meteors.
   The meteors seen in 1839 diverged from a point situated between Taurus

and Pegasus ; since then the point is stated to be near /3 Camelopardalis.
Both last year (1848) and this (1849), from a great number of observations,

the point of divergence was in or slightly above Cassiopeia on the 9th to the

18th of August, yet, strange to say, until then this point was not observed:

there was another situated in Cygnus, which had been plainly discernible since

the middle of July. From that time until the 9th of August, if the paths of

   * Messier gave a memoir on the subject, entitled, " Observation singulier d'une prodigieuse
quantite de petites globules qui ont passe au devant du disque du soleil." [Mem. Acad. Paris,

1777, p. 464.]
                                  --;

A CATALOGUE OP OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS. 47

the meteors were produced backwards they would nearly all meet at a point
situated to the east oi Alpha Cygni, and on the 10th were near the star Alpha.

   The number of stars seen this year on August 10th was about eighty, the
sky being clear for an hour, from shortly before 10 o'clock to near 11 o'clock.
Fifty-five of these had their paths and other features recorded here ; out of
this number the following are those noticed proceeding from the direction of

these two points of divergence :

                                                 13

   The two following letters to Prof. Powell will further illustrate this point.

  My --" dear Sir, The opinion that falling stars diverge from a given point

at two periods of the year, viz. August the 10th and November the 11th, is

generally believed, but I have seen no hint that they do so at other times

that they nearly all do I feel perfectly persuaded. From numerous observa-

tions on the 20th and 21st of this month, I find they diverge from about the

centre of the constellation Cygnus ; last night (July 23rd), which was particu-
larly rich in falling stars, gave a position slightly different, viz. l, Cygni for

the mean point from which thej'' diverged ; if this point was more attended to,

in all probability we should soon have sufficient data to enable us to give at

all events a rough element. From a few observations during June, this point
would seem to be in Draco, in beginning of May in Bootis, and in April in
Canes Venatici. The meteors were few in number in April, May and June,

but are now each night becoming much more numerous.

" The tail, as it is called, of meteors is apparently of two kinds, the one a

continuous streak of light, and the other individual sparks ; this does not

seem to be owing to the speed with which they move, tor I have frequently

seen each appearance, whether the meteor was moving rapidly or slowly.

                                                 " Believe me yours very truly,

" Highfield House Observatory, near Nottingham,  " Edward Joseph Lowe."

                       July 24, 1849."
                                                                                                           "July 28, 1849.

My" dear Sir,-- Out of the nine observations on the 26th of July, six gave

a point of divergence slightly below p Cygni. Some of the observations last

night gave a position rather lower in the Swan. It is pretty evident there is

a point of divergence, and that this point is now situated in the Swan, for

each night produces more examples of meteors coming from that direction.

                                  " Believe me yours very truly,
                                                 " Edward Joseph Lowe."

   In 184'2, Prof. Phillips noticed many meteors came from the direction of
Cassiopeia, and in ISiS the Rev. C. Marriott at Bradfield again noticed this

feature in one instance.

   It seems quite evident that the greater portion of these bodies move in

lines parallel to each other; for as proof that the point of divergence is merely
owing to perspective, the greater number of stars to the S. and S.E. of us

move towards S. and SS.W-i whilst those to W. and N.W. move towards W.

and W.S.W. This was very evident on the lOtli of August this year, for a
great number which occurred in Pegasus all moved to S. and SS.W., whereas

extinguished in Draco and 8 in Pegasus, 6 in Antinous, 4 in Pisces, 3 in
Cygnus, Aquarius, Lyra and Bootes, 2 in Sagitta, Cassiopeia, Ursa Major
and Perseus, and 1 in Andromeda, Delphinus, Ursa Minor, Coma, Berenices,
Serpens, Capricornus, Hercules, Camelopardalis and Triangulum.

   It is pretty evident that the meteors were nearer us on the 10th of August
very considerably than on the 16th, as on the latter day, although a few tole-
rably sized ones were seen, yet the great majority were meteors very brilliant
for their size, which was smaller than the smallest stars that could be discerned

by the unassisted eye.
   (5.) It is a curious fact, that when a falling star is seen to follow another in

the same track, it invariably moves at an equal speed with the one which had
gone before, i. e. if the first moved rapidly the second would do so also, and if
slowly the second would move slowly. The second star I have never as yet
seen larger than the first ; and generally there has been a considerable differ-
ence in apparent size, from the circumstance of the follower of a falling star
in the same track partaking of the speed of that which has gone before, and
that generally the respective bulks are very different; it might be supposed
that the smaller one was an attendant or satellite of the larger one ; if this be
the case, the meteor that fell at 10^ 17"* was accompanied by two satellites;
this strengthens the opinion very much of their being material bodies.

   On the other hand, if we consider them as shining by reflected light, it is

difficult to account for the luminous streak which is often left in the sky-
after the head of a meteor has itself vanished, and also why a meteor having
a continuous ray of light, if it cross an auroral arch or beam, instantly
brightens, a circumstance exceedingly curious and at the same time very
apparent : the phaenomenon has been noticed here four times, viz. December
3, 1845, September 10, 1846, June 21, 1847, February 20, 1818.

   As there are several difficulties attending this phaenomenon if we account
for them all with one theory or consider them all to be similar in formation,

I have ventured to suggest three classes :

               1st. Those with luminous streaks.
               2nd. Those with separate stars, and those without any appendage.

               3rd. Those large bodies with well-defined discs.

    The 1st class may shine by inherent light or be surrounded by a luminous
atmosphei'e ; the 2nd class by reflected light, as described by Sir John
Lubbock ; and the 3rd class may be purely atmospherical; as this kind nearly
always move in paths discordant to the direction of the other meteors, they
are not always spherical, and sometimes change their form : I have seen them
alter their colour from blue to red, and in one instance saw a meteor of a blue
colour give out orange-red sparks. Mr. Hind tells me he saw a green meteor

turn to a crimson colour.

    I have made numerous inquiries, but could never find any one, excepting
Mr. Hind, who had seen meteors move slowly across the field of a large tele-
scope ; he describes them as appearing better defined than stars, which they

 resemble, but the time of visibility was too short to allow of a planetary disc
 to be discovered ; the fragments or streamers appeared like phosphoric

 lights.

   (3.) Observations on luminous meteors, August 10, 1849.
   a No. 1. Between 9^ 30"^ p.m. and 9'' 33TM p.m., a rather large luminous

meteor shot from the Via Lactea, nearly midway between Cygnus and Cas-

siopeia; it was nearer Cassiopeia than Cygnus; its path was apparently

straight, across Lacerta, and the point of disappearance between Cygnus and
Pegasus considerably below the former and much nearer the latter. It

scarcely passed, if at all, the line joining a Cygni and /3 Pegasi. It left a

train of reddish scintillations, which were more conspicuous about the middle

of its course, dying away at each extremity.

Aa No. 2.  small meteor, between one and two degrees cast of Polaris,

passing downwards.

  Aa No. 3. luminous meteor passing between a and j8 Pegasi, and cutting

the line joining them very obliquely; its direction appeared to be parallel to

the meridian towards the south ; it was small and of short duration, but rather

larger than No. 2.

  Aa No. 4. small luminous meteor, near the head of Capricornus, passing

south and west.

a No. 5.

a No. 6. At about a minute or two before 10'' p.m., a rather large lumi-

nous meteor shot from above and to the north of Cassiopeia and disappeared

just to the north of Cygnus, the points of appearance and disappearance

being within the boundaries of each constellation; its apparent path, which

was straight, appears to have crossed the head of Cepheus. It was attended

by a train of reddish scintillations, more conspicuous in the middle, and

dying away at each extremity. This meteor was extremely similar to a No. 1

in every respect, save one, viz. direction. The directions of these meteors

did not appear to be parallel, but such as to give the idea of divergence ; the

line of direction of a No. 1 produced backwards, intersecting that of a No. 6

about the point of its commencement.

The above meteors were the only ones seen between 9^* 30TM p.m. and lO**.

They were all of a blue colour.

   b No. 1 (?). At a very few minutes after lO'' p.m., a very large and bright
meteor shot from beneath the tail of Ursa Major (the constellation at the

time being covered with a cloud), most probably in the neighbourhood of

Cor. Caroli ; it crossed about the middle of Bootes, s Bootes (?), and vanished
to the south of Corona Borealis. I much regret I did not obtain a full view

of this fine meteor, which was by far the largest hitherto seen, and I should

conceive exhibited the longest path, being engaged at the moment in con-
templating Cassiopeia. The light attracted my attention, and on turning I

just caught a sufficient glimpse of the meteor to assure me of its magnitude

and direction. I had a full view of the train of reddish scintillations which

it left behind ; this train perfectly agreed with the two I had previously

witnessed ; its direction appeared to be very nearly if not quite parallel to the

horizon ; it indicated that the path of the meteor was straight.

  Ab No. 2 (?). small but bright meteor passed directly over Polaris, bisect-

ing the star; its course appeared to be in the meridian towards the horizon.

N.B. I am not quite certain which of these meteors occurred earliest, but

I strongly suspect that b No. 1 was first.

b No. 3.

Ab No. 4.  very splendid globular meteor, abo\it the size of Jupiter at

opposition, of a whitish colour, very slightly tinged with red, passed with a

comparatively slow motion immediately over y Pegasi (the star was bisected).

Its path, which was slightly curved, was nearly parallel to the horizon, and

the meteor increased in brilliancy as it proceeded until its disappearance,

                                                                          e2
--52 REPORT 1849.

the point of which could not have been far removed from the line joining a
and /3 Pegasi, and produced : y Pegasi was about midway of its apparent
path. The path suggested the idea of that of a projectile, the meteor sensi-
bly bending to the earth just before the disappearance : there was no train, and
the meteor was exceedingly unlike any of the preceding.

    h No. 5. Within a very short interval, I should say less than a minute,
another meteor, of precisely the same size and exhibiting precisely the same
characters in every respect, not one excepted, appeared just beyond the point
of disappearance of b No. 4. Its path appeared to be a prolongation of that
of b No. 4, and it disappeared in exactly the same manner, slightly bending
to the earth, or rather horizon, not far from /3 Aquarii.

    Assuming for the moment, which is not altogether improbable, that the
two were only one meteor, which by some means had been extinguished for
a short time during its progress, its visible path in the heavens at London
would at least be from 15° north Dec. 0° Rt. Asc. to 6° south Dec. 320° Rt.
Asc. retrograde, and it crossed the equinoctial about 332° Rt. Asc.

    b Nos. 1 to 5 occurred by estimation between lO*" p.m. and lO** 15TM p.m.,
certainly not later than 10*^ 20" p.m. The appearance of b Nos. 4 and 5
most probably occurred at 10*^ 15"' p.m.

                                  Remarhs on the above Meteors.

   Of the above meteors five claim particular attention, viz. a Nos. 1 and 6

and b Nos. 1 (?), 4 and 5, a Nos. 1 and 6 occurring previous to lO*" p.m.,
and b Nos. 1 (?), 4 and 5 after 10'' p.m. Each of these meteors are very
readily identifiable. After a No. 1 had appeared, a considerable time elapsed
before a No. 2 was seen in the neighbourhood of Polaris, and the directions
of these meteors were very different and nearly opposite. Nearly half an
hour elapsed before a No. 6 became visible, its direction and that of a No. 1,
as before remarked, indicating a point of divergence just north of Cassiopeia.
With the exception of the meteors in the neighbourhood of Polaris and that
between a and /3 Pegasi, those seen in the eastern hemisphere, viz. a Nos. 1,
4 and 6, and b Nos. 4 and 5, were directed more or less towards the meridian,
b No. 1 (?) was the only meteor seen westward of the meridian ; and it is
worthy of remark, that while the direction of its motion was towards the
meiidian, it was in the opposite direction to those in the eastern hemisphere,
and this appears to indicate a point of convergence in the south, as well as a
point of divergence in the north. These phaenomena may greatly assist in
determining the position in space of these bodies. It is clear that at the
time of observation, the earth was moving towards a given point in the
heavens. The general direction of the meteors in the eastern hemisphere
was retrograde, while that in Bootes was direct. Assuming for a moment
that between 9^ SO"" and lO** 30"" the earth passed very near a small cluster
of meteoric bodies, which was moving in a contrary direction, the majority
being south of the earth's path, and one only north, the phaenomena would
be just as witnessed. All the southern meteors would have a retrograde
motion, while that of the northern would still coincide in the general direc-
tion of motion ; but instead of its being retrograde it would be direct, just as
a traveller on a railway sees the objects apparently rushing past him on each
side, their apparent motions being identically the same yet when these

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

jnotions are referred to the circle of which he is the centre, it is evident those
on his left-hand must have an opposite expression to those on his right.

    Upon a comparison of the paths of a Nos. 1 and 6 and b No. 1, which
appear, with the exception probably of the globular meteors b Nos. 4 and 5,
to have been nearest the earth, wc may be better able to judge of their
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

relative positions, especiallj' with respect to the earth. Taking Lacerta as
the middle point of the path of a No. 1, the head of Cepheus as that of
a No. 6 and a Bootes as that of b No. 1, it is very evident that the earth, or at
least its centre, must liave passed considerably to the south of the plane
passing through the centres of « No. 6 and b No. 1, and as b No. 1 appeared
but a few minutes after a No. 6, the distance between them would be con-
siderably less than that between a No. 1 and either of the others. If, as has
been suggested, the direction of the earth's motion was such as to leave the
meteor b No. 1 on the north and a No. 6 on the south, both would be suf-
ficiently identifiable at any part of the earth's surface from which they might

--be visible : 1st, from the priority of the southern meteor ; and 2nd, from the

apparent opposition of their motions ; and should observations have been

made from which the altitudes of each above the earth's surface may be
deduced, it would not be very difficult to determine approximately and

within certain limits their distance from each other, due allowance being
made for the earth's motion between the instants of apparition. In connexion
with the view here taken of the relative positions of these three bodies, the
StraightTiess of their paths strongly indicates the passage of the earth past

them. Upon M. Quetelet's determination of the mean altitude of these
bodies being sixteen or twenty leagues, it would appear that when the nearest
point of the earth's surface approaches a meteoric body at or witiiin this
distance, the phaenomena witnessed would be produced : the body would

pass through a segment of the earth's atmosphere, the path most probably
differing but little from a straight line ; upon entering the earth's atmosphere

combustion may take place, as suggested by Prof. Powell, and this may give

rise^ to the reddish scintillations so apparent in the three bodies observed
these scintillations presented phaenomena perfectly in accordance with this
notion, being most intense in the middle or deepest part of the earth's atmo-
sphere, and gradually dying off at each extremity.

    The meteors b Nos. 4- and 5 appeared to be essentially different from the
three we have just noticed; the well-defined globular appearance they

presented, the comparative slowness of their motion, the slight curvature of
their paths, and their decided increase of brilliancy just previous to their
extinction, place them altogether in a different category, and would lead one
to expect that at more southern stations they appeared both larger and more
brilliant. It would be interesting to obtain observations of these meteors
(which certainly were unmistakeable in their character) from places at which

they were vertical. At present however we must be content with knowing

that of the group of meteors observed they were probably the most southern,
 the plane of their motion being less inclined to the ecliptic than to the

 equinoctial.

Notice of Nebula lately observed in the Six-feet Reflector. By the
   Earl of Rosse, Pres. R.S. Communicated by the Rev. Dr.

   Robinson, Pres. B.A., and ordered to be printed entire among the

Reports.

At the Meeting of the British Association at York in 1844, it was an-

nounced that a reflecting telescope of six-feet aperture, which had been

about two years in progress, was nearly completed, and some slight account

was at the same time given of the means which had been taken to render the

Awstrument convenient and effective.  short notice of the principal results
--54 REPORT 1849.

which have since been obtained may perhaps not be uninteresting to the pre-

sent meeting.

   About the beginning of February 1S4'5, the instrument was so far finished as

to be usable ; and in the first instance it was directed to some of the brighter

nebulae in Herschel's Catalogue. Many of them were immediately resolved,

and very frequently the aspect and form of well-known nebulae were com-

pletely changed, fainter details not previously seen being brought out by the
great light and magnifying power of the telescope. Before the end of April
the wonderful spiral arrangement in 51 Messier was discovered. The specu-

lum, though there was a slight defect of figure, was in fine working order, and
defined with great sharpness when the air was steady.

   At the approach of the short nights, when the season for observing the ne-

bulae was nearly over, the instrument was dismounted, as it was desirable to
take the earliest opportunity of completing certain portions of the mechanism
which had been put together in a temporary way in a rough state, and it was

not till the close of the year that it was again in working order.

During the year 1846 the examination of the nebulae in Herschel's Cata-

logue w-as continued ; many sketches were made, and another spiral nebula
was discovered, 99 Messier. The moon was observed occasionally, and the

superiority of the instrument with six-feet aperture over that of three under
equal magnifying powers, in bringing out minute details, was very remark-

able ; so great is the effect of light even when we have to deal with an object
so bright as the moon with an aperture of three feet.

   As yet, however, but little time has been devoted to an examination of the
moon : the moonlight nights have usually been taken advantage of for expe-

riments on the polishing and figuring of the mirrors ; and the information
which has been obtained relates principally to matters of detail, from which

it would be premature to attempt to deduce general conclusions suitable to

the present notice.
   In the succeeding year, 184-7, there was but little done; unprovided at

that time with an assistant capable of making trustworthy use of the pencil

and micrometer, and being almost wholly occupied with the duties incidental
to a year of famine, it was impossible to do more than re-examine a few of the

objects of the previous year.

From the beginning however of the year 1848 till the present time, the

instrument has been constantly employed whenever the season and weather

--permitted it, and the following are some of the results : H. 604 was found

in some degree to resemble the great spiral nebula 51 Messier, but it is a
much fainter object, and appears to be made up of elliptic streaks disposed

rather irregularly with a tendency to spirality, but without that distinct sym-

metrical spiral arrangement which is so marked a feature of 51 Messier. If

51 Messier were seen somewhat obliquely, and were considerably fainter, it

would probably very closely resemble it.

H. 854, M. 65, has an arrangement of very elliptic annuli, and is apparently

a system of the same class seen very obliquely.
   M. 97, H. 838, is a very extraordinary object; with a dark hollow centre

somewhat in the shape of a figure of eight, easily seen, and with a disc irre-

gularly shaded, but showing in the shading a decided tendency to spirality

when seen under favourable circumstances : two stars are placed in a re-

Womarkable manner in the central opening.  may conceive it to be a spiral

Hsystem greatly compressed; the edges are filamentous: 2205 has a faint

but large spiral appendage, to which the ray as figured by Herschel is in some

measure a tangent. Several other nebulae are recorded in our note-books as
belonging to the class of spirals. The well-known planetary nebula in Aqua-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           :

rius, H. 2098, which in former years had been often examined with a tele-
scope of three-feet aperture, and with no other result than that it exhibited
a filamentous edge, when seen with the great instrument was found to have

two ansae like Saturn. Many have since seen it, and the resemblance to

Saturn out of focus has usually suggested itself. It is probably a globular
system surrounded by a ring seen edgeways ; while H. 450, which turns out
to have a bright centre surrounded by a comparatively dark ring, and that

again by a bright ring, though a much fainter object, is not improbably a
system of the same character seen directlj\

    H. 84 and 86 is a remarkable group of nebulae ; it consists of eight,
two of them pretty bright. Such groups are not uncommon, but in this
instance there are I believe more nebulae in a given space than in any other
group we have noticed ; it was observed by Mr. Stoney. The nebulae were not
connected by any perceptible nebulosity, but there are cases where a nebulous
connection was distinctly traced ; several minute nebulge or nebulous knots
hanging together as it were by a very faint but unmistakeable nebulosity.
The nebulae of Andromeda and Orion have of course been observed. As to
Andromeda, there seems to be little doubt that the companion is resolvable,
and the nucleus of the great nebula has that granular appearance which in-
dicates resolvability : it has however not been seen as yet under very favour-
able circumstances, and we have not commenced a sketch of it. The nucleus
was examined on three occasions, and the abrupt edge of the following streak
in Mr. Bond's drawing was traced to its visible limits ; but unfortunately we
did not receive the drawing till the nebula was out of reach, otherwise of
course more attention would have been directed to it. Subsequent to the re-

ceipt of the drawing, the nebula was seen by Mr. Stoney in my absence with

the instrument of three-feet aperture, but at a distance from the meridian

the appearance was very much as in Mr. Bond's drawing, except that the con-
trast between the preceding portion bounded by the edge of the following
streak, and the following portion of the nebula was much greater.

   The question however of most interest is, what do these streaks indicate ?
With the great instrument, dark streaks have been observed in many of the
nebulae, sometimes almost straight, as in Andromeda; for instance, H. 887,
H. 1909, H. 1041, H. 1149, are cases in point, the streaks being nearly
straight. H. 1357, to which Mr. Bond refers, is, if possible, a still stronger
case than it appears to be by Herschel's drawing, as I find a sketch in our
journal showing that the appendage is part of the nebula, the nebulosity ex-
tending and encasing both extremities of the opening just as in Andromeda,

We have also found a variety of examples of curved streaks ; for instance,

H. 264, H. 491, H. 406, H. 731, H. 854, H. 875, H. 1225, and others.
    Also H. 1486, H. 464, H. 2241, besides the well-known annular nebula,

and the little annular nebula sketched by Herschel, are some of the examples
of nebulae with comparatively dark centres ; the darkness being apparently of
the same quality as the dark streaks, but of a different shape.

    W^ith these facts therefore I think it not improbable that the dark lines

noticed by Mr. Bond in the nebula of Andromeda, and which with sufficient
power are perceptible in so many other nebulas, sometimes nearly straight,

sometimes variously curved, as also the dark spaces, are all indications of

systematic arrangement. When we see a dark space in the centre of a pla-
netary nebula, it is impossible to resist the impression that we are looking at

an annular system bound together by some mysterious dynamical law. If
we see a bright centre, as in H. 450, surrounded by a dark annulus, and that
again by a bright annulus, we have a system of another kind ; and in the
spirals, of which 51 Messier is the most remarkable example we yet have found,
                                                                                 ;

--56 REPORT 1849.

we have a regularity of arrangement equally accordant with our preconceived

notions of the order which should subsist in a regular independent system.

The very elongated elliptic annular nebulae, where the minor axis is some-

times almost evanescent, show us pretty clearly the nature of the slight, long,

dark and nearly straight streak in some cases found parallel to the axis of a

Along ray.  little consideration of the appearances which annular and spiral

systems must present when viewed in different positions, in some instances

affords a pretty satisfactory explanation of the confused streakincss we have

observed in several of the nebulas.

   This, however unsatisfactory it may appear, is the best explanation our
working journal-books at present afford of the streaks observed by Mr. Bond
in the nebula of Andromeda.

   Mr. Bond's paper has excited so much interest, and I have been so often
questioned relative to it, that I have prematurely, in anticipation of more nu-
merous sketches and measurements, which will probably throw additional

light on the subject, ventured to lay before the Association the very littlej
which is at present known to us.

   It was in the spring of ISiS that we first perceived the brighter portions
of the nebula of Orion in tlie neighbourhood of the trapezium breaking up
into minute stars. Whenever the sixth star was nicely separated, this appear-

ance was clearly perceptible. We had repeatedly examined Orion with the

telescope of three-feet aperture, without a suspicion of its being resolvable

however, its resolvable character once known, we were enabled with it on very
fine nights to see some of the stars. With the six-feet telescope, the space
within the trapezium is still dark, just as Herschel describes it, and I feel con-

vinced there is no optical illusion.

   Last season my attention was directed by Mr. Stoney to i Orionis, which is

on the edge of a dark spot ; the dark spot includes the nearer companion,
and is about 12" diameter ; we have not yet had an opportunity of examining

 it with the great instrument.

   A few copies from our collection of sketches accompany this notice : they

have been made within the last day or two by a drawing-master in the neigh-

bourhood. He has transposed white for black, and enlarged the scale to

make them more suitable for exhibition in the Section.
    In sketching, we employ solely the black-lead pencil, black representing

light, and the eye by habit makes the transposition without effort.

    The copies are not quite accurate, but they are sufficiently exact for the

purpose.

of carbonic acid on the growth of plants allied to those found in the coal

formation."

    This investigation was accordingly entered upon by myself in the spring
of 184^8, by means of an apparatus consisting of two jars of corresponding
size, each containing about 2800 cubic inches of air, the edges of which
 INFLUENCE OF CARBONIC ACID GAS ON HEALTH OF PLANTS. 57

rested upon a smooth slate table, having two circular holes perforated in it,
into each of which a pan or pot containing the plants to be experimented
upon was inserted.

   By the aid of this apparatus I carried on a series of experiments both on

flowering plants and on ferns, from which I inferred that the one as well as
the other would continue for a fortnight at least unaffected by a dose of car-
bonic acid, bearing a proportion to the whole volume of air equal to from
5 to 10 per cent., but that 20 per cent, would prove injurious to the one, as
well as to the other, in the course of two or three days. These results were
however not offered to the Association at Swansea with any confidence, because
the apparatus contrived for the purpose of carrying them on turned out to
be defective, the difficulty of cementing the vessels containing the plants to
the slate table, so as to render the apparatus impervious to air, being such,
that a large supply of gas was each day found requisite, in order to keep up
the percentage to the intended amount. Hence it was probable that during
a portion of the time the real quantity of carbonic acid in the jar might have
fallen very short of that with which it was proposed to operate.

   I therefore renewed the experiments in the spring and summer of the pre-
sent year ISW, in two ways, either of which had been ascertained by previous
trials to preclude in a great degree the danger of leakage, and thus to render
the amount of carbonic acid present whilst the experiment was being carried

on, tolerably constant.

   The first was that of allowing the jars, the edges of which had been well
ground, to rest upon the surface of a solid and smooth slate table, greased
along the line of its contact with the glass ; the other to make them dip into
shallow iron dishes with double rims, containing water to the depth of an inch,
so that the air of the jar might be cut off from the external atmosphere. In
neither of these cases was there a sufficient loss of gas to interfere with the
results ; in the former, the transmission of air between the smooth surfaces
of the slate table and the jar being inconsiderable, and in the latter, the quan-
tity of gas carried off by solution in the water being much reduced, when the
latter was covered with a thin pellicle of oil. Whatever indeed might be the
loss in either case sustained, I took care to supply it, by introducing the
requisite quantity once every twenty-four hours into the jars which contained

the plants.

   I am therefore now able to offer to the Association, with rather greater

confidence than before, the following results, as confirmatory of those which

were stated verbally in my Report, but which, for the reasons already assigned,

were not published in the Transactions of the Association for last year.

  --May 14th. In the first experiment, five healthy ferns, named Nephrodium

molle, Adiantum cuneatum, Gymnogramma chrysophylla, and two species of

 Pteris, viz. longifolia and serrulata, were introduced into jar 1 standing in
water, and a quantity of carbonic acid gas was admitted, which equaled 5

per cent, of the whole amount of air present in the jar. No perceptible change

occurring, the quantity was increased on the 17th to 10 per cent., and this
amount was maintained, as nearly as possible to the same point, by occasional

additions of the gas, till May 27th.
    At the expiration of ten days there was no perceptible difference in the ap-

 pearance of the ferns, either with reference to their preceding condition, or
by comparison with that of five similar ferns, which had been kept for the
same time under the corresponding glass, without any admixture of carbonic

acid gas. The experiment was then continued till June 21st, so that the plants
 were exposed to the influence of carbonic acid gas in all for a period of thirty-
--58 REPORT 1849.

three days, besides being subjected for seven days to about 5 per cent, of the
same. At the end of this time only two of the ferns appeared at all damaged,
namely Pieris longifolia and Nephrodium molle, the fronds of both which were
rather discoloured, those of the other three species remaining as before.

    The same description of experiment was made upon a species of Pelargo-
nium, which after having been during twenty-seven days exposed to the ac-

tion of 10 per cent, of carbonic acid contained in the air of a large jar, ap-
peared in exactly the same condition as a corresponding one placed under
glass in a vessel free from any abnormal mixture of that ingredient.

    From these, and from the experiments of the preceding year, it might be
inferred that plants in general are tolerant of a much larger volume of car-

bonic acid gas than exists in the atmosphere at present; but it did not
therefore follow, that the amount of carbonic acid decomposed, and of
oxygen exhaled, would bear any proportion to the quantity with which their
leaves were brought into contact.

   From several trials indeed which I made as to the per-centage of oxygen

present in the jar at different stages of the experiment, I was led to infer that
the amount of the latter was not increased in the degree which might have
been expected ; but, as a more easy way of determining the same point, I
introduced a certain number of fresh leaves of an Helianthus, in each case
exposing exactly the same amount of surface, into jars filled with water con-
taining different proportions of carbonic acid gas. In No. 1, for instance, the
proportion of gas to water was only as 1 to 12; in No. 2 as 1 to 6 ; and in

No. 3 as 1 to 3. Now it was found, that, instead of the oxygen disengaged

by the leaves keeping pace with the supply of carbonic acid, only 0'7 of a
cubic inch was given off from No. 3, whilst No. 2 had disengaged 4 cubic
inches, and No. 1 3*3 cubic inches; and in another experiment only O'l was
emitted by No. 1 ; 4*5 by No. 2 ; and 2-0 by No. 3, the other circumstances,
as to time, exposure to light, &c., being in all cases the same. If therefore
the disengagement of oxygen from leaves be, as is generally admitted, the
result of their vital action upon the carbonic acid in contact, under the
stimulus of light, it would follow, that where the carbonic acid exceeds a
certain amount, that action is in a great degree suspended.

    There is however an experiment of Count Rumibrd's, originally reported

in the Philosophical Transactions for 1786, and alluded to by one of my co-

adjutors in these investigations, I mean Mr. Hunt, in his late work entitled
' The Poetry of Science,' which would seem to imply that the decomposition of
carbonic acid by plants was not a vital phsenomenon, and consequently could
not be influenced by any such circumstance as the application of a super-
abundant portion of this gas to the surfaces of their leaves.

   Count Rumford states, that the property of causing water to emit oxygen in
the sun, is possessed, not only by living plants, but likewise by threads of silk,
by wool, and even by spun glass ; in which case the decomposition of carbonic
acid would seem to be simply the effect of light, the plant merely serving, by
the surfaces it exposes to the water, to disengage from it, more rapidly than
would otherwise happen, that oxygen which had been obtained without its

direct agency.

   On repeating this experiment, however, I found, as might have been anti-

cipated, that at first no such effect took place when wool, cotton, silk, or spun

--glass were introduced into the water, but that after some days it occurred

abundantly in every one of these cases the disengagement of the gas
however being always coincident with the appearance in the liquid of green
confervae, to the action of which doubtless this decomposition of carbonic

acid was to be attributed.
INFLUENCE OF CABBONIC ACID GAS ON HEALTH OP PLANTS. 59

    Accordingly the process went on, whether fibrous substances were placed
in the water or not, although in the latter case somewhat less rapidly, the

presence of such bodies serving to disentangle the particles of" gas from their
adhesion to the water more easily than would happen otherwise-

   There cannot therefore be a doubt, that the common opinion, which regards

the emission of oxygen from the surfaces of leaves, whether placed in water

or in air, as a vital phaenomenon, is the correct one, and hence it is quite con-
sistent with analogy, that, as we have already seen, some one proportion of
carbonic acid in the air should be more favourable to the exercise of this
function, than any other one more considerable in amount would prove.

   I was therefore encouraged to proceed in my inquiry as to the quantity of

carbonic acid contained in air, which was decidedly prejudicial to the health

of ferns.

With that view specimens of the same five species as before were selected

for experiment, and these were placed under the jar which contained about

2800 cubic inches of air cut off from the external atmosphere by water. To

this air 1 per cent, of carbonic acid was at first added, and a daily increase
to the same amount in the quantity present was kept up, until the propor-

tion reached 20 per cent. This same quantity was then maintained in the

jar for twenty days, by successive additions to compensate for the ascertained
amount of leakage, now found to be inconsiderable, and the appearance of

the plants was from time to time examined and noted.

    It was not till the 13th day that any sensible alteration for the worse was
perceptible, when we observed, that in Pteris longifolia the fronds had be-

come very brown ; in Nephrodium 7nolle and in Gymnogramma chrysophylla

two or three of the lower fronds showed signs of yellowness ; that those of
the Adiantum looked in general very sickly, but that Pteris serrulata did
not appear injured. The experiment was however continued seventeen days
longer, when it was found, for the first time, that the amount of carbonic acid
present in the jar, as ascertained in the usual way by potass, exceeded what

had  been  added                         proving  more decisively than  before,  that decay had com-
                                      ;

menced. The plants were accordingly taken out, and the following notes

--respecting their condition were entered in the Minute-Book.
   Pteris longifolia. All the old fronds are now dead, but the vitality of the
rhizoma is not destroyed, for young fronds are putting out, and appear at pre-

sent to be healthy.

   Pteris serrulata even now appears but slightly damaged, its fronds being
only more yellow than is natural.

   Nephrodium molle seems in the same condition nearly as Pteris longi-

--folia.
    Gymnogramma chrysophylla. Its old fronds slightly damaged and yellow,

--but young ones are putting out.
   Adiantum cuneatum. AH the fronds have died down.
    Thus it appears that this large amount of carbonic acid, even if gradually

 added, would in time prove fatal to plants of the above description, although
operating upon them with various degrees of intensity, and apparently not
 exerting any specific influence upon the stem and roots.

    That the effect however was attributable; not to tiie diminution in the pro-
portion of oxygen consequent upon the addition of so large an amount of
 carbonic acid, but to something positively deleterious in the latter gas itself,
 was inferred, by exposing the plants to air impregnated with 'iO per cent, of
 hydrogen, which in the course of ten aays appeared to exert no sensible in-
 fluence upon their health.

There did not appear to be any very material difference in the action of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

carbonic acid upon plants, whether it were suddenly or gradually introduced ;
for when I exposed the same ferns to air into which 20 per cent, of carbonic
acid had been added all at once, it was not till the 9th day that any change
in their appearance was perceptible, and then only in three of the specimens
Pteris serrvlata and Adiantum cuneatum being scarcely, if at all affected.

   However, on the 16th day the influence of the gas was manifest upon all
except Pteris serrulata; the per-ccntage of carbonic acid was found to exceed
that which had been added from without, and the condition of the ferns ge-
nerally was rather more unhealthy and faded than it had been in the fore-
going experiment, where the gas had been added in successive doses*.

   So much for this part of the investigation, which seems to be in a manner
prefatory to the one which may be regarded as the more immediate object

aimed at by the Association in suggesting these researches, that being, whether
a larger amount of carbonic acid than is present in our atmosphere would
increase the vigour, and stimulate the growth, of the tribes of plants which
are most connected with the fossil remains found in the coal formation.

   With reference to this latter question, I am not so far advanced towards its

determination as might have been desired.
   During the last five weeks Ferns and Lycopodiums have been living in an

atmosphere containing constantly 5 per cent, of carbonic acid, whilst corre-
sponding specimens have been placed under similar circumstances, except that
the abnormal amount of carbonic acid above stated was absent from the air
of the jar. In both instances the Lycopodiums continue up to this time in
perfect health, but it must be confessed that the Adiantum cuneatum &ndjla-
gelliforme which have been subjected to carbonic acid appear less thriving
than the corresponding plants not so treated.

    It must be remarked moreover, that the per-centage of gas within the former
jar has been increased to 5^ per cent., the additional ^ per cent, being attri-
butable to the diseased state of some of the fronds.

    The experiment however shall be continued for a longer period until more

 decisive results have been arrived at.

    But supposing it to be ascertained that ferns will exist in air containing
5 per cent, of carbonic acid, it still remained a question, whether the animals
 that lived at the same period could have resisted the poisonous influence of

 so large a proportion of this gas.

    In the coal formation, properly so called, MoUusca and Fish appear to be
 the animal remains principally detected, and the difference between the struc-
 ture of existing species, and of those which were in being at so remote a
 period as the one alluded to, may be urged, as an objection to the idea of
 extending to the latter any inferences that might be deduced from experiments
 instituted upon the former.

     Nevertheless as in so fundamental a function as that of respiration, a si-
 milar law pervades all the individuals belonging to the same great natural
 group at the present time, as for instance, what is true in this respect con-
 cerning the lowest in the scale of Mammalia, holds good likewise with cer-

 tain modifications with regard to the highest, it may not be illogical to presume,
 that the difference as to time would not create any radical change in the re-
 lations of a particular class of animals to carbonic acid, and in their suscep-

  tibility to its influence.

     * I do not find that ferns suflFer from confinement in large jars ; and at all events, as the
  circumstances were precisely the same in the two cases, with the exception of the presence
  or absence of this excess of carbonic acid, the difference in the appearance of the specimens
  seems clearly referable to the latter cause alone.

                                                                         Il

INFLUENCE OF CARBONIC ACID GAS ON HEALTH OF PLANTS. 61

   With reference to the proportion of carbonic acid which water would abstract
from air containing diffused through it so large an amount as 5 per cent, of
this gas, the principles upon which such a problem may be determined have
been long ago clearly laid down by Dr. Dalton.

As neither carbonic acid, oxygen, or nitrogen are retained in water by vir-

tue of any chemical affinity, but simply in the ratio of their respective elas-

ticities, it follows that the quantity of these gases present in it will be regu-

lated by the amount of each existing at the time in the superincumbent air.

  We know by experiment, that water would retain nearly about its own vo-

lume of carbonic acid ; 0*65 of its volume of oxygen ; and 0*42 of nitrogen
under the pressure of an atmosphere consisting wholly of the gas so retained.

   If therefore we suppose the atmosphere in former times to have consisted
of carbonic acid 5 per cent, and of common air, maintaining its present con-

stitution, 95, that is, of

Nitrogen                                         76

Oxygen                                           19

Carbonic acid                                    5

the quantity of each gas retained by a volume of water under such circum-
stances would be as follows :

Nitrogen                                         '03192
Oxygen                                           -01235
Carbonic acid                                    -05300

                                                 -09727*

   Water therefore under an atmosphere of this constitution would still con-
tain nearly as much oxygen as it does at present, and not more than "05, or

j\j, of its volume of carbonic acid, so that the condition of the gas expelled
from the water would be such, as to consist in 100 parts of

Carbonic acid                                    Si'S
Nitrogen                                         32-9
Oxygen                                           12-6

                                                                                          100-0

   Now I am enabled to prove, that a much larger proportion of carbonic acid

than that supposed may exist in water without affecting the health of fish at
the present time. On one occasion indeed I agitated some river water in a
closed vessel with a mixture of common air and carbonic acid, in the propor-
 tion of 1300 of the former to 100 of the latter, or in an atmosphere containing
 7 or 8 per cent, of carbonic acid, and found that a number of Minnows intro-

 duced into the water so impregnated died within twenty-four hours, although
 29 cubic inches were found by experiment to have taken up only 1 cubic
 inch of carbonic acid, which is in the ratio of 2-5 per cent.

    Nevertheless it was afterwards found by a number of experiments, that
 other fish, such as Perch and Roach, would live in water which contained from
 5 to 10 per cent, of carbonic acid, the larger of which quantities Avould be
 nearly double that which has been shown to be taken up by water under a

-pressure of 5 per cent, of the latter gas. On the other hand, where the

quantity present might be estimated at 13 per cent, as compared to the
volume of water, all the fish experimented upon speedily perished.

    Nor was this merely the case with freshwater species, for I have had an
opportunitj' within the last fortnight of repeating the same experiments at
Ryde on certain sea-fish obtained oflF that coast. The species operated upon
were those called Golden Maid (Labnis), two sorts of Pipe-fish (Syngnathus),
Rock-fish {Gobius )iiger). Bull-fish {Cottus scorpius), and Flounder (^Platessa
flesus). Of these the Pipe-fishes and the Flounder remained alive for many
hours in a tub of salt water containing 5 per cent, of carbonic acid, nor did

they appear to suffer in consequence. When the amount was equal to 10 per

cent., the Golden Maid (Labrus) was almost instantly affected, as were also
the Pipe-fishes above operated upon.

    Although therefore the difficulty of keeping sea-fish long alive in small
quantities of salt-water, after they have been removed from their natural
element, renders it more difficult to arrive at satisfactory results with them
than with freshwater species, I think myself upon the whole warranted in
concluding, that both kinds are equally tolerant of the smaller amount of car-
bonic acid, and alike susceptible of the poisonous influence of the larger.

    Supposing however no error to exist in the calculation I have made above
as to the amount of carbonic acid present in the water to which the minnows
had been subjected, it will follow that whilst 5 per cent, is innoxious to some
fish, 3 per cent, is noxious to others, and that the power of resisting its dele-
terious influence differs in different species. Nevertheless there seems reason
for supposing, that an amount of carbonic acid in the atmosphere considerably
larger than that which exists at present, would not communicate to the waters
of the sea and rivers properties incompatible with the life of many fish.

    Although reptiles are not supposed to have existed generally at so early a
period as that of the carboniferous formation, yet as saurians have been de-
tected in the coal-beds of Greensburg in Pennsylvania, and in those of Saar-
bruck near Treves*, which are regarded as belonging to the same epoch, and
as they made their appearance so abundantly in that which comes next to it in
point of antiquity, it appeared worth while to ascertain what power of resisting
the influence of carbonic acid might be possessed by the tribes now in being
which belong to the same class of animals.

   With reference however to this department of the inquiry, the experiments
hitherto made by myself are far from numerous : I have however found, that
frogs introduced under a bell-glass containing 5 per cent, of carbonic acid
gas, appeared not to suffer, although they were killed when its proportion
amounted to 10 per cent. Similar results were also obtained in experimenting
upon newts ; so that it would seem, as if, in accommodation to those arrange-
ments of nature which were calculated to impart a greater luxuriance to the
vegetation of the period alluded to, and to bring about during its continuance
a larger accumulation of carboniferous matter, the lower tribes of animals,
which at that time alone occupied the earth, were rendered less susceptible of
the injurious influence of carbonic acid, than the higher orders subsequently
created are found to be.

   In conclusion then I may remark, that the general tenor of these experiments,

so far as they have as yet gone, justifies us in inferring, that there is nothing
in the organization of those plants and those animals of the present day, which
appear most nearly allied to such as were in existence during the carbonife-

                                  * See Lyell's Travels in America, 2nd Series.

rous epoch, or even somewhat subsequently to that period, militating against
the probability, that a larger amount of carbonic acid may have been present
in the atmosphere, and diifused through the waters of the sea and rivers,

than is found, either in the one or in the other, at the present time; nor is

there anything to prevent us from imagining, that the absorption of carbon by

vegetables, and the consequent rapidity of their growth, may, at least within

certain limits, have borne some proportion to the greater amount of carbonic

acid assumed to have been present at earlier periods in the history of our

globe, although whether this be actually the case, is a point which I hope to

mybe able hereafter to settle more to  satisfaction, as well as to report the

results arrived at on some future occasion.

         Report on the Heat of Combination,

By Thomas Andrews, M.D., F.R.S., M.R.I.A.

There are few molecular changes in the condition of matter which are
not accompanied by the evolution or absorption of heat. The quantity of

heat which is thus set free or absorbed, bears always a definite relation to

the amount of the mechanical or chemical action, and its determination in

each particular case is a problem of considerable interest as affording a

measure of the forces in action. If we consider the great number of phseno-

mena, mechanical, electrical and chemical, among which the production of

heat forms the only bond of connexion which has hitherto been clearly

ascertained, although there may be strong grounds for suspecting them to be

only modified forms of the action of the same force, the importance of inves-

tigations of this kind to the future progress of physical science will become

at once apparent.

   The object of the present Report is to give a general view of the actual
state of knowledge on the subject of thermo-chemistry, under which we may

conveniently include a description of the thermal effects that occur in che-

Amical actions of every kind.  few new experiments will be described in

their proper places. These will be given in some detail, but when referring

to experiments already published, all numerical quantities will, as far as pos-

sible, be avoided.

Before entering upon the consideration of chemical combinations and de-

compositions properly so called, it may be useful briefly to refer to the ther^

mal changes which accompany solution. The earlier experiments on this

subject having been made solely with the object of discovering frigorific

mixtures, do not furnish quantitative measures of any scientific value. But

of late years the inquiry has been pursued in a more useful way by Gay-

Lussac, Thomson, Karsten, Chodnew and Graham. The salts examined have

been chiefly the soluble sulphates, nitrates and chlorides, and the solvents

pure water and saline and acid solutions. The principal results of these in-

vestigations I have endeavoured to express in the following propositions :

1. The solution of a crystallized salt in water is always accompanied by

an absorption of heat.

2. If equal weights of the same salt be dissolved in succession in the same

liquid, the heat absorbed will be less on each new addition of salt.

3. The heat absorbed by the solution of a salt in water holding other salts

dissolved, is generally less than that absorbed by its solution in pure water.

i. The heat absorbed by the solution of a salt in the dilute mineral acids,

is generally greater than that absorbed by its solution in water.
--64 REPORT 1849.

   As the subject is of great extent and the inquiry has hitherto embraced
only a small number of cases of solution, it is not unlikely that some of these
conclusions will require hereafter to be modified. From some experiments
by Graham on the solution of salts belonging to certain isomorphous groups,

there is reason to suspect the existence of a connexion between isomorphism
and the absorption of heat in solution.

    The foregoing remarks apply only to the solution of crystallized salts. If,
however, we take a salt Avhich crystallizes with water and make it anhydrous
before solution, the thermal results will be altogether different. The anhy-
drous salt, when added to an excess of water, will first combine with its ordi-
nary equivalent of water of crystallization, and the new compound will then
dissolve. The change of temperature observed is therefore a complex quan-
tity arising from the heat of combination due to the union of the anhydrous
salt with water, and the heat absorbed by the solution of the hydrous salt.
From a comparison of the results obtained on dissolving tiie same salt in the
anhydrous and hydrous states, Graham has endeavoured to deduce the amount
of heat due to the combination of the dry salt with its water of crystallization.
According to his experiments, the sulphates of water, copper and manganese,
disengage the same quantity of heat in combining with the first atom of
water. The sulphates of magnesia and zinc also disengage equal quantities
of heat in their complete hydration. The same simple relation is not however
observed to hold between the quantities of heat evolved in the complete hy-

dration of the first set of salts, or in the combination of the second set with
the first atom of water. Neither does it apply to the other sulphates of the
magnesian serie?.

   None of the experiments hitherto published furnish all the requisite data

for calculating with precision the absolute quantities of heat set free or

absorbed in these cases of chemical action. The weights of the water and of I
the salt are given, and sometimes the weight and form of the vessel, and the
material of which it is composed ; but these data are not sufficient to enable
us to deduce the true numbers from the observed increments or decrements
of temperature. Knowing the weight and composition of the containing
vessel, we may, it is true, calculate its thermal value in water. But other
corrections, such as those for the heating and cooling influence of the sur-
rounding air, can only be ascertained by special experiments performed
under similar conditions to the original observations. Neither have any ex-
periments of sufficient accuracy been made to determine the specific heats of

the solutions formed.

   To complete an investigation which would furnish all these elements, would
be a work of very great labour, and will probably scarcely be undertaken till
our instruments and means of observation are greatly improved. As a first
step to such an inquirj', I may here describe a few preliminary experiments
on the specific heats of some saline solutions, and on the quantities of heat

absorbed in the solution of successive portions of the same salt.
   To obtain results approaching to accuracy in experiments on the specific

heats of saline solutions is extremely diflicult, as the errors of experiment are
often of nearly the same order of magnitude as the whole differences to be
observed. Tlie corrections for the cooling and heating action of the air and
for the effects of radiation, cannot be estimated with any certainty by the ap-

plication of general formulas founded on experiments made at a different
time* ; and the most careful examination of the calibre of the thermometer

a very marked influence on the rate of cooling, when the excess of temperature above the air

tube will fail to render different parts of the scale accurately comparable with
one another to a five-hundredth part. The general method pursued in the
determination of the following specific heats was the same which I described

some years ago*; but to avoid the uncertainties just referred to, alternate
experiments were made with pure water and with the solution, under condi-

tions a3 nearly as possible identical, and these were repeated till accurate

means were obtained. By this mode of operating, a very great degree of

precision may be given to experiments of this kind.
   The only salts whose solutions have yet been examined are the nitrate of

potash, the nitrate of soda and the chloride of sodium. They were all chemi-
cally pure. The density of each solution compared with water at the same

temperature was also determined.
   The first solution of nitrate of potash contained for every 100 parts of

water 25'29 parts of the salt. The thermal values of the thermometer with

large reservoir described in the paper already referred to, in terms of this

solution and of water, were found in alternate experiments to be

Combination of Sulphuric Acid with Water In an elaborate memoir

on thermo-chemistry, which was published in PoggendorfF's 'Annalen,' Hess

made the first systematic attempt to reduce the quantities of heat disengaged

in the formation of the hydrates of sulphuric acid to definite laws. His ex-

periments were made by two distinct methods, which however did not give

exactly the same results. In the first or indirect method of operating, equi-

valent quantities of SO3, SO3 HO, SO3 2HO, &c., were respectively mixed

with a large excess of water and the increments of temperature observed in

each case. The difference between the increments observed on mixing any

two compounds with water, was assumed to correspond to the heat due

to the combination of the first compound with the number of equivalents of

HOwater necessary to convert it into the second. Thus, if SO3     added to
HO HO3H0X

a--b
        gave a units of heat, and SO3        added to the same x  gave b units,
       was supposed to represent the
                                       number of units which would be obtained
HOon combining SO3
                    and 2H0. In the second, or direct method, each
compound was combined with the quantity of water exactly required to con-

vert it into the succeeding compound, and the heat measured by observing

the increment of temperature of a determinate quantity of water surrounding

the vessel in which the combination took place. These experiments have

since been repeated by Graham, Abria, and Fabre and Silbermann, but their

results do not generally agree with the statements of Hess.

_ The fundamental principle laid down by the latter is, that there exists a

simple relation between the numbers which express the quantities of heat set

free in the formation of the successive hydrates of sulphuric acid. If we de-
HOsignate by 2 a the heat disengaged in the combination of SO3
                                                                  with HO,

then, accordmg to Hess, the heat set free in the formation of the other hy-

drates will be

                SO3-I-HO                            8a

   In an early part of his memoir, Hess gives 38*85 for the value of a, but
this he afterwards changes to 46-94, still maintaining however the accuracy
of the ratios. It is difficult to see how this can be correct. The only expe-
riment described by Hess on the combination of the anhydrous acid with
water gave the number 305, which bears to 46-94, not the ratio of 8 : 2, but
nearly that of 6-5 to 2. Abria obtained a still lower number for the combi-

nation SO3 with HO. There can therefore be little doubt, if the experiments
may be relied on, that the first ratio is too high. It remains to be seen how

far the others have been confirmed by subsequent investigations.

                                                                           f2

The multipliers of a for the three latter combinations given in the preceding

table are, according to Graham's experiments, 0*72, 1"35 and 1*18. These

numbers agree with Hess's statement only so far as to indicate that the heat

HO HOevolved in the combination of SO3            is nearly the same as that
               with

evolved in the combination of SO, 2H0 with 4H0.

The experiments of Abria were performed by the direct method and with

a similar apparatus to that employed by Hess. Adopting the views of Hess as

to the quantities of heat in the cases of combination being in simple relations

to one another, he arrives nevertheless at very different numbers for the ratios.

In the next table I have given Abria's theoretical whole numbers, as also the

exact numbers which result from his experiments.

In the three latter cases, the simple relations in the second column are

scarcely borne out by the experimental numbers. The only agreement with

2H0the ratios given by Hess is in the combination SO3    with HO, which,

according to both experimenters, sets free exactly half as much heat as the

combination SO3HO with HO. The value of a, given by Abria, is 39*33.

The latest experiments on this subject are those of Fabre and Silbermann,

from which I have calculated the following multipliers for a :

SO3HO + HO                                        2-OOa
SO3 2H0 + H0                                      0-93a

   Hess has also attempted to express by simple multiple relations the quan-
tities of heat disengaged in the formation of the hydrates of nitric acid, but
for the details of his results I must refer to the original memoir.

  --Combination of Acids and Bases. In the same memoir Hess describes an

extensive set of experiments on the heat evolved during the union of certain
bases with acids of different degrees of concentration. These experiments
serve to illustrate the general principle, that in the formation of a chemical
compound the heat developed is a constant quantity, being the same in
amount, whether tiie combination takes place directly at one time or in-
directly at repeated times. Thus he finds that on neutralizing an aqueous
solution of ammonia with sulphuric acid, containing one, two, three and six
atoms of water, there is a different development of heat in each case ; but by
adding to the results found by experiment in the three latter cases the quan-
tities of heat due to the combination of the monohydrated acid, with one,
two and five atoms of water respectively, the same number is obtained in each
ease as in the direct combination of the monohydrated acid itself. This
principle is correct, but it is almost self-evident and scarcely required so

elaborate a proof.

    The bases examined by Hess were potash, soda, ammonia and lime, which
he combined in different ways with the sulphuric, nitric and hydrochloric
acids. The conclusion at which he arrives is, that the same acid in combining
with equivalents of different bases produces the same quantity of heat, but at
the same time he expresses some doubt as to the applicability of this principle
                  ON THE HEAT OF COMBINATION.                                                    69

to all similar cases of combination. Indeed his own experiments with lime

and ammonia do not accurately agree with it ; I refer particularly to his ex-
periments with ammonia, which, when properly interpreted, appear to me to

prove clearly that that base in combining with acids developes less heat than

potash or soda, although I am aware that Hess himself has drawn from them

a different conclusion.

About the time of the publication of the first part of Hess's memoir, I had

completed an investigation of the same subject, but instead of employing strong

solutions of the acids and bases, I diluted all the liquids largely with water

previous to examining their thermal reactions. In this way I hoped to avoid

the complex effects that arise when successive combinations and decomposi-

tions of different kinds occur in the same chemical action, and the result

myfully realized  anticipations.  The general conclusion deduced from this

investigation may be briefly expressed, by stating that the heat de9eloped during

the union of acids and bases is determined by the base and not by the acid.
The following special laws will be found to comprehend the greater number

of cases of chemical action to which the foregoing principle can be made to

apply.

   1.* An equivalent of the same base, combined with different acids, produces

nearly the same quantity of heat.

   2. An equivalent of the same acid, combined with different bases, produces

different quantities of heat.

   3. When a neutral salt is converted into an acid salt by combining with

one or more equivalents of acid, no disengagement of heat occurs.

   4-. When a double salt is formed by the union of two neutral salts, no dis-

engagement of heat occurs.

  5. When a neutral salt is converted into a basic salt, the combination is

accompanied by the disengagement of heat.

   6. When one and the same base displaces another from any of its neutral

combinations, the heat evolved or absorbed is always the same whatever the

acid element may be.
   As some of the bases (potash, soda, barytes and strontia) form what we

may perhaps designate an isothermal group, such bases will develope the
same, or nearly the same heat in combining with an acid, and no heat will be

developed during their mutual displacements.

These laws are not intended to embrace the thermal changes which occur

during the conversion of an anhydrous acid and base into a crystalline com-

pound. The steps by which such a conversion is effected are generally very

Wecomplicated, and involve successive combinations and decompositions.

cannot  combine, at  ordinary     temperatures, a dry  acid  and  a  dry  base                   and
                                                                                              ;

when combination takes place in presence of water, hydrates of the acid and

base are first formed, which are afterwards decomposed, and the crystalline

salt finally obtained is sometimes anhydrous, sometimes combined with water.

To expect simple results where so many different actions must produce each

its proper thermal effect, would be altogether vain, and to introduce the con-

sideration of some of these actions without the whole would only render the

numbers empirical. In the experiments from which the foregoing laws were

deduced, the acids and bases before combination, and the compounds after

combination, were as nearly as possible in the same physical state. The only

change which occurred was the combination of the acid and base, and the

heat evolved must therefore have arisen from the act of combination. Such

changes of temperature as are produced by solution are not in any way con-

cerned in producing these thermal effects, as none of the reacting bodies

assumed at any time the solid state. The insoluble bases form, it is true, an
--70 REPORT 1849.

unavoidable exception to this statement, and in the experiments with them,
the results would require to be corrected for the heat due to the change of
the base from the solid to the fluid state. As this correction, however, al-
though unknown, must be a constant quantity for the same base, it would
not, if applied, interfere with the direct proof of the first law.

    In an inquiry of this kind, it is important, while endeavouring to generalize
the results of experiment, to point out at the same time the differences which
occur in particular cases between those results and the numbers deduced from
the theory. In the whole range of the science of heat, scarcely a single
general principle has yet been discovered which is strictly in accordance
with all the results of experiment ; and from the application of improved me-
thods of experimenting, discrepancies of this kind have of late years been
found to exist where they had not before been suspected.

    In the original experiments from which the first of the foregoing laws was
deduced, the mean heatdeveloped by the nitric, phosphoric, arsenic, hydrochlo-
ric, hydriodic, boracic, chromic and oxalic acids being 6°"61, the greatest de-
viation from the mean on either side amounted only to 0°*15 ; and a similar
remark may be made with respect to the combinations of soda, barytes and

ammonia. On the other hand, sulphuric acid disengaged about 0°*7 more^thau

the mean quantity, and the citric, tartaric and succinic acids about 0°*5 less.
To ascertain whether these discrepancies depended on the state of dilution of

the solutions, I repeated these experiments lately with solutions of only half the
strength, but although only half the heat was obtained, similar differences
were still found to exist. If, instead of taking just the quantity of sulphuric

acid required to neutralize the base, we employ a large excess, the heat given
out during combination Mill be nearly 0°'2 less, which reduces the anomaly
presented by this acid to about 0°"5. The sulphurous acid not having been
formerly examined, I have lately made some experiments on its thermal re-
lations to the bases, the results of which are very interesting. Although one

of the feeblest acids, it agrees almost exactly with sulphuric acid in the heat
developed by its combination with potash. In several carefully conducted
experiments the increments of temperature did not differ more than 0°*05.

Combining this with the fact that acids differing so much in composition and

properties as the nitric, boracic and oxalic, also disengag^e almost exactly the
same amount of heat in the act of combination, there will, I conceive, be
little hesitation in attributing the deviations already mentioned to the in-
fluence of extraneous causes, and in acknowledging the truth of the principle,
that the heat of couibination depends upon the neutralization or combination
of the base, and not upon the nature of the acid by which the base is neutral-
ized. That other causes of change of temperature, of feeble power, do ac-
tually exist, may be proved by the following fact. If we add an excess of
sulphuric acid to the neutral solution after combination has taken place, a

slight fall of temperature, amounting to about 0°'l, will occur; if we make
the same experiment with sulphurous acid, an increase of temperature of about
equal amount will be observed, while with oxalic acid there will be no

thermal change of any kind. Now it is very probable that the same causes

which produce these slight thermal effects are in operation during the original
combination of the acid and base, and if so, they would introduce anomalies
into the quantities of heat then developed.

   There is one important condition, which, as far as my investigations ex-
tend, requires to be fulfilled in order that the first law may hold good ; viz.

the acid must have the power of neutralizing the alkaline reaction of the
bases. It is for this reason that the hydrocyanic, carbonic and arsenious
acids do not develope the same quantity of heat in combining with potash as
ON THE HEAT OF COMBINATION.  'Jl

the other acids. The sparing solubility of the arsenious acid in water pre-
vents an accurate examination of its thermal reactions ; but on repeated
trials I obtained 0°*25 F., on combining with it the same quantity of potash
which under similar conditions gave 0°"34' with nitric acid. Although a
considerable excess of arsenious acid was taken, as proved by the fact that
further additions produced no new development of heat, the solution still
exhibited an alkaline reaction. The same is also well known to be true of
the hydrocyanic and carbonic acids. In the case of bases, such as the oxide of

copper, whose salts have all an acid reaction, this criterion will not apply
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

but the exceptional acids are so few, and their peculiarities so well-marked,

that they give rise to little difficulty in the experimental investigation.

   The quantities of heat developed by different bases in combining with the
same acid are so different, that it is unnecessary to refer particularly to the
proofs of the second law. In this case, neutralizing power has no apparent
influence on the results, as oxide of silver, which forms salts neutral to test
paper with the strongest acids, is one of the feeblest bases if measured by its
thermal power. It developes, in fact, little more than one-third of the heat
which potash does in combining with the acids.

   The more recent experiments of Graham and of Fabre and Silbermann,
confirm the accuracy of the facts from which the second and third laws were

deduced, that no heat is developed on mixing solutions of neutral salts or of

a neutral salt and acid*. It is difficult however to obtain, as Graham has
remarked, positive proof of the occurrence of combination, when such solu-
tions are brought into contact. Fabre and Silbermann indeed are of opinion

that acid salts cannot exist in the state of solution.

 --Double Decompositions. When solutions of two neutral salts are mixed

and a precipitate formed from their mutual decomposition, there is always a
disengagement of heat, which, though not considerable, is perfectly definite

in amount. It does not altogether arise from the components of the pre-

--cipitate having changed from the fluid to the solid state as it is not always

--the same for the same precipitate but it is chiefly connected with the latent

heat of the precipitate. If the latter contains water of crystallization, the

heat given out is much greater than when an anhydrous precipitate is formed.

Experiments of this kind appears at first view to be extremely simple, but it
is often difficult to obtain exact results, from the length of time during which
the heat continues to be disengaged, even Avhen the combination is aided by

brisk agitation.

   The precipitation of the salts of barytes and lead by a soluble sulphate
appeared to present favourable conditions for investigation, and accordingly
I made an extensive set of experiments with these classes of salts. This is

Aindeed the only part of the inquiry which I have been able to complete.

few other examples of double decomposition will however be noticed.

which is a little more than sufficient to decompose completely the chloride of
barium. The entire weight of the water employed to dissolve the salts was
234 grms., of which one-third was taken to dissolve the sulphate of mag-
nesia, and two-thirds to dissolve the chloride of barium. The solutions were
contained in vessels of thin copper, the smaller of which, when filled with its

   * Slight changes of temperature may however occasionally be detected ; but in some cases
a development, in others, an absorption of heat occurs. These thermal eflfects evidently arise
from causes altogether distinct from those which produce the combination of acids and bases.

   In the last experiment the precipitation was so slow that the thermometer
did not attain the highest point for thirteen minutes after the solutions were
mixed.

   When the salts of lead are precipitated by a neutral oxalate, the heat dis-
engaged is much greater than when they are precipitated by a sulphate. I

have not examined in detail the increments of temperature in this class of
precipitations, but in one experiment, in which the acetate of lead was pre-
cipitated by the oxalate of potash, 36-2 units of heat were obtained for each
gramme of oxalate of lead.

   In the experiments next to be described, a dilute acid was substituted for
one of the neutral solutions.

               ON THE HEAT OF COMBINATION.                                                                              7S

violent action of nitric acid on zinc and copper, and the abundant evolution
of gas which accompanies it. But the facility with which the gases may be
condensed by the acid solution is probably not so generally known, and
when the experiment is made for the first time cannot fail to excite surprise.
If a small vessel of thin German glass, of about the capacity of half a fluid
ounce, be half-filled with nitric acid of density T^, and a slip of zinc be sus-
pended in the upper part so as not to touch the acid, the flask hermetically
sealed, and finally inverted while surrounded with cold water, a very violent
action will occur, but without bursting the vessel. Having ascertained these
facts, there was little difficulty in measuring the heat disengaged during the
solution of the metals in nitric acid. The metal was weighed in a glass tube
open at one end, which was introduced into a thin glass vessel containing
nitric acid of specific gravity 1"4<. The latter was then carefully closed and
introduced into a copper vessel filled with water, and suspended in a metallic

cylinder which was capable of rotation. On inverting the apparatus, the

metal and acid came into contact, and the solution was completed in a few
seconds. The rotation was afterwards continued for five minutes, which was
sufficient to diffuse the heat disengaged through every part of the calorimeter.

We have therefore for the heat disengaged during the solution in nitric

acid of

               1 grm. copper                                                                              650

   I made several attempts to determine the amount of heat disengaged in
the solution of iron in nitric acid, but although acids of different strengths
were employed, I was unable to obtain satisfactory results, as the iron always
assumed the passive state before a sufficient quantity was dissolved to raise
the temperature of the water in tlie calorimeter through 1°. Silver, bismuth

and other metals were also tried, but the solution did not proceed with suffi-

cient energy.

The numbers 5857 and 2578 obtained above, are very nearly in the same

ratio as 5366 and 2394, which, according to ray experiments (and their results

differ little from those of Dulong), express the quantities of heat set free by

the combustion of zinc and copper in oxygen gas. This shows clearly that

the oxidation of the metals is the principal cause of the heat produced during

their solution in nitric acid. Other causes of thermal change however exist,

which must exercise a considerable influence. Such are the combinations

of the oxide with the nitric acid, the separation of the elements of a portion

of the nitric acid during the solution, and the condensation of the oxygen gas

during the combustion. From these and other circumstances, it is not un-

likely that the numbers expressing the quantities of heat disengaged in these

reactions will not be found in all other cases to be so nearly in the same

ratio as in the foregoing examples ; but it may be presumed that the general

results will be the same, and that those metals which produce a greater

amount of heat by their combustion in oxygen will also produce a greater

amount of heat when dissolving in nitric acid.

The heat produced by the solution of copper in nitromuriatic acid is,

according to the result of a single trial, about yth less than that produced by

--its solution in nitric acid.
    Metallic substitutions. I have lately treated this part of the subject at so

great length in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions, that I

--shall here only transcribe the general result of the investigation. It is thus

expressed : " When an equivalent of one and the same metal replaces an-

other in a solution of any of its salts of the same order, the heat developed

is always the same ; but a change in either of the metals produces a different
development of heat." This is evidently an analogous law to that already

stated for the thermal changes which accompany basic substitutions. The

--numerical results are however entirely different in their details.
   Combustions in Oxygen Gas. Since the time when Lavoisier published

his celebrated experiments on the heat produced by combustion, the subject

has frequently engaged" the attention of chemists. But few results were ob-

tained of any scientific value, till the posthumous publication of Dulong's

valuable researches, which have formed the basis of all subsequent inquiries.

More recently, Grassi and Fabre and Silbermann have examined the same sub-

ject, and I have myself lately published a set of experiments upon it, which

were made some years ago. With the exception of some of Grassi's results,

the numbers obtained by the different experimenters agree very nearly with

each other, and we may therefore consider the quantities of heat developed

by the combination of oxygen with the more important simple bodies and

with some of their compounds to be determined with considerable precision.

Fabre and Silbermann have also examined the combustion of carbon in the

Aprotoxide of nitrogen.  tabular view of nearly all the numerical results

hitherto obtained, will be found in the edition of Gmelin's Hand-book of Che-

mistry recently published by the Cavendish Society. I shall here therefore

confine myself to a few general observations.

The following bodies in their ordinary physical states, viz. hydrogen, car-

bonic oxide, cyanogen, iron, tin and antimony, disengage nearly the same
amount of heat in combining with an equal volume of oxygen. The num-

bers which express the heat of combination in these cases do not in fact differ

--from one another more than ^'^th part of the whole quantity, a difference

which is nearly within the limit of the errors of experiment. This observa-

tion applies only to the quantities of heat actually obtained by experiment.
ON THE HEAT OF COMBINATION.  77

But if we apply corrections for the heat due to the changes of physical state
which occur in some of these reactions, the same agreement will no longer
be observed. Thus in the combustion of carbonic oxide, the resulting com-
pound is obtained in the gaseous state, while in the combustion of hydrogen
it is condensed during the course of the experiment into a liquid ; and if,
from the entire quantity of heat evolved in the latter case, we deduct that
arising from the condensation of the vapour of water, the result will no

longer agree with the quantity of heat obtained in the former case. Protoxide

of tin may probably be added to the foregoing list, and perhaps also phosphorus,
which disengages however a little more heat than the other bodies.

    Sulphur, copper and the protoxide of copper, disengage, during their com-
bustion in oxygen gas, a little more than half the quantity of heat evolved
by the preceding class of bodies. Carbon occupies an intermediate position,
while zinc gives out a larger quantity of heat than any of the bodies already
enumerated ; and potassium a still larger quantity than zinc. The combus-
tion of a large number of carbo-hydrogens, alcohols, aethers and organic acids
has been examined by Fabre and Silbermann. Their results prove the opi-
nion to be erroneous, that if we subtract the oxygen in the form of water,
the remaining elements give the same amount of heat as in the free state.

    In the reduction of oxide of iron by hydrogen gas, no perceptible evolu-
tion of heat occurs, while in the reduction of the oxide of copper by the
same gas, it is well known that ignition takes place, unless the experiment is
conducted very slowly. These phaenomena are at once explained by the fact,
that in combining with oxygen, hydrogen gas disengages nearly the same

quantity of heat as iron, and twice as much heat as copper.

    Fabre and Silbermann have observed that the heat of combustion is influ-
enced to a considerable extent by the physical state in which the combustible
exists before combination. According to their experiments, carbon in the
form of the diamond disengages 7824? units of heat during its combustion in
oxygen gas ; in the form of graphite 7778 units ; and in that of wood-char-

coal 8080 units. According to my own experiments and those of Despretz,

the combustion of wood-charcoal produces only about 7900 units. Fabre
and Silbermann have also supposed that they were able to detect differences
in the quantities of heat disengaged by sulphur in its different allotropic
states. The same chemists have also made the remarkable observation, that
a much larger quantity of heat is evolved by the combustion of carbon in the
protoxide of nitrogen than in oxygen gas. From this it should follow that
in the separation of the elements of the protoxide of nitrogen, heat would be

set free. Accordingly, by passing the protoxide of nitrogen through a pla-

tina tube heated to redness by burning charcoal in a suitable apparatus, it
 was found that a larger quantity of heat was actually evolved than could be

--accounted for by the weight of charcoal burned.
    Combustions in Chlorine Gas, Some years ago, I published the results of

 an investigation on the quantities of heat evolved in the combination of zinc
 and iron with chlorine, bromine and iodine ; and I have lately given an ac-

 count of a set of experiments on the combustion of potassium, tin, antimony,

 mercury, phosphorus and copper in chlorine gas. So far as I am aware, the
 only other experiments on this subject are those described by M. Abria on
 the combustion of hydrogen and phosphorus in chlorine. From a com-

 parison of the results, it appears that in several cases the quantities of heat

 evolved during the combustion of the same metal in oxygen and chlorine are
 nearly the same. This observation applies particularly to the cases of iron,

"tin and antimony. Zinc however disengages a greater quantity of heat with

 chlorine (6309 units) than with oxygen (5366 units), and copper nearly twice
78 iiEPOBT-^i849.

as much (3805 and 2394? units). Phosphorus, on the contrary, gives less
heat with chlorine than with oxygen (2683 and 4509 units). On comparing
the quantities of heat disengaged by different bodies in combining with the
same volume of chlorine, it will be found that potassium disengages a larger
amount of heat than any other body hitherto examined, twice as much as

--zinc, and nearly four times as much as tin, antimony or copper.
    Combinations of Bromine and Iodine. The heat disengaged by the same
body in combining with bromine is less than with chlorine, and with iodine
less than with bromine. The greater development of heat in the case of
chlorine is at least partly due to that element being in the gaseous state be-
fore combination. In some early experiments, I observed that the quantities

of heat developed on converting equivalent solutions of the sesquichloride,
sesquibromide and sesquiiodide of iron into the corresponding proto-com-

pounds were equal. When a solution of protochloride of iron is converted

into sesquichloride by agitation with chlorine gas, a definite disengagement
of heat occurs, as also in the formation of the sesquibromide of iron by the
combination of the protobromide and bromine ; but in the corresponding re-
action between the protoiodide of iron and iodine, no change of temperature

can be observed.

Report of the Committee on the Registration of the Periodic Phenomena

  R. Taylor, Mr. W. Thompson, Rev. L. Jenyns, Prof. Henslow,
  Mr. A. Henfrey, Sir W. C. Trevelyan, Bart., and Mr. Peach.

Since the last Meeting of the Association, your Committee have made

several alterations in the Tables for the purpose of registering the periodic
phaenomena occurring in plants and animals, which were then submitted for
the approval of the members. These tables have been sent to upwards of fifty

members of the Association and others, who have undertaken to observe.
    But few of these tables have yet been returned to the Committee, but they

hope at the next meeting to find more abundant fruit of their labours. They
have to acknowledge, however, the receipt of a very complete registration of
the periodic phaenomena of the plants and animals in the neighbourhood of
Swansea, by Matthew Moggridge, Esq. ; also observations on periodic phae-
nomena for 1848, at Polpero in Cornwall, by J. E. Couch, Esq. ; a list of
the visitation and departure of birds at Llanrwst in Wales, by J. Blackwall,
Esq. ; and observations on the foliation and defoliation of plants, by T. L.

Lloyd, Esq.

Ninth Report of a Committee, consisting of H. E. Strickland,
   Prof. Daubeny, Prof. Henslow, and Prof. Lindley, appointed

   to continue their Experiments on the Growth and Vitality of Seeds.

During the past summer, a portion of each kind of seed collected in 1841

and 1846 were resown at Oxford and Chiswick, together with a few other

kinds contributed by Miss Molesvvorth, of Cobham Lodge, Surrey.

Those forwarded to Cambridge arrived just after Mr. Murray (Curator of

the Botanic Garden there) had started for a botanical tour in the north, and

he did not receive them till his return, when it was too late this year to have

Athem sown.     statement respecting them will therefore be given in the Re-

port for 1850.

  We again beg to remind persons interested in these experiments, that we

shall be glad to receive contributions of seeds of known date, whether old or
new, especially those of genera not named in the List submitted to the Meeting

of the Association in 1848.

--80 REPORT 1849.

Report concerning the Observatory of the British Association at Kew,

  from Aug. 9, 1848 to Sept. 12, 1849. By Francis Ronalds,

   F.R.S., Honorary Superintendent.

Notwithstanding the resolution which was adopted at the last meeting of
the British Association for discontinuing observations at Kew (a resolution
partly founded upon an opinion that the establishment could not be carried
on in a manner satisfactory to the Association " on so low a scale of expendi-
ture" as that which had hitlierto been found practicable), it was deemed

expedient to furnish a fund for defraying the cost of prosecuting experiments

then in progress, together with a few necessary expenses of the establishment
and another sum lor the reduction and discussion of the series of electric ob-
servations which commenced in August IS'tS and terminated in August 1848.

   The last year's work has therefore been principally devoted to reduction
and discussion by Mr. Birt of the electric observations recorded in the five
annual volumes preceding this year's volume, and to the due prosecution of
the magnetic experiments which were contemplated.

   I much regret that it has not been in my power to do more, as regards

the discussion of the observations, than confer with Mr. Birt upon the course
which was to be adopted *. The other objects became latterly so pressing,

and in my humble opinion so important, that it has been quite out of my

power to devote the time and attention to the subject which it eminently
deserves. The observations have furnished means of computing results, which,
combined with the successful prosecution of experiments on a general pho-
tographic system of registration, will, I trust, be deemed ample justification

of the opinions expressed by the last Kew Committee, presided over by Sir

John Herschel, and participated in by the Council, as to the utility of the

Kew establishmentf

   Mr. Birt's reductions, &c. will appear in a separate Report ; and I now
proceed to devote a i'ew lines (as usual), first to the state of affairs at Kew,
so far as regards the Building, Instruments, &c., and secondly, to an account
of the experiments and operations which have been conducted here during the
last (Association) year ; and a few other matters connected with experimental

inquiry.

                                  I. The Building, &c.

The premises having been repaired (outwardly) at the expense of Her

Majesty's Government in the previous year, nothing additional has been

required to be done in that respect ; but I am sorry to add that some parts

of the interior are sadly afflicted with dry-rot.

   The Quadrant Room has, in consequence of the extraordinary solidity of

the foundation, contributed largely to the success of experiments on, and to

testing the efficiency of, the self-registering magnetic apparatus, which has

been sent by the Superintendent of Magnetic Colonial Observatories, our

excellent General Secretary, to Toronto. For the immediate support of that

apparatus, two solid stone slabs were attached at the base of the wall tem-

porarily.

The principal Electric Conductor has maintained its original vertical

position (with the exception of a slight bending towards the north-east,

owing to the prevalence of south-west winds) amid the attacks of six years'

tempests; and the insulating power of its only support is improved, rather

Athan otherwise, since its erection by constant heat and age.  little is

   · It was agreed that the Greenwich methods of reducing meteorological observations should
(so far as was consistent with the different circumstances) be adopted, with modifications.

required to be done to prevent the entrance of rain (when violent gii:<ts

occur) at the cap.
    The Voltaic Electrometers are a little deteriorated (in appearance princi-

pally).

    Jlie Henley 'Electrometer (apud Volta) is certainly in a rather less efficient
state than when new. Friction of pivots is ever bad in electrometers, and

want of employment increases the evil tendency.

   The Wind Va7ie has been nearly destroyed by a ftdl, in consequence
of some bad soldering at its supporting ring.

   The following instruments are all in an efficient state for use in obser-

vation :

The Galvanometer.                         Thermometer' (standard).

Discharger.                               Wet-bulb Hygrometer.
Gold-leaf Electroscope.                   Daniels Hygrometer.
Distinguisher.                            Saussure's Hygrometer.

Three Night registering Electrometers.    Balance Atiemometer.
Barometers (ttvo).                        Haiti and Vapour- Gauge.

The numerous instruments which have been employed in electric, magnetic,

and other experiments and extraordinary observations are not materially, if

at all deteriorated. Tiiey will be carefully enumerated in a general catalogue

--of the actual contents of the Kew Observatory arranged under six heads,

viz.

          1. Fixtures, furniture, &c. found in the building on the 1st of August

1843.

          2. Apparatus supplied by means of a subscription in J 843.
          3. Apparatus, and materials for apparatus, purchased out of sums

granted annually by the British Association, including a 50/. grant from

the British Association for experiments.

          4. Apparatus presented to the British Association.
          5. Books the property of the British Association.

          6. Articles which are on loan to the British Association.

                         II. Experiments, &c.

   Soon after the meeting of the British Association at Swansea in August
1848, being very anxious to proceed with the magneto-registering system, I
began to make drawings of apparatus on the plan of suspending the declina-
tion magnet at right angles (horizontally) with the index arm (all else re-
maining as before), in order to procure a greater extent of scale with the
same amount of light ; but I'eflecting upon some valuable conversation which
I had the honour to hold with Dr. Lloyd at the Swansea meeting, and on some
suggestions of his afterwards, I made diagrams and calculations for trying his
methods of attaching the lens to the magnet, and deflecting it by separate
magnets, or by reversion of it, in order to procure a larger range of the in-
strument itself. I submitted these ideas, &c. to Colonel Sabine, and received
obliging and very useful hints from him. I also consulted profitably Mr. Ross

the optician.

   At the beginning of November I had made arrangements, drawings, &c.
for mounting a magnet on Dr. Lloyd's plan, which it was intended should be
tried at Woolwich ; but the apartment (or observatory) selected not having
ultimately been deemed very well-fitted for the purpose, I thought that the
Kew building and the Kew establishment could and ought to be appropriated

to the attainment of so desirable an end, that it was one exactly calculated
for the proper business of the establishment, and Colonel Sabine agreed in
these views I believe.

--82 REPORT 1849.

My continued instructive correspondence with Dr. Lloyd on the subject

was very profitable, and new arrangements were in consequence contem-

plated which were applicable to either plan (viz. that of using a detached

lens as heretofore, or an attached lens with deflectors, &c.), for comparing

them at Kew ; and Mr. Ross received some final instructions as to the work

to be executed.

   But in the course of Mr. Ross's operations in December, a considerable

improvement occurred to me in the management of the light, viz. that of

suppressing the condensing lenses at the object-end of the camera, bringing

the index much nearer to the lamp, and employing the focus lenses to pro-

cure not only a distinct image of the index, but also a brilliant pencil of

light (broad enough for oiir^ purposes) immediately from the flame itself.

By these means the time required to produce the desired effect upon the
paper was very considerably reduced. Mr. Malone assisted me in these ex-

periments zealously.

Several improvements were also made in the construction and disposition

of the time-piece {vide Plate II. K), &c. ; and at about this time, after

many vain attempts, an improvement in the brilliancy of the flame itself was
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \

wicks, &c., and an especial adaptation of a high square copper chimney, &c.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                [

{vide Plates 11. and III. D).

The reason for not instituting the above-mentioned comparison of lenses, I

was chiefly that of finding the expense of a lens properly adapted to the

purpose very considerable.  Yet  I  trust  that  my  anxiety  to                                                                                                               j

                                                                  carry out prac-

tically Dr. Lloyd's important suggestions, combined with the occurrence of]
more favourable circumstances, may not be ultimately unavailing, or that]
some less costly method than we thought of may be propounded.

In February IS^Q Colonel Sabine wished to know the difference of effect

(under such circumstances as those in which the Toronto horizontal force

magnetometer finds itself in magnetic storms, &c.) between a slit in a shield

and an index. The slit had also occurred to Dr. Lloyd and others, and I

resolved upon attempting a strictly practical solution of the question.

   But before the experiment had been tried upon paper, it struck me

that the Daguerreotype process would be far preferable to Talbotype in

these cases of rapid and great variations, if not in every case, in consequence

of the greater sensitiveness, greater capability of retaining the integrity of its

normal condition, and greater delicacy (or sharpness) of outline ; and the

result of the first trials fully confirmed the Colonel's sagacious anticipations

of the superiority of the slit, at the same time that the use of silver sur-

faces became at once indispensable for future operations. On the 23rd of

February, two specimens, extremely well defined, were procured, one in

twenty seconds, the other in thirty. The first was the stronger (too strong).

The next problem was to copy these impressions, for it was deemed too

expensive and cumbersome to preserve them ; and I spent much time in

trials on Mr. Edwards' plan, viz. that of pressing off a part of the mercury
upon black paper coated by a solution of isinglass. The sticking, and con-

sequent tearing of the long piece of paper presented great obstacles (amongst

others) to the success of these attempts; and I began, with Mr. Malone's

obliging assistance, to try whether the Talbotype process could be applied

Aprofitably to copy these metalline impressions.         specimen is preserved;

but we arrived at the conclusioa that the trouble and cost of time^ &c. in the

execution would be too great, and that no copy on paper could ever be so

sharp and beautiful as the metalline impression itself.

In the beginning of April I made a little experimental addition to the
                                                                                               ;

                                                                  ON THE KEW OBSERVATORY.      83

clock-work, for imitating long excursions of a magnet in short intervals, in
order to prove the efficacy of the above-mentioned new arrangements relative

to light, the slit and the Daguerreotj^pe process in such cases, and adapted

it to some horizontal-force apparatus which was intended for the Toronto

Observatory                                                       for it was by far too tedious a task to wait for any disturbance
                                                               ;

Aapproximating in extent to those which occur in Canada.                                   specimen is

preserved of the result, which makes out the case (of success) very well.

But we already begin to contemn these dirty, although efficient, specimens.

   I also began to think about etching the impressions on the plate itself, and
received some valuable information on the subject from Mr. Malone, Mr.

Hodgson of Winchfield, and other gentlemen ; and I found that the usual

cost of plates was somewhat too high.

Toward the end of May, Daguerreotype apparatus for cleaning, polishing,

coating, &c. silvered plates of the length required for our purposes claimed

attention, with special regard to saving of time and labour.

About the same time Dr. Lloyd visited the observatory, and suggested the

advantage of procuring a zero line upon the plate formed by the action of

the same source of light which produced the magnetic curve (as I had from

the first procured on paper), instead of depending upon the edge of the

plate for reading off ordinates. This hint appeared so judicious, that

(although presenting difficulties in contrivance and execution, and thus

creating delay in the preparations for shipment of the Toronto bifilar appa-
ratus) I thought it right to try experiments, and attained the object. The

method will be easily understood presently.
   I had now also hit upon an obvious, but very useful addition to all appa-

ratus calculated to measure ordinates of magnetic and other curves from a

given abscissa, within certain but extensive distances. This instrument 1 call

the Scale Board (vide Plate IV. figs. 2 and 3), and will describe it below.
   The last-executed improvements have been upon the instruments used in

<;leaning and coating the plates, in which Mr. Nicklin has materially assisted

and in carefully etching, or rather engraving and etching, the plate

without using (at first) a " ground," for which I am chiefly indebted to Mr.
Wood. The plate which has been thus treated is still capable of receiving

more impressions in the camera, although the first impression is deeply en-

Agraved, and capable of printing any (usual) number of copies.                                 printed

specimen is preserved (vide Plate IV. fig. 4).
   About the first week in June I experienced great satisfaction in receiving

a visit from Colonel Sabine, to inspect the apparatus (which had been ex-

perimented upon, improved and tested at our Kew Observatory, under the

auspices of the British Association) for a horizontal-force magnetograph, to

go to the Toronto Observatory. It (excepting the stone pillars) was shipped

for Montreal, and addressed to Captain Lefroy, Director of the Magnetic

Observatory, Toronto, in about the middle of last August, and may be thus

described.

 through a'.

   A horizontal aperture, of about a quarter of an inch broad, cut through

a', admits the light which forms the focus at e' of the 7noveable slit (in 6'),

 and a little vertical aperture in a' admits the focus of the fixed slit in o'.

equally unappreciable.

   The scale board (Plate IV. figs. 2 and 3), for measuring off rapidly and

A blank ivory scale is fixed upon C.

    ci is a milled-headed screw, acting by its shoulder upon a piece which
presses C inwards, or against the right-hand edge of Y.

    c- and c3 are screws passing through another ruler,
    M, &c., fixed immoveably upon B, and acting by their ends upon two little

brass sliders which press upon the left-hand edge of Y. This fixed ruler

(M) carries a scale of white metal, upon which divisions, representing hours,

half-hours, quarters and five minutes, are engraved, a length of one inch

Hrepresenting one hour (for the slider in the case F is moved by the clock

at a rate corresponding with these values). Two spiral springs are con-
Ytained in B, which cause the two sliders pressing on to resume their nor-

 mal positions when c^ and c^ are not employed.

Tcounting from the zero mark, 0, on each series ; and it is affixed to by a

milled screw passing through one of the oblong slits at either end, so that

either scale may be used, or a blade much more minutely divided might be

substituted.

  A good double lens, ov pair of lenses, may be used upon a stand with this

apparatus for reading the scales.

   The manner of using this instrument is perhaps sufficiently obvious. The
zero of the o/-rfz>2a<e 5C«/e (<) is adjusted (if necessary) to that right-hand
edge and extremity of the zero line (y*) which is furthest from the time
scale, M, transversely (after relaxing the screw near T). The ordinate
scale is, secondly, applied to the other extremity of y- ; and if the zero point
on it should not coincide with y"^, then the screw c' is relaxed, and the ap-
propriate left-hand screw (either c" or c') is slowly screwed up until exact
coincidence occurs. Then f' is screwed up again.

    Particular information, &c. as to the use of the apparatus sent to Toronto
was carefully detailed, and some hints relative to the (seemingly) best modes
of operating upon the long Daguerreotype plates, &c. were set down for the

use of Captain Lefroy, &c.

   These details are not requisite here. The former ^mfZ of information has
been already published, i. e. when my earlier experiments on registration
were made known* ; and the latter is comprised in great part (although not
in sufficient abundance) in several well-known publications.

   Proceeding now with the relation of the other circumstances connected
with experimental inquiry at Kew, I may add, tiiat at the visit above men-
tioned of Colonel Sabine we held some conversation on the subject of con-
structing a vertical-force magnetograph, which had previously occupied our
attention, when the Colonel relieved me from a difficulty by hinting that an
arm might be erected vertically upon the centre of the magnet, to carry the
shield with its slit. By this means the injurious proximity of the lamp to
the magnet at night will be entirely avoided.

    This apparatus is in an advanced state of preparation for Toronto.

  My correspondence with the Rev. Alfred Weld, respecting the establish-

ment of a self-registering electric and magnetic observatory at Stonyhurst,
after occupying much time (in making plans, drawings, &c.), has not been
as yet followed by the erection of a suitable building at that locality.

   In August 184-8 I received from the Superintendent of the Great Western
Hallway Electric Telegraph some further and rather curious notices of the
deflections of the needles, &c. at Paddington, Slough and Derby. At Pad-
dington, on the 9th of August, at about 1^ 50TM p.m., during a storm, an ex-
plosion occurred in the office like that of a gun fired, and the cross wire was
fused. The same thing occurred at Slough at the same time.

   The most remarkable effects upon these wires are those which are pro-
duced hyjbgs; and I apprehend that experiments relative to them would be
interesting, and perhaps profitable.

   Amongst several distingui;jhed visitors to the observatory in the past year,
Don Manuel Rico, Director of the Madrid Observatory, came to converse
on the subject of erecting an electrical apparatus like ours at that building,
and gave me a rough plan and description of it.

   The site appears to be extremely favourable. Experiments and observa-
tions in that latitude would form an important link in a geographical series
comprising the observations (now probably going on by means of similar
apparatus) at Bombay, and others to be instituted in a very high latitude (as

Alten, e.g.).

   I trust that other gentlemen, visitors to Kew, have derived some little
pleasure, and even profit, from the results of their inquiries here, and that

my limited correspondence on electric and other subjects with several gentle-
men of scientific eminence has not been wholly profitless to all parties.

   I have usually set down under this head a little list of proposals for new
experiments, or the continuation of old ones ; but the number of such-like
propositions has accumulated so much faster than the means and time re-

quired for their execution, that the catalogue arrives at an almost despairing
magnitude. However it shall follow here, because it will at least serve to

show that plenty of work could be done at Kew if we had plentiful means.

Report on the Experimental Inquiry conducted at the request of the

               British Association, on Railway Bar Corrosion.

          By Robert Mallet, M.R.I.A., Mem. Inst. C.E.

It having been long loosely rumoured that railway bars corrode less when
in use, i. e. travelled over, than when out of use, and the only evidence for this
being that they appear to do so to the eye, and several vague speculations
having been broached by engineers and others to account for the assumed
facts, it seemed desirable to ascertain the truth experimentally, and also to
determine at the same time the constants of abrasion by the action of the

wheels of railway carriages, this latter being in fact a necessary prior question

to the research as to corrosion.

  A general sketch of the views promulgated on this subject is contained in

my Third Report on Corrosion of Iron to the British Association in IS-tS ; a
sum of £20 having been placed at my disposal by the British Association at

the Rlanchester ISIeeting in 1842, for the purpose of these experiments.

    The first experiments were directed to the object of ascertaining the fact
of any difterence in the amount of corrosion by air and water, &c. between
railway bars in use and out of use, in an exact and unexceptionable manner;
and from the great weight of the rails requiring a balance of great strength,
this was found by no means an easy matter, as the difference of corrosion in
any moderate time might be expected not very greatly to exceed the errors
of weighing. The first sets of experiments arranged were on the Dublin
and Kingstown Railway, upon that part of the line which lies near Sydney Pa-
 rade, at the Dublin side of the level crossing there.

    The line is quite straight, the brakes are never applied here, and the rails
 are level. Three sets of six lengths of fifteen feet rails each, were here laid
 down upon the coming into town or western line.

    The direction by compass of the rails at this point is north-west and south-
 east, and hence these rails were always traversed over in a direction from

 south-east to north-west.

  --The experimental rails were laid in the following way : Having been care-

 fully weighed, viz. two sets of bars of six each were laid into the coming-in line,
 and secured in the same way as all the others on the line, by cast-iron chairs
 and compressed wood wedges resting upon longitudinal memel sleepers, and
 with pine or memel filling-pieces between the chairs, filling up the spaces be-
 tween the bottoms of the rails and the tops of the sleepers.

    Of these two sets laid into the line, one set of six bars (No. 2 marked · ·)
 was exposed freely and without any preparation, and was placed on the eastern
 side of the coming-in line ; the other of the two sets (No. 3 marked · · ·) was
 coated' ail over with boiled coal-tar, laid on the iron when hot, so as to
 protect it from all corrosion. The third set of (6) bars (marked No. 1 ·) was
 laid upon wood sleepers, chairs, &c., in the same way as the others, but were

  placed aside by themselves in the middle of the road between the two lines
  of railway, without any preparation, and freely exposed to corrosion, but not

  travelled over.

     All three setsof bars before being laid down or coated were heated in a boiler-
  maker's oven to a bright red heat, to remove all rust bya scale, leave their sur-
  faces perfectly uniform and alike, and were permitted to cool slowly without
  any blows, and in a horizontal position, so as to have as little permanent mag-

  netism as possible.

     Thus arranged the three sets of bars stood upon the line in the following

  order

   Thus the set No. 3, tarred over, is exposed to abrasion alone. The set
No. 2 is exposed both to corrosion and abrasion ; deducting therefore the
amount of the former from the latter, we get the amount of corrosion alone
of the rails in use, and are enabled to compare this with the amount of cor-
rosion of the set of rails No. 1 out of use, and thus at once to ascertain the
difference, if any exists, and to determine the amount of abrasion for a given
weight of traffic, of which returns are kept by the Dublin and Kingstown
Railway Company.

^ The Dublin and Kingstown rails were made at the works of John Bradley
and Co. of Stourbridge, and profess to be according to the specification of

                  the Company's Engineer of 1833, viz. " Exterior surface of best

          rolled iron previously hammered, and the interior of the best

          parts of the former and five parts of the latter, and branded as in

   The dimensions as to surface, &c. of the rails is as follows, in accordance

with the foregoing section :

  =Total perimeter of the rail 11 -5 inches:

Total surface per yard running=36x 11-5=414 sq. ins.=2-88 sq. ft.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                [

   Total surface in contact with the wheels= 1-5 in. x 36=54 sq. in. per lineal

yard of rail.
    Total surface iu contact v/\\\i filling jyieces beneath, and hence partially

protected from corrosion, is=r7 in. X 36=61*2 sq. in. per lineal yard.

    Besides this there is the surface covered by the chairs and wedges, which
partially but very slightly prevent corrosion, water finding its way between
iu wet weather very readily. There is one chair at every three feet, which
covers about twenty-four square inches, including the wood wedge. The
meeting-chairs at every fifteen feet cover twice this.

    The top surfaces of the rails which are run upon appear to corrode
scarcely at all, owing to the fine polish preserved by the rolling of the wheels ;
if it be assumed that neither this top surface corrodes nor the bottom surface

covered with the filling slip, then

   The total surface per yard lineal exposed to corrosion is=4'14 sq. ins.--

        (54'+61*2)=298-8 sq. ins., and the uncorroded surface=(54' + 61*2)

       = 115"2 sq. ins.=2"08 sq. ft, or the corroded is to the non-corroded

            surface per yard, as 298*8 : 115'2, or as 2-59 : 1 ;

omitting any account of the surfaces covered by chairs, which are common

to all the three sets, and do not prevent the corrosion materially beneath.
    But if the top or running surface of the rail be supposed to corrode equally

with the sides, then

   The total surface per yard exposed to corrosion is=4'14 sq. ins.-- 61*2
           =352*8 sq. ins., and the corroded is to the uncorroded surface per

            yard as 352-8 : 61*2, or as 5*76 : 1.

   The set No. 1, not travelled over, corrodes on the top as well as sides, and|
hence exposes to corrosion per lineal yard, 414-- 61*2=352"8 sq. ins.

   The weighings of the tiiree sets of railway bars took place for the first ex-j
perimenton 24th of March 1841 : they were previously marked, as mentioned!
above, (·), (··), (·· ·), with a centre punch near one end on the side of the]
bar, and each bar of each set numbered from 1 to 6.

   The weighings of the coal-tarred set were of course made before the ap-
plication of the varnish, in applying which care was taken not to heat the bars]
so as to scale them or to abrade, or in any way alter their weights.

   The weighings were made under my own eye, by David James, an intel-

ligent workman, with a beam about six feet long, sensible when loaded with!
one rail to about 2 ounces avoirdupois, or yJg-^th of the load in one scale, orl
gg'gp th of the whole load. Four accurately adjusted half-hundred weights ofI
cast-iron, varnished over, prepared from the brass standard wei'e used, andf
retained for use again on subsequent removal of the rails, and the other]
weights were accurate brass standard avoirdupois weights of my laboratory.

   Each rail was weighed separately, and the weights were checked by myself.]
   The following table gives the data and numerical results df the first seriesj

of experiments.
    All three sets. No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3, were laid down, and the traffic o|

the second day of July 1841 was the first that went over them.
   They M'ere all taken up again and reweighed on the 30th of Aprill842j

being exposed to corrosion and trafliic for an interval of 303 days.

or 378,030 .38 tons per annum.

But as the load is uniformly diffused over both sides of each set of rails,

only one-half the above load passes over any one given length of rail

                     or il^=189,015 tons,

the passage of which produces an abrasion of 1024*16 grs. per yard per

but as the trains only travel from 6 o'clock a.m. to 10 o'clock p.m., or 16
out of the 24, it is at the rate of 2*171 trains per hour, or rather more than

one every half-hour. This is probably as fast as locomotive trains are likely
to travel constantly on any line ; but the actual iveight of each train will
materially affect the amount of abrasion, as there can be no doubt that at
some certain weight the substance of the iron would be ruffled and disinte-

grated by the great pressure rolling over it.

   We can determine in this case the average weight per train, as follows

Hence the average gross weight of each train is=29'8 tons, or nearly 30

tons.

   And the remarkable fact appears, that the useless load per train is to the

iiseful as 25-44. : 4-36, or as 5*83 : 1, or nearly as 6 : 1 ; and that the abra-
sion or destruction of rail relatively to the useless and useful load are in the

same ratio.

We2nd.        deduce from this, that the absolute corrosion of a length of rail

out of use to that of the same rail in use, or exposed to traffic, is in round

numbers about, as 15-30 to 6-26, or that the difference in favour of the latter

is 9-04 ; but it will be best to postpone a minute comparison of the rate of

corrosion until we have the results of the further experiments also before us.
   While these experiments were in progress, it seemed very desirable to me

to obtain a set of experiments made co-ordinately with the above, but upon

a single line of railway where the traffic would be in both directions, viz.

backward and forward over the same set of rails ; as from views suggested

by Mr. Nasrayth, it was possible this might be an important element in the

question. Mr. Nasmyth's views, which are briefly alluded to in my Third

Report on the Corrosion of Iron, will be found more particularly detailed by

himself in the following interesting letter to me, which I have his permission

to publish !

--"My dear Sir, On my return from the continent I had the pleasure to

receive your valued letter respecting the rusting and non-rusting of railway

rails. I have not had any opportunity to obtain the exact comparative rate

of oxidation under the two conditions, but so strikingly different is the oxida-

tion of the one, as compared with the other, that a very slight glance will

satisfy any one that they are under very marked and different influences, in-
asmuch as, in the case of the Liverpool and Manchester, the rails of which

have been laid and exposed to all the changes of wet and dry for upwards of

five years, there is no more appearance of rust than merely a light-brown

coating of mud-coloured water, more the result of the splashing of rain

while in the case of the London and Blackvvall Railway, in which the car-
riages travel alternately east and west on the same rail, the rusting is proceeding

at that rate, that although they have not been laid two years, cakes of rust are

falling from the sides of the rail, and the ground for 12 inches on each side

of the rail is yellow with rust. This may be said to be mere ocular demon-

stration, but to any one willing to be convinced, it is most satisfactory proof.

I should be most glad to have my observations and theory on the subject

brought to the most severe test ; but to do this would not be very easy, as

to time and similar circumstances, all but the one in question, viz. the one

way travelling versus the both ways alternately ; for to be a true experiment,
we should have both bars of the same iron in the same place, only one
travelled on in one direction, the other in both, and au equal amount of

travel on each. The experiment required in that form might be tried by

mechanical contrivance, hut then we know not as yet what is due to the cor-

rection with so vast a length of rail as in the case of railroad ; but in the

absence  of any very delicate  and  am' scientific-like ' results I  fain  to  con-

tent myself with the most striking difference, which is observed, or may be

observed, by any one whose attention is directed to the subject. I may also

mention, that on the Liverpool and Manchester line, all the sidings, as they

are called, i. e. those parts of the rail which serve for backing trains into

--when it is desired to permit others to pass them on the same line, that all
                                    :

--94 REPORT 1849.

such sidings are rusting naost rapidly ; it is tlie sides of the rail I hold to as

proof, as such sides are in both cases removed from any friction. I may also

                                                                   Sidmj/

name that even the kei/s and chairs partake of the rusting or non-rusting in-
flence, as the case may be.

   " I have had no means as yet to ascertain whether my conjecture is right or

otherwise ; but I consider tiie rolling of the wheels in one direction to confer
or induce a magnetical condition on the rails, in the same manner as in the
case of inducing magnetism or magnetical property on a piece of iron or
steel, by the ordinary method of passing the parent magnet along the iron

bar, thus

The subject is, I think, a very interesting one, and well-worthy of attention,

as it may tend to illustrate, on a most grand scale, some of the pure results

of the delicate investigations which I doubt not you are familiar with, both as

to what has been brought to light by others as well as yourself. If there

be any further questions I can answer, you may command me at all times, as

on longitudinal wood sleepers, presented an excellent position for this expe-

riment, and on my writing to Mr. John Godwin, C.E., the Engineer of the
line, he at once acceded to my wishes, and undertook the experiment. The

following table gives its results, which are not as satisfactory as could be
desired, owing to some circumstances which are unexplained, and which
induced Mr. Godwin himself to consider the experiments in that light.

   The two following letters relate to this, and show that care appears to have
been bestowed on each step of the process. The only error I am able to
remark is, that one-half of the rails B, intended to be exposed to corrosion
only, were by some mistake coated to prevent corrosion ; hence in deducing
the results of the experiments I have been obliged to double the loss on the

three uncoated rails 13, so as to get an approximation to the truth.

--" Dear Sir, I send you enclosed the result of the experiment on the

rails which we laid down in June 1842. You will observe that they were

taken up in June last, and I would then have sent you the particulars had

they not appeared so unsatisfactory. I cannot account for the great difference

in the loss of weight, for we were very careful in weighing them. The

quality of the iron could scarcely have made the difference ; however, I send

--" Dear Sir, In reply to your questions relative to the account of the

experiments on the corrosion of iron rails which I furnished you with, I beg

to say, that the rail not travelled on was the centre rail in the middle of the line ;
they were weighed with the same beam and weights as when put down ; the

weights were properly adjusted; the beam was sensible to a quarter of an

ounce ; the rails were weighed separately.

London, was obtained prior to Experiment No. 1, and was now again used

to adjust fourteen cast-iron 56lbs. weigiits by, so as to enable 7 cwt. of rails

to be \reighed at once. These cast-iron weights, prior to final adjustment,

were coated with a thin covering of copal varnish, to preserve them from

corrosion, until again called into use, after the lapse of two years. They

were handled with leather slings to avoid abrasion, and preserved in a per-

fectly dry place, and checked against the brass standard again before being

Aused to weigh the rails after their removal.  steel beam of 36 inches

in length was prepared and carefully adjusted by Mr. Yeates, instrument-

maker, Dublin, by M'hich these weights were adjusted. It was sensible to

20 grs., with 56lbs. avoir, in each pan, or to soloo^h P^"^*^ ^^ ^^^ whole
load. It turned in all its bearings on hardened steel edges, and was found a

most satisfactory and accurate instrument.

  A large beam was also prepared and carefully adjusted, whose length was

eight feet, and whose strength was such as to be capable of weighing three
lengths of rails at once, or of sustaining a load of above 12 cwt. This
beam was of wrought iron, turning on hardened steel knife-edges, and with

means of gradually bringing the load upon the beam without jar or vibration.
   When loaded with three rails and their counterpoise, this very large beam

was found to be sensible to 500 grs., or to g^Va^ P^'^'' ^^ ^^^ S'"'^^^ ^"^'^
and could have been made still more so if requisite. It is probably the

largest and most accurate beam ever made.
   Both this and the smaller beam were tolerably equibrachial ; but to avoid

any error from this source, double weighings were made in adjusting the
weights, and one end of the large beam was marked, and the rails always

placed under it, the counterpoise being at the opposite end.

   This may appear a tedious description of an unnecessary amount of care ;
but when it is recollected that the question to be determined relates to a
weight of not much more than a single pound in a gross load of nearly
14001bs., it will be seen that any inaccuracy in the weighings would mate-

rially modify, or wholly vitiate the results ; and it is to the accumulation of
slight errors of this sort, and probably more particularly to want of equibra-
chiality in the beams used, or want of attention to always weighing at the
one end, that I attribute the want of consistency of the results obtained on

the Ulster line of railway.

In order also further to increase the accuracy of the result, I proposed to

allow a longer period to elapse before again removing the rails from the line
when laid down.

   The same set of eighteen rails divided into three classes of six each, which
had been used in the first experiment on the Kingstown line, were now again

brought into requisition. They had lain since the former experiment hori-

zontally under cover in a dry place, and had acquired a very slight coat of

red rust. They were all placed in a boiler-maker's oven, and exposed to a

bright red heat, and then permitted to cool, without being exposed to any
blows or jars, in a horizontal position and under cover. They had all now an

uniform coat of black oxide (Hammersehlag), very thin and adherent, were

pretty free from magnetism, except that due to terrestrial induction ; and in
this state they were all weighed, and the weights registered, each rail having

received a permanent mark at one end.
   The six rails to be exposed to abrasion only, were now heated horizontally

to about 400° Fahr. and coated with boiled coal-tar, which rapidly dried into

a tough japan varnish.

The weighings were made on the 10th October 1842; and on the 18th

October 1842 they were placed upon the up line of the Dublin and Kingstown

Railway, at the same place, and in precisely the same order as before, and
travelled over for the first time on that date.

   They remained exposed to traffic and corrosion for two years, and on the
18th October IS^^ were removed from the line and brought home for ex-
amination and weighing. Prior to this the beams and the standard ^'eights
were again examined as to their accuracy and adjustment, which were found as
perfect as before. I prepared to weigh the rails in the same order as before.

    These rails having been divided into three classes or sets, viz.
           No. 1. Not coated, exposed to corrosion alone and not to traffic.
           No. 2. Not coated, exposed to corrosion, and also to the abrasion

        of traffic.
           No. 3. Coated with coal-tar and exposed to abrasion of traffic, but

        protected from corrosion,
presented, when removed, the following appearances :

   The set No. 1 had a very dark red rusty colour, and an obvious scale of
adherent rust all over, which a closer inspection, and on passing the point of
the finger over the surface, proved to be papular or tubercular, and nearly

uniformly so all over, each separate circular tubercle of oxide being about
·j^yth of an inch in diameter. Tiie spaces between these were less dark-
coloured, or huffish; this aspect was quite uniform over every part of the
rails, except where they had been in contact with the chairs.

    The set No. 2 had no scale of rust on the surface, but a perfectly uniform
dark buff or reddish buff thin dusty coating of oxide all over the sides and
edges ; the top surface was bright and polished by traffic, but the wear was
not perceptible in dimension ; the lower surface, where in contact with the
wood filling slips, on the sleepers was of a deeper colour, and where in con-
tact with some parts of tiie chairs was bright and polished from the effects
of jarring or vibration produced by traffic. There was no loose rust what-
ever on any part.

   The set No. 3, which had been coated with coal-tar, were found bright
and polished, like No. 2, on the top edge, where borne upon by traffic. The
coal-tar varnish was fresh and sound everywhere else, and no rust had taken
place, nor any scaling off from any part of the bars. The surface, how-
ever, until it was washed clean, presented a uniform tint of yellowish brown,
arising from the fine particles of rust from the other rails, and probably also
from the wheels, of passing trains being blown upon the coal-tar coating, and
washed upon it by rain, &c.

    Prior to being cleaned for weighing, the whole of these rails were examined
as to their magnetic condition. The results ascertained will, however, be
best reserved for a subsequent part of this Report.

   The sets of uncoated rails, Nos. 1 and 2, were rubbed briskly with a fine
wire brush until all adherent rust was removed, and then finally cleaned

with dry cloths.

    The set No. 3 was exposed to a heat of about 700° Fahr. over a charcoal
fire, until the Avhole of the coal-tar coating Avas burnt, and removed as char-
coal dust by the brush and cloth. The weighings were then made in the
same order and way as before ; and the following Table No. 2 gives the

results.

   The rails, after being cleaned and weighed, presented all over a light red-
dish black tinge, perfectly uniform, and free from any scaling, or other indi-

cation of unequal action.

From these results we learn, that in a period of 730 days' exposure,

2nd. The absolute corrosion of the six rails in use, or exposed to traffic

and to corrosion, was 4813 grs. avoir.

in the ratio of 47"7 to 4'8, or in round numbers as 48 to 5, or nearly 10 to 1

4th. The absolute corrosion of the six rails out of use, or not travelled

over, was 13,125 grs. avoir.

5th. The ratio of the abrasion of the rails in use to the corrosion of the

rails out of use is nearly as 47*7 to 13*1, or in round numbers about as 4 to 1.

   There isi lerefore on this second experiment a distinct corroboration of
the result of the former Table No. 1, viz. that there is a real diminution of
corrosion in the rails, due to traffic. The absolute amount of dift'erence is

less however in this second experiment than in the first. By Table No 1 it ap-

pears that the ratio of the corrosion of the unused, to that of the used rails, was

as 15*30 : 6*06 ; but in the present case we find the ratio to be as 83-12 : 4-«-l 3,

or as               1 to 2'5 in the former, and

                    1 to 1*7 in the latter.

Hence the difference is a decreasing one, the causes of which we shall again

refer to.           sets of  rails  in  this  expenment were wei. gh, e- d, carelrulnly

before being cleaned just when removed from the line, and without any ad-

herent rust or other matter being shaken off from them, and, as already stated,

again weighed after having been brushed and cleaned. The difference

showed the amount of adherent oxide attached as a scale to the uncoated

rails, and of varnish coating on the others.

The weight of detached matter was as follows :

       No. 1. Uncoated, not travelled over          5,250 grs.

       No. 2. Uncoated, exposed to traffic          1,313 ,,

       No. 3. Coated, and exposed to traffic .... 11,375 ,,

consisting all of coal-tar and dust.
   From this it is apparent that the coat of adherent rust upon the unused

rails was on equal surfaces to that on the rails exposed to traffic, as 52*5 to

1 3*1, or that the adherent rust on the unused rails is nearly four times as
thick as on the rails exposed to traffic, proving that the oxide formed on the

latter is constantly shaken off" by the vibration of passing trains.

   It is now desirable to give the amount of traffic which passed over the rails

during the period of the last experiment, viz.
   Traffic in tons passed over the Dublin and Kingstown Railway between

18th October 184-2 and 18th October 1844, per T. F. Bergin, Esq.

                                                        Tons.

or 677,5791 tons per annum. Only half this, however=677,579^ tons in
the two years, or 338,789| tons per annum, traversed each length of ex-

perimental rails.
    This latter weight produced in the two years an absolute abrasion on 30

yards of rail of 47,687 grs. avoir., or of 23,844 grs. per annum, which is
nearly 795 grs. abraded per yard per annum, or an abrasion of iron amounting

to -00235 gr. per ton per yard, or 1760 x ·00235=4-136 gr. per ton per mile.
   The absolute abrasion is therefore less in this second experiment than in

the first, in the ratio of 4 to 9-5 in round numbers, proving that the upper
surface of the rails gradually alters in texture, and gets hardened by the

rolling over it of the loads, so as to be less and less abraded in proportion
to the load passed. This fact, however, can only apply to cases where the

loads are light enough not to disintegrate the surface of the rail, and to

places where the brakes are not applied. On many of the lines of heavy

traffic in these kingdoms at present the incumbent loads seem from the very
first to break up the molecular arrangement of the upper flange of the rail,
and hence induce a gradual increase instead of decrease of abrasion ; while
in places where the brakes are habitually applied, the rails are ground away
in flakes with great rapidity, those at some of the stations on (he Kingstown
line having one-half the upper flange of the rail cut away in three or four years.

   Through the kindness of Capt. Larcom, R.E., I am enabled to give the
amount of rain which fell in the basin of Dublin during the period occupied
in this last experiment. The results are taken from the meteorological re-

gister kept at the office of the Ordnance Survey, Mountjoy Barrack, Phoenix
Park, Dublin. The rain-gauges are situated on a plain 1 81-8 feet above the
Ordnance datum, or low water of spring-tides, at Dublin Bay lighthouse, and
have no hills in the immediate vicinity. The annual fall of rain is pretty
constant at Dublin ; and hence these tables may be viewed as sufficiently

applicable to all the experiments related in this report.

  The average rain, from several years' registry, is 33-1 15 inches by Ordnance
gauge, and 29-616 inches by that of the Royal College of Surgeons in the
city of Dublin, and at an elevation of 51'72 feet above the Ordnance datum.

 --102 REPORT 1849.

      The same sets of rails that had been taken up from the Kingstown line in
   October 1S4'4' were laid by in a dry place, passed through the same ordeal
    of heating to a bright red, cleansing and coating (one of the sets) as before;
   and on the 7th January 1845, the weighings being all completed, the three
   sets were again laid down on the Dalkey atmospheric single line railway, at
   a straight part of the line near the Dalkey terminus, in quite the same way
   and order as before, and fastened in the same way, the set of unused rails
   being laid at one side of the line of way. The direction of the railway at
   this place is nearly W.N.W. and E.S.E., corrected for variation ; and the
   traffic is here in both directioiis over the same rails.

       The rails were continued on this line for the long period of four years;
    and on the 7th January 1849 were removed and weighed after prior exami-
   nation as to state of surface and magnetism, &c. The results are given in

--Table No. 3. Third set of Experiments on the Dalkey Atmospheric Rail-

   On examining this table weareenabled todeduce the following results, viz.
   lot. The absolute abrasion during the whole period of 1460 days on the

six rails is 59,175 grs. avoir.

   2nd. The absolute corrosion on the six rails in use, and exposed to traffic

in same time, is 24,450 grs. avoir.
   3rd. The ratio of abrasion to corrosion on the rails in use is therefore

nearly in the ratio of 59*2 to 24"5, or about as 2'4 to 1.
   4th. The absolute corrosion of the six out of use and not travelled over

was 33,250 grs. avoir.
   5th. The ratio of the abrasion of the rails in use to the corrosion of the rails

out of use is therefore nearly as 59"2 to 33*3, or about as 1 '44 to 1, or 1^ to 1.
   6th. The absolute difference between the corrosion of the rails in use and

out of use is 8800 grs. avoir. Hence
   7th. The ratio of the corrosion of the rails in use is to that of the rails out

of use as 24*5 to 87'9, or nearly 88, or in round numbers as 3*14 to 1.
   Here again then we have corroborated the fact of a real difference in cor-

rosion due to traffic, and again we find it a decreasing one as compared with

the former experiments.

  We now proceed to give the amount of traffic on the Dalkey Atmospheric

Railway during the four years of these experiments, as deduced from the

records of the Company by Mr. Bergin at my request.

   The whole traffic up and down passed over the experimental rails.

And taking the passengers at 14 to the ton to allow for luggage, we have for

the weights in the above time

               1,166,155 tons of dead weight in trains

               67,831 tons of passengers.

Total. . . . 1,233,986 tons of gross load.

But the line was stopped on the 23rd November 1848 for repair, and

worked by a locomotive. The estimated traffic for this period up to January

7, 1849, is thus :                                         Tons.

                                   4,651

+divided into 86,972 288=87,260 trains. The average weight per train is

therefore only 14*2 tons.

   The total load transferred per annum on the average was 309,659^ tons.
The half of this=154,829f tons was therefore transferred over each length

of rail annually.
--104 REPORT 1849.

   The total abrasion on 30 yards of rail we have noted at 59,170 grs. in
four years, or 14,792"5 grs. per annum, which again is equal to 493*08
grs. per yard per annum. This is equivalent to '00318 gr. of iron abraded
per ton per yard, or to 1760 X -003 18 =5-597 gr. per ton per mile, or

nearly 5'6 grs. per ton per mile.
    This result corresponds closely with that of the second experiment on the

Dublin and Kingstown line, from which we may remark, that altiiough the

average weigiit per train in this instance is only about one-half that of the
Dublin and Kingstown line, yet that the abrasion is nearly as great, proving
that traffic over the same rails in both directions exercises a destructive effect
upon the molecular constitution of the iron, which is equal with trains of a
given w^eight to that produced by trains of double the weight always moving
in the one direction only, or in other words, that ivith equal rolling loads
t/ie destruction of the rails by abrasion is doubled by running the traffic in

both directions over the same rails. Owing to the fact that the piston car-
riage on atmospheric railways has to open the valve, there is rather more
pressure exei'cised by this carriage upon the rails than is due solely to its
weight, but this excess is so small as not to affect the question. Hence the
excess of abrasion nuist be due to the motion in opposite directions con-
tinually splitting up the topmost fibres of the iron, which have been partially
laminated and rolled out by the former train in the contrary direction of

motion.

   Having now arrived at the last of these prolonged experiments, we may
combine the results into one table of the 1st and 2nd experiments on the
Kingstown line, and of that on the Dalkey line, rejecting that on the Ulster
as dubious, and reducing all the results to one common period of 365 days,

or one year.

   It is probable that the rate of this decrease will be more and more slow,
and at a certain point of hardness reached by the condensation of the iron of
the rail due to the rolling load, it will become and continue constant.

   2nd. The corrosion both in use and out of use appears also to decrease
gradually upon the Kingstown line. The absolute corrosion in botii cases is
greater on the Dalkey line, owing to the increased dampness of the situation
in which the rails were necessarily placed for experiment upon it, viz. iu a
shallow cutting with wet bottom.

   3rd. The difference between the corrosion in use and out of use, which

exists throughout all the experiments, is also a constantly decreasing one.
    For purposes of general comparison, and of comparison with the corrosion

of rails made of other makes or qualities of iron than those of the present
experiments, it will be convenient to arrange the following table of the
amounts of corrosion, both in and out of use, reduced to one square foot of
corroded surface, and for a term of one year.

   The total exposed surface of the Dublin and Kingstown rail per lineal
yard, is=2'88 square feet, but from this we have to deduct the top surface
of the rail, which is rolled over in contact with the wheels, and which, being
preserved bright, does not corrode, being 1*75 inch wide, which leaves a
net surface of corrosion of 2"4"i square feet per yard for the rails in use, and

of 2'88 square feet per yard for the rails out of use as above.

   Taking the results of Table No. 4, therefore, we are enabled to deduce

Table No. 5, which gives the corrosion in each case per square foot of sur-
face of rail, and these results are then comparable with those of Table 15 of

my Third Report on the Corrosion of Iron and Steel, &c., Transactions of

British Association, and indeed comparable (by the aid of the standard bar
as referred to in those reports) with all other results as to corrosion detailed

therein, so that these experiments as to the corrosion of railway bars, may be
hereafter extended or applied by others to rails rolled of any other make of

iron whatever.

chimneys, accelerate corrosion ; still the difference is so remarkable, as to

induce the suspicion, that there are some forces engaged which more or less

retard the corrosion of iron when exposed in railway bars, in every condition,

i. e. whether travelled over or not. Thus in one year, the losses by corrosion

on one square foot of surface of the following sorts of iron exposed in the

  We now return to detail the examination made of the rails when just

removed from the Kingstown Railway, as to their magnetic condition after

the first exposure thereon, and also after their exposure upon the Dalkey line.

For this purpose the railway bars were brought into an open piece of level

ground, remote from any masses of iron or other causes of magnetic disturb-

ance                        and at some considerable distance from where they lay, a triangle and
                         ;

purchase-blocks were so arranged, that any one bar could be suspended bj'-

the middle of its length in a horizontal position ; the length of the bar being
preserved either in the magnetic meridian or at right angles to it, or could

be tilted up vertically, or in the line of the dip.

Each bar was first placed horizontally in the magnetic meridian by a line

parallel therewith, previously marked out on the ground by two distant ob-

Ajects.                     Kater's compass of delicate adjustment was now brought to rest,

and then advanced slowly parallel with the bar towards the end facing the

magnetic north, and the action of the bar on the needle noted. The compass

was then brought back to the southern face or end of the bar, and the action

also noted. The bar was then turned horizontally end for end, and similar

experiments made ; and lastly, the bar being turned round 90°, and thus being
at right angles to the magnetic meridian, similar trials were made for each

end. By this means the induced polarity by terrestrial magnetism was made

evident, and separated from the idio-polarity, or the magnetism permanently

proper to the bar.

Lastly, each bar was examined as to the position of the neutral point or

points betwixt the poles, by carrying the compass slowly along its length

while the bar was at right angles to the magnetic meridian, and observing
when the needle was neither deflected to the east nor to the west, but con-

tinued to point to the magnetic north station mark, the point opposite to

which was the neutral one. W'ith a longer needle of greater delicacy, and

suspended within a glass cylinder from silk fibres, examination was made as

to the state of polarity of each bar, with reference to the depth of the rail,

the fop edge while in use being always uppermost and the bar horizontal.

These experiments were made for every bar; it will not be necessary to

describe the individual results in detail, but give them generally.

  --WhenT/ie set No. 1 , not travelled over, and exposed to coriosion alone.

examined after exposure on the Kingstown line, they showed strong polarity

by terrestrial induction, but very slight idio-polarity. Some of the bars,

however, when placed in the magnetic meridian, showed a feeble permanent

When this bar and some others were turned at right angles to the mag-

netic meridian, and examined with the suspended needle moved vertically

up and down before their extremities, the existence of two poles at each end

of the bar was made evident ; thus the needle                                                                                                                                          Fig. 8.

was quiescent at a certain point in the depth
of the bar when held thus opposite the end j

of it, but was attracted or repelled in op-
                                                                                                                                                                                   ^^

posite directions when above or below this ]

point.

    This fact was subsequently ascertained to apply to all the railway bars ;

that is to say, a railway bar when polar is a magnet of such thickness, that

it presents poles at its solid angles, not only with reference to length, but to
depth, these poles being always of unequal intensity, the bar being in fact in

the predicament of a cube or large paralielopiped of iron when exposed to

magnetic induction. Hence the bar last adverted to with three neutral points
had in fact sixteen poles distributed along its length ; eight on the top and

eight on the bottom flange or edge, and alternately of greater and of less in-

tensity along the same edge, thus :

                                     Fig. 9.

These secondary poles, or those of depth, were not altogether due to ter-

restrial induction, as they preserved their signs, though with diminished

intensity, when the bar was turned upside down, i. e. when the top edge

became the lower, the direction and ends of the bar remaining unmoved, but

they are probably due to induction within the bar itself.

Similar phenomena to the above present themselves in the same bars when

examined after removal from the Dalkey line, as was to have been expected,

there being no change in their condition in either case, viz. not having been

travelled over on either line.

   The set No. 2, not coated, and exposed both to oxidation and to abrasion of
traffic, when examined in the same way, after experiment on the Kingstown

line, all proved to be powerfully magnetic with polarity ; the idio-polarity

being almost in every case suflSciently intense to neutralize or reverse the po-

larity of terrestrial induction. In almost every instance there were two

well-defined poles at the extremities of the bars, with one neutral point

between.

In every rail the S. pole of the bar was found in the direction in which

Nowoff from it.  the traffic passed over these bars in a direction from S.E. to

N.W., and hence the direction of permanent polarity conferred upon the bar,

coincides with the direction (in this instance at least) in which the traffic

rolled over it.

The same bars when examined after removal from the Dalkey line (where

it will be remembered the traffic is in both directions from W.N. W. to E.S.E.

and vice versa, and the polarity of the bars acquired on the Kingstown line

having been afterwards destroyed by heating them all to redness), were

found powerfully idio-polar ; some of the bars much more so than in the

former case, so as to be able, Avhen brought into the direction of dip, and thus

terrestrial induction made to aggrandize the idio-polarity, to lift and sustain
a common sewing-needle ; they had all two well-defined poles at the extremities

and one neutral point, but the poles were seldom of quite the same intensity.

    The set No. 3, viz. those coated with coal-tar and exposed to abrasion of
traffic only, when submitted to a similar examination, present quite the

same characters; each bar was powerfully idio-polar, with two well-defined

poles of slightly unequal intensity and one neutral point, All the pheno-
mena of terrestrial induction could of course be made evident with these as

well as the other sets.

   What is very remarkable, the intensity of magnetic polarity was quite as

great in those bars and in the set No. 2 after removal from the Dalkey line,
where they were travelled over in both directions, as after removal from the

Kingstown, where travelled over only in one. In the latter case however the

direction of the poles of each bar, as it lay in the line of railway, was that
due to terrestrial induction, i. e. the south pole of the bar faced the north

pole of the earth and vice versa ; the opposite was the case with the bars on
the Kingstown line of set No. 2, as already detailed.

   These facts are sufficient wholly to overturn the views suggested by Mr.

Nasmyth, in his letter already given, as to the peculiar effects of traffic in
one or in both directions.

In connexion with this subject, I have also examined the magnetic con-

dition of old wheels and axles that have run for a considerable time on rail-

ways. In every case these ran more or less in both directions ; the results

presented are very perplexing and variable, but in general I find the axle is
more or less idio-polar. The wheel also is very often feebly idio-polar, the

poles being at the nave and periphery ; but when a pair of wheels and their own

axle stand on the rails in the usual position, the axle being idio-polar, then

by induction from the axle and by terrestrial induction conspiring, a tolerably

distinct polarity of the whole wheel i^ produced, the nave presenting a pole
opposite to that of its own end of the axle, and a pole opposite to this being

found opposite the extremity       Fig. 10.
of every spoke round the

wheel-tire orperiphery: thus

when the wheel is rolled

along the rails where the lat-

ter have been long in use and

are themselves polar, the in-

tensity varies with the posi-

tion of the wheel over a given

length of rail, and may be a
maximum when the wheel

rests over a joint beween two

rails, viz. over the polar extre-

mities of the contiguous rails.

I endeavoured to ascertain whetiier the total intensity of the six bars consti-

tuting the set exposed to abrasion only, or of the six bars exposed to abrasion

and corrosion, was the greater, but not having a suitably mounted mag-

netometer, I was unable to satisfy myself fully ; so far as my trials went,

however, there seemed but little difference appreciable in either case, and

that equally so whether the two diffierent sets were rolled over both ways, or

only in one direction.

I ascertained also that the polarity of each bar, as it lies in the line of

railway, is somewhat increased in intensity by induction from the bar lying

parallel to it in the opposite side of the railway line. This effect however

is greater or less with the same breadth of gauge, dependent upon the po-
sition of the meeting-points of tlie ends of the rails, which are sometimes
nearly opposite across the line, but often not so, i. e. the pole of one length
of rail is opposite nearly to the neutral point of the rail at the other side of

the railway.

    It is manifest from what precedes, that the polar intensity of any given
rail in a line of railway depends, not only upon the rolling traffic it is exposed
to, but also upon the direction of the line of railway itself; that the bars in
railways running north and south are in a higher state of magnetism, other
things being the same, than in those running east and west, by the eft'ects of

terrestrial induction.

    In long lengths of railway, running east and west especially, but in some
degree in every direction, there are constant thermo-electric currents tra-
versing the rails from end to end, due to changes in atmospheric temperature,
between day and night, &c. : such currents have been already noticed by Mr.
William Barlow as perpetually traversing the wires of the electric telegraph,
and such currents may occasionally be due to other causes of disturbance of
the equilibrium of terrestrial electricity than those due to temperature.

    But the passage of locomotive engines over railways is a cause of electric
currents traversing the bars of a much more important and formidable cha-
 racter. If a galvanometer be placed in connexion with a rail forming part
of a line of way, and also with the earth at some distance, or with the rails
at a distant point in advance, powerful deflections are produced by the ap-
 proach of a locomotive engine, or even by the rolling along of a heavy train with-
 out an engine ; in the latter case the effects are comparatively feeble, and appear
 to be due to the repeated compressions and rendings of crystallized surfaces,
 to which the surfaces rolling and rolled on are subjected ; an action shown
 by Becquerel and others, to be an efficient producer of electric disturbance ;
 but in the case of the locomotive engine, a torrent of electric force is let
 loose and finds its way into the earth along the rails, which, from the im-
 perfect contact of their junctions, permit it to pass along the line with diffi-
 culty, and thus the equilibrium is gradually restored in great part through
 the chairs, fastenings and ballast, the resistance being greatest where the line

 is laid on longitudinal sleepers, and these are quite dry.
     There can be little doubt, that if a portion of railway were insulated to-

 lerably from beneath on wood, and a wood block inserted at given points, so
 as to cut ofi" a segment of rails from the line, powerful sparks would flash
 from the rails and train as it passed over this portion of the railway. Indeed
 all this may be inferred from the well-known facts of the hydro-electric

 machine.
     These electrical effects of locomotive engines in motion are somewhat

 uncertain, owing to the saline contents of the water usually employed fre-

 quently interfering ; but after an engine has run a considerable distance
 without stopping, and the passages of efflux steam have become cleaned by

 its continued passage, and the engine does not prime, the evolution of elec-

  tricityJs always considerable.

     As each railway bar may be viewed in the light of a conductor through
  which currents of electricity of variable intensity and quantity are per-

  petually flowing, it is obvious that magnetic currents are also in constant

 circulation round each bar and at right angles to its length : thus if upon
 the bar a, b an engine run over from south to north, the north end of a mag-

 netic needle placed above the rail will be deflected to the left-hand, and vice

  versci.

110 REPORT-- 1849.

    Again, on the other hand, the existence of polarity of variable magnetic
intensity in every rail involves the existence of electric currents circulating

                                                                 Fig. 11.

round the bars, in accordance with the facts pointed out so well by Dr. Fa-

raday. And in accordance with the recent experiments of Mr. Grove, the

constantly recurrent induction of magnetism of great intensity in each rail
involves a constant change of temperature in the rail, due to this cause alone,
and probably an equally constant change in the molecular arrangement of

its particles.

    Such are the facts, so far as I have been enabled to observe them, of the
complex relations to electricity, magnetism, and terrestrial temperature of
railway bars ; they fail to throw any direct light upon the immediate subject of
our inquiry, but since the closest relationship has been proved to subsist be-
tween all these molecular forces, and especially since the later refined re-
searches of Faraday and Pliicker have shown that changes in the electrical
or magnetic state of solids is attended with an instantaneous change in the
relative groupings of their molecules, and knowing beforehand that chemical
action in its most ordinary circumstances is powerfully influenced and modi-
fied by the state of grouping, or of aggregation of these molecules, it seems
by no means improbable that the chemical action of air and moisture upon
the iron of railway bars may be more or less modified by the electrical and
magnetic forces that specially apply to them. To reduce this to certainty,
demands experiments conducted, not after the manner or with the immediate
object of those before us, but by refined research in the physico-chemical

laboratory.

   Interesting as such researches may be to science, and to which the facts
here recorded may perhaps serve as finger-posts at the commencement of the

way, they are not of very high value to the practical railway engineer, inas-

much as we have already found that the destruction of railway bars by cor-
rosion is small in comparison with that by traffic. Nor are we obliged to

rest in any vague speculation to find efficient causes sufficient to account
for the real difference that we have established between the corrosion of the
same railway bar in use and out of use.

   The three principal causes to which I attribute this difference are,
   1st. The top surface of a railway bar in use is constantly preserved in a
state of perfect cleanness, polish, and freedom from oxidation, while the re-
mainder of the bar is rough, coated originally with black oxide (Ham-
merschlag) and soon after with red rust (peroxide and basic salts).
   Not only is every metal electro-positive to its own oxides, but, as esta-
blished in mySecondReporton theAction of Air andWateronIron(sec.242),
a mass of metal, partially polished and partly rough, is primarily corroded on
the rough portion. Hence then a railway bar while in use is constantly pre-
served from rusting by the presence of its polished top-surface. Such polished
surface has no existence upon the rail out of use.
   2nd. The upper portion of the rail in use is rapidly condensed and hard-
ened by the rolling of traffic over it ; and I have also shown in the same

reports, that all other circumstances being the same, the rate of corrosion of
                           ON RAILWAY BAR CORROSION.          Ill

any iron depends upon its density, and is less in proportion as this is ren-

dered greater by mechanical means.

3rd. As every metal is positive to its own oxides, the adherent coat of rust

upon iron, while it remains, powerfully promotes the corrosion of the metal

beneath, and this in a greater degree in proportion as the rust adherent is of

greater antiquity, inasmuch as it has been shown that the rust produced by air

and moisture, which at first contains but little peroxide (FcjOg), continues to

change slowly, and becoming more and more peroxidized, becomes more and

more electro-negative to its own base.

Now the rust formed upon a railway bar out of use continues always to

adhere to it, and thus to promote and accelerate its corrosion, while the rust

formed upon a railway bar in use is perpetually shaken off by the vibration

of traffic, and thus this source of increased chemical action is removed. Of

the extent to which this acts, we are informed by the results of the second

experiment on the Kingstown Railway, where the weight of adherent rust,

formed on removal of the bars out of use, was found to be more than four

times as great as that upon an equal surface of the bars that had been in use.

  We have found that this difference of corrosion in and out of use however

is a constantly decreasing one ; this arises from the fact that the condensation

of the top-surface of the rails ceases after it has reached a certain point de-

pendent on the maximum weight of the trains, and that after the lapse of a

considerable period a uniform coat of rust is formed upon the rails in use,

which is so firmly adherent that the vibration and wind of passing trains are

incapable of sweeping it away ; and it seems possible that after the lapse of

an extremely prolonged time, the difference between the corrosion of the

rail in use and out of use might become so small as to be perhaps insensible.

To recapitulate, then, we have found that railway bars forming part of a

long line, whether in or out of use, corrode less for equal surfaces than a

short piece of the same iron similarly exposed ; that the rails in use do cor-

rode less than those out of use ; that this difference is one decreasing with

the lapse of time ; that the absolute amount of corrosion is a source of de-

struction of the rails greatly inferior to that due to traffic; that it is highly

probable that the electrical and magnetic forces developed in the rails by

terrestrial induction and by rolling traffic, react in some way upon the che-

mical forces concerned in their corrosion ; and that therefore the direction of

lines of railway in azimuth is not wholly indifferent as respects the question

of durability of rails.

I am not aware of any information upon this subject having any character

of accuracy which I can refer to extraneous to the present report. In the

Franklin Journal, and also in Silliman's Journal, some few papers occur

giving rather long statements as to the wear of rails on the Lowell and other

American railways, as also some such in the Mining Journal (London), as

to some English lines ; as also some observations upon the abrasion of cast-
iron rails, given by Thompson in his ' Colliery Inventions and Improve-
ments.' They need not however be extracted here.

I might also extend this report to a comparison of the relations which

subsist between the surface per yard lineal exposed to corrosion, and the

strength and stiffness of the several principal forms of rail in use upon one

line                       but this can so obviously be done by the engineer for his own purpose,
                        ;

that it seems needless. It is however an element of choice in the form of

rails that appears heretofore to have been wholly neglected.

I conclude therefore with two practical suggestions, deducible from the

information we have obtained, having for object the increasing the durability

of rails, both as against traffic and corrosion. First. Of whatever quality of
--112 REPORT 1849.

iron rails are rolled, I would suggest that they should be subjected prior to
use to an uniform course of hammer hardening all over the top-surface and
sides of top flange of the rail. The effect of this would be two-fold ; the rail
will be stiffened witiioutany material reduction in ultimate strength ; its sur-
face will be hardened and polished, and hence best calculated to resist cori'o-
sion and abrasion ; and lastly, the direction of the principal axes of the crystals
of the iron, or of its "fibre," will for a small depth be changed and brought
perpendicular to the surface of the rail, by which the tendency to lamination
by rolling traffic will be greatly reduced. It will occur to any practical
engineer that machinery may be constructed with perfect facility by which
this hammer-hardening may be performed with rapidity and perfect smooth-
ness and uniformity, the bar being slowly advanced, end on, under small
hammers with suitably formed faces, driven rapidly by power. The total cost
of the operation would amount to but a trifle on a ton of rails.

   Secondly. I would suggest that all railway bars, before being laid down, should,
after having been gauged and straightened, &c., be heated to about 400° Fahr.
(but not higher, for fear of injuring the effect of the hammer-hardening),
and then coated with boiled coal-tar; this I have proved in the preceding
experiments to last for more than four years as a coating perfectly impervious
to corrosive action while constantly exposed to traffic. The outlay for this
would be very small; and if its value were no more than that after the lapse
of eight or more years, when a set of rails had to be replaced in consequence
of wear, the whole of the iron, which would have otherwise been dissipated
in rust, would be returned to the furnace to be remade, the outlay would
be well""bestowed.

   I would respectfully commend these suggestions to my professional brethren
as worthy of trial, and have now fulfilled, so far as I have been able, the

commands of the British Association, as to the corrosion and wear of rails.

      ON ELECTRICAL. OBSERVATIONS AT KEW.

    Report on the Discussion of the Electrical Observations at Kew.

                       By William Radcliff Birt.

The electrical observations made at the Observatory of the British Associa-
tion at Kew from August 1, 1843, to August 8, 1848, are divisible into two

portions, one occupying a period of seventeen months, viz. from August 1843
to December 1844 both inclusive, during which the readings were taken at
sunrise, 9 a.m., 3 p.m. and sunset ; the other, a period of three years and
seven months, viz. from January 1844 to July 1848, also inclusive, during
which the readings were taken at each even hour of Greenwich mean time
as well as at sunrise and sunset. The last portion, which is by far the most
complete, furnishes, from the observations of three complete years, the materials
for deducing the diurnal and annual periods of the electrical tension. This
has accordingly claimed our first attention and forms the first section ot
Part I., which is exclusively devoted to the examination of Positive Electricity.

    The observations at sunrise and sunset, extending over the entire period
of the five years, from the variability of the epoch of observation, require a
separate discussion ; they accordingly form the subject of the second section ;
and the third section is occupied with a discussion of the observations during

the first seventeen months.

    Scattered over the entire period of the five years we have several readings
of negative electricity, and as they are evidently accompanied by meteorolo-
gical phsenomena of a peculiar and unmistakeable character which strongly
 indicate them to be the results of disturbances, rather than their forming any
 portion of a regular progression of the electric signs, they have also been

 separately discussed. Their discussion forms Part II. of this Report.

                    Part I.--POSITIVE ELECTRICITY.

Section I.--Discussion of Positive Readings during the Years 1845, 1846
                                                and 1847.

   Durin'^the years 1845, 1846 and 1847, 10,526 observations were recorded
in the Journal", including the indications of the night-registenng apparatus.

Of these

                      10,176 were positive
                          324 ,, negative, and
                            26 ,, not employed in the discussion

       10,326

   In the following table are recorded the twenty-six unemployed readings

which were positive; they were in almost every case either preceded or suc-
ceedc»l by negative readings, from which it was concluded that they resulted

more from a disturbance in the usual electrical condition of the atmosphere,
than that they formed a part of its regular diurnal march : from these cir-
cumstances, connected with the high tensions mostly exhibited, it was appre-
hended the results would have been materially affected by employing them

in the investigation.

   In the following discussion, readings occasionally higher than some ot those

recorded below have been employed, but they have evidently formed either

--114 REPORT 1849.

a part of a regular diurnal movement, or have occurred at such hours as are

generally distinguished bj- exhibiting an increase of tension. It was con-

sequently considered that a rejection of them would to a certain extent in-
terfere with the development of the diurnal and annual curves. The values

in the table, as well as throughout the discussion, are recorded in terms of

Volta's electrometer No. 1. The observations were taken with Henley's in-

strument, 1 degree of which has been approximately considered to be equal
to 100 divisions of Volta No. 1 *.

  * On the 13th and 14th of July 1849, the reporter attended at the observatory for the

purpose of comparing the electrometers, and especially determining the value of the readings
of Henley's electrometer in terms of Volta's standard No. 1. The following are the results of
the comparison. It appears from upwards of two hundred readings, the charge varying be-
tween 50 div. and 110 div. of Volta No. 1 as read from the scale of the No. 2 electrometer,
that the mode of reading adopted by the observer at Kew, during the five years, was to bring
the eye into such a position that the inner edge of the straw should coincide with the division

read on the ivory arc of the instrument. By this mode of reading, 1° of Henley would very

nearly equal in value 100 div. of Volta ; this value has accordingly been retained, as most in
accordance with the mode of reading adopted. It will be however evident that the true read-
ing would be given, not by either edge of the straw, but by the centre: the diameter of the
straw is equal to 2°; consequently when the inner edge coincides with 1°, the true reading must
be 2°. From this it is clear that the values in the following discussion are relatively too high,
but they will not interfere with the results further than by expanding the curves ; the inflexions,
points of maxima and minima, and the general form of the curves, will be the same, conse-
quently the results derived from these curves will be unaffected. It would have been desirable
to have applied a correction for this dift'erence in the mode of reading, had not a greater dif-
ficulty presented itself in the dissimilarity of the construction of the two instruments, by which
the values at diff'erent parts of the scale of Henley's instrument acquire different values in terms
of Volta's instrument. The small extent of range common to both instruments renders it very
difficult to express the higlier readings of Henley at all accurately in terms of Volta. It is
therefore consideied best under the circumstances to retain the values as given in the tables,
especially as the results are not materially interfered with ; and endeavour to point out a mode
by which the readings of Henley's instrument may be accurately expressed in terms of Volta,
as well as to indicate a more precise method of observation.

    The standard electrometer No. 1 of Volta is so constructed that a given electric force causes
a pair of straws of a known weight to diverge. Their divergence is measured on a circular arc
of the same radius as the length of the straws, which is so graduated as to indicate half the
distance in arc between the extremities of the straws in half- Parisian lines, each of the divi-
sions, which are at equal distances from each other, being equal to half a line. It is clear from
this construction of instrument, that upon measuring the distance between the straws in a
right line, the sine of half the angle subtended by the extremities of the straws is proportional

to the electric tension of the charge.

    The electrometer No. 2 is so constructed that each division is exactly equal to five of No. I,
and the circular arc is graduated to read at once the electric tension in terms of No. 1. The
difference in the electrometers consists in the straws of No. 2 being heavier than those of No. 1,
in such a proportion as to increase the value of the readings in the ratio above mentioned. As in
No. 1 the sine of half the angle of divergence is proportional to the tension, so in No. 2 precisely
the same value of the tension obtains, viz. the sine of half the angle of divergence, the linear
value of the sine itself being proportional to its value in No. 1 for the same force : thus, a force
that would diverge the straws in No. 1 to an angle of 30° would only open them in No. 2 to an
angle of 6 , and in each instrument the sines of 15° and 3° respectively would represent the
same force. There is however no necessity to employ such a determination of the force, the
graduation of each instrument being amply sufficient for the purpose.

    The Henley's electrometer is so constructed that the force is measured by a straw termi-
nating in a pith-ball, which together constitute a pendulum that is inserted in a ball working
by two fine steel pivots. This pendulum diverges by the electric force from the perpendicular,
the angular amount of divergence being measured by a quadrant, graduated to degrees of the
circle on an ivory scale. As it is thus used, the readings are not very readily comparable with
those of the Volta's electrometers, in consequence of the Henley readings being in arc, while
those of Volta are in linear measure. This difficulty may however be readily overcome by
immediately measuring the sine of the angle of divergence, which in this instrument is a
measure of the electric tension. Nothing further would be required than to place the elec-
trometer in a convenient position for observation by a theodolite, which should be firmly fixed
at a known distance from it. The centre of the azimuth circle should be in the precise verti*
                                                        ;

             ON ELECTRICAL OBSERVATIONS AT KEVV.               115

cal plane of the centre of the pith-ball when nnelectiified, and should be at such a distance
                                that the arc measured by it may be of sufficient range to determine

                   ]. the length of the sine with tolerable accuracy. The distance between

             the centres of the azimuth circle and pith-ball should, if possible, be

             of such a value in half- Parisian lines as to facilitate tlie formation of a

             table for obtaining the value of the sine in half-Parisian lines by in-

             spection, so that a simple observation of the bisection of the right and

             left limbs of the pith-ball, which of course would be in arc, and the
             deduced divergence in arc of its centre from iis plane of rest when

             unelectrified, would, with the assistance of the table, give at once the

             electric tension in half- Parisian lines; and these readings might readily

             be converted into terms of Volta's electrometer No. 1, by properly

             adjusting the straw, pith-ball, &c. to a definite value, so that a diver-

             gence of lialf a Parisian line may be equivalent to a certain number of

             divisions of Volta's standard electrometer. In this way, it is clear, the
             tensions might be expressed in terms of Volta's standard up to 90°

             of Henley without the necessity of applying corrections, unless such

             corrections should be rendered necessary from the effects of gravity on

             the pendulum.

             The whole matter may be rendered plain by the annexed diagram

             A(fig. 1). Let represent the centre of the pith-ball when unelectrified,

             and B the centre of the azimuth circle of the theodolite. The di-

             stance B A will form the base of a i-ight-angled triangle, of which the

             P--divergence of the pendulum  A' is the perpendicular. When the

             instrument is electrified, the pith-ball diverges in a plane at right
             angles to the plane passing through its centre when unelectrified,

             and that of the azimuth circle ; or in other words, the plane of its

             motion passes vertically through the line A C, and is at right angles
             to the vertical plane passing through the line A B. If now the
             theodolite is so adjusted that the limbs of the pith-ball may be

             bisected, the azimuth circle will measure in arc the sine of the angle

                                  of divergence, and thus we have given the side and angles of a right-

            --** angled triangle from which the linear measure of the divergence may

readily be deduced. The analogy is as follows: Radius is to the tangent of the horizontal
angle, as the distance between the centres of the pith-ball and azimuth circle is to the

divergence.  =Suppose the distance A B

                                        500 half-lines

             The azimuthal angle  = 6°;

             Then Log AB          = 2-C98970

             ,, Log tan 6°        = 9-021620

             ,, Log52-55-H        = 1-720590

Consequently the divergence is equal to 52-55 half-Parisian lines in a plane at right angles to
the vertical plane passing through the above-mentioned centres.

   N.B. The diagram is constructed in accordance with the above example.

   AIt is not absolutely necessary to employ a theodolite. telescope furnished with cross vfires

firmly fixed on a support having its centre of azimuthal motion at a known constant and in-
variable distance from the centre of the pith-ball when unelectrified, the angle being measured
by an arm sufficiently extended to include the angle subtended by the pendulum when de-
flected from the perpendicular 90°, will be sufficient. A vertical motion should be given to the
telescope by rackwork by which it can be raised to the level of the pith-ball when electrified,
and it should be furnished with a level, Sec. to ensure horizontality.

   The above remarks have reference to the expression of the electric tension in the linear

terms adopted by Volta, viz. half-Paris lines, and are principally applicable to the retention
of Volta's notation so far as the measurement of the sine of the angle of divergence from the per-
pendicular is concerned ; but Mr. Ronalds has suggested a much better mode of connecting the

readings of the two instruments, viz. a conversion of the readings of Volta's electrometer (half

Paris lines) into measures of arc, so that the readings of the three instruments, Volta No. 1,

Volta No. 2, and Henley, and even of the discharger, may all be expressed in degrees of the
circle, the sines of which are of course readily ascertainable.

rises above 100 div. of Volta No. 1, except at particular hours ; this will

form a subject of discussion further on ; in the meantime it enables us to
gain some insight into the reason of the diurnal period during the summer
months in each year being more in accordance with itself than that of the

entire year. The defect of the early morning hours is not so great as the

excess at 10 p.m.; consequently the mean line cuts the entire curve more

equably, exhibiting the two maxima above, and the two minima below it.

This doubtless arises from the very few tensions above 50 div. that occur

during the summer nights, as well as from the observations at 6 a.m., which

Weare generally low.  have therefore a period that differs but little, if any,

from the natural progression of the electrical tension : 2 a.m. is the epoch of

the principal minimum; the tension gradually rises from this hour until 10a.m.,

the forenoon maximum ; the succeeding minimum occurs at noon, the de-

cline in the two hours being 13*3 div. ; the rise is then very slow and gradual

until 4 p.m., only 1*8 div. ; at 6 p.m. the tension increases and mounts rapidly

until 10 P.M., the principal maximum; the decline is then very considerable

from 10 P.M. to midnight.

Table XVTII. exhibits the mean monthly electrical tension at each ob-

servation-hour deduced from the observations of three months, also the

mean summer, winter, and yearly tensions deduced from the observations of
three summers, winters, and years. The last line in the table to which the
word " Means " is prefixed, exhibits the mean tension in each month as de-
duced from all the separate monthly observations ; i. e. the mean tension of

January, 150'7 div., is the result of all the January observations in the three
years. The same thing holds good of the seasonal and yearly mean ten-

sions.

   The curves projected from these numbers will be found on Plate IX.
   The tensions that enter into the preceding discussion range between 2

div. and 2000 div. in terms of Volta's standard electrometer No. 1. It has

however been considered that tensions above 100 div. of this electrometer,

or those measured by Henley's instrument, are not susceptible of that accu-

racy of determination which is requisite in the deduction of results, such as
characterize those of modern science. In addition to this, it is apprehended
that the electrical tension known more particularly as the tension of serene

weather, seldom (if at all) rises above 100 div., although there may be move-

ments indicated by Henley's instrument which partake of the character of

those of serene weather.

   In immediate reference to these points, and considerably elucidating them,
remarks occur, either in the body of the Journal or in the notes and addenda

accompanying it. In the description of the instruments at Kew published in

the volume for IS^^ (Reports, 1844, p. 124), the following occurs in refer-

ence to Henley's instrument :
   " This electrometer has seldom been observed until the Volta No. 2 had

risen beyond 90° (in terms of the first, i. e. 18 lines x 5) ; and since the un-
certainty and difficulty of measuring the higher tensions increase in a rapid

ratio with the increments of tension owing to unavoidable and sometimes

almost imperceptible ' spirtings,' and particularly to the falling of rain from

Nthe dish or funnel (fig. 2), proportionably less confidence must, of course,

be placed in our notations of such tensions by means of this instrument."

In the account of the experiments having reference to the employment of

photographic methods for self-registering the indications of the instruments,
which is appended to the volume of observations 1845 and 1846, we have
the following remark relative to the objection of the Astronomer Royal as to

the non-registry of the kind of electricity :
    " I had not of course overlooked the objection as to not registering the

kind of electricity, but as every former observer of the periodical electricity

of serene weather, (i. e.) that alone which is susceptible of exact measure-
ment, and that which is by far the most important and interesting, had ar-

  rived  at  the  same  conclusion  as  myself,  (viz.)  that  it  is  positive,  and  that  the

,

exceptions to this law are extremely rare, and always accompanied by an easily

distinguished feature in meteorology."

In the above extracts we have clearly a restriction of the electricity of

seretie weather to a comparatively low tension, and that the higher tensions,
although more difficult to measure accurately, are not near so important as

 those which characterize serene weather. In immediate connection with this

 comparatively low tension we have the following remark, recorded on June 23,
: 1844 :--

     " The weather of this day, considered as serene, has been rather remark-
 able. The signs a little after sunrise were the highestybr such weather that
 we have had. The thermometer at nine stood at75'5, the max. also, and the

 barometer at 29"938. The atmosphere quite clear ; the clouds were light,
128 REPORT--1849.

rather fleecy, roundish and somewhat detached. Wind N.E. and E., its force
about 500 grms. Daniell's hygrometer marked 20° of dryness."

   At sunrise the electric tension was registered at 65 div. Volta No. 1 . From
this it appears that a tension of 65 div. at sunrise is considered as liigh for
serene weather, and it might be inferred that tensions of a higher value indi-
cated some other exciting cause than that which we contemplate as exciting

the electricity of serene weather.

   In the explanations and remarks concerning the Journal, Sac. at Kew, pub-
lished in the Report for 1844, p. ISO, a serene day is defined as follows : " In

Nthe column is pointed out (by the letter S) such days as generally occur

when the positive charge rises after sunrise, falls early in the afternoon, and
rises again in the evening, accompanied by what is commonly understood by
the term ' fine weather ;' but there are exceptions to this (rather vague) de-
finition, which I believe require some habit, and an acquaintance with the
observations of Monier and others, particularly Beccaria, to appreciate."

   By glancing at the curves on pages 1 19 and 122, to which attention has been

solicited, it will be seen that the movements, as deduced from the observa-
tions in individual years and seasons, as well as those from the entire number
during the three years, are perfectly in accordance with the movements in
serene weather, and it is only the I'estriction to which allusion has been made
that suggests the probability of the higher tensions being due to a different

exciting cause than that of the electricity of serene weather. In searching

for such a cause among the records preserved in the Journal, we are struck
with the fact, that in the majority of cases high tensions {i. e. those measured
by Henley's electrometer) are accompanied by fog ; and this suggests that it
is not improbable that these high tensions may be more or less direct mea-
sures of the electricit)', not of the atmosphere, but of the condensed aqueous
vapour enveloping the collecting lanthorn. Of course the atmospheric

electricity, as contradistinguished from that of the condensed aqueous vapour,
will be mixed with it, and the conductor will be charged from two different
sources, the atmospheric electricity exhibiting by far the smallest amount,
and in cases of high charges forming probably but a very small proportion
of the whole. There does not appear to be any direct means of separating

these tensions ; for if we take the hiffh numbers, a small proportion, as we
have already said, must appertain to " atmospheric electricity ;" and if we
take the loto numbers as giving a more accurate measure of this element, on
some occasions and especially at certain hours, the tensions exhibited may

be those produced by the presence of aqueous vapour either in an invisible
or condensed state, so that a degree of uncertainty as to the true forms of
either of these diurnal curves must necessarily exist. Again, it is difficult to
determine the point at which to separate the high from the low tensions ; the
uncertainty attendant on the readings of Henley's electrometer, combined
with the electricity which alone is susceptible of exact measurement, tends
greatly to place all readings of Henley's instrument in the category of high
tensions. As a first attempt to separate the high from the low tensions, 1°
of Henley equal to 100 div. of Volta No. 1 was regarded as the separating
point; but it soon became apparent that readings lower than 100 div. had an
equal claim to be regarded as high, indications being afforded that they were
measures rather of the electricity of aqueous vapour than of the atmosphere.
The observations of three or four months Mere discussed in this manner, but
the curves of low tension presenting very anomalous characters, the mean
readings increasing very considerably towards 8 p.m. led to their abandon-
ment, and other separating points were tried from 50 div. and upwards. The
result has been that the point 60 div. has been employed in the further discus-
            ON ELECTRICAL OBSERVATIONS AT KEW.             129

sions of the observations, all readings above and including it being regarded

as high, and more or less measuring the electrical tension of aqueous vapour

either invisible or condensed ; and all readings below it being regarded as

more or less measuring the tension of " atmospheric electricity." Of course

this method is entirely tentative ; the separating point 60 div. has been arbi-

trarily fixed, and, as before observed, it is not to be expected that the curves

furnished will be true representatives of natural phaenomena, when we come

to contemplate the two different sources from which the conductor is sup-
posed to be charged ; nevertheless it may not be without its use in assisting us
to devise some mode by Avhich the two tensions may be effectually separated,

either by some subsidiary observations and computations by which the elec-

trical tension of the aqueous vapour may be disengaged from the aggregate

tension as exhibited by the electrometers, or by directly observing the elec-

trical tension of the vapour itself.

sions. This seems at once to indicate the variability of any point that may

be fixed on for the purpose of separating the two. Uniformity of curve
clearly points out uniformity of action, and in endeavouring to obtain a
knowledge of the action of the electricity of serene weather on the conductor
and electrometers, it is to be presumed that it is to a great extent uniform
and regular, and that consequently the curves will exhibit such uniformity
and regularity among themselves. This then, in the absence of some direct
means of measuring either the electricity of serene weather or of aqueous
vapour, must be our principal guide in endeavouring to separate them ; and
although on some occasions greater uniformity may be obtained by either
including or excluding particular tensions, yet upon the whole great uncer-
tainty must prevail, if we attempt to vary the point of separation without
more conclusive data than the mere uniformity of curve.

rendered more apparent in the summer than during the entire year. It is

important here to remark, that the results obtained by separating the sum-
mer observations from those of the entire year below 60 div. are of an oppo-
site character to those obtained by dividing the aggregate observations into
summer and winter series. In the case of the aggregate observations we
found the summer curves representing the diurnal march, less in extent and

less abrupt in their character than those of the entire year. On the con-
trary, we find the summer observations of low tension rather bolder in their

character and of greater range than those of the entire year. In the former

case, that of the aggregate observations, the summer readings were as a mass
much lower than those of the winter ; there were also a much greater num-

ber that would have especial reference to serene iveather than of those in the

winter, and these circumstances would reduce the summer curves to the form

in which we find them. When however we contemplate the tensions below

60 div., there is nothing cut oft' in the summer from those furnishing the re-
sults of the year, the whole of the observations up to and including 59 div.
finding entry at all seasons ; but we have a much greater number of low ten-
sions during the summer than in the winter, so that a greater portion of the

entire phaenomena is as it were compressed into the lower readings, and ma-
nifests itself by expanding the summer curves as compared with those of the

entire year rather than contracting them.

ON ELECTRICAL OBSERVATIONS AT KEW.  135

ence to which we particularly solicit attention is the augmentation in the
summer curves of low tension of the forenoon and evening maxima, and their
contraction in the aggregate summer curves. This is very apparent on con-
sulting the curves. In discussing the high tension during the summer months,
this subject will be again referred to ; in the mean time we may notice here,
that upon the consideration of the high readings measuring the electrical ten-
sion of aqueous vapour, it appears probable that these maxima depend on

the presence of aqueous vapour for their development.

greater number of observations of high tensions contribute to the production

of the aggregate curve in winter than in summer, and as a consequence, the

observations on which the winter curve of low tension is based are less nu-

merous than those on which the summer curve rests. In the curve now

before us, the double progression may be considered if not entirely, as almost

disappearing ; the removal of the higher tensions appears to be accompanied

by a removal of the forenoon and evening maxima, which is replaced by a

maximum near the middle of the day. This is extremely striking when we

compare our curve with that of the winter, as deduced from all the positive

readings (page 122); in this curve the forenoon and evening maxima are

strongly developed, and the depression at 2 and 4 p.m. very distinctly marked.

It would appear, on the supposition of the high readings being measures of

the electrical tension of aqueous vapour, that in this particular winter (1845),

very few measures of such tensions occurred below 60 div., so that in the

great majority of instances, the readings below 60 div. were, more or less,

measures of atmospheric electricity. The curve itself suggests the inquiry

--Is the diurnal march of atmospheric electricity viz. that which is uncombined

--with the electrical tension characterizing, or developed by, the presence of

aqueous vapour a single progression ? In other words, does the electrical

tension of dry air present a curve having simply an ascending and descending

Webranch, the progression being in harmony with the temperature ?  shall

have occasion to refer again to this subject in a future part of this Report.

On turning our attention to the winter of 1846, we find a curve more or

less in harmony with those of the summer and entire year, and strikingly in

contrast with that of the winter of 1845. It is however to be remarked, that

the depression at 2 p.m. is but slight, and very much less than the depression

during the summer of this year ; the slight check which is apparent in the

forenoon rise, at 8 a.m., tends to give the curve an appearance of possessing

three maxima ; there is indeed a great tendency to assume somewhat of the

form of 1845, which appears to be counteracted by the greater development

of the evening maximum.

The winter curve of 1847 may be characterized as exhibiting considerable

trepidation, and consisting of alternate but very subordinate maxima and

minima, the principal of which occurs at 6 p.m. There is an evident ten-

dency to a single progression, having its maximum about the early afternoon

hours. This curve is in contrast with that of the winter of 1845, inasmuch

as the most rounded portion of the curve is developed in the evening.

   On directing our attention to the mean of the three winters, we find two

maxima, noon and evening, well-developed, but of a subdued character. The
evening maximum is the principal ; it however rises only 0*9 div. above that

at noon ; the intermediate minimum occurs at 2 p.m., and is depressed T? div.
below the principal maximum.

 138 REPORT 1849.

     This subdued character of the two maxima, as well as the comparatively
 slight depression of the included minimum, is well seen in the above table

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

 and when combined with the characters of the individual curves of each
 winter which have been noticed above, together with the approach of the
 epochs of maxima in the mean curve to each other, viz. from 10 a.m. to noon,
 and from 10 p.m. to 6 p.m., a strong probability is suggested, that were we
 able effectually to separate the high from the low tensions, not at an arbitrary
point, but in such a manner that the high tensions of summer (in all proba-
 bility lower than those of winter) should find entry in their respective de-
 partment, the result would be, that the low tensions would exhibit a single
 progression in harmony with the temperature.

     In the following table the diurnal periods for the winter, as deduced from
 the aggregate and low tensions, are placed in contrast.

suggested the probability that the forenoon and evening maxima result more
or less from the presence of aqueous vapour, either in an invisible or con-

densed state.
   3. With a view to submit this notion to the test of observation, an attempt

has been made (it must be confessed of a very rough and arbitrary character)
to separate the high from the low tensions; the point 60div. of Volta's elec-
trometer No. 1 has been provisionally assumed as the separating point, and
all tensions above it have been regarded as high, those below it the converse.
The result of this separation, so far as the low tensions are concerned, has
been to exhibit series of curves, those of the summer and entire year being
somewhat in harmony with the aggregate curves for the same periods ; the
forenoon and evening maxima however are greatly subdued, but still the
evening holds the most prominent position. The curves of the entire year
suggest the probability that a single progression would be obtained on the
removal of the two maxima.

   4. The winter curves of low tension strongly confirm this suggestion. The
approach to a single progression is very apparent in the winters of 1845 and
1847 ; the mean curve however still presents the two maxima, although their
altitudes are considerably more equal in value than any of the curves yet
contemplated ; their interval in time (6 hours) is also less than most of the
others, especially the aggregate curves, the most usual interval of these being
12 hours.

   5. ThQ salient points characterizing the two series of curves (aggregate
and low tension) are a decided development of the forenoon and evening
maxima in the aggregate, and a considerable subduing of these features with
an approach to a single progression in the low.

--WeDiurnal period above 60 div., Year.  are now prepared to enter on the

discussion of the high tensions, with the expectation that the two maxima so

prominently developed in the aggregate curves will form very decided fea-

tures in those deduced from observations above 60 div. It is necessary to

observe here, that the observations above 60 div. will not furnish the entire

diurnal march of the high tensions, none being recorded at the hours of mid-

night and 2 a.m. ; very few indeed are entered at 4 a.m. ; and those finding
entrance at 6 a.m. being mostly confined to the summer half-year, the diur-

nal march cannot be accurately said to commence until 8 a.m. In the fol-

lowing tables and curves, with the exception of those having reference to the

summer half-year, the diurnal march is given between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m.

inclusive; in the summer it commences two hours earlier.

The 2647 high readings during the three years are thus divided among the

twelve observation-hours :

periods, each being marked by a greater number of readings than the inter-
mediate period between them. Of these, the last, viz. that occurring at 6, 8
and 10 P.M., presents the greatest number of observations, and it is to be no-
ticed, that both periods coincide with the epochs of the forenoon and even-
ing maxima, as developed in the aggregate curves. This of itself indicates
that the greatest number of high readings occur at those epochs, and that
the maxima result more from a systematic occurrence of the high than the
low readings. There is a difference between the greatest number, 473, at
10 P.M., and the smallest (excluding 4 and 6 a.m.), 221, at noon of 252.

   In the above table the correspondence within certain limits as to excess
and defect, in reference to the mean of each period, is well seen ; also the
striking development of the forenoon and evening maxima in each case.

Upon the continuation of the observations of high tension at midnight, 2 and
4 A.M. in the winter, the mean line would be lowered and the corre.spondence
rendered more complete.

   Daring the day the movements do not very materially differ from those of
the aggregate curves for the same periods ; this is evident from the follow-

   la addition to the principal results of the discussion of the aggregate and
low tensions on pages 138 and 141, we find from that of the high, that the
movements of the electrical tension above 60 div. in the winter are such as
strongly to confirm the suggestion of the forenoon and evening maxima re-

sulting from such high tensions.

monthly movements are exhibited to the eye in the sheets of curves illus-

    Table LII. exhibits the mean monthly electrical tension at each obser-
vation-hour, deduced from the observations of three months ; also the mean

summer, winter and yearly tensions, deduced from the observations of three
summers, winters and years. The last line in tlie table, to which the word
" Means " is prefixed, exhibits the mean tension in each month, as deduced
from all the separate monthly observations ; /. e. the mean tension of January,

'277*1 div., is the result of all the January observations in the three years.

The same thing holds good of the seasonal and yearly mean tensions.
    The curves projected from these numbers will be found on Plate XI.

         Annual Period.

Aggregate observations One of the principal results of the foregoing dis-

cussion has been to exhibitthe march of the electrical tension duringthetwenty-
four hours constituting the period of a day. This march has been found to
present two well-defined maxima, in most instances removed from each other
by an interval of twelve hours, the principal occurring at 10 p.m. and the in-

ferior at 10 A.M. Two minima have also been ascertained, the principal at

4 A.M. and the subordinate at 4 p.m. At a particular season of the year,

there have been indications of a curve ofloio tension presenting considerable
approximation to a single progression, more or less in harmony with the curve

of temperature \ but the curve deduced from all the positive observations is

not in harmony with the curve of temperature, inasmuch as neither of the

Wemaxima corresponds with either of its turning-points.  must not however

forget, that the greatest development of electricity, so far as the diurnal
period is concerned, takes place from sunrise to 10 p.m., and includes the

period that the sun is above the horizon, and to this extent there is a con-

Wenection between the temperature and the electrical tension.  now pro-

ceed to examine those changes of the electrical tension, the period of which
is completed in the same time that the earth is occupied in making a revolu-

tion round the sun.
   The following table contains the number of readings in each month of the

three yeai's which form the bases on which the results in the succeeding
tables rest. It will be remarked, that the greatest number occur in the sum-

mer and the least in winter, the cause of which has been already referred to

as resulting from the cessation of observations at 6 a.m. during the winter

mouths.

former.

  We have among the diurnal curves one that presents a striking similarity

to that now under consideration ; it is the curve of low tension for the mean

               ^'8' ^5*             of the three winters. In our ex-

                                    from the tendency in the readings

                                    to exhibit a single pi-ogression

in contrast; they are to a great extent the converse of each other. In the

winter we find the lower tensions struggling to maintain a single progression,
which is overpowered, not by the maximum being depressed, but by the
superposition of two maxima in all probability the effects of aqueous vapour,
--156 REPORT 1849.

and it is only after we have examined the yearly and summer curves that
we find a tendency to a single progression in the winter. In the annual
curve it is the aqueous vapour that produces the single progression ; this is
very apparent in the aggregate curves. When however we remove the ten-
sions that appear more immediately to result from the presence of aqueous
vapour, this single progression is interrupted at those points at which it is
probable the influence of the vapour may be less than that of atmospheric
electricity, and at these points only we have a corresponding elevation and
depression. From the above considerations, both with regard to the diurnal
and annual periods, we apprehend that it must be concluded, that a mere
arbitrary division of the readings at any particular point will fail effectually
to separate the electrical tension into its constituents, viz. that which is de-
pendent on the solar action from that which results from the presence of
aqueous vapour : nevertheless it appears, we apprehend, highly probable that

the indications of a diurnal as well as an annual progression of atmospheric
electricity, each having an ascending and descending branch, and consequently
both being single progressions, are by no means of an uncertain character,

and that the only requisite is a suitable mode of observation in order to apply
formula, capable of effecting such a separation, whereby all electrical tensions
resulting directly from the presence of aqueous vapour may be ascertained and
 deducted from aggregate tensions as measured by the electrometers ; that the
 curves both of atmospheric electricity and the electrical tension of aqueous
 vapour may be exhibited each freed from the influence of the other, so that
 their connexion or non-connexion with other meteorological elements may

It is not so gracefully flowing in its character, although based on a greater
number of observations, thereby indicating a certain irregularity of move-
ment in the monthly increase and decrease of tension, doubtless dependent
on the accide7ital electrical character of each individual month contributing
to the mean, which accidental character, it is highly probable, is derived from
certain disturbing influences to be noticed in the next section, the effects of
which have been eliminated in the sunset curve by employing five instead

of three years' observations. The apex of the mean annual curve of 1845 to
1847 occurs a month later, but from the high tension in January it would
probably appear that from a longer series of observations, January and
February would present an equality of tension, or January would become
the superior. As it is, there is at this point a marked difference between the
curves, the later occurrence of the apex in the three years' curve destroying
to a great extent the symmetry so observable in the sunset curve. With
the exceptions just noticed, the two curves in their general course are similar,
and this would suggest that the sunset curve presents to a certain extent an
approximation to the mean annual curve of electrical tension, but in excess.
The monthly differences between the two are as follows.

as compared with the sunset mean tension, is nearly two-tenths more than it
is in summer, i. e. in summer the value of the entire mean tension is about
seven-tenths of the sunset mean tension, while in winter it is nearer nine-
tenths: there is a greater jjroportional difference in summer tiian in winter.

That this ought to obtain is evident from the consideration that the epoch of
mean tension as before-mentioned is 4 p.m. In the summer the epoch of

sunset is nearer 8 p.m., at which hour the tension is higher than at 4 p.m.,
consequently the differences of the two sets of mean tension should from this

variability of the epoch of sunset be greater in summer than in winter; and

although this is not apparent when we contemplate the differences only,
because of the great increase of tension in the winter, yet upon ascertaining

the ratios of the one series to the other it becomes apparent, the proportional
differences as we have seen being greater in summer than in winter.

The irregularity of the curve of entire mean tension renders it doubtful

whether these ratios ought to be regarded as at all sufficiently approximate

to justify tiieir employment in deducing from a series of sunset observations
the entire mean tension. The month of July presents its usual anomalous

character. October also presents a higher tension than the usual flexure of

the curve would indicate as the mean, and the displacement of the apex
renders it difficult to apply any correction at present to the February mean

nevertheless it is highly probable that a scale of corrections founded on the
distance of the epoch of sunset from that of the mean tension of the entire

year, and applied to the deductions from five or more years* observations,

would furnish a tolerable approximation to the annual period of the entire

mean tension.

The lowest curve in fig. 17 is that derived from the observations at sun-

rise ; it partakes greatly of the character of the sunset curve, the flowing of
the ascending branch only being interrupted by a greater increment of

electrical tension in November than the mean monthly increment at this

period of the year, and this would appear to be confined to November 1843

(see Table LXVI. on page 159). With this exception the sunrise curve follows

the sunset very closely, the principal difference being in range, the range of

the sunset exceeding that of sunrise by 32'2 div.

  We now come to examine the differences between the annual periods of

sunrise and sunset. These periods differ from each other not only in value,

but, as we have just observed, in range ; the consequence is an inequality of

Wethe monthly differences between them.  have already alluded to the ap-

proximation of the sunset curve to the mean annual curve derived from the

observations of three years at the twelve observation-hours, the necessary cor-

rections being comparatively small ; it is however probable that the curves of
sunrise and sunset approach much nearer in for7n to the true annual curve,

which in value would come between them, and it is also likely that both curves

may furnish true representatives of the annual period when certain corrections

are applied, the value and range of the sunrise being necessarily lower than

those of the sunset, from the observations contributing to its determination

being made at a portion of the day characterized by a. feebler development of

the electrical tension. As the tension increases towards sunset in a certain ratio

and according to a certain law which is most probably preserved during the

annual progression of the electrical tension, the consequence would be that

with increasing tensions at sunset we should have increasing differences

from summer to winter and decreasing differences from winter to summer,

and that from a sufficiently long series of observations either at sunset, sun-

rise, or any selected hour, the mean annual period might be deduced. The

following are the differences between the two series.

 numbers, apparently arising from the sunrise observations, which must render
 a more extended series necessary before a correct scale of ratios between the
  two series can be computed.

                                              December 31, 1844.

     The entire number of observations selected from the seventeen months
  constituting the earlier portion of the five years is 1897; of these 551 were
 made in the last five months of 1843, and 1346 in the year 1844. It is quite
  improbable that from a series of this kind an annual period could be deduced.
  The only epochs of observation adopted in 1843 and 1844, and continued
  during the remainder of the five years, were sunrise and sunset ; they ac-
  cordingly, of all the observations, furnish an unbroken series during the
  whole period, and as such have been already examined. The epochs of the
  i-emaining observations, 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., having been discontinued at the
  end of 1844, the results furnished by them are necessarily very partial. In
  the discussion of 1843 and 1844 they have been incorporated with those of
  sunrise and sunset, and have been employed in the first instance in deducing
  the mean tensions in Table LXXIIL, which are those of each day on which

  positive electricity 07ily as a general rule has been observed.

of the year 18+4, and indeed by the others. Compared with the entire year,
the three months, December, January and February, present by far the
greatest electrical tension. In shorter intervals than five years, the months

of maximum vary, sometimes occurring in the one or the other of the three

months ; but it appears from the entire series of five years, that the greatest

tension is confined to the three months above-named.
   The shortness of the period over which the observations at 9 a.m. and

3 P.M. extend, combined with the irregularity appertaining to the movements
of a single year, render it impracticable to deduce the relation existing be-
tween the values at those fixed epochs. Nothing further than the general
fact, confirmatory of the results deduced from the observations of IS+S to

1847, viz. that the tension in the forenoon hours is higher than that in the
afternoon, is likely to be attained. This general result, which is very striking,

is exhibited in Table LXXIX.

   During the entire period the electric tension increased from sunrise to

9 A.M. ; the mean value of this increase on the seventeen months is ^S** div.
this, however, cannot be considered as of equal importance with the mean of

the year, because the last five months of the year 184'3 contribute to its de-

--termination. With only one exception, viz. December 1814, the tension de-

clined from 9 A.M. to 3 p.m. mean value as before, 30-6 div. It is not to be
considered that the tension actually AecWnas from 9 to 3, for we have already
seen that 10 a.m. is the usual epoch of the forenoon maximum, but that the
tension on an average is lower at 3 p.m. than at 9 a.m. The table shows an
increase from 3 p.m. to sunset, with two exceptions: December 1843 and

November 1844, mean value as before, 16-0 div., with the same limitation as

to the character of the increase, 4 p.m. being the usual epoch of the after-

noon minimum. These movements are further illustrated by the next table,
which exhibits the excess or defect of the mean electrical tension above or

below the mean of each month.

There are two or three numbers in the above columns that require a

passing notice ; most of them proceed very regularly, exhibiting a higher

tension than the mean at 9 a.m. and sunset, and a lower tension at sunrise
and 3 p.m. The first exception that we have to this order is in December

1843, the mean tension at 3 p.m. being in excess, while that at sunset is in

defect. In this month the double progression disappears, the tension de-
clining 18*6 div. from 9 a.m. to sunset. The second exception occurs in

February 1844, when the tension at 3 p.m. was 4*0 div. higher than the

mean ; the usual order of progression was not interrupted ; but from Table

LXXVIl. it would appear that the increase of tension giving rise to the

anomaly just noticed, occurred principally between sunrise and 9 a.m., and

was maintained afterwards. March and April 1844 present similar excep-

tions to each  other in  the tension  at sunset being  below the  mean                           the usual
                                                                                              ;

course of progression was not, however, interrupted in either case, as appears

from Table LXXVIl. The next exception occurs in November 1844, the
tension at sunset being 22-4 div. below the mean : an inspection of Table

LXXVIl. indicates that the increase of tension, as in the former instances,

--took place between sunrise and 9 a.m., hut was not maintained afterwards

in fact a diminution instead of an increase occurred at sunset; the increase

between sunrise and 9 a.m. augmented the value of the monthly mean ten-

sion, and this, combined with the reversal of the usual movement at sunset,
occasioned the depression of the mean at sunset below the mean of the

month. In December 1844 there are no traces of the double progression,

the tension increasing from sunrise to sunset: the epoch of mean tension for

the month occurs between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. ; the signs of these mean quan-

titles are consequently reversed. It is worthy of remark that, while both the
Decembers present single progressions, the points of maxima occur at different

periods of the day. The very close approximation of the values of the means

of the seventeen months, with opposite signs at sunrise and 9 a.m. and at

3 P.M. and sunset, is very interesting, and strongly indicates a symmetrical

disposition of the epochs of mean' tension, as deduced from these four daily

Wereadings with regard to them.  have, in fact, a tension at 9 a.m. as much

above the mean as that at sunrise is Ijelow it, and the same thing occurs at

3 P.M. and sunset, tlie value being rather more than one-third of the move-

ments in the morning. The great accordance which exists in this respect

with the results already arrived at is interesting, and tends greatly to confirm

the deductions that the movements are much greater in the morning and

forenoon, that the depression in the afternoon is of a minor character, and

that the principal maximum occurs in the evening ; for although the mean
tension at sunset is loiver than that at 9 a.m. (see Table LXXVIL), yet the

occurrence of two winters in the seventeen months tends to place the epoch
of sunset nearer the afternoon minimum than it is upon the year. It should

be borne in mind, that as the epochs of sunrise and sunset are variable, those
of mean tension must be symmetrically disposed with regard to the mean

   Upon consulting Table LXXXII. it will be seen that in most instances
the months March to October inclusive present tensions considerably lower

in value than those of the remaining four months, and in connexion with this,

Table LXXXI. informs us that in June, July and August, all the tensions
were low. The means have accordingly been taken for January, February,
the eight months of low tension, November and December; they are exhibited

in the following table.

   The double progression as a general rule is very apparent in the above
tables. To the increase of tension from sunrise until 9 a.m. there are no

exceptions ; two only to the diminution of tension between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.,
and one only to the increase from 3 v.m. to sunset. The numbers are greatly

in harmony at least in this respect with the results obtained from the discus-

sion of the low tensions in the years 184-5, 1846 and 1847.

The exceptions to the double progression occurring as they do in the winter

months, viz. January max. at sunset, February max. at 9 a.m., and December

max. at sunset, are not without significance. In the discussion of the lovv

tensions in the years 1845, 1846 and 1847, we adverted to the tendency ex-

hibited by the winter curves to present a single progression ; and while we

noticed that the essential features of the double progression as exhibited in

the aggregate curves were compressed as it were into the low tensions in the

--summer months, Ave also remarked that when the higher tensions which

were evidently more intimately connected with aqueous vapour, and were

--very much more numerous in the winter, were withdrawn, the features of

the double progression were withdrawn also, and suggested that upon a mode

of directly observing the electrical tension of the aqueous vapour being

devised, it might probably be practicable to separate it from the aggregate

tension, and thus obtain a curve of a single progression representing the

march of atmospheric electricity. The tables before us are strikingly confir-

and the great tendency to a single progression in the winter is quite as con-
spicuous, if not more so than in those years. Upon the whole, the discussion

of these seventeen months very strongly confirms the results already obtained.

   One point only remains for our consideration ; it is the annual period as ex-
hibited by these numbers. It may probably be useful to particularize the

annual period of each observation-epoch, and with this view the excess or

defect as compared with the mean annual value of each epoch is given in the

following table.

ON ELECTRICAL OBSERVATIONS AT KEW.  175

   In this table the depression of the summer readings below and elevation
of the winter readings above the mean line at each epoch are very apparent.
The differences however between the annual periods at each epoch and their
approach to, or departure from, the mean is rendered more perceptible to the
eye by the annexed curves (fig. 18).

                                                              Fig. 18.

             Curves exhibiting the annual periods of the electrical tension (low) at the four observation-
                                                                     epochs for the year 1844.

   It will be apparent from these curves that the forenoon and afternoon
movements upon the annual period are strikingly different. There is con-
siderable agreement between the curves of sunrise and 9 a.m., and also
between those of 3 p.m. and sunset ; the four curves forming two pairs, each
pair presenting many features in common. The greatest difference between
the curves is noticed at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. There is more accordance between
the sunrise and sunset curves, the principal difference occurring in the opposite
movements in September. The sunrise curve is evidently modified by the

movements at 9 a.m., as is that of sunset by the movements at 3 p.m. From
this we may probably infer that the movements in the middle of the day, at
least between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., are much more irregular even in the low
tensions than at any other period. The range (see Table XCL), which is
lowest at sunrise, increases rapidly between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. the maximum ;

 and this circumstance, taken in connexion with the cloudiness of the atmo-
sphere (a subject to which we shall have occasion particularly to refer when
 treating on negative electricity), strongly indicates that the irregularity of
 movement in the middle of the day is more or less connected with the dis-

turbing influences of clouds. The curve of cloudiness, as deduced from six
years' observations at Green wicli, will be found on page 198. The approxi-
mation towards agreement in the sunrise and sunset curve is greatly in ac-
cordance with the phaenomena already noticed in the same curves from five
years' observations (see page 162); and the differences observable between
those for the year 1844 strongly confirm the remark that has been offered,

viz. that a series of five years' observations at least is necessary to eliminate

the effects of irregular movements. It may be remarked, in immediate con-
nexion with the curves of 1844, that the sunrise curve is much more in ac-
cordance with the sunset than that at 9 a.m. is with that at 3 p.m.

       Q,X ELECTRICAL OBSERVATIONS AT KEW.  177

      In the succeeding table, the great majority of instances in which negative
 electricity has been exhibited, are characterized by hvo very interesting

 features. At Kew one of these features has been t\\e.faUi7}gofrain, in most

 instances heavy ; and the other the great probability, from the almost con-
 stant record, at or near the same epochs at the Royal Observafory, Green-
 wich, of cirro-stratus, and occasionally cumulo-strafus, that these clouds
 have more or less not only accompanied, but contributed their quota to,

 the development of the electricity observed. On numerous occasions, cz'rro-

 stratus has been observed at Greenwich without the electrical instruments
 having been affected, and from this we may with great truth infer that cirro-

 stratus in its ordinary action does Kot occasion a disturbance of the regular
 diurnal march of the electrical tension. Most probably it is onl}' when the

 conditions exist for the precipitation of rain, especially when the rain is
 formed very rapidly and in great quantities, that the electrical condition of
 the cloud is disturbed, and the conductor affected negatively. From the
 great constancy of the phsenomena during a period of seventeen months, we
 are inclined to consider that to a certain extent they illustrate the remark
 relative to the production of lightning by ruin, which occurs in the Report of
 the Committee of Physics, including Meteorology, approved by the Presi-
 dent and Council of the Royal Society, pages 46 and 47. In speaking of

--thunder-storms, the writer, in alluding to one point to which the Committee

 wished some attention to be paid, says, " It is the sudden gush of rain which
 is almost sure to succeed a violent detonation immediately over-head. Is this
 rain a cause or a consequence of the electric discharge ? Opinion would seem
 to lean to the latter side, or rather, Ave are not aware that the former has
 been maintained or even suggested ; yet it is very defensible. In the sudden
agglomeration of many minute and feebly electrified globules into one rain-
 drop, the quantity of electricity is increased in a greater proportion than the

surface over which (according to the laws of electric distribution) it is spread.
 Its tension therefore is increased, and may attain \he point when it is capable
 of separating from the drop to seek the surface of the cloud, or of the newly
 formed descending body of rain, whicli under such circumstances, and with

electricity of such a tension, may be regarded as a conducting medium.
 Arrived at this surface, the tension for the same reason becomes enormous,
and a flash escapes." In immediate reference to this remark, we apprehend
the observations do not so much indicate the actual electric tensio7i of the rain

fulling on the conductor, as the eftect on the conductor of the electric disturb-

ance occasioned by the production of the rain ; this disturbance principally
 influencing the cloud from which the rain is precipitated, and through the

Wecloud influencing the earth and bodies in its immediate neighbourhood.

 shall have occasion again to refer to this subject in the Notes that are sub-

joined.

    The exceptions to the general fact of heavy rain falling when the con-
 ductor has been negatively electrified are rare ; only ten instances are re-
 corded during the seventeen months ; they are given in Table XCIII. p. 185 ;
 some of them are extremely interesting, and are calculated to throw great
 light on the subject to which we have just alluded : we shall notice them in

 their proper places in the Notes that follow.

gular diurnal march being interrupted by the passage of a cloud in the im-

mediate neighbourhood ol" the observatory. No rain appears to have fallen,

yet the instruments were thrown into a state of oscillation, positive to negative,

which gradually diminislied as the cloud passed off; a spark or sparks O'^ inch

in length were registered. This cloud appears to have been a cmnulo-straUcs
for at Greenwich at 3 p.m. cumulo-slratus is registered, and during the suc-

ceeding twenty minutes a very heavy shoicc'r of rain accompanied with thunder

is recorded. The electrical instruments were not affected.

  --C^) October 2, IB^S. The connexion in this instance between the heavy

rain and nerjative charge is very apparent, and would, combined with the

observation of September 10, greatly tend to refer the production of the
charge to the particular cloud by the agency of which the rain was precipi-
tated, rather than to the rain itself. Cirro-stratus was registered at Green-
wich from 9** 20°^ a.m. to 5^ 20"* p.m. The violent squall of rain occurred

--there at 5 minutes before 1 1 a.m.
    (^) October 12, 184-3. " Front sunrise until about 11 a.m. dull and cloudy.
At about 11 A.M. a heavy rain began and continued until about 1*" 15" p.m.
At its commencement Volta stood at 25'^ pos.: immediately afterwards the

charge became negative, the maximum of whicii was 30° of Henley, and a
negative state continued until about 2** 45"" p.m. The positive charge then
remained during the rest of the day. The negative state existed about

I hour and 30 minutes after the rain had ceased; and the weather during
this period was fine and accompanied with sunshine. The duration of the

negative stale of the conductor, viz. about 3 houi-s 45 minutes, from about
II A.M. to 2** 45TM P.M., one hour and a half of which time elapsed without

rain, is I believe a rare occurrence, and one which I do not recollect to have

--observed in my former experiments. [F. 11.]"

   The negative state of the conductor during the tliree half-hours is remark-
able. It appears the sun was shining and the weather fine; but the register
does not inform us whether clouds were present or not. On turning to the
Greenwich observations we find rain recorded at 11'' 20TM a.m., and at 1'' 20TM

P.M. thin rain falling ; the rain appears to have ceased earlier than this at

Kew. From O*" 20TM a.m. until "i^ 20TM p.m. cirro-stratus was registered at
Greenwich ; and as this cloud frequently manifests itself in the form of a

--thin hut very extensive stratum, it is not unlikely that it was the source of the

negative charge observed. [W. R. B.]
   (f) October 28, 1843 At 'o^ 20TM p.m. this squall was observed at Green-

wich w?^//02/< the hail. The observer thus writes: "At present there is a

violent squall: the rain is falling in large drops: the sky is covered with a

nimbus: a few minutes since a cumulo-stratus with coloured edges was in

the west, and scud was passing quickly from the west with a fine blue sky

Abetween." The head of the galvanometer needle deviated towards 5°.

AA.M. Greenwich time), the observer records : " few clouds only here and

there : at 8** 5TM a.m. rain and sleet began falling ; and about 8*^ 40"^ a.m. snow

fell thickly, soon covering the ground ; it ceased about 9^ 20TM, when the

clouds broke : wind in gusts to 2, with prolonged lulls." Negative electricity

was observed between 7 and 9 a.m. very weak. Wind N.W., force |- to 7 lbs.,

removing it the observer received a severe shock.

  --Third Storm. At l^ 20*" p.m. Greenwich time. Cirro-stratus ; wind in

kwheavy gusts ; squalls of hail and snow are frequent ; occasionally, also, a

breaks occur: very dark and gloomy; snow mingled with sleet has again

I'' 55"" P.M. It is worthy of remark, that the approach of the cloud to the
zenith, the formation of the heavy ruin-drops, and the affection of the instru-
ments, the charge being negative, loere apparently simultaneous, and succeeded

   C') May 18, IS^'i. The contrast between the observations at Kew and

Greenwich is interesting: it furnishes us with another instance (and perhaps
the most striking of the three) of the affections of the instruments by the prox-
imity of cloud, most probably cirro-stratus, which was prevalent at Green-
wich, at least before noon. During the changes that occurretl there in the
electrical charges, small quantities of sleet only fell, and these not in any de-

gree measurable, for we find on May 18, 22 hours Gottingen time, the same
records of the rain-gauges as on May 17, 22 hours; but at Kew the period

marked by the affections of the instruments at Greenwich is characterized by
three showers, two of which are recorded as heavy, the electrical changes
being considerable. It is to be remarked, that at Greenwich the tension was
higher than had been observed previously in the course of the year. These
phaenomena appear to point to a common origin of the electricity noticed at
the two observatories, viz. the presence of a particular kind of cloud. It
cannot in this instance at least be immediately connected with the rain, for

although the changes loere manifested at Kew during the continuance of the

showers, yet electricity of a greater tension than any that had been observed
during the former part of the year teas recorded at Greenwich ; the saine ac-

tion teas going on at Greentvicli without the rain us at Kew with it: the only

difference appears to have been, the absence at Greenwich of those particular
conditions necessary to the production of the sudden gush of rain most fre-
quently characterizing the exhibition of negative electricity, or rather the
oscillation of the electrical condition between positive and negative. The
instance before us presents a very instructive comparison with the passage of

the cloud over the Kew Observatory on September 10, 1843, when the con-

ditions for the production of rain did not appear to have existed at Kew,

while they did at Greenwich yet the electrical instruments at Kew were
                                                                                                                                                         ;

   (') June 10, ISii. The records of this shower at both observatories were
as under :

    Previous to the fall of any rain upon the conductor, the Henley rose to
90° pos., sparks l-i-| inch*. At one time of this high positive charge (before
the rain), the Leyden jar, of about 56 square inches coating, on being applied
to the conductor, became charged to the intensity of the rod in about 20
seconds. The charge changed to negative shortly after the rain began, max.
55° of the Henley, sparks ^^ inch. These high signs lasted about a quarter
of an hour, and spirtings occurred from the little ball above the discharger.
The negative charge remained a considerable time after the rain had ceased,

gradually diminishing.
    Nothing remarkable in the appearance of the clouds ; they were rather

fleecy or plumose, and not low, but large.

   * These were the longest sparks which we have yet observed ; bat on the 31st of January
the continuous stream of fire from the conductor to the discharger was much more lasting.
If the ball attached to the conductor and above the discharger were placed nearer or at the
end of the cross-arm, the sparks would be longer ; also if it were smaller. But it is, I fear,
in vain to attempt to measure these very high tensions accurately by ordinary electrometers
and dischargers. Our Henley was in this instance evidently useless. The shock of the
spark reached the elbow without a jar. [Observer at Kew.]

   June 10'' 2"^ Gottingen time, I*' 20TM Greenwich time. Cumuli, cumulo-
strati, and dark scud ; within the last three minutes the temperature has fallen
3°, the reading just before the observation having been 74'°*5, and there was
a sudden exhibition of negative electricity ; a large dark cloud was at the
time passing over from the N.W.: at 1"^ 27" p.m. a fine shower of rain began
falling ; at l^^ 29TM the temperature was 62°-0; and at I'' 46TM it was 59°'5.

   Negative electricity recorded between I'' 16TM and l''^^TM p.m., max. tension
20° Volta (2). Wind W., force to 1 lb., rain falling.

    By means of these records we obtain a further insight into the conditions

necessary for the exhibition of the phsenomena detailed. Cloud being the

origin of the electrical oscillations, appears very evident from the affections

of  the  instruments  at  Kew previous to (he fall of any rain  upon the  conductor
                                                                                                                ;

and the very high charge communicated to the conductor under these cir-

cumstances is highlj' instructive. The usual march of the electrical tension

was evidently disturbed by the approach of the cloud, although it exhibited

nothing remarkable. This disturbance did not manifest itself at Greenwich

until the cessation of the rain at Kew. It appears that at this time the ob-

server at Greenwich noticed a large dark cloud passing over from the north-

west, which was attended by two very remarkable phagnomena: a sudden

diminution of temperature, with as sudden an exhibitio7i of negative electricity.
This appears to have occurred at least seven minutes before the fall of any rain.

The presence of the cloud, the diminution of temperature, and the exhibi-

tion of negative electricity, appear to be closely and intimately connected,

and to indicate either that the cloud itself underwent a remarkable physical

change, which materially influenced bodies in its vicinity ; or, which is the

most probable, that it existed in such a condition as to produce great physical

changes in such bodies, so far as electricity is concerned. It is easy to con-

ceive, that if by any means the temperature of the cloud should be diminished

by coming into a colder portion of air, for instance, a sudden agglomeration

of its vapour-particles might take place ; its electrical Condition be suddenly

and extensively disturbed by the enormous tension which these newly formed

rain-drops might acquire in consequence of the rapidity of their formation,

in some cases the diminution of temperature being so great as actually to

freeze them and thus produce hail, which at some seasons is not an unfrequent

phsenomenon accompanying the exhibitions of negative electricity. The

electrical influence of the cloud thus circumstanced may not be confined to

the mere strip of country over which the rain or hail may fall, but may ex-

tend to some little distance beyond its circumference, and thus the signs may

be changed without the actual fall of rain in such localities, or the negative

state continue after the precipitating portion has left the place of observa-

tion. Nor does it follow that rain must necessarily fall from every portion

of the under-surface of a cloud; there may be an axis characterized by the

lowest temperature; around this may exist a zone having a higher tempera-

ture, and another still higher, the skirts exhibiting the highest.

    It is well known that in showery weather the masses of cumulus present

the appearance of highly heaped or vastly piled-up clouds towering high in

the atmosphere, and on many occasions these cumular bodies are surmounted

by sheets of cirro-stratus, through which their summits frequentlj"^ penetrate,

giving rise to that modification of cloud termed by meteorologists cumulo-

stratus. By carefully noticing their mode of formation the idea will be sug-

gested of vapour rising from the earth by evaporation with considerable force.
190 REPORT--1849.

and which upon passing the vapour-plane is immediately condensed. The
supply continuing from below, and the condensation going on above, produce

--the heaping, piling-up, and general outline of the cloud which is particularly

characterized by its crenated edges, and to which it owes its picturesque ap-

--pearance just as steam, which, issuing in an invisible state from the funnel

of a locomotive, meets with a stratum of air sufficiently cold to condense it
rajiidly, by which it assumes in a very decided manner the characters of the
highly-heaped cumular clouds. It has been suggested, that the immense
masses of these clouds, so commonly met with in the calm latitudes between

--the trades, may possess some sucii an arrangement as above-mentioned at
--least in the temperature of the rain that falls from them by their more

elevcded portions being precipitated by tlie colder air with which they come
in contact ; and as it is likely the most elevated part of the cloud would
most probably be situated near its centre, the precipitated rain would fall
along the axis, and bring with it to a greater or less extent the temperature
which contributed to its formation. The other portions of the cloud not
being so elevated as the central would produce rain of a higher temperature,
the rain falling from the skirts of the cloud being the warmest.

   One such cloud appears to have come under the writer's notice, at least if
the differejice in {he precipitations may be regarded as indicating differences
of temperature, or of elevation of certain portions of the cloud. The cloud
was considered to extend over a diameter of about six miles ; near the axis a
fall of snoiv occurred which was sin-rounded by a precipitation of kail, and

from the portions near the shirts, rain i'ell. It would appear that the tempe-
rature in the centre or axis was sufficiently low, or that the summit of the
cloud was sufficiently elevated to freeze the vapour-particles before they had
run into drops in the usual manner in which snow is formed ; but in the
zone characterized by the fall of hail, a different process appears to have

contributed to its production. Upon the first formation of the drops, the

temperature appears to have been above the freezing-point, and it is possible
that the relative diminution of temperature in this zone might have been
greater than in either the axis or skirts. If so, we have all the conditions for
a vei'y rapid formation of rain-drops, which, from their proximity to the snow
on the one hand, and the continued diminution of temperature on the other,
might soon become frozen. There can be no question but that so rapid a
conversion of aqueous vapour from tlie aeriform to the solid state, must have
been accompanied by electrical phsenomena more or less striking ; the elec-
trical condition of the cloud itself, as before observed, must have been mate-
rially influenced, and this as it travelled onwards again influenced bodies in
its more immediate neighbourhood as it passed them. In the observations

more immediately before us, as well as in numerous others, we find that
shortly after the lain began the charge became negative. That the cloud

disturbed the usual electrical condition of the conductor is veiy evident from
the observations, and it is to be presumed that, at the time the high positive
charge was communicated to the conductor, tJie heavy rain was falling,

--although it had not arrived at the observatory ; in other words, that portion

of the cloud in which the diminution of temperature was so great as to occa-
sion the rapid formation of rain, and thus alter the electrical condition of the
cloud itself, was yet at some distance from the observatory. There might pos-
sibly have been at this moment tivo bodies reciprocally acting on each otiier

--electrically the body of falling rain and the cloud ; and it may not be at all

 improbable that it is the actions of these bodies, the one on the other, that
 influence our conductors, and give rise to the sudden and extensive changes

   The following notes by the writer of this report may probably assist in
more distinctly particularizing the principal features of the above-recorded
phaenomena. The references are in letters of the italic alphabet.

   (a) The occurrence of the flash and the increase of the negative tension
may indicate the approach of the cloud as well as the formation of rain. It
would appear that from 'S^ 40" to this time, 22 minutes, rain had been falling,

but not such as to lead the observer to record it as heavy.

   (J) The maximum tension ; rain had ceased, but great oscillation of the

charges existed.

   (c) This flash appeared to exert a momentary influence on the conductor;
the tension was slightly declining, but increased after its occurrence.

    (d) This flash appeared to have no effect on the electrometer.
   (e) The " gush oF rain" arrived at the observatorj\ It may be remarked
that after this, tiiunder was heard but once, and in ail the records it is de-
scribed as distant. From the time thunder was last heard, 4'' 21TM p.m., the
charge had gradually fallen to Volta 10 div. P. The highest tensions were ob-
served, not when the rain was heaviest, but when the discharges (at a distance)
took place more frequently. It is probable that after the cessation of these
discharges the " gusli of rain" came travelling on, being still accompanied by
the causes of its production, and a corresponding oscillation of the tension
occurred.

   (f) The increase of tension on the occurrence of the discharge is very
apparent, as well as the gradual decline afterwards, notwithstanding the ces-
sation of rain which occurred within the next 11 minutes.

--(") July 1, 1844. As the records of this storm have already appeared

in the volume of Reports for 1844, page 134, we shall not further introduce
them to the reader. On a careful consideration of the record it will be found

that the storm may very naturally be divided into three sections, viz. the

period of heavy rain previous to the electrical discharges ; the period of the

discharges themselves ; and the period of rain succeeding the discharges, a

--portion of which was heavy. The times are as follows : first period S^ 30""

P.M.  to  5^ 55"^ P.M.  inclusive=25  minutes                                      second  period  5^ 56TM p.m.  to
                                                                                ;

=gh y^m p_]^j_ inclusive 29 minutes; third period 6** 25TM p.m. to 7'^ 50TM p.m.
= Weinclusive l hour 26 minutes.
                                      have in the first period a decided instance

of heavy rain, characterized on one occasion as very heavy, being in advance of

the actual thunder-storm. During the second period nf^'iihev thunder nor heavy

rain, except on one occasion, appear to have been noted : it is however to be

pi'esumed, as we shall have occasion hereafter to notice, that from the fre-

quency and character of the flashes they were accompanied by both, and the

probaljility is, that during the exhibition of the lightning the rain that fell

was much heavier than that in either the preceding or succeeding period.

In the third period the heavy rain continued about half an hour. The values

of the tensions having reference to these periods are interesting. The mean

of the tensions recoided during the first, without having regard to kind, is

32° of Henley ; that of the second 48° of Henley ; and that of the third 27°
of Henley, or during the heavy rain only, 33° of Henley. The connexion

between the high tensions and the electrical discharges from the cloud is

very apparent ; also the mean values of the tensions during each period of

the heavy rain indicate a certain relation between them. The entire phae-

nomena strongly suggest the existence of an axis characterized by the active

development of strong electric action ; the tension of the cloud and probably
that of the rain being so enormous that frequent discharges took place to

restore the equilibrium. This axis occupied about half an hour in passing

the oVjservatory. It is probable the strong action going on in the centre

was communicated to a zone of nearly the same breadth in all its parts, in

which the principal phgenomenon was the rapid formation of rain unaccom-
panied by electric discharges. In connexion with this it may be remarked

that the third period may be subdivided into two, the first characterized by

heavy and the last by light rain ; the duration of the first was, as we have
already noticed, 30 minutes, namely from 6** 25TM p.m. to 6^ 55"^ p.m. inclusive,

and this may probably be regarded as the true termination of the storm.

--succeeding heavy rain do not differ very considerably in duration from each

minutes. It is also to be remarked, that at the commencement and termi-

nation of the second, oscillations in the kitid of tension occurred, the tension
at the occurrence of the first flash being positive 60° of Henley, and that
at the last also positive 50*^ of Henley: the intermediate tensions were negative.
Oscillations also occurred during the periods of heavy rain.

   At Greenwich the same storm was observed, the clouds recorded being
cirro-stratus and scud. It appears to have commenced at 5^ 49" p.m., at

least so far as the affection of the instruments is concerned ; the record is as

--follows: [" This storm first rose in the N.W. ; it then passed round to the

north, and afterwards to the east, as also did the wind ; at 5"°^ 50TM there was

a vivid flash of lightning, followed by thunder at the interval of seven

seconds ; at 5^ 55^ there was another very bright flash, and thunder followed

at an interval of two seconds ; this was a long peal, the crackling continuing
from 45^ to 59^ Several flashes of lightning took place between 6^ and

6^ iS^, followed by thunder at intervals of one, two and three seconds.

Between 6^ and &^ 20"", 0*78 inch of rain fell at Mr, Glaisher's residence

after this time the lightning ceased ; the rain however continued, but not so

--heavily." G.]

From this record it may be gathered that the first flash of lightning oc-

curred at 5'^ 50TM P.M., being six minutes earlier than the occurrence of the

Kewfirst flash at  ; it is described as very vivid, and followed by thunder at

the interval of seven seconds. The second flash, which was very bright,

occurred at 5^ 55°" p.m., one minute earlier than the first at Kew ; it was

evidently much nearer than the first observed at Greenwich, the interval

being two seconds. Between &^ and &" 15TM p.m. several flashes are recorded,

the point of discharge being upon the whole nearest to the observatory

during this quarter of an hour. During the same period six flashes were

registered at Kew, from four of which sparks were obtained, the longest

being 0*4 inch ; it occurred at 6^ 5TM p.m. This quarter of an hour was evi-

dently the period in which the focus of the storm passed both observatories,

and during the twenty minutes between 6^ and 6** 20TM Mr. Glaisher registered

078 inch of rain at Blackheath. It is this circumstance to which we wish

to refer in connexion with the axis of the storm, it being evidently accom-

panied at Blackheath by a great precipitation of rain. Less rain appears to

have fallen at Greenwich, about half an inch having been registered during

the twenty-four hours from 9'^ 20TM a.m. of July 1 to 9** 20TM a,m, of July 2^
During the storm changes of tension occurred, the maximum tension being 30°

--of Henley and the longest spark 0"23 inch.
   (°) Julys, 1844. Between ll** 18TM a.m. and I'' 15TM p.m. a thunder-shower
passed over the observatory at Greenwich. Positive and negative electricity
were exhibited ; heavy cumulo-strati covered the sky until 1 1'* 55^ a.m., when
heavy rain began to fall and thunder was heard in the N.W. ; max. tension

10° of Henley ; sparks max. length O'lS inch. During this time the weather

at Kew is registered " fine but cloudy," but at l'' to I'' 5TM p.m. a heavy

shower of rain is recorded, which does not appear materially to have aflPected

·the instruments.

Between 4^ 0TM p.m. and 4*" 46TM p.m. changes are again recorded at Green-

wich with rain falling; the electricity was negative until 4'' 12TM p.m., when

it suddenly became positive, max. tension observed 120 div. Volta (2). Du-

--ring the whole of this time the charge was negative at Kew.
   (P) August 8, 1844. There can be but little doubt that the fine rain at a

distance observed at Kew at l'^ 26TM p.m. is the same shower that fell at

Greenwich at l** 35TM p.m. ; the only link in the chain of evidence required to

identify it is the direction in which the fine rain was seen from Kew ; both

conductors were affected almost simultaneously. If the shower seen at Kew
and the one that fell at Greenwich be the same, we have another instance of
the cloud being the common origin of the electricity exhibited at the two

observatories*.

It has already been remarked, that one of the most prominent results of the

arrangement constituting Table XCII. is the almost constant accompaniment

of rain in a falling state when the conductor exhibits a negative charge,

and it is to be particularly noticed that this is in striking contrast with the

condition of the atmosphere surrounding the conductor when high charges of

positive electricity are exhibited, the tension 7iot being in a state of oscillation.
In both cases the conductor may be said to be surrounded by moisture, but

the conditions of this moisture are extremely different. In the case of high

positive tension such as we have described, the moisture is not in the liquid

state ; and even if it may be said to be in contact with the surface of the con-

ductor, yet it has not passed beyond the form in which it exists as cloud ; the

conductor under sitch circumstances may be considered as penetrating the

cloud; and bringing to us the electricity of the cloud itself. In the case of

falling rain, the conductor is situated beloiv the cloud, the drops impinge on

it, and it is evidently a matter of question Avhether its indications are those

of the electricity of the rain, or of a state induced in the conductor by the

Aproximity of the cloud.  note aj)pended to the description of instruments

at Kew (Report 1844', page 124), relative to Henley's electrometer, appears

--to lead to the conclusion that the latter is the case: " The oscillations of

the index between the 30th and 35th degrees, sometimes during a heavy

shower, plainly show that the electricity of the conductor is washed off", as it

were, as fast as brought." By the electricity of the conductor being washed

off, as it were, it would appear that the electric state induced in the con-
ductor was momentarily conveyed yro»« it by the falling rain. In connexion

with this, we must bear in mind that all rain is not accompanied by negative

electricity, nor on the other hand is the negative charge o/tt'oys accompanied

by rain. In those instances in which negative electricity has been observed

without rain, the state of the weather is printed in italics in Table XCII., and

in such cases the presence of cloud alone has been the accompanying phae-

nomenon at the Kew Observatory ; nevertheless on some of these occasions

heavy rain has fallen at Greenwich. If therefore negative electricity should

be, as it appears to be, connected with cloudiness, it ought to present a

* It is a remarkable circumstance and one demanding further attention, tliat most of the

thunder-storms recorded in the foregoing pages passed more or less to the north-west of the

WeRoyal Observatory at Greenwich.  give the following as illustrative of this remark:

                                     j

   To these instances we may add that of the remarkable thunder-storm which passed over
Loudon on July 26, 1849. In the meteorological observations furnished by the Astronomer
Royal, and published in the weekly report of the Registrar- General, it is thus noticed:
" From l"" till l*" p.m. a violent thunder-storm, chiefly situated to the north ; the flashes of
lightning were vivid and in quick succession, followed by loud thunder at intervals of 15 to
20 seconds generally." The storm passed over London from S.W. to N.E., striking several
buildings in its passage. During the continuance of the storm at Greenwich the electrical
tension was strongly positive for a period of two hours and a half, viz. from 1'' to S*" 30TM while
the storm raged in London ; at other times, the observer writes, the tension was strongly ne-
gative, with frequent constant volleys of sparks and galvanic currents.

   From the above it may be inferred that London is more particularly exposed to the effects
of thunder-storms, most of them passing over the immediate neighbourhood of the metro»

polls.

Wediurnal period more or less in harmony with it.  have already remarked,

that the record of negative exhibitions does not furnish us with sufficient

data previous to 1845'to determine the diurnal period ; nevertheless a synop-
tical arrangement of the hours included in the entries under the head " Limits

--of Time," furnishes us with an approximation to such a period at least so far

as the time of occurrence of negative charges is concerned'. The following

table, which is deduced immediately from Table XCII., exhibits the number

of times negative charges (more or less) were observed between August 1843

and December 1844, both inclusive, between the hours specified, making in

the whole 231.

having an ascending and descending branch, the maximum occurring about

--40 minutes before noon, and the minimum between 9 and 10 at night then

they must necessarily exhibit somewhat of the same subjection to the laws
of periodicity which is characteristic of the causes themselves. That the
diurnal occurrence of negative electricity is of a periodical character, the ob-
servations of five years, viz. from August 1843 to August 1848, testify in a
very unequivocal manner ; and although its connexion with the general
cloudiness of the atmosphere may not be satisfactorily made out, yet it by no
means follows that it may not be more immediately connected with certain
classes of cloud ; for as we have determined a diurnal period in the cloudiness

generally, it is not unlikely that certain clouds, the cirro-stratus for instance,

may likewise exhibit a diurnal period, being much more frequent in its oc-
currence at one portion of the day rather than at another. Upon the whole,

the negative readings are obvious indications of considerable disturbances,

and their occurrence in much greater frequency at a particular period of the

day renders it highly probable that the disturbances themselves are of a sy-
stematic character and subject to well-defined laws of diurnal periodicity.

 --Negative readings from January 1845 to July 1848 inclusive. During

this period 424 negative charges of the conductor were observed. Their
distribution among the twelve observation-hours is seen in the following

electricity from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. At 8 p.m. the diminution is so exceedingly

slight as almost to indicate a tendency to rise at that hour, and at 10 p.m. we

have a decided increase : but in connexion with this, it should be borne in

mind, that at one of the 33 observations contributing to its determination, the

Henley's electrometer read 70° ; and it is easily seen that this high tension very

materially influences the result, for if we abstract it, the mean tension is

lower than that at 8 p.m. With regard to the mean tensions at midnight

and 2 a.m., the same remarks apply which we offered relative to the positive

tensions at these hours (see pages 118, 119) ; they are for the same reason pro-

bably lower than the truth, and indeed more particularly so in the case of nega-

tive electricity                                                           for it  is  likely  that  when  such  electricity has  been  indicated by
                                                                        ;

the conductor on other occasions than the eight and twelve recorded, it has

exhibited much higher tensions than 50 div. of Volta No. I. The remarkable

difference between the values of the mean of all the positive observations for

three years (66-9 div.) and of all the negative during 43 months (725*3 div.)

is exceedingly interesting, as indicating at once the character of the move-

ments giving rise to the negative exhibitions, viz. disturbances.

                                                                                               Fig. 19.

ON ELECTRICAL OBSERVATIONS AT KEW.                                                                                 199

both instances the cloudiness and humidity precede the electricity, and strongly

indicate that whatever relation may exist between the development of positive

electricity and humidity on the one hand, and that of negative electricity and

cloudiness on the other, such relations are not only likely to be of a very

constant character, but that a similarity exists between the two sets of phae-

nomena which goes far to show that the nature of their connexion, if any,

is also similar ; the one, viz. positive, principally indicating, as we have before

remarked, the electric tension of aqueous vapour ; the other, viz. negative,

the electrical disturbances produced by the sudden precipitation of this vapour

when existing as cloud.

It would greatly contribute to our knowledge of this part of our inquiry,

if systematic and comparative observations were instituted at different observa-

tories, on occasions of electrical disturbances, of a somewhat similar character,

but of course considerably varied in their details, to those adopted on the oc-

Acasions of magnetic disturbances.     principal feature in such observations

should be tJie observation of the electrometers at regular but small intervals of

time during the continuance of the disturbance, so that curves of the variations

of the instruments might be readily projected at any time afterwards. Pro-

vision should also be made for noting the precise instants at which particular

and striking phaenomena occurred, such as lightning, thunder, a change in the

kind of electricity/, the commencement of rain, the commencement of heavy rain,

the termination of rain either light or heavy, also the same phcenomena as re-

Agards Imil or snow.     rain-gauge should also be kept for these particular

phcenomena ; it should be of such a construction as to admit of its being fre-

quently read during the continuance of the disturbance ; and its indications

should be noted at sufficiently short intervals to afford data from which a

curve could be constructed by which the eye coi^ld readily judge of the light-

ness or heaviness of the rain by the amount precipitated within the interval

fixed on. Observations of the kind just alluded to should by no means be

confined to the more striking exhibition of electrical phaenomena, such as

thunder-storms, &c., but upon the slightest, indication of a disturbance they

should be immediately resorted to ; even on the positive tensions ranging

higher than usual, the shorter intervals of observation may with great pro-

priety be adopted, if it should be only for the purpose of securing on such

extraordinary occasions  the epoch of  maximum                                               and in all instances  that it
                                                                                          ;

may be deemed advisable to resort to them, they should be continued while

there is the least indication, either from the appearance of the sky or from

the instruments, of the existence of the disturbance, and in fact until the ob-

server is perfectly satisfied that it has ceased. It may be well to remark, that

electrical disturbances appear to be very confined in their effects, extending

over but a comparatively small portion of the earth's surface.

Mr. Mallet's Report On the Facts of Earthquakes does not appear, as in-

tended, in the present Volume, in consequence of the manuscript having been
delayed by the author, pending his researches in foreign libraries, until too
late for the period fixed for publication.

   The Report will appear in the Volume for next year.

On the Application of Graphical Methods to the Solution of certain Astrono-
   mical Problems, and in particular to the Determination of the Perturba-
  tions of Planets and Comets, By J. C. Adams, F.R.S.

After briefly pointing out the advantages of graphical methods, the author pro-
ceeded to give some instances of their practical application. It was shown that the
solution of the transcendental equation which expresses the relation between the
mean and excentric anomalies in an elliptic orbit, is obtained in the most simple
manner by the intersection of a straight line with the curve of sines. Attention
was directed to Mr. Waterston's graphical method of finding the distance of a comet
from the earth, and an analogous method was given for determining the distance of

a planet, on the supposition that the orbit is a circle in the plane of the ecliptic.
   The author then passed on to the more immediate object of his communication,

the graphical treatment of the problem of perturbations of planets and comets. He
first showed how to obtain geometrical representations of the disturbing forces, and

then gave simple constructions for determining the changes produced by these forces
in each of the elements of the orbit, in a given small interval of time. Having ob-
tained the total changes of the elements in any number of such intervals, it was

shown in the last place how to find their effect on the longitude, radius vector and
latitude of the disturbed body, and thus'to efi^ect the complete solution of the pro-

blem of perturbations without calculation.

        On a Model of the Moon's Surface, By Henry Blunt.

This model is an accurate representation of a part of the moon's surface as it

appears through a Newtonian telescope of seven feet focus and nine inch aperture,

under a magnifying power of about 250. The large volcanic crater, which forms the

principal object in the model, has received the name of Eratosthenes. It is about thirty

miles in diameter and stands at the end of a lofty range of mountains not far from

Athe centre of the moon's disc.  hilly district, rising into two or three lofty peaks,

runs upwards from Eratosthenes, connecting it with what appears to have been an

ancient crater now filled up. Touching the edge of this crater and descending from

it towards the right, may be seen a long line of minute volcanic cups, which are

nearly the smallest objects visible with the instrument by which the observations

were made. The whole is represented as seen with an inverting eye-piece, and the

model ought to be held in an oblique light in order to view it to advantage.

        0?i the Heat of Vaporization of Water. By J. P. Joule.

The object was to point out the complex nature of the heat hitherto taken for

the latent heat of steam. In the exact experiments of Regnault 965° was found

to be the quantity of heat evolved in the condensation of steam saturated at 212°
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

of this quantity 75° was stated by the author to be the heat due to the vis viva com-

municated by the pressure of the steam, leaving 890° as the true heat of vaporization
of water. In a perfect steam-engine, supplied with water at 212° and worked at
atmospheric pressure without expansion, 965° will be the heat communicated from
the fire to the boiler, 75° will be the heat utilized by conversion into force, and the
remainder, 890°, will be the heat given out in the condenser.

   By working the steam expansively, so as to utilize its sensible heat, the oeconomi-
cal duty may be at least doubled. In this case 150° out of 965° communicated to

the boiler will be converted into force, leaving only 815° to be evolved in the con-
denser.

       On De Vico's Co»isL By the Rev. Prof. Powell, F.R.S. i^c.

   The author called the attention of the Section to the expected return of this comet,
the first since its discovery. It will come to its perihelion on Feb. 6, 1850, but will
be in such a position with respect to the earth as probably to render it quite invi-
sible. The annexed diagram gives a rough idea of its positions.

     Prof. Chevallier has since printed an Ephemeris of the comet : the only period
 during which it could possibly be seen would be in October 1849.

                   On a new Equatorial Mounting for Telescopes.
                     By the Rev. Prof. Powell, F.R.S. Sfc.

    The object of the plan here proposed is mainly the personal convenience of the
 observer, and the ease and rapidity of changing to a new position, which is often a
 matter of more importance than mere comfort.
                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.

   The essential principle of the construction (see the annexed section in the plane
of the meridian) consists in making the telescope (T) move about a point (C), at, or
a little beyond, its eye-hole, instead of, as usual, about its middle point, by means
of a counterpoise (W). The telescope projects sufficiently from the frame (F) which

carries it to allow room for the head of the observer ; and to this frame is attached
the declination-axis (D), turning in supports from the lower frame (F), through the
arm of which passes the polar axis (P), fixed to a firm pier, and round which the

whole is counterpoised by the weight (W).

When the whole is in the plane of the meridian the axis of the telescope coincides

with the polar axis, and the point of intersection (C) of the polar and declination

axes, is the position of the eye of the observer, or centre of motion, which is an

Ainvariable point in space for all altitudes and azimuths.  perpendicular dropped

from this point gives a point (V) on the floor, at which a pivot is fixed, round which

the observing couch (inclined at a constant angle) can revolve through a semicircle
horizontally. The observer has only to push himself round in azimuth, and, in any

given azimuth, he commands all altitudes in the plane of a circle at right angles to

that azimuth, by simply turning his head from one side to the other.
   The possible objection of want of steadiness in the telescope is one which can

only be judged of by actual trial ; but for telescopes of moderate size there seems no

reason to apprehend that with well-constructed framing, axes, and counterpoises,

sufficient steadiness might not be attained.

The same piinciple is obviously, and with greater simplicity, applicable to small

transits and moveable telescopes. In the latter case it has been successfully put to

   The object of this paper is to ascertain the friction of water on a vessel or other
floating bodies rolling in water. For this purpose experiments have been made
upon a cylindrical model whose length is 30 inches, diameter 26 inches, and weight
255"43 lbs. avoirdupois, in the following manner. The cylinder was placed in a
cistern, in the first place, without water, and made to vibrate on knife-edges passing
through the axis of the cylinder ; a pencil projecting from the model in the direc-
tion of the axis of the cylinder on the surface of another moveable cylinder marked
out upon paper placed upon this last cylinder the amplitude of each oscillation.

                                                                                                           1*

the function assumed in the arbitrary integral by means of which the elliptic integral

is compared.

   If we want to compare the elliptic function with another elliptic function of the
same kind but a different modulus, the function in the arbitrary integral will be the
same radical which enters in the elliptic integral ; but if the object be to compare
the elliptic function with any other integral of a different form, the function in the
arbitrary integral will be fixed, and depend upon the form of the integral thus used.

   Various rational forms have been given to this arbitrary integral, with a view to
compare the elliptic functions with functions that can be integrated, and amongst
them one has been found to answer the conditions of the functional equation, and
also to be integrable by means of logarithms and circular arcs.

       On the Oscillations of Floating Bodies. By Robert Rawson.

   This paper had for its object the description of a course of experiments made at
Portsmouth Dockyard by Mr. John Fincham, the master shipwright, and the author,
with a view to confirm several important formulee discovered by Professor Moseley
relative to the rolling and pitching motion of vessels. All the experiments, which
were made by Admiralty order, confirm the formulas for determining the amount of
force or work done to deflect a floating body in a state of equilibrium through a
given angle, and also another formula which determines whether the vessel thus

deflected will move slowly or otherwise.
   The importance of these questions to naval architecture is obvious ; and all the

experiments we have made show what we believe to be an important practical fact,
viz. that when a sudden gust of wind is applied to the sails of a vessel, or any cause

which acts constantly during one oscillation, the ultimate amplitude of deflection
will be double the amplitude which the gust of wind will permanently deflect the

vessel.

   In the next part, several experiments were made on models of vessels, some of
which have been built with a view to ascertain the best form of midship section

which will give the easiest rolling motion.

                              Description of a Binocular Camera.

   By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., 8s V.P.R.S. Edin.

   This instrument affords to amateurs and artists a ready mode of obtaining double
drawings both of colossal statues and of living bodies or of fixed structures, for the
purpose of having them exhibited as solids by the stereoscope. As the camera re-
quired for this purpose must have two lenses of exactly the same focal length, in
order to form by the Daguerreotype or Talbotj'pe processes the two pictures required,
with mathematical precision. Sir David has constructed his double camera by di-
viding a suitable lens, either single or achromatic, into two semi-lenses, each of which
will form an image exactly like that which the entire lens would have formed, though
with less light. These semi-lenses, placed at the proper distance from each other
and from the object, give the two pictures as required for producing the effect of

relief when seen by each eye at once in a stereoscope.

                          Improvement on the Photographic Camera.

    By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., ^ V.P.R.S.Edin.

    Sir David Brewster gave an account of an improvement which he had made and
 used on the Photographic Camera. In order to observe when the picture was most
 distinct on the paper or metal, he views the picture with a single or a compound
 eye-piece, either when the picture is received on the ground-glass plate, or in the
 air when the ground-glass is removed. In this last case the camera becomes an
 excellent telescope, by which the satellites of Jupiter as well as other astronomical
 phaenomena may be easily seen. The ground-glass may be wholly dispensed with,
 or it may be permanently connected with the eye-piece, and drawn back when it is
 out of use. If the ground-glass is retained, a hole opposite the eye may be made in
 it, or that part of the gliiss may be left unground. This construction of the Camera,
 by which the focus can be adjusted with the greatest accuracy, has been adopted and
 successfully by Mr. Beickle of Peterborough, who has executed some of the finest
 Talbotype we have seen.

O71 a new form of Lenses, and their Application to the Construction of two

ByTelescopes or Microscopes of exactly equal Optical Potver.  Sii* David

Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., 4- V.P.R.S. Edin.

   This method is to divide, in the same way as before described, one lens into two
serai-lenses or quadrants, or sextants or octants, and using each semi-lens or quadrant
for forming the image. Sir David also showed, that by a proper combination and
adjustment of two such serai-lenses or quadrants in a frarae or tube, by placing
their diameters at a proper angle, each may be raade to correct the imperfect image
formed by the other.

                        Notice of Experiments on Circular Crystals.

  By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., ^- V.P.R.S. Edin.

   Mr. Fox Talbot first studied the phenomena of this class of crystals as exhibited
in those produced by a mixture of borax and phosphoric acid, and Sir David Brewster
exhibited to the Section drawings of this phsenomenon which had been presented to
hira by Mr. Fox Talbot. In the course of his own inquiries he discovered a large
number of bodies which yielded circular crystals, which he divided into two classes,
positive and negative, including oil of mace (the phsenomena of which he had pre-
viously described in the Phil. Trans, for 1814), animal fat, wax, &c., in which it is
very difficult to distinguish circular from quaiiuaversits polarization.

           Additional Observations on Berkeley's Theory of Vision.

By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L.,' F.R.S., ^- V.P.R.S. Edin.

Tn this paper, the author, by various arguments, partly metaphysical, partly optical,

and by examining the accounts of persons couched for cataract at an advanced period

of life, which were relied on by the supporters of Berkeley's views (illustrating his

views by several diagrams), considered he had overthrown every position essential to

the maintenance of that theory, and especially the fundamental proposition from which

that philosopher started.  ______

                     An Account of a. nav Stereoscope.
By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., S,- V.P.R.S. Edin.

   The ingenious stereoscope, invented by Professor Wheatstone for representing
solid figures by the union of dissimilar plane pictures, is described in his very in-

teresting paper "On some remarkable and hitherto unobserved Phsenomena of

Binocular Vision ;" and in a paper published in a recent volume of the Edinburgh
Transactions, Sir David Brewster has investigated the cause of the perception of
objects in relief, by the coalescence of dissimilar pictures. Having had occasion to
make numerous experiments on this subject, he was led to construct the stereoscope
in several new forms, v^'hich, while they possess new and important properties, have
the additional advantages of cheapness and portability. The first and the most

generally usfful of these forms is the Lenticular Stereoscope. This instrument con-
sists of two serailenses placed at such a distance that each eye views the picture or
drawing opposite to it through the margin of the semilens, or through parts of it
equidistant from the margin. The distance of the portions of the lens through which

we look, must be equal to the distance of the centres of the pupils, which is, at an
average, 2^ inches. The serailenses should be placed in a frame, so that their di-
stance may be adjusted to different eyes. When we thus view two dissimilar draw-
ings of a solid object, as it is seen by each eye separately, we are actually looking
through two prisms, which produce a second or refracted image of each drawing, and
when these second images unite, or coalesce, we see the solid object which they re-
present. But in order that the two images may coalesce without any effort or strain

on the part of the eyes, it is necessary that the distance of similar parts of the two
drawings be equal to iicice the refraction produced by each lens. For this purpose,
measure the distance at which the serailenses give the most distinct view of the
drawings, and having ascertained, by using one eye, the amount of the refraction
produced at that distance, or the quantity by which the image of one of the draw-

ings is displaced, place the drawings at a distance equal to twice that quantity.
                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  7

that is, place the drawings so that the average distance of similar parts in each is

equal to twice that quantity. If this is not correctly done, the eye of the observer

will correct the error, by making the images coalesce, without being sensible that it

is making any such effort. When the dissimilar drawings are thus united, the solid

will appear standing, as it were, in relief, between the two plane representations of

it. In looking through this stereoscope, the observer may probably be perplexed

by the vision of only the two dissimilar drawings. This effect is produced by the

strong tendency of the eyes to unite two similar, or even dissimilar drawings. No

sooner do the refracted images emerge from their respective drawings, than the eyes,

in virtue of this tendency, force them back into union ; and though this is done by

the convergency of the optic axes to a point nearer the eye than the drawings, yet

the observer is scarcely conscious of the muscular exertion by which this is effected.

This effect, when it does occur, may be counteracted by drawing back the eyes from

the lenses, and shutting them before they again view the drawings. While the serai-

lenses thus double the drawings and enable us to unite two of the images, they at

--the same time magnify them, an advantage of a very peculiar kind, when we wish

to give a great apparent magnitude to drawings on a small scale, taken photogra-

phically with the camera. The lenticular stereoscope may be made of any size.
Sir David Brewster then described how we may see at the same time a raised and a

hollow cone, the /ormer being produced by the union of the ^rs/ with the secoirf, and

the latter by the union of the second with the third figures. This method of exhi-

biting at the same time the raised and the hollow solid, enables us, he said, to give

an ocular and experimental proof of the usual explanation of the cause of the large

size of the horizontal moon, of her small size when in the meridian at a considerable

altitude, and her intermediate apparent magnitude at an intermediate altitude. As

the summit of the raised cone appears to be nearest the eye of the observer, the

summit of the hollow cone furthest off, and that of the flat drawing on each side at

an intermediate distance, these distances will represent the apparent distance of

the moon in the zenith of the elliptical celestial vault, in the horizon, and at an alti-

tude of 45°. The circular summits thus seen are in reality exactly of the same size,

and at the same distance from the eye, and are therefore precisely in the same
circumstances as the moon in the three positions already mentioned. If we now
contemplate them in the stereoscope, we shall see the circular summit of the hollow

cone the largest, like the horizontal moon, because it seems at the greatest distance

from the eye ; the circular summit of the raised cone the smallest, because it appears
at the least distance, like the zenith moon ; and the circular summit of the cones
on each of an intermediate size, like the moon at an altitude of 45°, because their

distance from the eye is intermediate. No change is produced in the apparent

magnitude of these circles by making one or more of them less bright than the
rest, and hence we see the incorrectness of the explanation of the size of the hori-

zontal moon, as given by Dr. Berkeley. When the observer fails to see the object in

relief from the cause already mentioned, but sees ozily the two drawings, if there are

two, or the three drawings, if there are three, the plane of the drawings appears

deeply hollow ; and, what is very remarkable, if we look with the eccentric lenses at a
flat table from above, it also appears deeply hollow, and if we touch it with the palm
of our hand, it is felt as hollow, while we are looking at it, but the sensation of

hoUowness disappears on shutting our eyes. Sir David Brewster described a variety

of forms in which he had constructed the stereoscope, by means of lenses, mirrors

and prisms. The sense of sight, therefore, instead of being the pupil of the sense

" of touch, as Berkeley and others have believed, is, in this as in other cases, its

teacher and its guide. Sir D. Brewster's simplified stereoscopes may not only be

" rendered portable, but may be constructed out of materials which every person pos-

 Asesses, and without the aid of an optician.  fuller account of these instruments

Society of Arts.

 Experiments on the Inflection of Light. By Lord Brougham, F.R.S.

  A communication from Lord Brougham was read by Sir David Brewster. His

Lordship's experiments were made at his seat at Cannes in Provence, with a very fine
--8 REPORT 1849.

and ingenious apparatus executed by that distinguished optician, M. Soleil of Paris,
and with the aid of a heliostat for fixing the sun-beam in one position during the
day. The results obtained by Lord Brougham establish a new and interesting pro-
perty of light, namely, that when a pencil of divergent light has suffered inflection
by a metallic or any other edge, of any form or substance, it exhibits different pro-
perties on its different sides when submitted to the action of a second inflecting edge.
The heliostat being a rare and expensive instrument, and of difficult construction.
Lord Brougham offered the use of his to any members of the Association who might
be occupied with experiments on light which required the assistance of it.

On an Orbitual Motion of the Magnetic Pole round the North Pole of the
                      Earth. By the Rev. H. M. G rover.

    This subject was investigated by tracing the positions of the magnetic pole at se-
veral intervals during the period of the last 250 years, by converging lines drawn
from the London, Paris and St. Petersburg Observatories, and deduced by compu-
tations of the different variations of the magnetic needle at these places. These
changes were shown very distinctly upon the different polar horizons of the obser-

vatories, and the orbit drawn from them in its proper position. An extraordinary
acceleration of this motion from 1580 down to 1723 was pointed out, and a pause

at that period, which indicated a climax in that year, in which both the horizontal
movement of the needle was suspended, and the dipping motion changed its course
from a downward to an upward motion. Mr. Grover showed also a series of changes
in the lines of equal declination about the isodynamic poles, which appeared to in-
dicate a direct tendency, or attractive force operating upon the magnetic needles
from those poles, which he assumed and showed to be suflicient to account for the
extra linear position of the line of no declination between Europe and Asia, as well
as for the extraordinary curvatures of the declination lines observed in the north of
Asia on the two sides of the isodynamic pole, and the origin and changes of the
closed systems or ovals in their Asiatic and Pacific allocations. Mr. Grover regarded
the moving magnetic pole in the light of a satellite, or supplemental system, to the
isogonal poles, disturbed by the accumulations of ice about the pole in the course of
a long series of ages, and generated as a compensative process from an interruption
of the original system.

On some recent Discussio7is relative to the Theory of the Dispersion of Light,
                   By the Rev. Prof. Powell, F.R.S. ^-c.

   Two eminent continental writers have recently published some discussions on this

subject, which seem to call for a few brief remarks.

   M. Mossotti, in a memoir " On the Spectrum of Fraunhofer," &c. (Paris, 1845,
transl. in Taylor's Foreign Scientific Memoirs, No. xix. p. 435), compares the in-

terference or grating spectrum, with that formed by refraction, as to the intensity of
light at its different parts, and the relation of the deviation to the values of X, the
wave length, which in the former is simple and normal.

   As to any measures of the intensity of light at different parts of the spectrum, it
appears to be a necessary condition to state the kind or degree of light used, whe-

ther the full solar rays, or bright or dull daylight ; since in the former case the inten-
sity of the middle part of the spectrum enormously exceeds and overpowers that of
every other part, while in the latter cases it is only in a slight degree brighter.

    In Part II. § 2, the author gives the dispersion formula substantially the same as

M. Cauchy's, as far as the 4th power of X. He adopts a method of calculation by
means of least squares, and considers the verification sufficient, from the agreement

in one specimen of Fraunhofer's flint-glass.
    It cannot but excite surprise to find so eminent a philosopher at the present day
                             TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                             9

referring to the ideal analogy of musical intervals. Yet Newton's notion of the

permanency of the proportions in the analysis of light might seem but the necessary

consequence of the permanence of the synthetic result. And this main difficulty

yet remains to be cleared up.

   The Abbe Moigno has also referred more particularly to this subject in his

' Repertoire d'Optique Moderne' (Paris, 1847, vol. i. p. 123-126). After giving

M. Cauchy's formula, he states that in my comparisons of observation and theory

for a great number of media the differences never exceeded the probable errors of ob-

servation.. Unfortunately not only is this not the case, but I have expressly dwelt

upon it, in reference to one or two most highly dispersive substances. He also ob-
serves, that M. Cauchy (in his ' Nouveaux Exercices ') has re-calculated the results,
and shown a perfect accordance. But this applies only to Fraunhofer's ten media,
and does not extend to the highly dispersive oils. He further states the deduction
from M. Cauchy's formula, that the differences of the squares of velocities of pro-

pagation are very nearly as the reciprocals of the squares of the wave-lengths ; but
adduces only one case of flint-glass in proof. It seems to be often overlooked, that

though there is a close accordance for all moderately dispersive substances, yet a

very few instances to the contrary in the higher part of the scale suffice to show that

the formula stands in need of some essential modification to make it apply to them,

while it shall still include the former. I have pointed out* that an empirical con-
stant for each medium will rectify the discordance. Whether this can be justified by

theory, is the point to which the attention of mathematicians ought I think now to

be directed.

Both M. Mossotti and M. Moigno admit the necessity of assuming (according

to the number of terms taken) three or four experimental constants for the medium.

myI notice this, because it has been objected to in  investigations. But on distinct

grounds it appears to me evident that from the nature of the problem we must suppose

at least three constants to characterize each medium. In other words, the problem is

--a compound one, each medium having as it were three distinct properties : 1st, the

absolute magnitude of its refraction, or deviation of the whole spectrum or of a mean

ray ;   2nd, the magnitude   of  dispersion,  or  expansion  of  the  whole                            3rd, the cha-
                                                                                                    ;

rctcter of the dispersion or relative expansion of the parts : conditions which are

certainly independent of each other, and each of which would involve a separate

constant.

                  On Irradiation. By the Rev. Prof. Powell, F.R.S. ^c.

   The phsenomenon known by the name of Irradiation is best exhibited by the me-
thod of M. Plateau, which forms the basis of all the author's experiments, and

      ^«tiijsfij  jifiait^^  which consists of a card or lamina cut so that a long paral-
                             lelogram has one half cut out and the other left, the por-
^                            tions at the sides being cut away. Thus the effect is seen

                             doubled either by transmitted or reflected light. [In the

                             annexed sketch the shaded portions represent the parts cut

                             away.] It is well established that the effect increases with

                  Lfli the intensity of the light. It is also evident that it decreases

            Bj rapidly towards the edge of the enlarged surface.

               Jffi| The effect has been ascribed by most writers to a peculiar
                                     kind of physiological afl"ection of the retina. But (allowing

for the effects of dazzling, contrast, &c.) the author has shown that this is not the
case, since exactly the same effect is produced in an artificial eye, or camera obscura.
The eflfect has also been tried photographically, in some cases especially in direct sun-
light, with perfect success ; in others without effect. But the most effective photo-
graphic rays are not the most illuminating, and may therefore not be equally subject

to this modification.

   These phaenomena appear to be simply cases of the enlarged focal image of a lu-
minous point, which is a well-known result, both of theory, as investigated by Mr.
Airyf, and of observation, as seen in the discs of fixed stars under contracted aper-

tures.

--10 REPORT 1849.

   The effect on the eye is diminished, and may be totally destroj'ed, by the inter-

vention of a lens, even in the brightest lights. This is explained by the diminution
of intensity in proportion to the superficial magnification, which is most effective at
the edges.

    In telescopes there is a twofold effect of this kind, one at the focus of the eye,

another at that of the object-glass ; the former may be neutralized by the magnifi-
cation of the eye-piece. The author has tried many experiments on the image of a

card, cut as above, seen in a telescope under apertures of various degrees of con-
traction, which appear to accord closely with the phsenomena of " the diffraction of
the object-glass." It also follows that there must be a limit to the increase of
the enlargement of the image, dependent on the diminution of light when the
aperture is contracted beyond a certain point, which will vary in each individual
instrument.

   The author suggests a method of measuring the amount of irradiation under any
given conditions of light, by viewing and measuring micrometrically in a telescope
the image of a card cut as above, under the given light, placed at the focus of an
object-glass opposite to that of the telescope, and connected with it by a tube.

   Theoretically, irradiation would explain those singular phfenomena seen in eclipses
and transits of the planets, of the connection of the edge of the dark disc bj- necks
or threads to that of the sun ; as also the apparent projection of a star on the bright
limb of the moon, by simply overlapping the star from irradiation. But the difficulty
in all these phrenomena is their appearance in some cases and not in others, under
circumstances apparently similar.

         On a Mode of Measuring the Astigmatism of a Defective Eye,
                            By Professor Stokes, M,A.

   Besides the common defects of long sight and short sight, there exists a defect,
not very uncommon, which consists in the eye's refracting the rays of light with
different power in different planes, so that the eye, regarded as an optical instrument,
is not symmetrical about its axis. This defect was first noticed by the present

Astronomer Royal, in a paper published about twenty years ago in the Transac-
tions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. It may be detected by making a
small pin-hole in a card, which is to be moved from close to the eye to arm's length,
the eye meanwhile being directed to the sky, or any bright object of sufficient size.
With ordinary eyes the indistinct image of the hole remains circular at all distances

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but to an eye. having this peculiar defect it becomes elongated, and, when the card
is at a certain distance, passes into a straight line. On further removing the card,
the image becomes elongated in a perpendicular direction, and finally, if the eye be
not too long-sighted, passes into a straight line perpetidicular to the former. Mr.
Airy has corrected the defect in his own case by means of a spherico-cylindrical
lens, in which the required curvature of the cylindrical surface was calculated by
means of the distances of the card from the eye when the two focal lines were
formed. Others however have found a difficulty in preventing the eye from altering
its state of adaptation during the measurement of the distances. The author has
constructed an instrument for determining the nature of the required lens, which is
based on the following proposition :

   Conceive a lens ground with two cylindrical surfaces of equal radius, one con-
cave and the other convex, with their axes crossed at right angles ; call such a lens
an ast'ujmatic lens ; let the reciprocal of its focal length in one of the principal planes
be called its power, and a line parallel to the axis of the convex surface its astig-
matic axis. Then, if two thin astigmatic lenses be combined with their axes inclined
at any angle, they will be equivalent to a third astigmatic lens, determined by the

--following construction : Through any point draw two straight lines, representing

in magnitude the powers of the respective lenses, and inclined to a fixed line drawn
arbitrarily in a direction perpendicular to the axis of vision at angles equal to twice
the inclinations of their astigmatic axes, and complete the parallelogram. Then the
two lenses will be equivalent to a single astigmatic lens, represented by the diagonal
of the parallelogram in the same way in which the single lenses are represented by

Athe sides. piano-cylindrical or spherico-cylindrical lens is equivalent to a common
TRAXSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  II

lens, the power of which is equal to the semi-sum of the reciprocals of the focal
lengths in the two principal planes, combined with an astigmatic lens, the power of
which is equal to their semi-difference.

   If two plano-cyhndrical lenses of equal radius, one concave and the other convex,
be fixed, one in the lid and the other in the body of a small round wooden box, with
a hole in the top and bottom, so as to be as nearly as possible in contact, the lenses
will neutralize each other when the axes of the surfaces are parallel ; and, by merely
turning the lid round, an astigmatic lens may be formed of a power varj'ing con-

tinuously from zero to twice the astigmatic power of either lens. When a person
who has the defect in question has turned the lid till the power suits his eye, an

extremely simple numerical calculation, the data for which are furnished by the
chord of double the angle through which the lid has been turned, enables him to

calculate the curvature of the cylindrical surface of a lens for a pair of spectacles
which will correct the defect of his eye.

On the Deternmiation of the Wave Length corresponding with any point of
                   the Spectrum. By Professor Stokes, M.A.

   Mr. Stokes said it was well known to all engaged in optical researches that Fraun-
hofer had most accurately measured the wave lengths of seven of the principal fixed
lines in the solar spectrum. Now, he found that by a very simple species of inter-
polation, w^hich he described, he could find the wave lengths for any point interme-
diate between two of them. He then exemplified the accuracy to be obtained by his
method by applying it to the actually known points, and showed that in these far
larger intervals than he ever required to apply the method to the error was only in
the eighth, and in one case in the seventh place of decimals. By introducing a term
depending on the square into the interpolation still greater accuracy was attainable.
The mode of interpolation proposed depended upon the known fact, that, if sub-
stances of extremely high refractive power be excepted, the increment A//, of the re-
fractive index in passing from one point of the spectrum to another is nearly pro-
portional to the increment AA-2 of the squared reciprocal of the wave length. Even
in the case of flint-glass, the substance usually employed in the prismatic analysis
of light, this law is nearly true for the whole spectrum, and will be all but exact if
restricted to the small interval between two consecutive standsird fixed lines. Hence
we have only to consider ^ts as a function, not of A, but of A-^, and then take pro-

portional parts.

   On examining in this way Fraunhofer's indices for flint-glass, it appeared that
the wave length (B>i) of the fixed line B was too great by about 4 in the last, or
eighth, place of decimals. It is remarkable that the line B was not included |in

Fraunhofer's second and more accurate determination of the wave lengths, and that
the proposed correction to (Bx) is about the same, both as to sign and magnitude,
as one would have guessed from Fraunhofer's own corrections of the other wave

lengths, obtained from his second series of observations.

On Professor Quetelet's Investigations relating to the Electricity of the Atmo-

   sphere, made with Peltier's Electrometer. Communicated by Professor
   WlIEATSTONE, F.R.S.

   Of all the meteorological conditions of the atmosphere its electrical state is per-
haps among the most important. Yet in the various observatories established in
different parts of the world in connexion with the great magnetic inquiry now in
progress, and in the establishment of which the British Association has taken so
prominent a part, no provision has been made for regular observations relating to
this important subject. It thus happens, that while we possess a most valuable ac-
cumulation of periodical records, made with great accuracy and regularity at widely
different points of the earth's surface, relating to the magnetism of the earth, and
to the barometric, thermometric, hygrometric, and anemometric conditions of the
atmosphere, we have no simultaneous electrical observations with which to compare

them.

This has arisen from the want of a simple and efficient instrument by which such

observations could be made. The most valuable results which have hitherto been

obtained have been made with fixed electric apparatus. That established at the

Observator)' of the British Association at Kew, under the superintendence of Mr.

Ronalds, and in which he has introduced so many important improvements which

render it, in perfectness of insulation, and the comparability of its attached electro-
meters, superior to any hitherto erected, will no doubt, when the observations

made at the establishment during the past five years are reduced and discussed, as

is now being done by Mr. Birt, yield valuable results. Still such apparatus are

too costly, and require too many precautions in their establishment and manipula-

tion to be recommended for general use.
   Meteorologists will therefore learn with satisfaction that this deficiency is now

supplied by the late M. Peltier's induction electrometer, a portable instrument,
simple in its construction, certain in its results, and of which any number may be

made perfectly comparable with each other. One of these instruments is on the

Atable.  hollow ball of copper, four inches in diameter, is placed at the top of a

rod of the same metal, which is terminated at its lower extremity by a much smaller

ball. From the last-mentioned ball, insulated from the glass cover by a lump of

shell-lac, descends a copper rod, which bifurcates and forms a kind of ring. At the

centre of this ring a small copper needle, which forms the essential part of the in-

strument, moves freely, balanced on a pivot. When the electrometer is in its na-

tural state, the needle is brought to the magnetic meridian by a much smaller mag-

netic needle which is parallel to it, and fixed immediately above it. Another copper

needle, much thicker than the moveable one, forms a system with the rod which

descends into a glass tube filled with shell-lac and fixed into the wooden stand.

Thus the entire metallic part of the apparatus is insulated, and electricity can be

communicated from it neither to the glass cover nor the stand. This insulation

mu.=t be established with the greatest care. The stand is furnished with three level-

ing screws, which enables it to be placed horizontally. To prepare the instrument

for an observation, it must be so placed that the fixed needle shall be in the direc-

tion of the magnetic meridian. In this position, the moveable needle, directed by

its small magnetic needle, places itself parallel to the fixed needle. If now a body

electrified, positively or negatively, be held above the ball, it decomposes by induc-

tion the electricity of this ball and its metallic appendages. If the body be posi-

tively electrified, at the upper extremity of the ball the negative electricity is coerced

by the positive electricity in presence, while in the lower part of the instrument the

free positive electricity causes the small needle to diverge from the position which it

had at first, and its angle of deviation from the fixed needle will be greater as the

free electricity is more considerable. The angle of deviation is read off by means of

two graduated circles, one of which is pasted to the stand and the other to the

glass cover ; by this parallax is avoided in the readings. If while the ball is in-
fluenced by the external electricity, the stem is touched, the free electricity, which

we will assume to be positive, will be removed and the needle will replace itself in the

magnetic meridian. If the inducing body which coerces the negative electricity at

the upper part of the ball be removed immediately after, this electricity will become

free, and the moveable needle will diverge anew.

   I will state in M. Peltier's own words the mode of operating with this instrument
when the electricity of the air is to be observed. " When I wish to ascertain the

electric tension accumulated in the atmosphere, I ascend to the terrace, I place the

instrument on a stand raised about G feet, I put it in equilibrium by touching the

lower part of the stem, I then descend, and place the instrument on the table ap-

propriated to it : all this is performed with great rapidit}', and requires only eight

seconds : when the instrument is put in equilibrium, the arm of the observer must

be raised as little as possible, for if it be raised sufliciently to reach the globe, the

hand becoming negative by induction will repel the negative electricity of the ball

it will neutralize the positive portion which will be attracted towards it, and the

instrument will be charged negatively at the moment of the removal of the hand.

The stem must therefore be touched as low as possible, and with as slender a body

as a metallic wire, in order to avoid the inductive action of the mass of the hand

upon the remainder of the stem. The equilibrium being established when it is

elevated at any height above the surface, the instrument on being lowered gives

Whensigns of negative electricity, while on being raised it will indicate positive.

the operation is thus performed, this change of sign must be taken into consideration,

in order not to attribute a contrary electricity to the atmosphere. In like manner
a negative tension of the atmosphere is indicated, when the instrument after de-

scending into the cabinet gives a positive sign."

   The proportional forces corresponding to the marked degrees of Peltier's electro-
meter may be ascertained in two ways. Peltier has given a table, in which the equi-
valent degrees were determined by an electric torsion-balance ; but the method
employed} by Quetelet is more easily applicable, and gives very satisfactory and
comparable results. This method, which is that of Volta, consists in dividing the
electric charges by placing spheres of the same diameter in contact. He took
two electrometers, each surmounted by a metallic ball of the same diameter ; he
commenced by charging the first electrometer so that the needle indicated 74°"5,
the two balls were then placed in contact to divide the charge. After this first

operation the electrometer indicated only 70°. Their values, according to Peltier's
table, correspond to 2825° and 1400° of the torsion-balance, which corresponds

almost exactly with the ratio of 2 : 1. After having discharged the second electro-

meter, he again placed it in contact with the first, which this time only indi-

cated 64°, or 795° of the table of equivalents, which is nearly half of the number
1400. This operation was repeated several times in succession in order to form

the table.

  A regular and uninterrupted series of observations has been made with this in-

strument by M. Quetelet at the Royal Observatory in Brussels since the beginning
of August 1844. He has recently published these observations, extending through
four and a half years, from this date till the 31st of December 1848, and the con-
sequences he has deduced from them are very satisfactory and important. I will
briefly state the principal of these results, referring for more extended details to the
last memoir he has published on the climate of Belgium *.

   The first object of M. Quetelet was to ascertain the relation that exists, under
ordinary circumstances, between the dilFerent heights above the neutral point and
the electric intensities. The experiments of Erman and Saussure had long since
made known that electricity is not equally expanded in the atmosphere ; that it is
nearly of the same intensity in a horizontal stratum of air, and stronger in the
upper strata. The discussion of the numerous experiments made by M. Quetelet
with respect to this point, shows that in a place in the neighbourhood of which
there are no higher objects, the electric intensity of the air increases, starting from
a determinate point, proportionally to the height. But it must be borne in mind

that this law has only been verified with respect to heights not exceeding 16 feet.
   The observations, with the view of ascertaining the annual variations of atmo-

spheric electricity, were made every day at about the hour of noon, commencing in

--August 1844. The results of each year are in complete concordance, and are as

follows : 1st. The atmospheric electricity, considered in a general manner, attains
its maximum in January, and progressively decreases till the month of June, which
presents a minimum of intensity ; it augments during the following months till the
end of the year. 2ndly. The maximum and the minimum of the year have for their
respective values 605 and 47 ; so that the electricity in January is thirteen times
more energetic than in the month of June. The mean value of the year is repre-
sented by the values given by the months of March and November. 3rd. The
absolute maxima and minima of each month follow a course precisely analogous to
that of the monthly means ; the means of these extreme terms equally produce the
annual variation, although in a less decided manner.

    In order to determine the intensity of the electricity of the air in its relations with

the state of the sky, M. Quetelet separated, for each month of the year, the num-
bers which referred to a sky entirely clouded, from those observed when the sky
was serene, or rather presenting so few clouds that eight- or nine-tenths were at
least entirely unclouded. In order not to complicate the results by foreign influ-

--ences, he omitted the observations made during storms, snow, rain and fogs. The

table thus formed gave the following results : 1st. Whatever be the state of the sky,

                      * Annales de rObservatoire Royale de Bnixelles, torn, vii. 1849.
14 REPORT-- 1849.

the electricity of the air presents a maximum in January and a minimum towards
the summer solstice. 2ndly. The ditference between the maximum and the mini-

mum is much more sensible in serene than in cloudy weather. In the latter case the

numbers are 268 and 36, the ratio of which is about 7. In serene weather the
maximum of January is 1133° and the minimum of July 35°; the ratio of these
numbers is 36, which shows a very considerable difference. 3rdly. Throughout every
month the electricity of the air is stronger when the sky is serene than when it is
clouded, except towards the months of June and July, when the electricity attains
a minimum, the value of which is nearly the same whatever be the state of the sky.

   Starting from this epoch, the electricity of the air, when the sky is clear, exceeds
the electricity observed when the sky is entirely clouded, in proportion as the months
advance towards January, when the ratio is more than 4 to 1. This strong elec-
tric intensity, under a clear sky in winter, is a very remarkable circumstance, and
had already been noticed by all the investigators of atmospheric electricity, although
they attributed to it a much less relative value.

.

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                        15

   From the observatioas made to ascertain the diurnal variation of the electricity of

--the air, M. Quetelet deduces the following conclusions : 1st. The electricity of the

air, estimated always at the same height, undergoes a diurnal variation, which gene-
rally presents two maxima and two minima. 2ndly. The maxima and minima vary
according to the different periods of the year. 3rdly. The first maximum occurs, in

summer, before eight o'clock in the morning, and towards ten o'clock in winter ; the
second maximum is observed after nine o'clock in the evening in summer, and to-
wards six o'clock in winter. The interval of time which separates the two maxima
is therefore more than thirteen hours at the epoch of the summer solstice, and eight
hours only at the winter solstice. 4thly. The minimum of the day presents itself
towards three o'clock in the summer, and towards one o'clock in winter. The ob-
servations were insufBcient to establish the progress of the night maximum. 5th.
The instant which best represents the mean electric state of the day, in the different
seasons, occurs about eleven o'clock in the morning.

   The indications afforded by Peltier's electrometer are simpler and more readily in-
terpreted than atmospheric electrometers of the usual construction. The former is
affected only by the inductive action of the atmosphere, or rather by the difference
of the inductive actions of the earth and its superincumbent atmosphere ; however
the instrument be raised above or depressed below its'point of equilibrium, or how-
ever the inductive action of the atmosphere may change, while it remains in the same
position it neither receives nor loses any electricity ; its distribution only is changed.
But if instead of a polished ball the stem be terminated with a point, a bundle of
points, or a lighted wick, as in Volta's experiments, to the pha;nomenon of induc-
tion there is added another which complicates and sometimes disguises it ; the un-
coerced electricity radiates into space, and though this radiation is greater as the in-
duction is more powerful, yet it is also greatly influenced by the moisture of the
air, rain, and the force of the wind, none of which circumstances affect in any obvious

degree the induction electrometer.

Meteorological Phcenomena observed in India from January to May 1849.

 JBy George Buist, LL.D., F.R.S. (Communicated by Colonel Sykes.)

   The papers comprised pressure curves of the barometer for five years at Boml)ay,
four years at Madras, and four years at Calcutta; a map of the occurrence of
storms at various places in India between the 19th and 25th of April L849 ; corre-
sponding observations at various places during storms in India on the 15th and
22nd of January ; the same between the 20th and 23rd of February and the 1st and
3rd of May. The pressure of papers in the Section disabled Colonel Sykes from
giving more than a running commentary upon the different phsenomena. He called

the attention of the Section to the general uniformity of the several pressure curves

at the three presidencies in India ; the maximum pressure being in December or
January, and the minimum pressure in June or July ; the absolute height of the
barometer however was different in different years ; but the gradual descent of the
curve from January to June and ascent from June to January was rarely inter-
rupted, excepting at Bombay in the months of September and October 1845 and
1846; in the months of August and September, at Madras, in 1841 ; and in No-
vember and December 1843 and 1844. At Calcutta the descent and ascent of the
curves did not show any interruption, but the barometer appeared to have a greater
annual range at Calcutta than at Bombay or Madras. Colonel Sykes called atten-

tion to the fact that these curves were not affected by the passage of the sun twice
annually over the places of observation, nor by the occurrence of the monsoon at
Calcutta and Bombay in June, and at Madras in October. The map of storms be-
tween the 19th and 24th of April, showed that they occurred almost simultaneously
in the Punjab, near Wuzeerabad, at Loodiana, at Simla, Delhi, Calpee, Alahabad,
Calcutta, Bombay, Belgaum, Madras, and down the coast to Tranquebar ; at Man-
galpre, and down the Malabar coast to Cochin, and on the western side of Ceylon.
--16 REPORT 1849.

Accompanying this map. Dr. Buist gave curves of horary oscillations from the 19th
to the 25th of April at Bombay, Madras, Aden, Calcutta, Lucknow and Mangalore,
and at none of these places were the daily oscillations of the atmosphere, with their
two maxima and two minima, in the slightest degree interrupted ; and with refer-
ence to the uniformity of these horary oscillations and the annual maximum and
minimum pressure. Colonel Sykes called the attention of the Section to the singular
coincidence of these movements of the atmosphere; with similar movements, tt
nearly the same hours and periods, of the electric intensity, as determined by Mr.
Birt in a paper recently read by him in the Section. In the storms of the 15th and
22nd of January, 20th to 23rd of February, and 1st to 3rd of May, Dr. Buist gives
the simultaneous reading of the maximum and minimum pressure of the barometer
at various places. These readings show that the horary oscillation at places on
the level of the sea may have different ranges ; for instance, at Calcutta and Bombay,
on the 18th and 19th of February, the horary oscillation at Bombay is respec-
tively 0*104 and 0"132, and at Calcutta 0'159 and 0'165. Carrying the comparison

--to Aden, the discrepancy is yet greater 0'072 and O^OSl. Similar instances occur

at the other periods. In the meteorological crisis of the 15th of January, Dr. Buist
considered that the storm was felt all over India ; and amongst other places, where
it fell severely, he mentions Jaunah in the Deccan, where, on the 14th of January
1849, there was a hail-storm, the hailstones being lenticular, and from two to two

and a half inches in diameter, and weighing from one to two ounces each ! On the

whole. Dr. Buist is of opinion that meteorological disturbances extend over very
considerable areas. Dr. Buist's papers were not accompanied by tables of tempe-
rature or moisture.

 On a Rainbow seen after actual Stmset. By the Rev. Prof. Chevallier.

   The rainbow was seen at Esh, six miles west of Durham. The latitude of the
place, determined by Bessel's method of observing the transits of stars over the
eastern and western prime vertical, is 54° 47' 25" ; and its longitude 6" 45' west.
The elevation above the sea is /OO feet. The time of the setting of the sun's upper
limb could not be observed, in consequence of clouds ; but the computed time, allow-
ing 33' for the horizontal refraction, was 8'' 36'" 2'. At 8'' 31"' 43' the bow seemed
to be a portion of an arc greater than a semicircle, approaching to the form of a Sa-
racenic arch, both sides being visible to an elevation of about 40°. At 8'> 34" 43'
the southern end had faded ; but at the northern end the primary and secondary
bow were both visible at an altitude of about 5°, the sky being sensibly darker be-
tween the two bows. This northern end of the rainbow continued visible until
gh 37"' 48'^ or 1'" 42' after complete sunset ; and at %'^ 38"" 43', or 2'" 41' after sun-
set, an irregular portion of the southern part of the bow was visible at an altitude
of about 15°.

    The time was accurately obtained by comparing the watch with a transit-clock
immediately after the observation. The barometer at the time, at the Observatory
at Durham, 34 7 feet above the level of the sea, stood at 29'48, the attached ther-
mometer 61°, the external thermometer 57°'5, the wind S.W., force 4. In order
to account for this appearance, it seems necessary to suppose either that the hori-
zontal refraction was much greater than its ordinary value, or that the rainbow was
formed in a very elevated region of the atmosphere.

    Notices of Mirage on the Sea Coast of Lancashire. By T. Hopkins.

    In this paper Mr. Hopkins represented that he had observed the phaenomenon
 called Mirage on certain parts of the sea coast of Lancashire, and had at different
 times examined the state of the atmosphere on various parts of the shore, but more
 particularly near Southport. Here he found that whilst the sky was cloudy, ap-
 parently threatening rain, evaporation in the air near the surface of the wet shore
 was very active ; but at other times, when the sun was shining brightly, evaporation
 at the same short distance from the surface was checked or entirely stopped, and at
 such times mirage might be seen.

    On the morning of July 9th mirage appeared at a certain distance to the north of
                                                                       --

the spectator over the flat sandy shore, and on examining the state of the locality
where the phaenomenon had been seen, the following facts were ascertained :

                 The temperature on the adjoining dry sand-hills was 87°
                                             on the moist sand of the flat shore 78°" 1

                           of a dry-bulb thermometer in air ... 65°"5
                           of a wet-bulb thermometer in air ... 63°'6

        Difference between the two last   1°'9

To account for these facts, Mr. Hopkins said that when mirage appeared the sun

was shining brightly, and by his direct rays raised the temperature of the ground
considerably, when energetic evaporation from the wet sandy shore took place,

which sent much vapour into the atmosphere. The presence of this vapour in the

air checked evaporation from the wet- bulb thermometer, and prevented it from be-
coming much cooled, and the wet-bulb thermometer at the same time, by the feeble-
ness of its evaporation, proved the existence of the large amount of vapour in the

locality. Now as mirage appeared only when the sun produced a large amount of

vapour from the moist surface of the ground, which vapour was shown to be present

by the state of the wet-bulb thermometer, it is to be inferred that the vapour caused

the appearance of mirage.

   It might be that some of the vapour was condensed by the comparatively cool air,
at a small distance from the surface of the sand, and thus a stratum of cloud was
formed from the surface of which light was reflected. But however this may be, the

presence of vapour sufficient to saturate or nearly saturate the air in the part always

accompanied the appearance of the mirage, and therefore is presumed to be the

cause of it. Objects that were beyond the place where the mirage appeared were

reflected by it as if they were reflected by water. Refraction sometimes accompa-

nies mirage, distorting the reflected as well as other objects, nearer to the spectator

than the mirage ; but the refraction is quite a separate phtenomenon, sometimes
appearing with and sometimes without the mirage.

   Mr. Hopkins exhibited a number of tabulated observations in corroboration of
what had been advanced. He also said that recently, at Blackpool, in the middle

of the day, with a clear sky and a strong sun, while the dry- and wet-bulb thermo-
meters on the wet sandy shore were at the same height (70°), there was a difference
of 5° between the two instruments on the adjoining cliflFs, about sixteen yards high.

These facts, Mr. Hopkins contended, proved, that while evaporation saturated the
air near the surface and produced mirage, the atmosphere at the height named was

comparatively dry, allowing evaporation to take place with considerable energy from

the wet-bulb thermometer.

Letter from Sir Robert H. Inglis, Bart.., F.R.S., to Col. Sabine, JR.A.,

                           Aug. 8, 1849.

  We were at Gais (Canton Appenzell, Switzerland) a few days ago, and saw

there, what may be familiar to you and other men of science, but was quite new to
me and to the people at the place. About 3 p.m. on the 8th of August my servant

--called to me, " that there was something falling very curious." I went out to the
--bridge which connects the old and new buildings of the Hotel du Boeuf, and under

the shade of the new house looked up and saw thousands and thousands of brilliant

white motes, like snow, falling as in flakes. There were no clouds, but there was

a kind of halo round the sun, or rather, as I looked up, there were in that direction

apparently more and larger masses through which the rays passed ; balls separated
themselves, consisting of vast numbers, and these resolved themselves into frag-

ments and came whirling and floating about. The master of the Hotel, M. Heen,

joined us : he had obviously never seen anything of the kind before, and called out,

" Des millions, des millions." He summoned his people to look. I continued to

gaze till I was half-blinded. At first the fragments seemed to melt ; and to the

last I could distinguish no appearance of an animal. Our servant fancied that he

saw something like wings ; I certainly looked till, to my eye, they seemed to evapo-

rate, but their disappearance and perhaps the re-appearance of the same individual,

might have been owing to their turning at right angles instead of exhibiting their

-- --extent lengthways, and «;fce versa. This lasted at least Hooked 25 minutes. Cer-

tainly none came to the ground. Reaumur 20°, no wind. Gais is 3100 feet above

the sea.

   Of analogous facts (more or less so) Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bart. F.R.S., says,

in a letter to Col. Sabine, R.A., I can mention two :
    1. In or about the year J 821, I remember seeing in Sir James South's telescope

at Blackmat) Street, when turned in a direction near, but not to the sun, about
midday, frequent objects having all the appearance of stars, which were seen sailing
through the field of the telescope. Dr. Wollaston, when this was mentioned to
him, said it was thistledown. I do not think it was.

    2. In the hay season, some three or four years ago, the day being clear and hot
and calm (at least in the immediate neighbourhood of our house), our attention was
excited by what at first seemed to be strange -looking birds flying; but though pre-
sentlj' assured they were not birds, it was by no means clear what they were. They
were irregular wispy masses sailing leisurely up and settling down again, apparently
over a hay- field on the east of our grounds, and above a quarter or three-eighths of
a mile from our house. Some of these were of considerable size, and their general
appearance was convex downwards and taily upwards. After wondering awhile, I
got a telescope and directed it to the flying phsenomenon, when it became evident

--that they were masses of hay some of very considerable size, certainly not less

(allowing for the distance) than a yard or two in diameter. They sailed above

leisurely, and were very numerous. No doubt wind prevailed at the spot, but

there was no roaring noise, nor any sign of a whirlwind, and all about us was quite
calm. Nobody was at the time at work in that field. None fell on our side of the
trees, above tvhich they rose perhaps 50 or 100 feet.

    P.S. Could Sir R. Ingiis's phsenomenon have been winged ants ? They some-
times appear in astonishing numbers, and might associate like gnats in masses for

a dance, and then separate again.

On Meteorological Observations made at Kaqfjord, near Alien, in Western
  Finmark, and at Christiania in Norway. By John Lee, LL.D., F.R.S.,

   of Hartioell, Bucks.

Dr. Lee stated that he had the honour to present to the Association some meteo-

rological observations, made by Mr. J. H. Grewe, an officer in the service of the

Alten Mining Company at Kaafjord, in Western Finmark, near Alten, under the

direction of S. H.Thomas, Esq., the superintendent and able geologist of the Company,

for the months of January to September inclusive of 1848 ; and that they had been
made at the same hours of the daj^ and on the same plan as the similar observations

which he had the pleasure to present to the Association in former years.

The present observations were accompanied by two new Tables from Mr. Grewe;

--the first containing barometrical means, deduced from the period of eleven years,

and arranged in three series: 1st, the monthly means; 2nd the quarterly means;

3rd, the annual means. The second table contained the thermometrical means, made

simultaneously with those of the barometer, and arranged in similar series. These

observations and tables of Mr. Grewe were also accompanied by two tables made by

Mr. J. F. Cole, a gentleman now resident in London, but formerly at Alten, and

the associate of Mr. Grewe in making some of the earlier observations at Kaafjord;

and Mr. Cole has reduced the observations of Mr. Grewe from the French measures

explanatory of the tables.

Dr. Lee also presented to the Association, through the courtesy of J. R. Crowe,

Esq., Her Britannic Majesty's Consul- General of Norway, a series of meteorological

observations, made during the year 1848 at Christiania. They were stated to be a

continuation of observations made at the same hours and on the same plan as others

presented on former years.  ,p ,

--Sir, I have had much pleasure in inspecting the Alten Meteorological Observa-

tions from January to September 1848, lately transmitted to you by my former

colleague, Mr. Grewe.

It appears that from October 1848 the hours of observation have been changed

from 9 A.M., 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. to 7 and 11 a.m., 3, 7 and 10 p.m., in accordance

with the suggestion of Professor Hansteen of Christiania.

The present observations are the last of a set of eleven years, and Mr. Grewe has

formed a very interesting table of the results of the barometer and thermometer for

that time ; some of these results I have reduced into English scales, as per tables

annexed.

From the table of the results of the observations on the barometer for the eleven

years ending 30th September 1848, it will be perceived that the means of the 9 p.m.

observations are higher than those of 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., except in November and

December, when the 3 p.m. are a trifle the highest.

   The observations fall from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., and then rise to 9 p.m. The monthly

means fall from May to June and July, and rise to August, then fall to September,
October, November and December, and rise to January, then fall to the lowest mean

in February, and rise to March and April, reaching the highest mean in May.
  During the eleven years the month of May gives the highest monthly mean, and

the month of February the lowest.

  The mean of the monthly means for May and February (being the highest and

lowest) differs from that of the eleven years by only 0"017615 inch; but of the

monthly means, the one for March comes nearest to that of the eleven years, differ-

ing by only 0-00079 inch.

   Of the seasons, the mean for Spring is the highest and Autumn the lowest. The means
fall from Spring to Summer and Autumn, and rise from Autumn to Winter and Spring.

From the tables of the results of the observations on the thermometer for the

eleven years ending 30th September 1848, it will be found that the means of the
9 p.m. observations are lower than the 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. without exception. Of the
eleven years, the month of February is the coldest, and August the warmest.

   The monthly means of the observations rise from March to August, both inclusive,

and from September to February, also both inclusive.

The monthly means rise thus :                                                        o

          From April to May, Fahrenheit                                              9"396
          From May to June, Fahrenheit                                               8-807

          From June to July, Fahrenheit                                              6-651

          From July to August, Fahrenheit                                            0-254

They then fall--                                                                        o

   It will be noticed from the foregoing, that the monthly means rise rapidly from
March to June, and fall heavily from August to November.

The mean of the monthly means for August and February being the highest

and lowest, differs from that of the eleven years by only 1^-594 Fahrenheit.
   The nearest monthly mean to that of the eleven years is October, differing from

it by only l°-659 Fahrenheit ; this agrees with the result generally noticed by me-

teorologists.

On the Cleans of Computing the Quantity of Vapour contained ifi a Vertical
                  Column of the Atmosphere. By T. Hopkins.

    Mr. Hopkins showed that the quantitj^ of aqueous vapour existing in the atmo-
sphere is computed, by meteorologists of the present day, from the tension of vapour]
near the surface of the globe in such a way as would be correct if an atmosphere of'
vapour only existed. But the vapour in our atmosphere is intermixed with and
diffused through gases, which gases cool by expansion consequent on the removal
of incumbent pressure five times as much as the vapour does. The vapour therefore
produced by evaporation at the surface of the globe, as it passes into the higher
regions of the atmospheric space, is cooled and condensed, not by its own law of
cooling by expansion, but by the cold of the gases ; and the result is that a smaller
quantity of vapour remains in the atmospheric column with a given temperature
and dew-point at the surface than there would be in a pure vapour atmosphere, or
than is now said to be indicated by the tension of the vapour found at the suiface.
That tension he showed was a consequence, not alone of the pressure of an incum-
bent column of vapour, but also of the resistance which rising vapour encounters
from having to penetrate the gases while expanding upwards into the atmospheric
space. As soon as elastic vapour is formed the surface of the globe becomes the
base on which it rests, and from which it is disposed to expand upwards. But the
resistance of the gases prevents free expansion, and preserves a certain amount of
density of vapour that would not otherwise be so early attained. The tension of
vapour therefore only measures the degree of density that is thus produced, and
does not indicate correctly the quantity that exists in the whole atmospheric column.
Tables were exhibited by Mr. Hopkins to show (he quantities of vapour, expressed
in decimal parts of an inch of mercury, that could exist at different heights to the
extent of 4000 yards from the surface, in an atmosphere of pure vapour, and also in
our mixed atmosphere, each being at the temperature and dew-point of 50° at the
surface. And the excess in the quantity of vapour in the former above the latter
was stated to show the extent of the error involved in the present mode of estimating
the quantity of vapour in a vertical column of the atmosphere with the dew-point
named, 50°.

             On Meteors. By Edward Joseph Lowe, F.R.A.S.

    See Reports in this volume, page I.

            Notice of a Meteor seen in India on the I9th of last March.

                          By Admiral Sir C. Malcolm.

   This consisted of selected notices of the meteor from the Bombay 'Times of March

--and April, and contained several letters detailing the circumstances under which it

was seen by the different writers from which it was inferred to be a mass of over
600 feet in diameter ; and the place at which it fell after bursting was ascertained
to a high degree of probability : it fortunately was not an inhabited place.

                 Extract from the Bombay Times, March 16, 1849.

  We have letters from Hoshungabad to the 6th inst., which mention that most

extraordinary weather had prevailed there during the latter half of February. It
had been close, hazy and drv, and a similar state of matters prevailed up to the

day above mentioned. On the evening of the 5th the clouds began to collect, the

--atmosphere having been highly charged with electricity for four days previous, the

electrometer (Cavallo's) readily indicating the amount, and the least friction causing
considerable excitation. Pressure and dryness had somewhat increased, and rain
was therefore not looked for, but either another earthquake or a thunder-and-dust

storm was predicted by the weather-wise. On the 2C)th of February half a gale
had blown throughout the greater part of the day, the mean of the barometer ha-
ving descended in three days from 29"949 to 29'(JS4 ! Our correspondent continues :
" Prognosticating an earthquake at Hoshungabad is somewhat akin to a pig see-

ing the wind ; but I only hint at such a phaenomenon from the consciousness that
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                     25

there is something very peculiar just now in the atmosphere, and from the fact that

the instruments seem as strangely siifected as the senses."

  We adverted in a former issue to the singular state of the weather at Calcutta,

Delhi, along the line of the Jhelum and Chenaub from Rhotas to Mooltan, and near

Socotra at Aden, on the 22nd of January ; and we now have an account of the ap-

pearance at Gibraltar at the same date of nearly the same phasnomena which were

observed all over the northern part of India. Here, as at Calcutta, Bombay, and

Aden, the mercury was remarkable for its elevation ; and we have little doubt that

were returns obtained from the intermediate points, similar facts would be supplied.

Here we have one of the most striking cases of an atmospherical perturbation of

simultaneous occurrence we have ever noticed, traceable over one-fourth part of the

Weearth's circumference from east to west, and 20° lat. N. by S.  now have the same

striking chain of phsenomena from Ceylon, where the heat at Colombo in the last

week of January was altogether without precedent in the meteorological annals of

the Cinnamon Isle. Hot winds, resembling those of the present year, were last

experienced in 1844 [month not given], when they blew from the I6th to the 19th,

occasioning much injury to the crops. The waters of the Colombo lake were be-

ginning to dry up, and the canals were nearly useless ; many of the wells had run
dry. The Ceylon Times, to which we are indebted for these facts, assures us that

the evaporation amounts to nearly an inch per diem.

        On the Results of certain Anemotrieters. By Follett Osler.

   The author first stated, that, from an aggregate of upwards ot 50,000 additional
hourly observations, he had been enabled to test the accuracy of the report he brought
forward in Glasgow respecting the hourly forces of the wind and their coincidence
with the curves of temperature, and that the result was highly satisfactory, being

almost precisely similar to that recorded in the report just alluded to, the wind
rising with the temperature with great regularity. The curve of temperature for

each season corresponded with the curve of force ; but from these observations it
would appear that the period of mean force in the evening took place about half an
hour before that of mean temperature; showing that the motion of the air declines
more rapidly than the temperature. The whole of the stations comprise an aggre-
gate of nearly 200,000 hourly observations, all of which were tabulated and reduced.
The direction of the wind for each hour of the day, together with its force, was first
tabulated, and from this an abstract was obtained, giving the total force and direc-
tion for every day. Thus, on the first of January for each year the winds for that

day with their forces are recorded ; and so on throughout the year. By thus ob-

taining the exact period of each wind, the coincidences of a series of years were
ascertained. In reviewing the Wrottesley observations, which were carried out
more fully than the rest, Mr. Osier called attention to the fact of disturbances in the
currents of the atmosphere taking place at certain and apparently regular intervals.

A comparative calm is followed by considerable disturbances : these calms and

movements appear to be periodical. It was possible that observations for a longer
term might neutralize these periods, and by shifting their times only leave us with
the knowledge that intermittent pulses do occur ; but the regularity of some led him
to hope that such is not the case, and that a law of periodicity might be traced even

in this variable climate.

   From six years' records at Wrottesley the average periods of greatest movement
in the aerial currents took place towards the end of Januarj-, the middle and end of
March, the end of April, the early part of June, a short time after the middle of
October, about the 20th of November, and the first week in December : the periods
of greatest calm occurred about the middle of January, about the 17th of June, and
about the 14th of November. There were many other maxima and minima, but
Mr. Osier thought it desirable to defer going more into detail respecting them until
he had been able further to investigate the subject. On minutely examining the
registers of the anemometers two kinds of currents are observed, the one moving very
regularly and with great steadiness, the other in larger pulses or waves, causing the
vane to oscillate over a considerable arc. One he regarded as the air moving to fill
up a void or deficiency ; the other, flowing from an excess or from a portion of the
--26 REPORT 1849.

atmosphere, being put in motion and carried on by momentum previously acquired,

causing great undulations in its motion, on which occasions the wind appears to
have much more force than is really indicated by an instrument. The north winds
generally showed less oscillation than those from the south points. While carrying
on these observations, Mr. Osier's attention had occasionally been directed to par-
ticular storms, and he had applied to them the rotatory theory set forth by Colonel
Reid, in the main principles of which he fully agreed; but he considered that a

rotating circle would not explain all the changes that occur. He was of opinion

that the rotating portion is smaller than has usually been assumed, and that the
air approaches this circle or vortex in spiral lines ; that sometimes this rotating
circlf is not in contact with the earth, in which case the lower current will be more
in the direction of radial lines ; that the air in advance of a storm is not put into
such rapid motion in consequence of the movement forward of the storm itself, while,
for the same reason, the action in the rear of the storm is increased.

    Mr. Osier called the attention of the Section to the great practical importance of
endeavouring to ascertain the exact course of the wind in rotatory storms, which he
considered miiht be done with the aid of the instruments we now possess. The
Americans were beginning to take the subject up in a manner worthy of its import-
ance; and Mr. Osier hoped that while Lieut. Mauiy and others were at work on

the west coast of the Atlantic we should take the east. He recommended that a
series of stations for meteorological observations be established, commencing at the

 Canaries and including Madeira and Gibraltar, the west coast of Spain and Portugal,
the Azores, Guernsey, &c. In England, Ireland and Scotland many stations are

already established that would no doubt join in contributing observations. By

adopting a well-organized and comprehensive system, the main currents on the east
 of the Atlantic might soon be ascertained vs;ith great exactness.

   AMr. Osier then exhibited and described his improved integrating anemometer.

plain sheet of paper, about twelve inches wide, and long enough to last some weeks
 (or months if required), is first rolled on a cylinder whose axis is horizontal, and
passing over a second cylinder is received on to a third. Over the central cylinder is
placed a registering pencil. The second and central cylinder is made to revolve in
proportion to the rate at which the air is passing, by means of rotators exposed to
the atmosphere. The direction is obtained by the same means that Mr. Osier
adopted with the anemometer at Lloyd's, and which is found to act with great
exactness, laying down the direction in a single line free from all oscillations. This
is accomplished by means of a fan-sail, similar to that at the back of a windmill,
the motion from which is conveyed to a pencil. The paper is ruled as it passes on,
by means of pencils indicating the direction. The time is recorded by a clock,
which causes a series of small punches marked with the hour to be brought round
in succession, one of which receives a blow every hour from the hammer of the
clock, and records it on the margin of the paper. Thus a single line gives the di-
rection and quantity of air passing any station, while every hour the clock marks
off the time. Mr. Osier pointed out some improvements he had made in his original
pressure anemometer, by which he was now enabled to record the force of even
light winds at the same time the instrument was strong enough to resist storms.
In conclusion, Mr. Osier said that he had long been impressed with the conviction,
that if greater attention were paid to a study of the currents of the atmosphere, it
would prove to be of more importance in advancing the science of meteorology than
anything else that has hitherto been done. It was this conviction that led him to
construct his first anemometer in 1836 ; and though he was not so sanguine as to
expect to see meteorology vie with astronomy in its mathematical prophecies, yet he
believed that if the subject were taken up on a systematic plan for a short period
the results might prove of very great value to science.

 On the Temperature of the British Isles, aiid its influence on the Distribution
              of Plants, By Augustus Petermann, F.R.G.S.

    The author adverted to the climate of Western Europe as being the mildest,
comparatively, of all countries in a similar latitude, and showed that a temperate
zone, limited by the isothermals of 70° and 30° (Fahr.), extended in

                                         Asia                   30°... 50° ...

                                         Europe                 30°... 71° ...

The British Isles are situated almost in the centre of this zone. To show the main

features of their temperature, the author had constructed on a large map iso-

thermals of the hottest and coldest month (July and January) in the year, based oa

the observations of about seventy places.

The most striking feature in the January isothermah is their general direction

from north to south, instead of from west to east, inferring the greatest cold not in

the north, but in the east. Between the Shetland Isles and the southern coast of

England (except Cornwall and Devon) there is no difference in the winter tempera-

ture ; but between the eastern coasts of England and the western coasts of Ireland

the difference amounts to about 10°; the former being, at an average, 35°, the latter

probably 45°. The coldest portion of Britain extends from the Naze to the Firth of

Forth,                       comprising  to the  west  all the  Pennine  chain                             in this  district an average
                                                                                                        ;

temperature of 35° to 36° prevails. On the continent the January temperature be-

comes lower in going eastward, precisely in the same ratio as in the British Isles,

and the isothermal of 28° extends as far west as the meridian of Gottingen and

Hanover. In Scandinavia the temperature decreases very suddenly, owing to the

snow-clad mountain masses which project in a high rampart on the western coasts.

The difference between Bergen and Christiania, two places in about the same lati-

tude, distant from each other IQO miles, amounts to as much as 14°, the former

being 35°"0, the latter 20°'8. The author then proceeded to allude to general and

local causes, by which these January' isothermals are regulated.

The average direction of the isothermals of the hottest month (July) is from S.W.

to N.E. The highest summer temperature in the British Isles, indicated by the

isothermal of C4°, occurs in the central portion of the south coast of England, the

lowest in the N.W. part of Scotland, and the difference appears to be at least 10°
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       j

while the difference between the western and eastern coasts is much less. The iso-

thermal of 62° extends to Lincoln, Birmingham, and the southernmost ponions of

Wales. All Ireland, Wales, northern part of England, and Scotland to the foot of

the Highlands, lie between the isothermals of 62° and 60°. North of the Highlands

the temperature is very considerably lower, Inverness having only 55°'7. By com-

paring the British Isles with parts of the continent in the same latitude, we find in

that of Dublin, 6l°-5, at the Dutch shores 64°, at Hamburg 65°. In the latitude

of Inverness (55°'7 temp.), Frederikshaven in Denmark 6l°'9, Goteburg in Sweden

63°"2                        between this latter place and Inverness the distance is 6()0 English miles.
                          ;

The author then alluded to the influence of temperature on the distribution of

plants, the districts of which he had found to be strikingly corroborative with the

general correctness of his isothermals (for his botanical observations he was greatly,

indebted to Mr. H. C. Watson, author of the ' Cybele Britannica,' &c.). There are

altogether a good number of plants in Britain which botanists are accustomed to re-

gard as western species, being frequently scattered along the western counties, from

Cornwall to Scotland, without passing into the eastern counties, unless at the south

or north extremities of Britain. Compared with each other, these western species
present much diflFerence in respect to the area, or space of Britain, over which they

are distributed respectively. But they correspond in the negative peculiarity of being

absent from that part of Britain which extends between the Firth of Forth and the

Lincolnshire Wash, and mostly absent from the whole eastern side of the island be-
tween the Thames and Murray Firth. This class of plants corresponds in their di-

stricts with the January isothermals. Other plants, less impatient of a cold winter,

but requiring a higher summer temperature, are found to run parallel with the July

Aisothermals.                great number of species, and the districts where they occur, were

named. Among the more important plants being limited by summer isothermals is

the vine, the northern limit of which is found to be between the July isothermals of
66° and 67°. In the valley of the Seine, it obtains its highest latitude between Louvier

and Andelys in about 49° north lat., but further east, near Berlin, it reaches nearly

52^°, a latitude corresponding with that of Norwich, Birmingham and Limerick.
   The author, in concluding his observations, expressed the hope to see this subject

further investigated ; especially to see the net of meteorological stations over the

--Contributions to Anemometry The Therm-anemometer. By John Phillips,

          F.R.S., Assistant- General Secretary to the British Association.

The author's researches into the force and velocity of wind have been directed to

the completion of a method of wind-registration which should be independent of
mechanical movements, momentum and friction *. He wished to register the wind

by one of the effects of the displacement of its molecules, not the movement of its

mass. For this purpose only one method has occurred to him as sufficiently appli-
cable, viz. the evaporation of a liquid. He has experimented on water, saline

solutions and alcoholic mixtures, and he finds that with either of these liquids an

instrument really indicating the movement of wind, by the registration of the eva-

      poration which the wind causes, is producible. Such an instrument

0--i  need occupy but a very small space, and will have the desirable quality

      of being most accurate in those very low velocities of wind which elude

      entirely Lind's anemometer, and are scarcely sensible by any register-

      ing machinery.

      It will be remembered, that for the interpretation of the register of

      evaporation into a register of wind velocity, it was necessary first to

correct for the hygrometric state of the air. This being done, the cooling power of

wind was found by experiment to be nearly as the square root of its velocity. In

this experimental result Professor Phillips was induced to place confidence, because

it appeared to represent and flow naturally from what may be thought the true phy-

sical action of the moving air.

Having lately occasion to examine extensively and carefully into the amount of

air which passes through the ramified passages of collieries, where the currents are

--sometimes so slow, that machine anemometers, even of a most delicate description,

are insensible to the movement of the air where even the miner's candle affords but

a rude guess, and where the situation is such that smoke or the powder flash can-

--not be appealed to he was happy to find that the problem was perfectly and easily

solved, by noting the cooling power of the current.

For this purpose a registering or integrating anemometer is not required. The

currents underground are steady, and require only an anemoscope or indicator of

the momentary velocity. Evaporation from the wet-bulb may therefore be aban-

doned ; the common thermometer, with its bulb clear of the frame, will answer the

purpose of experiment in every conceivable instance f.
   The author stated the general formula, to which he had been conducted by very

numerous experiments through a large range of velocities ascertained bv other means,

thus : -- r=iv.

   In this formula C and r are constants to be determined for the particular ther-
mometer in use ; s being the number of seconds which elapse in cooling through a
certain range (5°) from a point a certain number of degrees (10°) above the tempe-
rature of the moving air, v the movement of air in a given time (one second).

  The explanation is simple. A thermometer-bulb, heated above the temperature

of the surrounding air, is cooled by radiation and by convection.
    Omitting at present the consideration of the cooling in the fhermometer-bulb by

radiation (?·). the effect of air movement in lowering temperature is proportional to
the quantity of air {q) (or number of cooling elements) which passes the bulb, and to
the time of its action (s), or to qs, which will be a constant (C) for each instrument.
The quantity which passes is proportional to the velocity of the current, and to the

                                                                             Q

   tit appears from Prof. Forbes's Report on Meteorology to the British Association in

1832, that the idea of employing a thermometer for indicating the velocity of wind was en-

--tertained by Professor LesUe. It appears never to have been worked out. (J. P.)

By a great variety of experiments, r, the effect of radiation, is quite unimportant

in practice (less than half a foot in a sec.:;nd), except in very low velocities. Its

effect in combination appears to be constant for the same instrument, and precisely

similar to that of v, so as to be included v\'ith it. The formula thus becomes

   As already stated, he had made frequent and advantageous use of this cooling pro-
perty of the air for measuring its velocity in coal-mines. In these situations it is
perhaps the only accurate method which can be applied to determine the quantity of

--air which passes through the extremities of the workings by the bodies of the work-
--men engaged in cutting the coal at particular and critical outlets from the old
--wastes in contractions by brattices, scalings, and perforated doors. In one of the

most important of these cases, viz. the current of air by the bodies of the workmen
in the extremities of the ' intake ' system, he found enormous differences in different
coal districts ; but he forbore to mention them, because statements of this kind, un-
accompanied with full explanation, might lead to very erroneous conclusions re-
garding the relative safety and good management of mines, and prejudice important
inquiries now on foot.

   Professor Phillips found the therm-anemometer equally available in a great variety
of other researches, some results of which he hoped to present hereafter.

and yet to swim very light. Besides, this vessel was to be able to go backwards as
well as forwards equally well, and though a small boat was to contain great accom-

modation.

  Now it will be easily seen by those accustomed to the wave system, that the pro-

blem as thus stated is one to which the wave principle is far from seeming pecu-
liarly applicable. In the first place, it is well known that the wave principle pre-
scribes a different form of the bow for that of the stern, in order to obtain most
speed with least cost of power. In the second place, it is known that a high speed
requires, on the wave system, a very considerably greater length than was here al-

lowed for the entrance of the vessel, or the lines of the bow. It would therefore
seem at first to be a case that would in all probability prove too difficult for the
successful application of the wave system. It is on this account mainly that this

case seems to me important to the science of naval construction, and to the progress

of the wave system, and to the records of the British Association.
   There is one more feature in the case which gives it interest. At the same time,

the same problem was worked out by another party on another plan of construction,
not on the wave principle. Another vessel was built under similar conditions, and
furnished with engines of the best construction, made by one of the most eminent
engineers in England. Both these vessels were built at the same time, and tried
under similar circumstances ; therefore here was a case in which the practical value

of the wave principle has been brought to a test more direct and less questionable
than any that was likely to have occurred, and therefore more important to be placed

on the records of the British Association.

   The first question which will naturally occur to a Member of this Association
who recollects this principle, will be this : how could you apply the wave principle

--in a vessel made to go equally well both ways ? The first answer is ready it is

this, that the vessel cannot be made to go as fast as if designed with equal power to
go only one way, seeing that in one case she would have a best possible bow and a
best possible stern, and in the other case could have neither.

   The next point is this, that in both cases, of bow and of stern, it was necessary
to have a compromise. Each required to be in turn both bow and stern ; this was
accomplished in the following manner:

   If there be any point which has more forcibly struck me in the application of the

--wave principle than another, it is the flexibility of the wave principle the extent

to which it admits of deviations from its strict rules without losing the benefit of its
resistance. If it had unluckily been true of this system, that it prescribed an exact

mathematical solid in its three dimensions (like Newton's solid of least reaistance;,
to which implicit adherence was imperative, on pain of losing all the benefit prof-
fered, then indeed the system would have been (like Newton's) of little use, from
the fact that from causes independent of resistance, ships cannot be solids of revo-
lution, consistent with other qualities. The wave principle, on the contrary, pos-
sesses wonderful flexibility, first from the circumstance of its prescribing lines in one
plane only, and so leaving the other two dimensions in the hands of the practical

constructor, so that the sections of the vessel in one plane being given by the system,
the sections in two others are at the service of the constructor. This to the accom-

plished constructor is the greatest possible benefit ; to the ignorant constructor it

may be considered a great disadvantage, because it aflfords him no fixed rule in two
planes, and so leaves him open to commit a multitude of other errors in points which

are not questions of resistance ; but to the scientific constructor it gives precisely

that latitude which he desires, to leave him free to work out the intentions of the
owners and the uses of the ships he may have to build.

  --There is a second point in the wave system, which is another element of its ge-

neral usefulness it partakes of the nature of a mathematical maximum or minimum.
It is the peculiarity of a " maximum and of a minimum," that deviations on either
side of it to a moderate extent occasion deviations of magnitude that are compara-
tively very small. Thus it is that the wave line being considered as the curve of
least resistance, there are near to it an infinite number of approximate curves, which
are curves of small resistance, though not of least ; and out of these the constructor
is free to choose those which shall best accomplish any other object, at the sacrifice
of the smallest amount of resistance.
--32 REPORT 1849.

   It will readily be seen how these considerations enabled me to obtain in this case
the greatest amount of benefit out of the application of the wave system. I had in
this case to lay down for both ends of the vessel, that which is best for a bow, and

that which is best for a stern, at the given velocity. I had next to place relative
values on bow resistance and stern resistance. I had next to single out from between
those two lines, one which taken either as bow or stern would deviate least from
either, and so have least resistance on a mean of both directions. This therefore the
wave principle did ; it gave the limits, and gave also the choice of a series of means,
all more or less suited to the purpose intended.

   I have now shortly to state the practical details by which this process was carried
into effect, and the results arrived at in consequence. The engines of the vessel, as
well as the vessel, had to be constructed by my partner P4r. Albert Robinson and
myself, and we were enabled to adapt the one to the other with greater ease and
certainty than in all likelihood we could have done had the engineer been separate
from the ship-builder. In one case the engine was considered and made an actual

portion of the ship, and the ship of the engine. It will be fair therefore to deduct
from the good effects attributed to the wave form of the ship such advantages as we

possessed in building both engines and boilers and ship as one whole. Still it is fair
to remember, on the other side, that the builders of the engines with which ours had
to compete have been celebrated for their efficiency and for the large actual power
they have developed, when compared with their nominal power. It should also be
remembered that the builders opposed to us had previously built the fastest boats of
their district. The only advantages which, consistently with right feeling, we could
venture to claim over our competitors, were therefore the use of the wave system,
and the having designed both ship, boilers and engines ourselves, and constructed
them in our own works as one complete whole.

   The practical results obtained are as follows :

        I. Table of Comparative Experiments.

        Both vessels were about 150-155 feet long.
                                                22-224 feet beam.

of stroke to paddle-wheel in both cases ; and with only such differences as the engi-

neers and ship-builders in each case considered likely to be most successful incarrj'-

ing out the execution of their work to the best advantage ; the terms prescribed to

both builders by the engineer of the proprietors being identical, and with only such

latitude as should not form an obstacle to whatever might seem best suited for ob-

taining greatest efficiency.             ^

These are the results of accurate trials at the measured mile, made both with the

tide and against it. It is important to observe the amount of slip, as it serves to

show that it was no deficiency of the engine power which caused the difference, both

Aengines having gone at as nearly as possible the same speed.  higher speed might

have been taken for the wave- formed vessel, but this is given as that in which the

propelling powers were most nearly identical, and therefore the results in speed are

most directly comparable.

In order that the statement just given may not lead to false conclusions, it is ne-

cessary to state what were those minor differences in vessel and engine which each

constructor adopted as tending to greater efficiency. The wave vessel had a flatter

floor, five feet longer, and considerably squarer on the midship section; which was

done for diminishing the depth of water as wanted for her use. In the other vessel.
           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                           33

the consideration of draft of water was rejected or overlooked, and a finer midship
section taken, although with a larger draft of water. In one case also the rudders
were considered as part of the length of the vessel and treated accordingly ; and in
the other case rejected from it. In the engines, although the diameters of the
cylinders were identical, the stroke of the wave vessel was somewhat longer than
the other, but the diminished effective diameter in the shorter stroke reduced them
to nearly the same proportion.

   Thus far the experiments given only serve to prove that practically a considerably
better result has been obtained by a steam-vessel built on the wave principle than
by a competitor built under conditions that are perfectly identical, in so far as the
public and the owners are concerned.

   But as regards the purely scientific question, I shall add two other experiments
with the wave vessel, which furnish data of a more permanent and precise nature
one at a higher, the other at a lower velocity.

           The surface of vessel immersed was 3080-0 feet.

           Specimens of Incombustible Cloth. By James Latto, Dundee.

        Specimens of Incombustible Cloth for ladies' and children's dresses, raanufac-

I a lighted candle, or fire to such an extent as to injure the person who wears a dress
    made of it. It burns slowly, with a greenish flame, and is speedily extinguished.
        Rain or washing deprives' the cloth of its diflJcult combustibility, and it was with

     the view of directing the attention of chemists to the subject, so as to discover a
    method of giving the cloth a permanent incombustibility, that Mr. Latto was

The President exhibited a Universal Sun-dial, made by Mr. Sharp of Dublin. It

consists of a cylinder, set to the day of the month, and then elevated to the lati-

Atude.  thin plate of metal in the direction of its axis is then turned by a milled

head below it till the shadow is a minimum, when a dial on the top shows the

hours by one hand and the minutes by another. It appears that the time can be

obtained by this to the precision of about three seconds.

  Inquiries on some Modifications in the Colouring of Glass hy Metallic Oxides.

                                         By G. BoNTEMPs.

 In this communication some important practical points connected with the coloured
 ornamentation of glass and porcelain were brought forward. In the tirst place, it was
 shown that all the colours of the prismatic spectrum might be given to glass by the
 use of the oxide of iron in varying proportions and by the agency of different degrees
 of heat; the conclusion of the author being, that all the colours are produced in
 their natural disposition in proportion as you increase the temperature. Similar
«phaenomena were observed with the oxide of manganese. Manganese is employed
 to give a pink or purple tint to glass, and also to neutralize the slight green given by
 iron and carbon to glass in its manufacture. If the glass coloured by manganese re-
 mains too long in the melting-pot or the annealing-kiln, the purple tmx, turns first to
 a light brownish-red, then to t/elloiv, and afterwards to green. White glass in which
 a small proportion of manganese has been used is liable to become light yellow by ex-
 posure to luminous power. This oxide is also in certain window-glass disposed to
 turn pink or purple under the action of the sun's rays. M. Bcntenips has found that

 similar changes take place in the annealing-oven. He has determined, by experiments
 made by him on polyzonal lenses for M. Fresnel, that light is the agent producing

 the change mentioned ; and the author expresses a doubt whether any change in the

 oxidation of the metal will explain the photogenic effect. A series of chromatic

 changes of a similar character were observed with the oxides of copper; the colours
 being in like manner regulated by the heat to- which the glass was exposed. It was
 found that silver, although with less intensity^, exhibited the same phsenomena; and
 gold, although usually employed for the purpose of imparting varieties of red, was
 found by varying degrees of heating at a high temperature and recasting several times,
 to give a great niany tints, varying from blue to pink, red, opake yellow and green.
 Charcoal in excess in a mixture of silica-alkaline glass gives a yellow colour, which
 is not so bright as the yellow from silver; and this yellow colour may be turned to
 a dark red by a second fire. The author is disposed to refer these chromatic changes
 to some modifications of the composing particles rather than to any chemical changes
 in the materials employed.

 On an Improvement in the Preparation of Photographic Paper, for the pwposes

     of Automatic Registration ; in which a long-continued action is necessary.

    By C. Brooke, F.F.S.

    The preparation of the paper described previously, may be thus briefly stated.
 The paper is washed over by a bru.-ih with a solution of 12 grs. of bromide of
 potassium, 8 grs. of iodide of potassium, and 4 grs. of isinglass in one fluid ounce of di-
 stilled water, and dried quickly. When about to be used, it is washed over by a brush
 with a solution of 50 grs. of nitrate of silver to 1 fluid ounce of water, and placed on
 the cylinder of the registering apparatus, on which it remains in action for twenty-

 four hours. When removed, the impression is developed by brushing over a warm
              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTTONS.                             35

solution of gallic acid, containing 20 grs. in the fluid ounce, to which a little strong
acetic acid is added, and is then fixed with a solution of h)'posulphite of soda in
the usual manner. The present improvement consists in rinsing the paper in water
after the application of the solution of nitrate of silver, pressing out the superfluous
moisture in folds of blotting-paper, and then adding a little more of the solution of
nitrate of silver to the surface of the paper; this is most conveniently effected by pour-
ing a small quantity on the paper, and then passing a glass rod or tube lightly over
the paper, by which the solution is evenly distributed over the surface, and the con-
tact of organic matter avoided. The increased sensibility and improved cleanliness
of the paper consequent on this addition to the process, are presumed to depend on
the removal by washing of the nitrate of potash formed by the mutual decomposition
of the salts on the surface of the paper.

Researches on the Theory of the principal Phenomena of Photography in the
                      Daguerreotype Process. By A. Claudet.

The various questions treated by M. Claudet were the following:

1. What is the action of light on the sensitive coating?

2. How does the mercurial vapour produce the Daguerreotype image?

3. Which are the particular rays of ligiit that impart to the chemical surface the

affinity for mercury ?

4. What is the cause of the difTerence in achromatic lenses between the visual and

Whyphotogenic foci ?    do they constantly vary ?

5. What are the means of measuring the photogenic rays, and of finding the true

focus at which they produce the image?

Light produces two different effects on the Daguerreotype plate capable of giving

an image. By one the surface is decomposed, and the silver is precipitated as a white

powder; this action is very slow. By the other, the parts affected by light receive

an affinity for the mercurial vapour, and this metal is deposited in white crystals.

This action, which is the cause of the Daguerreotype image, is 3000 times more rapid

than that producing the decomposition of the surface. After having examined the

phaenomena of these two actions, M. Claudet considers that it is impossible to refer

them to the same cause. The first is a chemical decomposition of the surface, and

the second is a mere new property imparted to the surface to attract the vapour of

mercury, which is given by some particular rays and withdrawn by some other rays.

The most refrangible rays produce the affinity for mercury, and the least refrangible

withdraw it.

M. Claudet afterwards explained the principle of his photographometer, and

several improvements he has lately made in that instrument, by which he can com-

pare upon the same plate a series of intensities in a geometrical progression, varying

from 1 to 512, and when employing two plates at the same moment, from 1 to 8192;

--and by another modification of the instrument by shutting one-half of every hole

through which the light has affected the plate, and submitting this half to radiation

--through red, orange or yellow glasses he can study the modifications produced on

these various intensities of effect, by these coloured or insulated radiations. The ex-

periments to which M. Claudet refers would be too long to enumerate here, and

we shall conclude by alluding to the most important point of this paper, which is the

question of the difference between the visual and photogenic foci in achromatic

lenses, and the constant variations they undergo by the influence of unknown causes,

at all events, which he has not been able to ascertain. It is known that several years

ago M. Claudet was the first to point out the difference between the two foci, and

the necessity for the operator to place exactly the plate at the point where the pho-

togenic focus is produced, in order to have a correct Daguerreotype image. But

the new important fact lately observed by M. Claudet refers to the constant variation

between the proportionate distance of these two foci. It appears that, according to

some causes which M. Claudet has not been yet able to discover, the two foci for

the same distance of an object are sometimes coinciding, and sometimes very far,

one from the other; and what is most remarkable is, that the difference varies ac-

cording to some properties of the lenses, in such a manner that when the two foci

coincide in one case they may be very much separated in the other.

                                                                    3*

On the Formation of Dolomite. By Professor Fohchhammer.

   Prof. Forchhamm^r communicated some observations upon dolomites. He stated!
that the white chalk of Denmark is covered by a bed only a few feet thick, contain-]
ing corals of the genera Cnrt/opht/Uia and Ocitlina, and a number of fossils different!
from those of the white chalk; that this bed, which may be seen over a great part
of Denmark always in the same position, the same fossiliferous character, and the
same thickness, is enlarged in the hill of Faxoe to a thickness which cannot be much

less than 150 feet. Here the Faxoe limestone is covered by a bed of dolomite, which

again is covered by a thick bed of limestone, consisting almost entirely of fragments

of Bryozoa, and belonging likewise to the chalk formation. The limestone of Faxoe

contains about 1 per cent, of carbonate of magnesia, arising from the shells and corals,

which always contain it in a small quantity, but which in some instances, as in the

Ms and some Scrpults, amounts to 6 or 7 per cent. The bryozoan limestone which

covers the dolomite contains not more than 1 per cent, of carbonate of magnesia,

while the dolomite contains 16 or 17 per cent.

   The dolomite occurs generally in round globular masses, very similar to those of

Humbledon Hill, and are evidently, like most of the globular masses of limestone,

such as confetti di Tivoli and the peastone from Carlsbad, the produce of springs; an
opinion which is still more confirmed by a number of large vertical tube-like cavities,

which pass through the compact limestone, and are completely similar to those de-

scribed by severaf English geologists as passing through the chalk, which liave been
recognized as the natural pipes of springs, 'i'hus the Faxoe dolomite is the produce
of springs; but then these springs have deposited stalagmitic limestone wherever

they have passed through the crevices of the limestone rock, which, as a more or less

Nowthick coating, covers all the fossils.  this produce of the springs contains only a

very small quantity of magnesia, but, besides lime, a great quantity of oxide of iron.

It appears thus that if no other reaction takes place than the escape of carbonic acid,

the springs do not deposit carbonate of magnesia, but that the dolomite is formed
where the carbonic acid springs come in contact with sea water.

   The author has made a great number of experiments on the decomposition which
takes place when water containing carbonates dissolved by carbonic acid acts upon

sea water, and found that always a more or less great quantity of carbonate of mag-

nesia was precipitated with the carbonate of lime. When using water containing
only carbonate of lime, the quantity of carbonate of magnesia thrown down at a boil-
ing heat amounted to 12^ per cent., the rest being carbonate of lime. The results

of this decomposition vary however very much, and according to conditions not yet
well known. So nmch however may be stated, that the quantity of carbonate of
magnesia precipitated increases with the increasing temperature. Water which, be-
sides carbonate of lime, contains carbonate of soda, throws down a much larger quan-

tity of carbonate of magnesia, amounting in one experiment to 27'93 per cent, of the

precipitate.

springs of Germany would form, if they at the boiling-point acted upon sea water.

 On a New Method of ascertaining the Quantity of Organic Matter in Water.
                                    By Prof. FORCHHAMMER.

   The test which the author applies is hypermanganesiate of potash or soda, which
he prepares in this way; he heats the hydrate of potash or soda with chlorate of pot-
asii and peroxide of manganese, according to the method of VVohler. After heating,
the salt is thrown into water, and so much diluted muriatic acid is added that it
assumes a bluish-red colour, upon which carbonic acid gas is led through, until the
colour has become bright red and the manganesiate of potash completely converted
into hypermanganesiate. The liquid must be cleared, either by allowing it to deposit
all the oxide of uianganese, or by filtering it through asbestos. This liquid may be
kept for a very long time unaltered in a glass vessel with a glass stopper. The next
process is to ascertain the strength of the test, which is done by taking any deter-
mined measure of it, mixing it with water and a little alcohol, and then heating it.
All the manganese is thrown down, and after being washed and exposed to a strong
red heat, it is the compound oxide of manganese, 3Mn-f 40.

   This test is now applied in such a way, that, for instance, one pound of the water
which is to be tried is mixed with a small quantity of the test and boiled; if the colour

has disappeared, another quantity is added, and the liquor again boiled, until, in going
on in that way, the red colour of the liquid does not disappear any longer. After that
it is allowed to cool, and then the quantity of hypermanganesiate of potash, which has
not been decomposed for want of organic matter in the water, is determined by com-
paring its colour with distilled water, to which have been added very small deter-
mined quantities of the test solution. If the quantity of the test which thus is added
in excess is subtracted from the whole quantity which has been used, the real quan-
tity of decomposed hypermanganesic acid is determined, and thus also the quantity
of organic matter itself. This method is liable to one fault, viz. that the nature of
the organic matter may be different, and accordingly require different quantities of
the test liquor to be decomposed. But the organic matter which generally occurs
in water is approaching almost always to humic acid, and thus the determination of
the organic matter is practicable. As to that part of the organic matter in water
which contains nitrogen, the author thinks that he has found out a method to de-
termine it by itself; but not having yet finished his experiments on that point, he
must leave it out of the question.

    Water taken from a greensand spring about twelve miles from Copenhagen, con-
 tained so little organic matter that 1 pound only required 6 measures of a test solu-
 tion, of which 100 measures contained the manganese of 0"526 of the double oxide
of manganese, while water taken from a lake which communicates with a peat moss,
 required for 1 pound 74 measures of the same liquor. Prof. Forchhammer, con-

tinuing for a whole year every week this analysis of the water which is used to pro-
vide Copenhagen, observed the following facts :

   1. The quantity of organic matter is greatest in summer.
    2. It disappears, for the most part, as soon as the water freezes.
    3. Its quantity is diminished by rain.
   4. Its quantity is diminished if the water has to run a long way in open channels.

                  On the Compounds of the Halogens with Phosphorus.
                                 By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D.

   It is well known that chlorine, bromine, and iodine will combine directly with
phosphorus, yielding compounds containing three atoms of the halogen. Cyanogen
does not so combine. If a larger amount of the halogen be employed, compounds

are formed containing five atoms. Ail these substances are neither basic nor acid j
they are resolved l)y water into the hydracids of the halogens, and phosphorous or
phosphoric acid. If phosphorus be distilled with chloride, bromide, or iodide of mer-
cur}', the ter-compound results. There exists a ter-fluoride (Davy). The ter-cya-
nide is doubtful.

   The penta-compounds of the halogens with phosphorus may easily be reduced to
the ter-compounds. The addition of fresh phosphorus will effect this in each instance.

Phosphuretted hydrogen has already been observed to reduce the pentachloride; it
has the same effect upon the pentabromide. Hydrogen alone has no reducing power
upon either of these compounds. Heat alone however will effect the reduction of
the pentabromide J if a current of dry air be passed over it at 212° F., so as to re-

move the free bromine, pure terbromide is obtained. The higher compound of iodine
and phosphorus may be similarly decomposed, but not the pentachloride.

  --The force of affinity for phosphorus is in the order chlorine, bromine, iodine. The

ter-compounds are not directly acted upon by oxygen or sulphur, but suffer double
decomposition by water or hydrosiilphuric acid. The comparative feebleness with
which the two additional atoms of the penta-compounds are combined, is also evident
from the action of certain non-metallic elements; thus, iodine reduces the pentabro-
mide of phosphorus. The moderated action of water upon the pentachloride forms an
oxychloride of phosphorus (Wurtz), and there exists an oxybromide of phosphorus,

PBrgOo, exactly analogous. No compound, similar to the sulphochloride of phos-

phorus of Serullas, is formed by the action of hydrosulphuric acid on the pentabro-
mide, but a liquid, the analysis of which appears to suggest the composition SPBrj

-f PS3. No such compounds exist in the iodine series.
   The increased stability, which the substitution of two atoms of oxygen, or sulphur,

--for two atoms of the halogen, imparts to the remaining three atoms, is manifest from
    1, the non-action of hydrosulphuric acid; 2nd, the fact that metals, even potas-
sium, are not attacked by them ; 3rd, the non-action of phosphorus.

    Hydrochloric acid produces no partial double decomposition with the pentabromide
or pentiodide. Nor does any halogen combine directly with the ter-compound of
another with phosphorus. If bromine and iodine be presented simultaneously to

the terchloride, pentabromide of phosphorus is formed. A colourless crystalline body

exists, belonging to the bromine series, never obtained in quantity, possibly isomeric
with the oxybromide.

   Sulphur appears to combine directly with pentachloride of phosphorus when they
are fused together; a crystalline body, and a straw-coloured liquid result. The
analysis of these compounds is attended with peculiar difficulty, nor had the author
sufficient time to investigate all the anomalies of their decomposition. The straw-
coloured liquid however would appear to be P CI5 S4. The provisional name of Sul-
phurets of the Pentachloride of Phosphorus is given.

   On a continued spontaneous Evolution of Gas at the Village of Charlemont,
                          Staffordshire. By Samuel Howard.

   In a field by the side of a lane, near the village of Charlemont in Staflfbrdshire,
certain patches of ground had been noticed, which, without any apparent cause, were
destitute of vegetation. They excited little attention, as they were supposed to be

what are commonly called fairy rings, and it was not till the summer of 1846 that
 their true character was discovered.

    The person who first paid particular attention to the cause of these barren spots,
 was the tenant of a neighbouring cottage (at which there is a cold bath, noted in the
vicinity for its sanative properties). From certain circumstances he was led to be-
 lieve that something permeated the earth in those spots; and having dug a hole, he
inserted a gas-pipe, and on applying a light to the mouth of the pipe, he found to his

great surprise that a large flame issued from it. It was not long before he conceived
the idea of applying it to domestic purposes, and in pursuing his experiments he found
that it was not necessary to convey it from the place where it was first discovered,
at a distance of about 150 yards from his house, as on driving a pipe some inches
into the ground under the floor of the cottage, he procured a continuous flow of gas.

    There are at the present time seven burners in the cottage, which enable the owners
to dispense with fire and candles. The next cottage is also supplied with two. It ap-
pears to make no difference to the supply of gas if allowed to burn for weeks toge-
ther, and the flame is always of the same colour. In windy weather the flame is
generally unsteady ; when there is a blast of wind outside the flames of gas rise seve-
ral inches, but as each blast dies away they return to their original size. The escape
of gas is larger in wet weather than in dry ; but whether the gas is produced near the
surface or otherwise has not yet been satisfactorily ascertained. The place where it
issues from the earth is quite a mile from any coal-pit, and is outside the eastern edge
of the Staffordshire coal basin.

   The gas, as analysed by myself from a portion of it (procured for me by Mr. S.

Lloyd, jun. of Wednesbury, about three miles from the place), was composed prin-
cipally of light carburetted hydrogen. In 1000 volumes of the gas, as it rises, I pro-
cured 996 vols, of light carburetted hydrogen, .3 of carbonic acid, and 1 of aqueous
vapour and nitrogen. Its specific gravity is 0'56126. Its composition is somewhat
different from the gas known as marsh gas, and from that which collects in the old
workings of mines, as it contains less carbonic acid, and less nitrogen ; the propor-

tion in marsh gas of the fornieJ' being --^ and of the latter ^^ to ^V. whereas in this

   It burns with a pale bluish-white flame, emitting considerable light and heat.

Mixed with atmospheric air or oxygen, it explodes with considerable violence on con-
tact with flame, or with the electric spark. As it issues from the pipe it has a moist
or slightly musty smell, as of sticks partially decomposed, but after keeping for some

Whentime in stopped glass jars this is lost, and it becomes perfectly inodorous.

inhaled in large quantities it produces the same effects as hydrogen gas, but it does

not appear to exert any evil influence on the health of the inhabitants of the cottage,
when diluted with a large portion of atmospheric air.

On Copper containing Phosphorus, with Details of Experiments on the Corrosive
  Action of Sea-water on some Varieties of Copper, By John Percy, M.D.,

   F.R.S.

Upon analysing a specimen of copper, to which when in a state of fusion some

phosphorus had been added, it was found that it contained a considerable quantity

of phosphorus, and also a large portion of iron derived from an iron rod employed in
stirring the mixture at each addition of the phosphorus. The copper employed

--was of the " best selected " it appeared to be harder than copper treated with

arsenic. The details of the analysis of 1 1 676 grains were given, the result of which

was

It has long been stated that a very small quantity of phosphorus renders copper ex-
tremely hard, and adapts it for cutting instruments, but such an alloy as that formed

by Dr. Percy lias not previously been formed. It is a remarkable fact, that the pre-

sence of so large a quantity of phosphorus anil iron should so little affect the tenacity

and malleability of the copper. The effect also of phosphorus in causing soundness
in the casting of copper is interesting, and may be of practical importance. Some

experiments were next described, made by Capt. James of Portsmouth, bearing on
the oeconomic value of the alloy of phosphorus and copper. By the experiments made

by Capt. James on the corrosive action of sea- water, it would appear that this com-
pound was much less affected tlian most other specimens of copper tried. The re-

sults derived from exposing measured pieces of copper to the action of sea-water for

nine months were as follows :

The results appear to be of sufficient importance to excite attention to the fact, and
to elicit further inquiry, especially when it is remembered how important and ceco-

nomi'; a desideratum it is to the Admiralty to diminish or prevent the corrosive effect

of sea- water upon copper.

On the Decomposition and partial Solution of Minerals, Rocks, 8<c. by pure

   Water and Water charged with Carbonic Acid. By Prof. W. B. Rogers and

   Prof. R. E. RoGKRS, of the University of Virginia.

  In opening this communication. Prof. W. B. Rogers adverted to its important bear-

ings upon the chemistry of geology, and the theories of the formation of soils and of

the nutrition of plants. He referred to the comparatively isolated experiments of
Struve, Forchhammer and others, as being of too restricted a scope to furnish a basis

for reasoning generally on the disintegration of rocks, the formation of chalcedonic,
zeolitic and other minerals by solution, and the conveyance of inorganic materials
into the structure of plants. It therefore becomes a question of importance, whether
water pure, or charged with carbonic acid, possesses that general decomposing and
dissolving power which some chemists have vaguely and without sufficient evidence
ascribed to it, or whether this action applies only to the few materials hitherto tried,
and which all contain an alkali.

   The experiments of the Professors Rogers were of two kinds ; first, by an extempora-
neous method with the tache ; and secondly, hy prolonged digestion at the ordinary tem-
[jcrature. In the former, a small quantity of the mineral in very fine powder is di-
gested for a few moments on a small filter of purified paper, and a single clear drop
of the liquid received on a platinum slip is dried and examined by appropriate tests
before and after ignition. In the second process a quantity of the finely-powdered
mineral is placed with the liquid in a green glass bottle and agitated from time to
time for a prescribed period. The liquid separated by filtration is evaporated to dry-
ness in a platinum capsule. The residuum is then critically examined, and, if in suf-
ficient amount, is submitted to quantitative analysis.

    In both processes two parallel experiments were made, the one with pure aerated
water, the other with water charged to saturation at 60° with carbonic acid. In the
second process, correction was made for the alkali, lime, &c. dissolved from the con-
taining glass, by making separate experiments in similar vessels without the mineral
powders.

   1. When the substance is very minutely powdered before mingling it with the

liquid, even the first drops that pass the filter will commonly give a tache containing
some of the alkali or alkaline earth that has been dissolved. In this way proof of
the action of the carbonated water may generally be obtained in a few minutes after
adding it to the powder. In the case of pure water the action is feebler and requires
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  41

a longer time, but with nearly all the substances enumerated it is distinct, and with

some of them quite intense.
   2. By an independent series of experiments to determine the effects of lieat, which

were made upon the taches of potassa and soda and their carbonates, and upon those
of carbonate of lime and magnesia, as well as upon considerable quantities of these
substances successively exposed in a crucible to the heat of the table blowpipe, it

--was found that the order of volatility was as follows : potassa, soda, magnesia, lime.

The tache of potassa disappeared almost at once, that of soda lingered some time,
that of magnesia wasted more slowly, while that of lime remained with little altera-

tion for a long time.

   Before heat was applied the tache oHhe alkalies or their carbonates would of course
be strongly alkaline. That of the carbonate of magnesia also presented a decided

and sometimes strong reaction with the test-paper, while that of carbonate of lime
gave a merely appreciable effect. But on raising the tache to a red heat, the car-
bonate of lime, by escape of carbonic acid, would acquire intense alkalinity, the re-
action of the magnesia tache would be but little altered, and that of the alkaline

taches would be almost or entirely destroyed.
   As examples of this distinctive testing and of the mode of proceeding in these tache

experiments. Professors Rogers gave some details, extracted from the large mass of
unpublished results, and called attention particularly to the contrasting phaenomena
in the cases of Leucite, Olivine and Epidotej the first characterized by potassa, the

second by magnesia, and the last by lime.
   Thus in the case of Leucite, the water tache and carbonic acid water tache were

both alkaline, the latter very strongly so. But even gentle ignition for a few seconds,

or strong ignition for a moment, was found entirely to dissipate the alkali.
    In the case of Olivine, the water tache was decidedly alkaline, and that from car-

bonic acid water greatly more so. Ignition produced for the first second or two but
little change, but its continuance caused a gradual diminution of the alkaline re-
action, which at the end of ten seconds was reduced to about one-twelfth of what it

was at first.
    With Epidote the tache presented an extremely feeble reaction before heating.

Ignited for a moment, the alkalinity was intense, and after ten seconds of ignition but

little abatement of the alkaline reaction was discerned.
    3. Referring to the second method of experimenting used by the Professors Rogers,

viz. that o(prolonged digestion in water oi- carbonic acid water. Profs. Rogers exhibited
results obtained with hornblende, epidote, chlorite, mesotype, &c., showing that the
amount of solid matter dissolved by the carbonated water in many of these cases is
quite sufficient for a qualitative analysis, even when the digestion has only been con-

tinued for forty-eight hours. When further prolonged, they have procured from the

Hquid a quantity of lime, magnesia, oxide of iron, alumina, silica and alkali, the dis-
solved ingredients of these minerals severally amounting sometimes to nearly one

per cent, of the whole mass.
    4. In connection with theprecedinginvestigntions, the Professors Rogers were led to

 an examination of the comparative solubility of carbonate of lime and carbonate of mag-
 nesia in carbonated water. In the standard chemical and geological works the car-
 bonate of lime is stated to be the more soluble, and on this supposed fact is founded
a common theory of the origin of the large quantities of carbonate of magnesia in
 the niagnesian limestones. It was conceived that in a mixed limestone containing
 both the carbonates, the relative amount of carbonate of magnesia would be augmented
 through the more rapid removal of the carbonate of lime by the percolating waters,
 and that thus the mass would approach mpre and more to the composition of a do-

 lomite.

    The experiments of the Professors Rogers demonstrate that in water impregnated
 with carbonic acid, carbonate of magnesia is much more soluble than carbonate of lime.
 Thus, by allowing the slightly-carbonated water to filter through a mass of magnesian
 limestone in fine powder, and collecting the clear liquid, analysis detected a much
 larger proportion of carbonate of magnesia in the solution, in comparison with the
 carbonate of lime, than corresponded with the amount of these substances relatively
 in the powdered rock. Again, by agitating briskly a quantity of the powder with the
 carbonated water in a glass vessel and then separating the liquid by filtration, it was
--42 REPORT 1849.

 found that a larger relative amount of the carbonate of magnesia had been taken up
 by the solvent than of carbonate of lime.

    From these experiments the Professors Rogers infer that the infiltering rain-water,
 with its slight charge of carbonic acid, in passing through or between strata of mag-
 nesian limestone, will remove the carbonate of magnesia more rapidly than the car-
 bonate of lime, and that thus the rock will gradually become relatively less magnesian,
 instead of being made to approach the condition of a dolomite, as is commonly main-

 tained.

    Professors Rogers called attention to the fact, that the stalactites in caverns of mag-
nesian limestone contain only minute quantities of carbonate of magnesia. An exa-
 mination of those in Weyer's cave in Virginia had proved that while the milky white
 opake stalactites contain a small but measurable amount, the sparry and more trans-
 parent kinds are almost destitute of a trace of this ingredient. It is evident that in
 such cases the carbonate of magnesia is carried off by the liquid below, and that such
is the case seems to be confirmed by the fact of the large amount of carbonate of
magnesia found in the springs in the immediate neighbourhood of the cave just
named.

   5. A fact of much interest noticed in these experiments is the comparative readi-

ness with which the magnesian and calcareo-magnesian silicates yield to the decom-
posing and dissolving action of carbonated water and even simple water. This ex-
plains the rapid decomposition of most rocks composed of hornblende, epidote, &c.,
without calling in the agency of an alkali, and it enables us to trace the simple pro-
cess by which plants are furnished with the lime and magnesia they require from soils
containing these silicates, without our having recourse to any mysterious decom-
posing power of the roots of the growing vegetable.

    6. In their tache ex[)eriments, the Professors Rogers ascertained that the powder of
anthracite, bituminous coal and lignite all yielded a discernible amount of alkali to
the carbonated water, while the ashes of these materials, similarly treated, gave no
alkaline trace on the test-paper. This they think is at once explained by the high
temperature at which the ash is formed, which by experiments already noticed is
quite sufficient to dissipate any portion of alkali or carbonate originally present in
the material.

On the Allotrop'ic Condition of Phosphorus. By Prof. Schroetteh of Vienna.

   This communication being already before the world in the 'Annuaire de Chimie' of
Millon and Reiset, it is unnecessary to do more than briefly state the facts, which Prof,

Schroetter illustrated by experiment. When phosphorus is exposed to light or heat,

it is found that a peculiar change of colour takes place, and that although it under-
goes no chemical change, a very remarkable physical difference is found to have

ensued. The ordinary yellow phosphorus is highly inflammable. The allotropic red
phosphorus was not ignited by friction, nor by those agents which acted energetically
upon the common variety.

On the combined Use of the Basic Acetates of Lead and Sulphurous Acid in the
      Colonial Manufacture and the Refining of Sugar, By Dr. Scoffekn.

   Dr. Scoffern, after a few preliminary remarks on the anomalies which beset the
colonial manufacture of sugar, stated the actual amount of pure v.'hite and crystalliz-
able sugar existing in the sugar-cane juice to be from 17 to 23 per cent., and the
amount of juice contained in the cane to be about 90 per cent. Of this amount
only 60 per cent, on an average is extracted, and of this quantity only one-third
part of its sugar is obtained, in a dark impure condition, instead of white and pure,
as it might be extracted. The operation at present generally followed in the
colonial production of sugar involved the use of lime, an agent which, although
beneficial in separating certain impurities and decomposing others, effects both these
agencies at the expense of two-thirds of the original sugar.

   Various plans had been followed to avoid the use of lime; alumina in its hydrated
condition had been employed, but with inconsiderable success. As a purifying agent
the basic acetate of lead was known to be most potent, but could not be generally
employed, owing to the existence of no efficient means of separating any excess of
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                  43

that agent which might remain. Dr, Scoffern effects this separation by means of
sulphurous acid forced by mechanical means into the sugar solutions. The process
had been used for more than twelve months in one of the large British refineries,
and a lump of sugar prepared by means of the operation was exhibited.

  --The advantages presented by this operation were thus summed up:

    1. As applied to cane-juice, and other natural juices containing sugar, it enables
the whole of the latter to be extracted, instead of one-third, as is now the case, and
in the condition of perfect whiteness, if desired, without the employment of animal
charcoal. Owing to the complete separation of impurities, the juice throws up no
scum when boiled, and therefore involves no labour of skimming. Finally, the pro-
cess of curing is effected in less than one-third of the present time; and the sugar
being in all cases pure and dry, no loss in weight occurs during the voyage home.

   2. As applied to the refinery operation, it enables the manufacturer to work upon
staples of such impurity that he could not use them on the old process. It yields
from these staples a produce equal in quality to the best refined sugars produced
heretofore, in larger quantity and in less time. It banishes the operation of scum
pressing, the employment of blood and lime. Finally, its cost is even less than that
of the present refinery process.

On the Composition of the Ash of Armaria maritima, grown in different Locali-
   ties, and Remarks on the Geographical Distribution of that Plant, and the
  Presence of Fluorine in Plants. By Dr. A. Vcelcker.

   The presence of iodine in plants growing near the sea, and the absence of that ele-
ment in the same species of plants growing in inland situations, have been noticed
some years ago by Dr. Dickie of Aberdeen, who likewise found that in the former
soda was more abundant, and potash prevailed in the latter. The author found Dr.
Dickie's observations confirmed by his own, and no qualitative analyses of the sea-
piuk {Armeria maritima) having been made, he analysed the ashes of specimens from
three different localities, and obtained the following results (the carbonic acid and

sand found by actual experiment havingbeen deducted, the result calculated for 100):

No. T. was grown near the sea-shore, and washed by the sea-spray at high water.
No. II. was grown on an elevated granitic rock opposite the former locality.
No. HI. in Mr. Lawson's nursery near Edinburgh.

Several observations are suggested by the inspection of the above results:
1. The proportion of alkaline chlorides, as well as that of silica, in all three ashes

is considerable.

   2. The quantity of soda is more abundant in the ash of specimens grown near the
sea-shore, whilst potash prevails in those grown on the rock.

   3. Soda is entirely replaced in the ash oi Armeria maritima grown in the nursery.
   4. The larger quantity of phosphoric acid and potash in the ash of specimens grown
in the nursery, viewed in connection with the greater vigour and the somewhat changed
natural character of the cultivated plant, appears to exercise a great influence on the
natural character of Armaria maritima.
--44 REPORT 1849.

5. Traces of fluorine, hitherto found in only few plants, were distinctly detected

in ail three ashes; iodine only in specimens grown near the seashore.

The author then adverted to the geographical distribution of the sea-pink in Ger-

many, and represented the above analyses as well-calculated to throw light on the

causes which contribute to chain some plants to a particular well-defined geognostic

formation, by showing that a soil deficient in soluble silica and alkaline chlorides, of

which the sea-pink requires a considerable quantity, is unable to sustain the life of that

plant. According to Schleiden, the sea-pink, found everywhere upon the arid sand-

dunes of the northern coasts of England, is universally distributed over the sandy plains

of northern Germany. In middle and southern Germany it is found only in a few

places, and these arc distinguished by their arid, sandy character j and curiously enough,
we find that the Armeria marltima disdains the richest soils in its range of geographical
distribution. Thus we find in northern Germany the granite, clay-slate and gypsum

of the Hartz mountains, and rhe porphyry and muschelkalk of Thuringia, setting a

limit to the Armeria viaritima, and we meet with it only until we arrive at the Keuper

sand plains in the neighbourhood of Nuremberg. In southern Germany it is found

extending through the Palatinate, but neither on the Suabian Alps nor the whole

alpine region is it found, and it appears at last again on the sandy plains of northera
Italy. The fact that the sea-pink is not found in every sandy soil in Germany, sug-

gests the idea that those inland localities where it occurs have been perhaps the
bottoms of ancient lakes, and that the soil in these places will contain much salt. In

England and Scotland the sea-pink is found universally on the sea-coasts, but with a

Afew exceptions, we do not meet with it in inland situations.  remarkable excep-

tion of this general rule of its geographical distribution in England is offered by the

appearance o? Armeria maritima on the summits of several mountains of the Scottish

Howhighlands.      does it happen that it does not occur in the lowlands and localities

much nearer the sea? The author regretted to have been unable to procure the

material for an analysis, which might probably have assisted him in throwing light

on the subject; but expressed the hope to be enabled to examine the ash of specimens

from the Highlands in the course of the current year, specimens having been pro-

mised to him by Prof. Balfour of Edinburgh. In the meantime he communicated an

analysis of dried specimens which he obtained from the herbarium of the Botanical
Society of Edinburgh, but for obvious reasons he does not put much confidence in
the accuracy of these analytical results. The analysis however indicated likewise a

considerable amount of alkaline chlorides in the ash oi Armeria maritima from the

Scottish Highlands. Armeria maritima is not the only marine plant which presents

this peculiarity; several others, for instance Plantago maritima, are found under

similar circumstances. Having had no opportunity of examining the localities in

the Highlands where these plants occur, the author declined to enter on the theory

of this peculiar occurrence, further than to ascribe an important share to the salt,

which in the spray of the sea is often carried to considerable heights into the air, and

which, it is not unreasonable to suppose, has been deposited again by the rain, par-

ticularly in those places which are exposed to regular sea-winds, in such quantities

as to answer to the requirements of the sea-pink and other marine plants. He con-

sequently recommended naturalists interested in the subject to ascertain whether

those localities in Highland mountains, where these marine plants occur, are exposed

to frequent sea-winds or not, and to pay general attention to the meteorological

conditions of these places.

In conclusion, the author stated that distinct traces of fluorine had been detected

in the three different ashes oi Armeria maritima, and likewise in the ash of Cochharia

officinalis. In the ashes of Dutch Kanaster tobacco no fluorine could be detected, but
as tobacco leaves are soaked in water when prepared for Kanaster, it may be that the

trace of fluoride of calcium, if present, has been dissolved out by the water, fluoride

of calcium having been shown to be joluble in water, to some extent, by Dr. G. Wil-

son of Edinburgh,

The simultaneous presence of silica in the ashes of most plants renders the detec-

tion of fluorine rather difficult, because the methods hitherto known for tracing the

presence of fluorine in siliceous mixtures are impracticable, in all cases in which we

have to deal with traces of fluorine and large quantities of silica. By following a

plan recommended by Dr. G. Wilson, the author was enabled to prove distinctly the

presence of fluorine iu the above plants, and he h confident that other chemists, fol-

lowing the same direction, will find it in other plants in which it is likely to occur.

             On a Form of Galvanic Battery. By W. H. Walenn.

   The present form of battery has been the result of an attempt to combine the prin-

--ciples of the batteries now in use, and to avoid some of their present inconveniences.
   Its metallic elements are, highly carbonized cast iron as a negative plate, and
zinc, prepared in a way to be described afterwards, as a positive plate.

   The solution is formed by dissolving some of the cast-iron plates, intended to form
the negative plates, in one part by measure of oil of vitriol to eight of water, and
when there is no free acid in the liquor, adding one-eighth of oil of vitriol.

   In the last battery made (one of 6-inch square plates) the zinc plates were prepared
by dipping them in dilute sulphuric acid, to cleanse thera, washing them well in water,
then dipping them in a solution of acetate of lead, and drying the laminal deposit

thus obtained over a charcoal fire; mercury, with a little dilute sulphuric acid being
then rubbed over the plate, unites with the lead, and this amalgam with the zinc; the
excess of mercury is then driven off by second heating over a charcoal fire, and the
plate is prepared.

   In the form which I have employed, the plates are fixed in a skeleton frame of
wood, one-sixteenth of an inch apart, alternately iron and zinc, with glass plates be-
tween every metallically connected pair ; the frame with its plates is then placed
in a trough (of glass in this instance) containing the solution as made above.

   The quantity of electricity passing has been tested with two separate galvano-
meters, and found to be half that evolved from a Maynocth battery, with plates of
the same area, in a given time : this experiment has been repeatedly tried when the
battery has been just put to work, and when it has been at work with a galvanometer
in the circuit a whole day.

   One galvanometer was not very delicate, either in the mounting of the needle or
the thinness and number of convolutions of its wire, being designed rather for the

measure of large quantities of electricity, than to test the existence of a small
amount.

   The other was extremely delicate in the mounting of the needle, and therefore
could be depended on for its registrations ; the current from a single cell battery,
having a positive plate of 16 square inches active surface, and two negative plates of
the same active surface each, passing through a wire one-sixteenth of an inch dia-
meter, and 1 J inch from the needle, immediately beneath it, deflected the needle
more than 30°.

    In estimating the quantity of electricity evolved from different batteries, Barlow's
theorem was used; viz. that the quantity of electricity passing through a given gal-
vanometer is directly proportional to the tangent of the angle of deflection.

   It was observed, in testing the above single cell battery, that in every instance
when the battery contact was broken, a small bright spark was visible in daylight.

   It has been remarked that the longer the same solution has been used in an active
battery, the longer will the addition of a given quantity of sulphuric acid keep the
flowing current of electricity constant; also that the battery is much more energetic
if it be left out of action, for a time equal to that during which it has been in ac-
tion, immersed in water; it is also necessary that a considerable volume of solution
should surround the plates.

   This battery is clearly a combination of the principles of the batteries known as
Daniell's, Suiee's, Van Melsen's, Chevalier Bunsen's, Sturgeon's, the Maynooth,
Schonbein's Inactive and Active Wrought Iron Batteries, and Robert's.

   The following advantages peculiar to these.batteines, follow from what has been
said above :

    1 Great strength of current both in intensity and quantity.
    2. Constancy of action.
   3. Protosulphate of iron in pure crystals, and pure carbon in fine powder as a sale-
able residuum, also a sulphate of zinc.
    4. Very great reduction in the current expense of batteries as well as their first
cost, porous tubes not being used.
--46 REPORT 1849.

   5. The plates may be placed at the sixteenth of an inch, and even less, apart : an
enormous acting surface may thus be obtained in a very small space, and an additional
strength of galvanic current, owing to the nearness of the plates.

   6. 'J'here is no danger of the boiling of the solution.
   7. The plates once arranged in a suitable framing would not require to be disturbed
for a very considerable period.
   Since the above was written, further experiments have been made, in order to
simplify the method of preparing the zinc plates, and the following is the method
which appears the best
   After the plates are cleaned with emery, immersion in dilute sulphuric acid, and
then in water, they are dipped into a mixture of about equal parts by measure of
saturated solutions of chloride of mercury (corrosive sublimate) and acetate of lead
they are then rubbed with a cloth and washed, and are ready for use.
   The superiority of this method of preparing the plates consists in the fact, that
local action is entirely prevented, and they only require one preparation until they
are quite dissolved ; they are not so liable to break as common amalgamated plates
are, and are therefore able to be used as long as any metal remains.

   They are also more highly positive than common amalgamated zinc plates.

   On Motions exhibited hy Metals under the Influence of Magnetic and Dia-

                     magnetic Forces. By W. Sykes Ward.

    In the course of a series of experiments in relation to diamagnetism, I observed

that the nature of the action upon many metals varied with the intensity of the mag-
netic force; and I found that such effects vvere in accordance with the observations
of Prof Plucker, " that the diamagnetic force increases more rapidly than the mag-
netic in relation to the power of the exciting magnet." I took considerable care in
procuring specimens of pure silver, cop[)er, lead, tin and zinc, and found that these
assumed the magnetic or diamagnetic state according to the power of the magnet
employed. I found a magnet of very moderate size and power sufficient if the polar
pieces vvere brought near to each other, and the metals, the subject of experiment,
were in small discs and delicately suspended.

   My attention being particularly directed to the phaenomena which Dr. Faraday

terms revulsion, I observed that the direction of the revulsive motions changed when
the magnetic or diamagnetic state of the metal was changed.

   When the polar pieces were adjusted within one quarter of an inch apart, and the

disc of metal so suspended that one-half was without, and the other half between the

polar pieces, another series of phasnomena presented themselves. On developing

the magnetic force, the disc moves as a pendulum, with a tendency to pass outwards
from between the polar pieces; on breaking contact, the disc moved in the reverse
direction, tending to pass within the polar pieces. Such motions are remarkable, in
that the direction of them is alike in all metals. Such motions appear to result
from electrical currents rather than from magnetic or diamagnetic forces ; for on sub-
stituting for the disc of metal a flat spiral of insulated wire, they were not produced ;
but on using a similar spiral, but of which the ends of wire were in good contact,
the like phaenomena were observed as with a disc.

   On a Theory of Induced Electric Currents, suggested by Diamagnetic Ph<E-

                           nomena. By W. Sykes Ward.

    The phaenomena mentioned in the foregoing paper involve many points which

 cannot be easily accounted for according to the received theories of magnetism.
 Ampere's theory may account for magnetic or diamagnetic phaenomena taken sepa-
 rately, but not easily for the changes of condition which take place in the same metal,
 still less for the changes in the direction of the revulsive motions, particularly those
 which follow the sluggish condition of the metal under the influence of that amount
 of force by which the ma;i;neti5m or diamagnetism are nearly balanced.

    It also appears that the induced or secondary electric current may be accounted
 for on the hypothesis that the current in the primary conductor effects a molecular
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                               47

disturbance in the parallel or secondary conductor (such disturbance being in the
nature of a magnetic affection), and that such disturbance correlatively induces the se-
condary current, both when it is produced and when it ceases. This hypothesis is
also in accordance with the fact that this induced current is only transient, and also
appears the best explanation why the induced is not of equal duration with the
inducing current.

   The author stated that a series of calculations, founded on tables produced to the
Chemical Section at Swansea, showed the efficient power of three generally used
forms of battery, known as Smee's, Daniell's and Grove's, would be equal when 100
pairs of Smee's, 55 pairs of Daniell's, or 34 pairs of Grove's were used ; and that the
expense of working such batteries, as regards a standard of 60 grains of zinc in each
cell per hour, would be about 6e?., T\d, and M. respectively.

   On the Presence of Nitrogen in Mineral Waters. By W. West, F.R.S.

    In this paper the author corrects the statement of Dr. Granville, in his ' Spas of
England,' that the continental chemists do not find nitrogen gas in their analyses
of mineral waters ; whence the Doctor infers either some extraordinary difference be-
tween the spas of England and of the Continent, or some error in the experiments of

British chemists. Mr. West shewed, by quotations from many statements, prin-
cipally of German chemists, that they at least, in many instances, state the propor-
tion of nitrogen found by them, and that in those cases where this is omitted, the
absence of nitrogen is not to be inferred, but only that they made no examination of
the gaseous contents, beyond ascertaining the quantity of carbonic acid present.

On the Presence of Fluorine in the Waters of the Firth of Forth, the Firth of
   Clyde, and the German Ocean. By George Wilson, M.D., F.R.S. E.

   In 1846, the author announced to the Royal Society of Edinburgh the discovery

of fluorine as a new element of sea water. He was led to search for it, after ob-

serving that fluoride of calcium possesses a certain small but marked solubility in

water, which explains its occurrence in springs and rivers, and necessitates its occa-

sional, if not constant presence in the sea. The only specimens of sea water he had

examined before this summer were taken from the Firth of Forth at Joppa, about
three miles from Edinburgh. He obtained the mother-liquor, or bittern, from the

pans of a salt-work there, and precipitated it by nitrate of baryta. The precipitate,

after being washed and dried, was warmed with oil of vitriol in a lead basin, covered
with waxed glass having designs on it. The latter were etched in two hours as

deeply as they could have been by fluor-spar treated in the same way, the lines being

filled up with the white silica separated from the glass.

   The author has recently examined in the same way bittern from the salt-works at
Saltcoats in the Firth of Clyde, but the indications of fluorine were much less di-
stinct than in the waters on the east coast. On procuring, however, from the same

place, the hard crust which collects at the bottom and sides of the boilers used in

the evaporation of sea water, he found no difRculty in detecting fluorine in the deposit.

This crust, or deposit, consists in greater part of sulphate of lime and of carbonate of

lime and of magnesia; but it contains also much chloride of sodium, and the other

Whensoluble salts of sea water entangled in its substance.  sulphuric acid, ac-

cordingly, is poured on it, it gives off much hydrochloric and carbonic, as well
as some hydrofluoric acid, and the latter is thus swept away before it has time to

corrode the glass deeply. The author preferred, nevertheless, to use the crust

exactly as he got it, that the proof of the presence of fluorine might not be impaired

in validity by the possibility of that substance being introduced by the water or re-

agents which must have been employed, had the chlorides and carbonates been sepa-

rated from the crust by a preliminary process. The crust, accordingly, after being

dried and powdered, was placed along with oil of vitriol in a lead basin covered by
48 REPORT-- 1849.

Aa waxed square of plate-glass, with letters traced through the wax.  single charge

of the crust and acid corroded the glass only slightly; but by replenishing^ the basin

with successive quantities of these materials, whilst the same plate of engraved glass

was used as the cover, he found no difBculty in etching the glass deeply. The author

is indebted to his friend Mr. S. Macadam for this simple but effective way of in-

creasing the corrosion of the glass, which seems worth the adoption of chemists in

all cases where fluorine is sought for. Four charges of material have been sufficient,

with all the si)ecimens of sea-water deposit he has examined, to mark the glass

strongly. It was kept wet on the up|)er side, and exposed undisturbed to the action

of each charge during twelve hours. Operating in this way, he has found fluorine

readily in the boiler-deposit from the waters of the Filths of Forth and Clyde. It

is a less easy matter to subject the waters of the open sea to the requisite concen-

tration before examination. It occurred to the author, however, that the incrusta-

tions v/hich are periodically removed from the boilers of the ocean steamers would

1serve to determine the question whether fluorine is a general constituent of the sea.

He made application, accordingly, at Glasgow and Leith for the deposits in question.

It appears, however, that the deep-sea steamers which leave the former have their

boilers cleaned out at other ports, so that he has as yet been unsuccessful in pro-

curing crusts froni the west coast of Scotland. He has obtained at Leith the crust

from the boiler of a steamer called the ' St. Kiaran*,* which trades between thai port

and Montrose; so that the greater part of the water consumed as steam by its en-

gines is derived from the German Ocean, although a portion is necessarily obtained

from the Firth of Forth. The crust from the boilers of this vessel was treated in the

Away described, and at once yielded hydrofluoric acid.  single charge, indeed, of

Wethe materials marked the glass distinctly, and four charges deeply.       may there-

fore infer that fluorine is present in the waters of the German Ocean, for different

portions of the deposit yielded it readily, and marked glass as deeply as the deposit

from the water of the Firth of Forth did, which could not have been the case if the

whole crust had not contained fluorine pretty equally diffused through it.

It will be an interesting matter to have similar examinations made of the boiler

deposits from the Transatlantic, and other ocean steamers which make long voyages;

nor will it be difficult, where the crust is thick, to select portions from the interior

of the deposit, which may be regarded as best representing the contents of the sea

at a considerable distance from land. From what is known of the comparative uni-

formity in composition of sea water, it may safely be inferred that if fluorine be

present in the waters of the Firths of Forth and Clyde and in the German Ocean, it

will be found universally present in the sea. In one of the interesting communica-

tions which Prof. Forchhammer has laid before the British Association, he has shown

that the more marked ingredients of sea water vary little over wide areas. One of

the ingredients selected by this gentleman to mark the uniformity in composition of

the sea, is lime, and as it is exceedingly probable that the fluorine in sea water exists

in the state of fluoride of calcium, his observations may be referred to as in harmony

with the inference that the element in question is generally diffused through the sea.

Other proofs, however, are not wanting. Mr. Middleton, before 1846, came to the

conclusion that fluorine must be present in sea water, since it occurred, as he had

ascertained, in the shells of marine moUusca. Silliman, jun., without a knowledge

of Middleton's views, drew the same inference, from its mvariable presence in the

calcareous corals brought to America by the United States' expedition from the Ant-

arctic seas. The author has found fluorine abundantly present in the teeth of the

walrus, which points to its existence in the Arctic Ocean ; and it seems so invariably
to associate itself with phosphate of lime, that it may be expected to occur in the

bones of all animals marine and terrestrial.

The author has found fluorine likewise in kelp from the Shetlands, but much less

distinctly than he anticipated. Glass plates were only corroded so far as to show

marks when breathed upon. Prof Voelcker also was kind enough, at the author's

request, to search for fluorine, when analysing the ashes of specimens of the sea pink

   * In the account of this paper contained in the Athena;um report of the meeting of the
British Association for 1849, the name of the vessel was inadvertently called the ' Isabella
Napier ' instead of the ' St. Kiaran.' They both traded between Leith and the northern
parts of Scotland.

{Statice Armeria), which had grown close to the sea-shore and contained iodine, and

found fluorine in the plant.

   When all those facts are considered, it is not too much, the author thinks, to urge

that fluorine should now take its place among the acknowledged constituents of sea
water. He has entered at length into the consideration of the natural distribution
of this element, and into other details connected with it, in a paper in the Transac-
tions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xvi. part 7, and in a communication
made to the Association at its Southampton meeting. The author further notices,
incidentally, that the only ascertained plant, so far as he knows, in which fluorine had
previously been detected, is barley, in which Will found it. In 1846 the author
detected this element in American potashes, and it now appears to be one of the
constituents of the kelp sea-weeds, although the observations which were made on
commercial kelp are liable to the objection, that the fluorine detected might be de-
rived from sea water which had dried upon the kelp weed before it was burned.

  AThe Statice rmeria may certainly be added to the list of plants containing fluorine,

and so may the Cochlearia Anglica, in specimens of which obtained from the Bass
Rock, and analysed in Dr. Wilson's laboratory, Dr. Voelcker has also detected this

element.
   Specimens of etched glass were shown to the Section in illustration of this com-

munication.

a sheet of paper and held in direct sun-light, or any other bright flame, so that the
shadows of the grooves which form the letters may fall upon the paper.

Analytical Investigations of Cast Iron. By F. C. Wrightson.

   This series of analyses showed the influences of the hot blast in producing the so-
called " cold short iron," by occasioning an increased reduction of phosphoric acid,

--and the consequent increase of phosphorus in the " hot-blast " iron. The respective

per-centages were :

            I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII.

Cold blast  0-47 041 0-31 020 0-21 0-03 036

Hot blast   0-51 0-55 050 071 054 0-07 040

   The irons differed also considerably as to the state in which the carbon was con-
tained, the hard white iron resembling impure steel, containing nearly all its carbon
in a state of chemical combination, whilst the carbon contained in the gray and
mottled varieties of iron was principally contained only as a mechanical mixture.
The presence of sodium and potassium in all the specimens examined was also no-
ticed for the first time, and it was thought probable that these might materially alFect

the qualities of the metal.

        GEOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.

            Notes on the Geology of the Channel Islands.

                  By Robert A. C. Austen, F.R.S.

The object of the present short communication is not to give a detailed account of
the mineralogical character of the various crystalline rocks which form so large a por-
tion of this group, nor to lay down their topographical extent. The publication of facts
of this class does not form any part of the objects of the British Association, and all
that I would now attempt is a few general results, for the purpose of discussion, on
one or two points in geological investigation, which these islands help to elucidate.

   The mineralogical constitution of Guernsey in particular, as is well known, was

investigated by Macculloch, himself a native of that island.
   From the position of this group with reference to the coast of France, it is obvious

that comparisons must be instituted rather with the formations of the Cotentin, than
with anything on the English side of the channel. One great difficulty which every

50 REPORT 1849.

one must have experienced in attempting to investigate the relations of the mineral

masses of the Cotentin, arises from the want of natural sections, owing partly to the

manner in which its surface is covered by heath and wood, and partly to superficial

accumulations ; a difficulty, which, though it exists to considerable extent in tiie

larger islands of Guernsey and Jersey, is obviated by the great extent of coast-line

they present.

The sedimentary rocks of Guernsey and Jersey are of inconsiderable extent ; a

small patch of clay-slate occurs in Rocquaine Bay, on the west of Guernsey, and

larger areas are occupied by it in the north and north-east parts of Jersey : in the

latter they are occasionally siliceous, and pass into subordinate beds of rounded con-

glomerate. The whole of this group has been variously moved about, but its general

slope as a mass is to east. These beds are evidently a part of the palaeozoic series of

the Cotentin, and closely resemble that portion of it which, consisting of alternations

of compact sandstones and argillaceous shales, are well seen on the north and south

of Valognes. The calcareous bands of the French series are altogether wanting, nor

did I see any of those peculiar steaschist beds, with nodules of quartz, which in the

neighbourhood of Cherboin-g underlie the middle part of the group.

Organic remains, if not entirely wanting, must be exceedingly scarce in these beds,

in which respect they agree with that part of the French series to which I have com-

pared them.

No trace of any one of the secondary series of formations is to be found over these

islands ; the surface of the slate rocks has been much denuded, and the like process J
may have removed whatever newer strata may have at some time existed there ; but/
fi'om certain characters which the new red sandstone and the cretaceous beds put on in

their extension into the west of France, it is more probable that beds of that period

never were deposited here.

The geological interest which attaches to these islands consists in the relative ages of

Athe crystalline rocks, which form so large a portion of their masses.                                                                                                                                                                    circumstance

which cannot fail to strike any observer is the very great changes of mineral character

which these masses put on, and within very narrow limits : there is, however, a three-

fold division, which is apparent enough :

  A1. flat-bedded crystalline group, such as that which occurs over the southern

half of Guernsey.

  A2. granitic group, which includes a series of gray, red, and black granites.
  A3. sienitic series, comprising a vast variety of combinations, in which, however,

hornblende prevails.

The first of these groups, as it is seen in Guernsey, is of great thickness, and though

no topographical limits can well he drawn, it maybe said to occupy all south of a line

from Castle Cornet to Vason Bay ; it is in some places a true granite, at others gneiss,

at others a true micaceous schist. It agrees with the next group as to the constituent

minerals into which it graduates downwards.

The true granites are to be seen over the northern part of Guernsey, nowhere better

than in the quarries of St. Sampson's parish. These latter, as a mass, underlie the

first group, and their more massive external character, as well as more imiform cry-
stalline texture, may be merely the results of cooling under rather different condi-

tions                         and tlie whole may be an intrusive plutonic mass of the same period.                                                                                                                                        On the
                           ;

other hand, portions of the upper group irresistibly suggest the notion that at some

time they nuist have existed as sedimentary strata.

    In the island of Jersey the true granites occupy the southern portion, and it is only
here that we see their relation to the slate series already noticed. As the slates ap-

proach the granite, they become hard and splintery. At this junction enormous veins

or branches extend from the granitic mass, as well as the most delicate threads ; at
places the slate rocks seem reduced to fragments, among which the fluid granite has

poured itself, the angular edges being sharp and uninjured.
   The granite of this island puts on a character more closely resembling stratification "

than is usually seen; so nmch so, that in many places, as for instance in the steep

walls of rock beneath the citadel of St. Heliers, it might be, excusably mistaken for a

mass of highly inclined sedimentary beds. These divisioni.have no general angle of

dip, but are inclined most unequally                                                                                                                                                                                                      they may be planes of cooling which were once
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

horizontal, and have acquired their present position by subsequent disturbance. The

extreme smoothness of their surfaces is very remarkable.

In the red granites I observed one set of planes running nearly north and south,

with a dip to the west and a cross set east and north, and which had a dip north.

   Hornblende is not absent in the second group of crystalline rocks, as an occasional
constituent; and in these cases, as in St. Sampson's parish, it makes its appearance

by gradual increase, and as it were by passage from one rock to another.
   The third group is quite distinct : the different appearances which it assumes, from

the preponderance of one or other of its constituents, would cause it to be described

mineralogically under a great variety of names. I noticed, however, a single dyke in

the island of Jersey which in one place was an earthy hornblende (wacke), then com-

pact greenstone trap, hornblende with distinct crystals of felspar; lastly, hornblende,

with large plates of mica.

The intrusion of the hornblendic series is of subsequent date to that of the granitic

rocks : as to the period in the geological scale at which this took place, it would be
hazardous to conjecture; they have broken up and been projected amongst the gra-

nites, in the same manner as we have seen that the granites affected the slate rocks.

A vast lapse of time must have been required for the cooling down of the fluid gra-

nitic masses yet it is evident that the whole of that structure of divisional planes was
                                                                 ;

complete before the intrusion of the sienitic rocks; an illustration of this represented

the dyke in every instance following one of these sets of planes. But for nume-

rous other sections, where the granite is seen caught up in the greenstone in great

angular masses, it might be supposed that the two rocks were arranged in parallel

beds; instances of the subsequent date of the hornblende series is perhaps best seen

in Jersey, but good examples are to be found in Guernsey.

At several places in this same island is to be seen a deposit of fine sedimentary

matter, conforming to the irregular surface of rock on which it rests. These accumu-

lations have for a few years past been worked for the purposes of brick-making, so that

good sections can be obtained. Their position is on the high table-lands of the south

part of the island, so that at the time of their deposition the whole must have been

submerged ; but besides this, the beds themselves would indicate a great depth of

water. No fossils that I could ascertain have ever been met with. In one or two of

the lower portions of this deposit, and where the sands were rather coarser, I detected
fine sharp angular fragments of chalk flints ; and guided by many considerations which

it would be needless to mention here, but which will readily suggest themselves to

those acquainted with the geology of the south-west parts of France, it seemed to me

that these beds might be outlying patches of the deep sea eocene period.

 --The geological phenomena of these islands next in date are referable to sub-aerial

conditions the deep disintegration of the crystalline rocks, and the accumulation of
the materials so produced. The thickness of these accumulations indicate a long lapse

of time ; they cover not only all portions of the larger islands, but are found capping
the smaller groups of rocks which surround them : they come down to the present
sea-level ; they evidently, by their position, belong to a period when the whole of

those islands had a much greater amount of elevation than at present.
   The old peat-beds and forest-trees of Catel parish belong to this period of sub-aerial

conditions, as do also the submerged forests which run out from these islands at so
many places, Vason Bay, Grand Cobo.

The elevation of the whole of this group at this line was probably very consider-

able.

   Up to a height of no great amount above the sea, the surface is covered by an ac-

cumulation of sharp sand, with occasional lines of shingle ; chalk flints enter largely

into the composition of this. In the parish of St. Sampson it will be seen resting on

the surface of the granite, as in many of the quarries ; but it occurs equally on the sub-

aerial beds                                                the thickness of these accumulations is very trifling,  and  can  only indi-

cate a depression beneath the present level of very transient duration. In the Island

of Jersey such lines of inland cliff as that which extends from Gorey southwards, at

the base of which lie the ancient marine beds, covered along the sea-bord with blown

sands, would indicate a rather lengthened period of stability before the last change of

level.

   Such is the series of physical change which this group of islands appears to have

undergone ; its geological history is simple compared with many other districts, but
for the apparent fact that it should have preserved tracts as dry land through so many

surrounding changes, and probably since the post-eocene period.

                                                                                                                        4*

On some Neio Species of Tcstacea from the Hampshire Tertiary Beds.
                         By E. Charlesworth, F.G.S.

Mr. Charlesworth stated that the British Natural History Society had employed

collectors to obtain fossils from the eocene strata of Hampshire, and that amongst the

-- A20,000 specimens already obtained were seven new to this country: 1. Cytherea

Awith the external form of Isocardia. ?..  Purpura'', with a single prominent plait

AAon the columella. 3.                     shell allied to Cerithium. 5. Murex
Cancellar'ia. 4.

Atriptrroklc'n (Deih.). 6. Fusus e.vcisiis (Lam.). 7. variety o( Murex defossus (Sow.).

Mr. Charlesworth remarked on the importance of investigating particular deposits,

especially where there was any danger of good localities being destroyed, as in the

case of the Bridlington crag.

On the Geography and Geology of the Peninsula of Mount Sinai and the ad-
  jacent Countries. By John Hogg, M.A., F.R.S., F.L.S., Hon. Sec. of the
   Royal Geograph. Soc. S;c.

    In communicating a brief account of the geography and geology of the peninsula
of Mount Sinai, and of the countries immediately adjoining to it, the author in the
first place took a hasty survey of the chief natural features of the peninsula, beginning
at Suez, and following the Siuaic coast of the Gulf of Suez as far as its south point at
Has Mohammed, and thence up the Sinaic coast of the Gulf of Akaba to its north

extremit}'.

   Secondly. From the Kalah el Akaba down the Arabian shores of that gulf, he de-
scribed that region, the little isles of Tiran, Senafer, and others which lie to the S. of
Ras Furtak, and then the districts near Ain Uneh and Moweilih, on that coast of

Arabia.

   Thirdly. Passing from Moweilih up the Gulf of Akaba, lie gave some views of it,
of the VVadi el .Araba, and of the neighbouring mountains, as far north as the ruins
of Petra.

   Fourthly. On the rocks of Petra the author offered a few remarks, also on Gehel
Harun, and the mountains of the Nabathaean chain, those to the N.W. of Wadi el
Jerafah, the great desert of El Tyh, the range El Egmeh, the Sinaic group, and Gebel
el Tyh and G. Thughar.

    Fifthly. Starting again from Suez, he shortly noticed that east region of Egypt
which is contiguous to the Gulf of Suez, nearly as far south as the supposed site of
Myos Hormus.

   And, sixthly. In conclusion, he observed upon the general features, the heights of
the mountains, the geological formations, the minerals and ores of the peninsula of
Mount Sinai.

   The plain map that accompanied this paper was carefully reduced from a much larger
one (which was also exhibited and coloured geologically), drawn and compiled by the
author from the maps of Professors Lepsius, Russegger and Robinson (the last ex-
ecuted by Kieppert at Berlin), and from the charts of the survey of the Red Sea, by
Messrs. Moresby and Wellsted, under the authority of the East India government.
For the purpose of keeping the map as clear as possible, and not crowded with names,
those of the chief places are alone inserted. The Arabic, the classical and scriptural
appellations are added. It was recently engraven by Mr. VV. Hughes for the Royal
Society of Literature, in order to illustrate the author's previous memoiron MountSinai,
now publishing in the forthcoming part of their Transactions*.

   Mr. J. Hogg also exhibited a copy of the same, which he coloured geologically,
principally after Russegger's maps of Egypt and the Sinaic peninsula, very lately
executed at Vienna; but the latter he corrected in some places according to the de-
scriptions of Burckhardt and other travellers who had visited them in person.

   An imaginary section, likewise geologically tinted, was described ; it comprehended
the peninsula from Gebel Jaraf on the north to Ras Mohammed on the south. This

the author himself enlarged, eight times, from a portion of a more extensive section,
neatly engraved with the altitudes derived from Russegger's work, by Herr Augustus
Petermann.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  53

   Two other geological sections, which the author sketched and coloured, were also

explained; the first was a representation of the 'Granite Peaks of the high Sinaic
mountains,' enlarged after Russegger; and the second was entitled, ' Section of the
Wadi el Araba, from the Gulf of Akaba to the Dead Sea, showing what portion is now

lower than the level of the Red Sea.' He likewise stated that the stoppage of the
River Jordan through that Great Wadi (supposed to have once flowed through it)
might have been effected by a volcanic agency, traces of which exist about the Dead

Sea, and near the head of the same gulf.
    It is impossible in the limits of the present abstract to follow the author through

his several divisions, wherein he carefully recorded the chief facts relating to the
rocks, mountains, and plains, and the nature of the respective formations. But some
of the geological characters, and the different formations of these countries, as far as

they are at present known, are the following .

      I. Diluvium, alluvium, sand, marine formation, coral rocks, &c.
     II. Tertiary sandstone, upper Nubian sandstone, and oldest diluvium.

   III. Tertiary limestone and marl.

    IV. Limestone of the cretaceous series.
     V. Older sandstone, Nubian sandstone, and its marl (lower cretaceous series).

    VI. Unstratified or crystalline rocks granite, sienite, porphyry, diorite, greenstone,
                                                                                                                                                                            ;

felspar, gneiss, chlorite, hornblende, mica and clay-slates, &c.

  VII. Volcanic rocks ; basalt, and basaltic lava.
   The distribution of these formations over these regions of Arabia and Egypt is

briefly thus :

  A large tract of beds comprised in I. occurs around the head of the Gulf of Suez

and to the N.W., where exist the salt marshes, Szabegha. Then due N. a strip of
tertiary sandstone and oldest diluvial beds, II. ; next, a narrow piece of tertiary lime-

stone and marls. III. ; again a large extent of II., interrupted by a narrow belt of III.
running N. and S., which stretches out N.E. nearly to 34° E. long. From thence
the immense desert of El Tyh with its many plateaux of different elevations, bounded
by Gebel el Rahah on the W., the Gebel el Tyh range on the S.W., S., and S.E.,
nearly to the line of 29° N. lat. consists of IV., limestone of the cretaceous fovmation,
but covered in places by large tracts of sand, gravel, and flints. The western coast
of the peninsula is 1., about as far as Ras Soddur from the head of the Gulf of Suez

on the W. ; but to the E., including more than half the range of El Rahah, III. pre-
vails. Between that Ras (cape) and Wadi el Amarah, there intervenes an outlying
piece of IV. From the last valley (Wadi) to about El Hamam Faroun, III. again
comes in, which continues a little to the E. of Howara. From Wadi Gharandel to the
N.of WadiNaszb and the well of Morkha, except along the sea-shore and the plain W.

of the latter spot, which are of I., bounded on E. by Gebel Watah, and from thence
to W. Naszb in a S.W. direction, IV. extends. From that mountain to Sarbut el
Chadem inclusive, and from Morkha on the coast plain to the head of El Kaa, below
Mount Serbal on the W., the sandstone (secondary), V., and its marls occupy that
district. Gebel Araba range, near the sea, is of limestone, IV. The long gravelly

and sandy plain of £1 Kaa, which stretches out to the S. extremity of the peninsula
is I., and more or less covei'ed with pebbles and detritus of the primitive i-ocks, VI.
Along the coast there follows a small chain, including the remarkable G. Narkus of

v., then succeeds G. Hemam, nearly as far as Tur Bay, composed of IV. Two

patches of III. occur N. and S. of Tur; but that small town, the only one in the
peninsula, stands on a raised coral bank and sand, I. South of Ras Sebil there is a

little tract of III. ; and this reappears at Ras Mohammed; N.W. and N.E. of which
low promontory some older sandstone, V., intervenes between it and the granitic roots

of the Gebel El Turfa. East of Sherm, which is of V., volcanic rocks, VII., are seen,
and crater-like appearances, fhence north-eastwards, V., where an intermediate
strip of IV. is found at Wadi Nubk. Along the Sinaic coast of the Gulf of Akaba
up to Noweibia from Wadi Orta inclusive, VI. prevails ; a little of V. occurring N.W.

at Dahab, and in the lower part of W. Sal.
    The unstratified or crystalline rocks, VI., range from the S.E. of Sarbut el Chadem,

bounded by the S.W., S., and S.E. sides of the elevated sand plain of V., called

Debbet el Ramleh, and from Wadi Roniman, and the N. end of W. Firan, where it
joins W. Mukatteh, along the eastern edge of El Kaa, to the S. termination of the
 El Turfa chain. Then N.E. of Wadi Sal, and N. of it to the northern branch of
--54 REPORT 1849.

El Tyh V. continues. Along the Sinaic shores of the sea of Akaba, from Noweibia,

near which place is IV., the same extends northwards; somewhat to the west and

north of this coast line, rocks of VI. and V, alternate, and occasionally with IV. ex-
hibit many remarkable displacements ; W. of the granitic Isle of Kureiyeh are black

basaltic cliffs, VII., along the beach ; then N. some breccia or conglomerate is noticed

and afterwards granite rocks succeed.

Ascending the Wadi el Araba, the mountains on the E. are of VI., chiefly porphyry

with granite in places, to about 30° N. lat. ; near which occurs the watershed, at about

an elevation of 500 feet above the sea in that Wadi, the inclined bed of which, from

the gulf to that point, is formed of sand and gravel and debris. Sandstone, V., and some
chalky limestone, IV., are met with on the W. side of the Great Wadi Araba. Those

formations are elevated to about the level of the desert El Tyh, and in spots some-

Hanm --what higher. Fi'om about the line 80° N. lat. V. extends northwards be3'ond Gebel
           and the ruins of Petra, both inclusive, except an intermediate strip in Wadis

Gharundcl and Dalegheh running nearly W. and E., which is IV., and all along the

E. side of this region, a lofty chain, attaining an altitude of perhaps 3600 feet above

the sea, which the author termed the ' Nabathasan chain,' and proceeds a great di-

--stance north consists of IV. On the other, the western side of the valley of the

Araba, and opposite to Gebel Harun (Mount Hor), the abrupt Gebel Makrah and the

peak of Gebel Araif el Naka, or the ' She Camel's Crest,' are likewise of the IV.

formation. South of these begins "the great and terrible wilderness" of El Tyh,

or ' the Wandering,' which has been already noticed.

  On the east of the Nabathaean chain, as also of the gi-anitic range of Mount Seir

south of the line 30° N. lat., for a vast distance in the eastern desert, and to the S.,

the limestones of IV. extend. The mountains from Kalah el Akaba, the ' Castle of

Akaba,' along the Arabian coast, are granitic, VI. At the promontory Ras Furtak is

a low tract of IV. corresponding with that in the N. side of the opposite isle of Tiran,

and with that in Wadi Nubk on the Sinaic shore. The coast then, south of the gra-
nite mount Gebel Makna, in many places is of I., but between those and the granitic

range behind Ain Uneh and Moweilih, the tertiary sandstone II. is, according to

Russegger, again developed. Further inland, the sandstones, V., of the lower creta-

ceous series prevail.

Again, on the co.ist of Egypt, S. of Suez, Gebel Ataka, which is of the limestone

IV., divides a tract on the N. and S. of tertiary limestone. III. ; the plain El Baidea

being of I. S. of this a very considerable district of the secondary limestone IV.

follows. On the heights above Wadi Zafraneh on the N., a strip of granite, VI., takes

place, wherein exist traces of old copper mines. Near the coast S. of lias Zafraneh,

some beds of tertiary limestone and marl, III., and some conglomerate rock, are

found. In the Eastern Desert, a little S. of 28° 30' N. lat. and about 32" 30' E.

long., there occurs some of the sandstone, V., of the lower cretaceous series, and called
by Russegger ' sandstone of Nubia,' The mountains rising between that portion of

the desert and the coast are for a great distance southwards primitive or granitic, VI.

of these Gebel Garib or Agrib is the loftiest; its summit being elevated to about

6000 feet above the sea level. Both N. and S. of it are observable remains of

copper mines.

   The fossils of these tertiary and secondary formations have not as yet been suffi-
ciently examined. Capt. Newbold states that he found among the many fossils of the

limestone, IV., Ostrece, Echini, Madripora, and Pectines; and Herr Russegger ob-

Hamamserves, that in the compact chalk rock of the same series, IV., at Ras  in the

Gulf of Suez, he observed remains of monocotyledonous plants ; and in the same for-
mation, from the Gebel el Tyh, that is to say, compact chalk with flints, were numerous
fossils. Mr. John Hogg however conceived it probable that some of the limestone

formation, which Russegger assigns solely to the cretaceous series, in the vast district

to the N. and E. of Gebel el Tyh, will, on further examination, prove to be of an

older limestone. So he thought that certain of the sandstones of V. may, after future

discovei'ies, be more correctly I'eferred to rocks anterior to the secondary, pei'haps to

the Palaeozoic, epoch ; indeed in tlie older or secondary sandstone, V., Capt. Newbold
could find no fossils. And with regard to the ages of the primitive or unstratified

rocks, VI., of the Sinaic group, the same traveller, who examined them recently with

care, says that the greenstone is the latest, and next in order the porphyry and gra-

nite, and that the hypogene schists or slates are the oldest.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  55

   Few minerals and ores occur in the Sinaic peninsula; of these iron and copper are

the most abundant ; indeed, in hieroglyphics, Professor Lepsius remarks, that the whole
country was called Mafkat, i. e. " the copper land." Neither lead nor silver has been
detected, but near Mersa Dahab, which means the ' gold port,' some assert that gold

dust is present, for the teeth of the Ibex ai"e sometimes seen surrounded with it. This

probably may be only auriferous pyrites. Hematite, antimony, rock-crystal, cinna-
bar, nitre, rock-salt, a yellow clay named tafal, crystallized sulphate of lime, sulphur,

gypsum, pebbles of agate and jasper, occur. Thermal springs rise at Gebel Hamam

and in El Wadi near Tur ; the former having a temperature of .55° R., and the latter
91° Fahr. The porphyries and granites of the high Sinaic group vary extremely in
colours, and some are of great beauty ; the latter resembling those near Assouan.

    According to Russegger, the highest peaks of that group, in fact of the entire

Apeninsula, rise to 9300 English feet above the sea. peculiarity in the lower mountain

--ranges is this : generally an ascending valley (Wadi) leads up to the summit, which

constitutes a plain, and then another Wadi slopes down to the level of the neigh-
bouring district. Such is even the present general form of the long Wadi el Araba.

   The minerals and ores in Eastern Egypt are, the author believes, only iron, copper,
and much naphtha or petroleum found at Gebel el Zeit, 'Mount of Oil;' and in that
part of Arabia which comes within this notice, little or nothing is known of its mineral
products. The soil however in several localities is much more fertile, and more
abounding in water, than that either in Eastern Egypt or in the Sinaic peninsula.

   Mr. J. Hogg illustrated his observations with some beautiful lithographed views of
Suez, of the mountains in the peninsula, of the head of the Gulf of Akaba, and the
site of Petra, by Mr. David Roberts and the late Lieut. Wellsted.

On the Relations between the New Red Sandstone, the Coal-measures, and the
   Silurian Rocks of the South Staffordshire Coal-field. By J. Beete Jukes,

   M.A., F.G.S.

   The author commenced by remarks on the interesting question of what rocks lay
below the new red sandstone of the Midland Counties, and after giving a concise sketch

of the structure of that district, directed attention to the particular instance of the

South Staffordshire coal-field. He stated that a point of great practical importance was

the nature of the boundary faults of the midland coal-fields, whether they were true
faults, or only old cliffs of coal-measures with the new red sandstone abutting against
them. Having been engaged in the government geological survey of South Stafford-

shire, he wished to point out what results had been already arrived at. He showed

that each of the three formations entering into the structure of the district (namely,

the new red, the coal-measures, and the Silurian) were unconformable to the other;
that this unconformability was rarely locally appreciable, the difl^erence in the dip or
strike being slight, but was shown by each of the superior formations resting on dif-
ferent parts of the inferior at different places. The nature of this unconformability
was exhibited in the catting of the railway near Dudley, where beds of coal-measure
sandstone abutted against a clitf of Silurian shale 20 or 30 feet high, both formations
being nearly horizontal. He then briefly described the boundaries of the southern
portion of the South Staffordshire coal-field, showing that on the east the new red sand-
Btone was brought dovi-n against the coal-measures by a true downcast fault ; that the
coal-measures were worked for some distance beneath the new red sandstone, but
that they appeared to be suddenly thinning out in that direction near West Bromwich,
andthata little east of the present workings the Silurian shale had been driven into, on a
level with the thick coal; that Silurian shale had likewise been metwith nearthe surface
south of Oldbury, and that it was therefore probable that there was a space on the east
side of the present coal-field aboutSandwell and Smethwick, where the new red sand-
stone rested directly on Silurian shale without the intervention of any coal-measures,
but that this space was not of any very great extent, from true coal-measures having
been reached not far from the Stonehouse near Harborue, and near Aldridge east of
Walsall. He then traced the western boundary from Wolverhampton to Stourbridge,
which he showed to be probably a true " downcast fault to the west," more or less
complicated by minor faults and branches which spread from it into the coal-field.
Along the southern edge of the field from Stourbridge, south of Halesowen to Lappal
and the neighbourhood of Harborne, he described the boundary to be formed simply by
--56 REPORT 1849.

the superposition of the new red sandstone on the coal-measures, the beds of the latter

dipping gently to the south, and the former resting on them with apparent conforma-

bilily. He believed that here would be found the true upper beds of the coal-

measures, and the lowest beds of the red sandstone, as deposited in that district, but

doubted tlie existence of any beds of passage from one into the other.

As a practical conclusion, he stated that while there was every hope that profitable

coal-beds lay beneath the larger part of the new red sandstone plain of the Midland

Counties and Cheshire, it would not be advisable rashly to commence a search for them,

nor without competent  direction  and  advice                                 that  this  advice  and  direction  might
                                                                           ;

eventually be hoped for from the Geological Survey of Great Britain under Sir H. De

la Beche. He likewise added, that if he were now asked to fix a limit of depth at which

the coal was probably to be attained beneath the new red sandstone, he should say Jive

or six hundred yards was the least depth the speculator would probably have to sink

for it.

On Traces of a Fossil Reptile (Sauropus primsevus) found in the Old Red Sand-
 stone. By Isaac Lea of Philadelphia. {Communicated hy Dr. Buckland.)

   The object of this communication is to announce to the Society that I have discovered
the footprints in bas-relief of a reptilian quadruped lower in the series than has yet
been observed. On the 5th of April last, in the examination of the strata in the gorge
of the Sharp Mountain, near Pottsville, Pennsylvania, where the Schuylkill breaks

through it, a large mass of remarkably fine old red sandstone attracted my attention.

Upon it I was astonished to find six distinct impressions of footmarks in a double row
of tracks, each mark being duplicated by the hind-foot falling into the impression
of the fore-foot, but rather more advanced. The strata here are tilted a little over
the vertical, and the surface of rock exposed was about 12 feet by 6 feet, the whole
of which surface was covered with ripple-marks and the pits of rain-drops beautifully

displayed in the very fine texture of the deep red sandstone.
   The six double impressions distinctly show, in the two parallel rows formed by the

left feet on the one side and the right feet on the other, that the animal had five toes
on the fore-feet, three of which toes were apparently armed with unguinal appendages.
The length of the double impression is 4-^ inches ; the breadth 4 inches ; the distance
apart in the length of the step of the animal 13 inches; across, from outside to out-
side, 8 inches. The mark of the dragging of the tail is distinct, and occasionally
slightly obliterates a small part of the impressions of the footmarks. The ripple-
marks are 7 to 8 inches apart, and very distinct, as well as the pits of the rain-drops.

   The footmarks assimilate remarkably to those of the recent Alligator Mississippi-
ensis, and are certainly somewhat analogous to the Cheirotherium.

   The geological position of this reptilian quadruped is of great interest, from the
fact that no such animal remains have heretofore been discovered so low in the series.
Those described by Dr. King, in the great western coal-field, are only 800 feet below
the surface of the coal formation (No. 13 of Prof. Rogers, the State Geologist). The
position of the Pottsville footmarks is about 8500 feet below the upper part of the coal
formation there, which is about 6750 feet, according to Prof. Rogers, and they are in

the red shale (liis No. 11); the intermediate siliceous conglomerate (No. 12) being
stated by him to be 1031 feet thick. These measurements would bi"ing these foot-
marks about 700 feet below the surface of the old red sandstone.

  A mass of coal plants exists immediately on the northern face (upper-) of the

heavy conglomei-ate, here tilted ten degrees over the vertical, and forming the crest
or "back-bone" of Sharp Mountain. This conglomerate mass is about 150 feet thick

at the western side of the road below Pottsville. On the same road-side, about 1735

feet from these coal plants (south and directly across the stratification), is the face
of the rock tilted slightly over the vertical and facing to the north. It is proper to
state that the limestone of the old red sandstone exists here, about 2 feet thick, and

underlies these "footmarks 65 feet."

On a New Species of Labyrintkodon from the New Red Sandstone of War'
                        wickshire. By G. Lloyd, M.D., F.G.S.

   After stating the unfrequent occurrence of the remains of this extinct genus of
reptiles, more especially of other parts of the body than of the bead, and having shown
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  5^

that on comparison with the remains of other species ah-eady described there were good
grounds for assigning to the fossil referred to, and illustrated to the Section by a litho-
graphic drawing, the rank of a new species, to which he proposed to apply the name
Bucklandi, the author proceeded briefly to point out the osteologicai features of the
fossil. The specimen was described as consisting of tlie internal surface of the
greater part of the bones of the cranium, presenting both orbits entire, the nasal
aperture somewhat mutilated, and about twenty more or less perfect teeth in the su-
perior maxillary bone of one side, and also preserving, either by the presence of bone
or by impressions left of absent bones, the general configuration of the skull, the di-
mensions of which were about 11^ inches from the termination of the premandibular
to the extremity of the projecting condyles of the occipital bone, and about 9 inches
from the outer edge of one temporal bone to that of the other. The general consoli-
dation of the bones of the cranium, especially of those forming the orbits, was con-
trasted with the comparative loosely constructed skull of modern Batrachians ; and
the projecting condyles of the occiput were pointed out as highly characteristic of that
family. The teeth presented the usual characters of the genus ; and the position of
the nostril, in conjunction with the other osteologicai peculiarities, confirmed the com-
pound nature and amphibian habits of this reptile. The fossil described was recently

discovered in the Bunter-sandstein.

Note on the Genus Siphonotreta, with a Description of a New Species. By

        John Morris, F.G.S. {Communicated by Sir R. I. Murchison.)

   Among the numerous interesting fossils collected by Mr. John Gray from the Wen-
lock limestone and shale in the vicinity of Dudley, is a form which I am inclined to

consider belongs to Siphonotreta (de Verneuil), a genus of Brachiopoda, hitherto con-

sidered peculiar to the Silurian formations of Russia.

   The genus having been previously unnoticed in this country, and presenting some
peculiarities both as regards the structure of the shell and the mode of attachment, it
may not be uninteresting to offer a few general remarks on the subject; more especially
as this shell, and some apparently allied forms, have been lately made the subject of a
special notice by Dr. Kutorga of St. Petersburg. In this memoir* Dr. Kutorgahas
grouped together in one family (the Siphonotretese) four genera, Siphonotreta, Schi-
zotreta, Acrotreta, and Aulonotreta, which scarcely present any character in common,
and have been in part considered by preceding authors as belonging to different

groups or distinct subfamilies of the Brachiopoda.

    Of the above-mentioned generic forms, two of them have been known for about
twenty years. One of them, remarkable for the immense abundance with which it

occurs in the lower Silurian grits of the north of Russia, its broken fragments disse-
minated in the plane of stratification, giving to the rock a micaceous appearance, was

first made known (1829) as a peculiar genus by Prof. Eichwaldf, under the name of
 Obolus {Aulonotreta, Kut.) ; about the same period (1830), Pander J gave the name
 Ungula to this fossil, and which L. von Buch§ considered to be an Orthis. The other
form was also first noticed by Prof. Eichwald in 1829 as a Crania [C. sulcata, C. un-
guiculata), which he afterwards (1843) placed under Terehralula\\ ; subsequently how-
 ever M. de Verneuil, in the second volume of the great work on Russia ^, after a careful
 examination of these fossils, clearly recognized the differences which separated them
from Crania and Terehratula, and gave them the very characteristic name of Sipho-
 notreta, describing two species, S. unguiculata and S. verrucosa.

    Since the publication of the work on Russia, four additional species of the latter
 genus have rewarded the researches of Hern. v. Volborth and other Russian geolo-
 gists, and which are fully described, as well as those previously known, in the mono-
 graph by Dr. Kutorga above alluded to, and from which is extracted the following
 synopsis of the principal characters of the genera in the family.

On the 3Ietamorphosis of certain Trilobites as recently discovered by M. Bar-

        rande. {Communicated by Sir Roderick Impey Murchison.)

    Sir Roderick Murchison brought before the Section the important discover}' made
by M. Barrande, of the metamorphosis of Trilobites, as exhibited in a series of forms
apparently very distinct, but which have been shovsrn by that author to belong to the
one species Sao hirsufa (Barr.). Referring in the first instance to the extraordinary
number of species of Trilobites recently discovered in the palaeozoic rocks of Bo-
hemia, whether as compared with the small number hitherto known in that tract,
or the whole quantity described in other parts of the world. Sir Roderick explained
how with untiring zeal and ability, and at considerable cost and labour, M. Bar-
rande had been the real agent in opening out this rich field, and how by a long and
careful analysis of all its organic remains he had shown that it is essentially of Silu-
rian age. In anticipation of a great work by M. Barrande (the ' Silurian Rocks of
Bohemia'), in which the necessary proofs will be given, and containing among
numerous other illustrations 40 plates of Trilobites only. Sir Roderick communicated
the following extract of a letter from that author :

    "The fact, which is made intelligible by the plate of drawings annexedf, relates
to a species which I have named Sao hirsufa, of which I have verified the gradual

 development from the embryonic to the adult state. I have been able to discover
twenty successive stages in this progress, which took place after development from
the egg, as is observed in some of our modern crustaceans. The first stage is marked
by a disc two-thirds of a millimetre in diameter, of which the head only occupies
the whole of the trilobed surface. In the second stage the thorax appears in a
 rudimentary state, and it increases in the following stages by the successive additioa

 bably be found to belong to the wliole genus, when the spines are carefully examined by a
 higher power than that used by Dr. Kutorga.

each time of a ring, until the thorax has thus acquired seventeen free segments, and
the pygtdium two anchylosed segments, in all nineteen, which constitute the adult

age. During the course of this evolution the form of the different parts of the body

is developed in so continuous a manner, that in tracing the successive stages there

is no sort of ' hiatus.' Towards the sixth stage four isolated grains are observed
on each side of the glabella. I name ' principal grain ' that which is nearest to the
axis, and ' primitive grains ' the three other and smaller grains, which are arranged
in a convex band towards the interior. Now, these four grains are persistent in

all the following stages, both in their relative size and reciprocal position, with a

constancy and regularity which alone might suffice to estabUsh the specific identity
of all these forms. The principal grain is also recognizable upon the adult, but at
that age the three primitive grains become merged or lost amidst a crowd of other

grains which accumulate around them. They all terminate in assuming a conical
form, i. e. they become spines. [The figures show the details.]

   " Three other species have offered to me an analogous development, but with fewer

intermediary stages between the extremes. These are the Trinucleus ornatus (Stern-

berg), Arioriius ceticephalus (Barr.), and Arethusina Konincki (Barr.).
   " The embryonic evolution out of the egg took place then in species or isolated

genera among the trilobites of the Silurian epoch, just as among modern crustaceans.

That which is remarkable is, that two of these four species belong to my lowest or
primitive fauna, or to my band C, or the schists of Skrey, viz. Sao hirsuta and Ari-
onim ceticephalus. You know that the Trinucleus ornatus characterizes my band D,

or your Caradoc sandstone * ; and lastly, the Arethusina KonincJci is found exclusively

at the base of my inferior limestone E, which occupies the place of your Wenlock
formation. In the three other superior bands of my upper division of the Silurian
system, no trilobite has offered to me a trace of a similar evolution. These all

appear to be born with the complete number of thoracic segments, but not with all

the articulations of the pygidium f.
   " I have thought that an acquaintance with this fact would be of some interest to

you who first opened out the necropolis of trilobites.

   * M. Barrande does not consider, vfith Mr. Salter, that the Trinucleus Caractaci (Murch.)

is the same species as the Tr'mucleus ornatus (Sternb.).
   t The comments made by the eminent naturalist M. Milne-Edwards, Member of the Aca-

demy of Sciences in Paris, on this communication, must have so much weight, that a deviation

--is made from the ordinary practice in giving this abstract of them in a note. " Prof. Milne-

Edwards remarked that this discovery was equally interesting to the zoologist and physiolo-

gist. Metamorphoses like those of the insect and tadpole were formerly supposed to be ex-

ceptions to the ordinary rule, until the researches of Harvey showed, that the chick in the egg
underwent changes quite as extensive and remarkable. It now appears to be a law of nature,
that animals are more alike as they are observed at a period nearer their embryonic state
and it is of the highest consideration in zoology to show, through what stages animals pass
before arriving at their adult form. The zoological affinities of the trilobites were long a
matter of dispute. They were first supposed to be Chitons, until Alexander Brongniart
showed they were true crustaceans. But the crustacean forms are very varied, and it has

been held uncertain whether the trilobites were allied to certain Isopoda, sc. Oniscus, or, as
Mr. Thompson suggests, to Apus. Barrande's observations confirm the views of Mr. Thomp-
son. The Isopods are born almost with the same form which they retain through life ; but
the Apus quits the egg in an imperfect state, having but few of the segments which consti-
tute the body of the adult. In the young Sao the number of thoracic segments continually
increased until the animal was adult; and to each of these (though no traces are now seen)
legs were certainly affixed, not like the hard legs of insects adapted to terrestrial movement,
but soft and membranous like those of Apus, for swimming in the water. The cephalic
shield, which in the youngest stage of Sao formed the whole animal, constitutes but a small
portion of the adult ; and the amount of change exhibited in successive stages of development
is so great, that it would be no wonder if zoologists should have built up upon it numerous
species and even several genera. The rule which obtains now, that animals belonging to the
same zoological type, though much differing in the adult, lose those differences in states ap-
proaching their embryonic condition, is seen even in the remains of animals which perished
in the most remote epochs ; and thus the tenants of the Silurian seas furnish arguments

hitherto afforded by the study of living animals alone."

On the Distribution of Gold Ore in the Crust and on the Surface of the Earth.
             By Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, G.C.S., F.R.S. kc

   The recent discovery of considerable quantities of gold ore in California having
excited the public mind, and led to some conclusions which he esteemed lobe exagge-
rated, the author took this occasion of the meeting of the British Association to bring
forward the whole subject of the distribution of gold ore over the surface of the
earth, not merely to develope his own views and those of others, but also to elicit by
discussion, the knowledge of the assembled geologists, mineralogists, miners and statists.
An enlarged Mercator's projection of the world was exhibited, on which all the leading
ridges which had afforded gold ore in times past or present, were marked, as taken in a
great part from a general sketch-map by M. Adolphe Erman of Berlin, the explorer
of Siberia and Kamschatka, which is appended to a geographical and mineralogical
description of California by M. Hoppe and himself, as inserted in the ' Archiv fiir
Wissenschaftliche Kunde von Russland' (7 band, 4 heft).

   Referring to the works of Humboldt and Rose on the Ural Mountains, as well as to
those of Helmersen and Hoffman, the former of whom constructed some time since a
map of all the gold tracts of Siberia, and also citing the other contributions of M.
Adolphe Erman on this head, Sir Roderick gave a condensed view of his own obser-
vations on the gold regions of the Ural Mountains. His exploration of that chain, in
company with his associates M. de Verneuil and Count Keyserling, led him to form
the opinion, that great and rich gold veins had alone been produced in the oldest
formations, and chiefly where they have been highly metamorphosed by the intrusion
of igneous rocks; in other words, that wherever clay-slates, old limestones, and
greywacke sandstones (whether azoic or of Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous age),
had been penetrated by greenstone, porphyry, syenite, granite or serpentine, and were
consequently in a more or less metamorphic or crystalline condition, there auriferous
quartzose veinstones most occur, containing gold ore diffused in grains, leaves, lumps,
and irregular filaments. Every discovery in the auriferous regions of Siberia and
America, as well as all the workings in the Old World in past times, confirm this view,
and prove it to be a geological constant, that the azoic and palaeozoic rocks, when
metamorphosed, are the only great repositories of gold ore. The minute quantities
of auriferous pyrites and gold which have been detected in the secondary and
younger deposits do not interfere with this generalization.

   To the general view of Baron von Humboldt, that the richest gold deposits are those
which are derived from ridges having a meridian direction, M. Adolphe Erman is de-
cidedly opposed ; but Sir Roderick is of opinion, that a much greater quantity of gold
ore has been obtained from chains having a nearer relation to N. and S. than from
those approaching to equatorial or E. and W. directions, due perhaps to the general
form of the chief masses of land and the prevailing strike of the palaeozoic rocks. He
next pointed out an error into which some persons had fallen, of supposing that the
chief Uralian mines were worked underground ; the only small subterranean work being
one near Ekaterinburg, which affords a very slight profit. All the rich mines along that
meridian chain, throughout 8° of N. latitude, are simply diggings and washings which
are made in the detritus or shingle accumulated on the slopes of the ridges and in the
adjacent valleys, and with one small exception are all upon the eastern or Siberian side.
Tliis phaenomenon in the Ural Mountains is a necessary result of their structure ; the
older and more crystalline formations through which the eruptive rocks have risen
constituting chiefly the crest and eastern slopes of the chain, whilst the western slopes
are occupied by deposits of younger or Permian age. As the conglomerates and de-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  61

 trihis of the latter deposits contain no traces of gold, though they abonnd in copper
 ores, it was pointed out by the author in his work on Russia, that the auriferous
 veins were there posterior to those of iron and copper, and must have been produced
 after the accumulation of the Permian system.

     Exhibiting maps, sections and views of the Ural Mountains, formerly prepared by
 him, and referring to the description of California by Erman and others, he entered
 upon a comparison between the two counti'ies, and showed that there were great coinci-
 dences of mineralogical structure in both, and that with these constants the same
 results obtained in America as in the Ural ; the chief distinction consisting in the

 apparently larger proportion of gold in the detritus of the newly-discovered deposits of

 California than in those of the Ural. He contended, however, that no very large tract

 of California would be found to be as uniformly auriferous as the banks and slopes of
 the upper tributaries of the Sacramento. That gold ore has been found in certain
 localities along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada is admitted, but its conti-
 nuity as well as the breadth of the deposit have yet to be ascertained.

    And here the author took some pains to indicate the distinction between all such

 surface operations as those of Siberia, California, and the Brazils, and those works
 in which, besides the ores of silver, copper, &c., gold also had been extracted from
 veins in the solid or parent rock ; the latter operation being very seldom remunera-
 tive. Adverting to the fact, that in the Ural Mountains the veinstones "in situ" (in
 this case little or no admixture with other ore exists) have proved very slightly remu-
nerative when worked further downwards, he glanced at an opinion of Humboldt, who
looking to the great lumps or " pepites " occasionally found in the surface rubbish, sup-

posed that there may have been some connection between the production of gold and

 the atmosphere ; since judging from these specimens, it was from the superficial extre-
mity of these quartz veins that the richest bunches of gold must have been derived ; the
veinstones when followed downwards having invariably proved either sterile or very

 slightly productive.

    The author carefully distinguishes the major part of the auriferous detritus from
modern alluvia, and shows that it has been the result of former and more powerful

--causes of degradation than those now in operation causes which distributed coarse

shingle, blocks and sand, and which wearing away all the associated schists and
the most oxidizable ores, left only the harder rocks, particularly the quartz veins,
together with the harder and nobler metals gold and platinum. The existing rivers
have had little more to do with this phEenomenon than that in mountainous tracts

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and where they have a rapid descent, they have occasionally laid bare the edge of the
previously-formed and water-worn gold accumulations. By this observation it is not
meant to deny, that where existing streams flow directly from rocks "in situ" which
are now impregnated with gold, a little auriferous detritus must not naturally be

washed down, but simply to prevent the student who may refer to detailed maps of

gold tracts from imagining that the rivers are auriferous, except where they derive
that quality from the wearing away and breaking down of the mixed materials

which constitute their ancient banks. In a word, British geologists may be assured
that gold shingle and sand have been accumulated just in the same manner as the
former great drifts of their own country, whether general or local, in which bones of

the fossil elephant, rhinoceros, and other extinct quadrupeds occur.
    Having terminated his account of the geological constants which accompany gold

mines in Europe, Asia and America, Sir Roderick then traced the history of gold and

its development, as known to the ancients and our ancestors of the middle ages. He

showed that in all regions where the above-mentioned palaeozoic, crystalline and
eruptive rocks occuiTed, gold had been found in greater or less quantities, and that
just in proportion to the time a country had been civilized, the extraction of the pre-
cious metal had diminished ; so that in many tracts, as in Bohemia, where gold had
formerly prevailed to a great extent, it had been worked out and the mines forgotten.
Briefly alluding to the examples at home of gold-works in Wales under the Romans,
where Silurian rocks are pierced by trap, and contain pyritous veinstones as described
by himself*, and to the former gold of Scotland and Ireland in similar rocks, its oc-
casional discovery still in the detritus of the county of Wicklow, and its diffusion in

62^ REPORT-- 1849.

some of the oldest Silurian strata of Merionethshire, he particularly dwelt on the con-
tinental ti'acts formerly so rich, as cited by Strabo, all of which (with the exception
of the North Ural or countiy of the Arimaspes*, from whence, as Humboldt believes,
the Scythian ores came) had been exhausted and were no longer gold-bearing di-
stricts. This circumstance is explained by the Scythian or Uralian gold having re-
mained unknown from the classical age until this century. So completely ignorant
were the modern Russians of the existence of gold in the Ural Mountains, or that
they had in their hands the country which supplied so much gold to Greece and
Rome, that excellent German miners had long worked the iron and copper mines of
that chain before any gold was discovered. Even then gold was worked from a solid
veinstone for some time before the accidental discovery of gold ore in the ancient al-
luvium or drift led to the superficial diggings, which produced at an infinitely less
expense the present produce. All the energy however displayed by the Russian
miners has failed to augment the amount of Ui-alian gold much beyond half a million
sterling, and as the period is arriving when the local depressions or basins of aurife-
rous detritus of that region will be successively washed out, the Ural will then re-
semble many other countries in possessing actual mines of iron and copper, but a
history merely of its gold. Russia, however, has also the golden key of all eastern
Siberia, in which various offsets from the Altai 'chain (chiefly those which separate
the rivers Lena, Jenisei, &c., or stretch along the shores of the Baikal lake) have
proved so very productive in their gravel, that for some years they have afforded the
enormous annual supply of upwards of three millions sterling, exclusive of the Ural.

   As in the Ural Mountains, so has it proved to be in South America. There, the
Spaniards, notwithstanding their keen search for gold from the days of Columbus to the
present time, made many works in the parent rock, but either never discovered its
existence or neglected to work it in the gravel and sand of the valley of the Sacra-
mento, which tract they left in quiet possession of the native Indians, It was only
indeed by the recent accident of the breaking away of a bank of detritus by a mill
race, that this region was opened out for the first time to the colonists of the Anglo-
Saxon race. Wliat then is to be the value and duration of these Californian mines?
On the point of absolute value the author does not venture to form an estimate in
the absence of suflicient facts and statistical data ; but in regard to the duration of
this mining ground, he speculates that granting it to be locally much richer than
similarly constituted detritus in the Ural, still there is nothing to interfere with the
belief, founded on the experience derived from all other auriferous tracts, including
those of Bohemia so productive in the middle ages, that, with the activity and num-
bers of the men now employed in the works, these deposits may in uo great length

of time be exhausted.
    Judging from analogous facts, he is inclined to think, that the very great per-centage

of gold ore in the gravel of the valleys of the Sacramento, indicates that the most
valuable portions of the original veins have been ground down by former powerful
denuding agencies ; and if the rule be allowed which obtains very generally in
mining, that the richer the veins the less are they likely to be spread over a large
mass of parent rock, so is he disposed to think, that it will only be in certain patches
that very great wealth will be discovered, and hence that it would be very wrong to
conclude, that because rich gold detritus has been discovered on the affluents of the
Sacramento, in lat. 40°, and also on the river Colorado in lat. 34° 5', all the interme-
diate tract of country should prove productive. Considering the vast addition in the
few last years made to the European market by researches in Siberia, and seeing that
such addition has produced no change in the value of gold as a standard, the author is
of opinion (as far as the evidences allow him to judge), that the Californian discovery
is not likely to produce any disturbance in the standard. At the same time he ex-
presses his full agreement with M. Erman and others, that with the advancement of
colonization in the central regions of North Asia, and other parts of the world

where civilization has not yet extended, other gold tracts may be discovered, wherever
the geological and lithological constants to which he has adverted occur; but neither

Russians. R. I. M.

would this circumstance induce him to fear, that such discoveries (occurring probably

at long intervals of time and for the most part in countries at enormous distances
from the means of transport) will much more than compensate for the wear and tear

of the precious metal, and the wants of a rapidly increasing population.

Sir Roderick then briefly alluded to the erroneous opinion of old authors, that the

origin of gold had any reference to hot or equatorial climates, as testified by the abun-
dance of ore in Siberia, even up to 67° N. lat., and cited a table of M. Erman, which

showed, that by far the greatest quantity occurred in northern latitudes, there being
every probability, that much more of this ore may be detected in the northern pro-

longation of the American chains and in the frozen regions of Russian America, just

as it had been discovered in ridges of the north-east of Siberia and even near to Kam-

schatka.

He reminded his auditors, that in considering the composition of the chief meri-

dian ridge of Australia and its parallels, he had foretold that gold would be found

in them ; and he stated that in the last year a resident in Sydney (Mr. Smith),
who had read what he had written and spoken on this point, had sent him specimens

of gold ore found in the Blue Mountains, whilst from another source (Mr. Phillips)

he had learned, that the parallel N. and S. ridge in the Adelaide region, which had
yielded so much copper, had also given more undoubted signs of gold ore. The

operatien of the English laws of royalty had induced Sir Roderick Murchison to re-

present to Her Majesty's Secretary of State, that no colonists would bestir themselves

in gold mining if some authoritative declaration on the subject were not made. The

auriferous lines in Australia were marked in the general map.

In support of his general views, he called for the evidence of Professor William

Rogers of Philadelphia, whose beautiful map of the Appalachian or Alleghany chain

was exhibited ; and he also fortified his inductions respecting the chief auriferous

masses of Mexico and Peru by appeals to Colonel Colquhoun and Mr. Pentland,

all these gentlemen being present. References were also made to an article by M.

Michel Chevalier in the 'Revue des deux Mondes' (1847), on the silver and gold

mines of the New World as compared with those of the Old World ; also to the work
on the mines of Mexico by M. St. Clair Duport, to M. Duflot de Mofras, to Mac-

culloch's ' Dictionary of Commerce,' and to Professor Ansted's ' Gold Seeker's

Manual.'

In conclusion, he specially directed attention to the distinctions between the two

classes of gold-works, i. e. in the veinstones and in their debris, and showed, that

in the present day as in the remotest periods, the simple digging into and washing

of old alluvial accumulations, have invariably proved to be the great source of pro-

duction                              whilst in works in the solid rock, on the contrary, the extraction of the gold
                                  ;

from the silver alloy and other ores with which it is mixed up therein, and its sepa-

ration from them, have proved so expensive, that to mine for gold as the Spaniards

have done in South America, has frequently proved ruinous even to a proverb*.

     On the Fossil Geology of Cornwall. By Charles William Peach.

   The author commenced by noticing the extensive beds containing fish remains,
which had been discovered since he communicated to the Section at Cork the few
then found; that the beds enclosing these remains extend from near the Ranie Head,
Whitsand Bay, to the west side of Fowey, and that they are in places abundant;
Bellerophontes also are rather plentiful, but each appear to have lived and died in
separate flocks, rarely being intermixed with each other; a very few Gasteropods
{Loxonema) are mingled with them. The beds generally rise at high angles, and are
intermingled with trappean and quartzose beds, the line of strike nearly east and
west, with a southerly dip, and appear to have been in places greatly disturbed.

   Underlying these beds on the south side are a series of slaty, arenaceous and cal-
careous ones, containing Corals, Crinoids, Shells, Orthoceratites, a few Goniatites and
Trilobites, some of these very abundant. These beds are first seen on the east side of

Pencarra Point, and extend to beyond the Black Mead, St. Austel Ba)'. Outside these
ave a series of hard quartzose rocks, commencing at the Cairn near Goran Haven,
passing across to Caerhayes Beach, tlience to Gerrans Bay; these contain Corals and
Crinoids very rare, Orthides, and other bivalves more plentifully, and Trilobites not
uncommon : there are also at these places small beds of limestone, a large series of
conglomerates, in which are rolled blocks of limestone filled with crinoids and Ortlio-

ccratites ; these rocks are a little out of the general line of strike. On the north side

of these fish-beds are a very extensive range of fossiliferous ones, resting conformably

on them ; these may be traced from Whitsand Bay to St. Veep, and St. Winnow, and

completely occupy the county via Bodmin, Liskeard, &c., to the sea on the north side.
Although all the other organisms mentioned as occurring in the southern rocks are
found in these, no traces of Trilobites have been noticed until reaching Bodmin ; and
at Menheniott, a bed exists there containing thousands. The author had also found
organic remains rather plentiful at St. Columbporth, and at Newquay in the North
Channel ; at the latter place splendid Turbinolopsides, Crinoids, Trilobites, and a mag-
nificent spine of an Onchus in clay-slates, associated with beds of impure limestone.

   He remarked upon the very few fish remains that agreed with those found in the

old red sandstone (one good specimen of Asterolepis, the species selected by Mr.
Hugh Miller to illustrate 'The Footprints of the Creator') and those described in

the ' Silurian System.' He concluded by saying that when Sir H. Dela Beche made
his survey of the county, only three or four places were known to be fossiliferous ; now
three-fourths of the county had been proved to be so, and in many places abundant
he trusted the day was not far distant when a new section would be run through the

county, and the age of the rocks settled.

Notice of the Discovery of Beds of Keuper Sandstone containing Zoophytes in

                       the Vicinity of Leicester. By John Plant.

   In this paper the author describes the position of certain marls in the new red sand-
stone laid open by the cutting of the Leicester and Swannington railway, and the
existence in them of markings in the sandstone which he refers to the genus Gorgonia.
The sections show a thickness varying from 2 to 50 feet of superficial and detrital
deposit, below which appear clays, marls, shaly marls and sandstones, offering a total
thickness of about 200 feet, of which the first 150 feet contain masses and blocks, some
of them weighing many tons, of the sienites, porphyries, and carboniferous limestone
of Charnwood Forest and the neighbourhood. Amongst these are gray shaly sand-
stones containing the fossils developed between two beds of red clay which thin and
swell out very irregularly. Between the sandstones are bands of fine marl enveloping
the bodies described by the author as the polypidoms of a coralline, and these occur
in great profusion on the surfaces of nearly every band, the bands being also furrowed
by other markings. The polypidoms lie confusedly and in all instances occur as sili-

ceous casts, the delicate organization of the cells being obliterated. Associated with
them at times are thickly-set small granular concretions, giving the surface the appear-
ance of shagreen.

   The strata containing the fossils are considered to represent the keuper sandstone,
both by their similar character and their distance from the lias. The author sug-
gests for these fossil markings the name Gorgonia Keuperi.

On the Discovery of a Living Representative of a small Group of Fossil Volutes
           occurring in the Tertiary Rocks. By Lovell Reeve, F.L.S.

    In the Eocene portion of the tertiary series a small group of Volutes occurs, distin-
guished by a peculiarity of form and sculpture which is not found in any living species
collected hitherto. The well-known Valuta lima of the British tertiary strata may be
regarded as the type of this group ; but there are other fossil species of the group which
has been arranged as a subgenus by Mr. Swainson, luider the title Volutilithes.
During the late expedition of H.M.S. Samarang, a single living example of this type,

very closely and elaborately sculptured, and encircled by two or three coloured bands,
was dredged by Sir Edward Belcher oflF the Cape of Good Hope, from a bank of
dead shells, corallines, &c., at the depth of 132 fathoms.

   All the species of Valuta hitherto known in a recent state are of comparatively solid
stnicture, characterized by a copious deposit of enamel on the body whorl on reaching
maturity, and none exhibit any detail of sculpture beyond tliat of longitudinal ribs.
The species under consideration is not identical with any of the tertiary species, but
of the same type more minutely latticed, similarly coronated, so to speak, and with a
similar channeled excavation round the spire.

   It is proposed to name it Voluta ahyssicola, and it will be described and figured in
the Mollusca of the Voyage of the Samarang.

   Prof. W. B. Rogers exhibited the State Survey of Virginia, geologically coloured,

and gave a general sketch of the structure of the country, with especial reference to the
Faults in the Alleghanies. The State of Virginia comprises an area of 6(),000 square

--miles, containing four distinct physical and geological districts : 1 st, the Tertiary plain

on the Atlantic; 2ndly, the rising ground consisting of gneiss, mica-slate and other
primitive rocks, which lies between the coast plain and the Alleghanies, with the
oolitic coal-field of Richmond occupying a depression on its surface ; 3rdly, the Alle-
ghany mountains ; and 4thly, the great western coal-field. The Alleghanies consist of
numerous parallel ridges of palaeozoic rocks, ranging north-east and south-west, sepa-
rated from the primitive region by the " Blue ridge," a tract of igneous and highly

altered rocks, which may be regarded as the igneous axis of the State. The anti-
clinal ridges of the Alleghanies all lean to the westward ; and this want of symmetry
increases towards the "Blue ridge," until the strata forming the western flanks of

each ridge are completely inverted, and dip under those on the eastei*n side ; these
great foldings and inversions of the strata are frequently attended by enormous faults,
the western side of a ridge being absolutely engulphed and the eastern over-riding
it ; in these cases the Lower Silurian rocks sometimes rest on the inverted carboni-
ferous limestone, and even on the conglomerates of the coal-measures : the displace-
ment of the strata must amount in many instances to 10,000 feet; but if a fault is
traced to a great distance either way, it is found to diminish gradually and terminate
in a mere flexure of the strata; the length of the faults is sometimes more than 100
miles. Prof, Rogers then mentioned the occurrence of workable anthracite below the
carboniferous limestone of the Alleghanies. In conclusion, he stated that during a
recent tour in the Alps he had observed a general conformity in the structure of those
mountains with the law of flexures exhibited in the Alleghanies; that is to say, the
greatest dip of every anticlinal and synclinal was on the side furthest removed from
the axis of disturbance : so that the general direction of the ridges and the curvature
of the strata would now afibrd indications of the direction of the dynamic agency
by which those flexures were produced.

On the Age of the Saurians named Thecodontosaurus and Palseosaurus.
                         By William Sanders, F.G.S.

The remains of these animals were discovered in the year 1835 by Dr. Riley and

Mr. Stutchbury, who state that the dolomitic conglomerate in which they were im-
bedded forms the base of the new red sandstone, adopting the views announced by

Dr, Buckland and Mr. Conybeare, in their Memoir of the Bristol Coal District.

This memoir was published in 1822, accompanied by a map and sections, which re-
present distinctly the conglomerate rocks as constituting the lower division of the new

red sandstone. The age thus assigned to these fossils was adopted by all geologists

it is so described in the best elementary works, and enters into the general statement

made by Professor Owen in his Report on Fossil Reptiles. The Ordnance maps and

sections present no alteration in this respect ; they likewise represent the conglo-

merate as completely subjacent to the later new red.
   Nevertheless the elaborate essay of Sir Henry De la Beche ' On the Formation of

Rocks in South Wales and South-western England,' in the first volume of Reports of

the Geological Survey, contains such a description of the new red sandstone beds as

to lead the reader to concur with him in believing, that such conglomerates and

limestones "may be of different dates," and that "the cause of their production con-

--66 REPORT 1849.

tinuod up to, and included the base of the lias." The author of that essay also notices
ceilain tranquil deposits of red clays and marls on the surface of the carboniferous
rocks. After making these preliminary remarks, Mr. Sanders exhibited a map of the
parish of St. George's, near the mouth of the Avon, and another map of the three
parishes of Compton Martin and West and East [larptree, together with sections for
the purpose of illustrating the fact, that the spaces coloured on the Ordnance map as
conglomerate, are reallj' composed of several small tracts of conglomerate at different
elevations, separated by larger tracts of tranquilly-deposited clays, marls, and sand-
stones, similar in all respects to those which all concur in marking as the upper part
of the new red sandstone.

   The evidences first, of a regular succession of strata on the sides of the hills ; se-
condly, of the action of water at low levels ; and thirdly, of similar structure of rocks
in the lower as in the upper parts, denoting similar depth of water, lead to the con-
clusion that the land included in the Bristol district was, during the formation of such
jjarts of the new red sandstone as are therein deposited, subjected to a gradual move-
ment downwards, so that the waters first vouched the lowest parts of the hills, and
then gradually ascended up to the highest point at which the conglomerates are

--found. This hypothesis is confirmed by the following facts: On the northern side of

the Mendip hills, at the height of 750 to 800 feet above mean sea level, there is depo-
sited a conglomerate of the age of the white lias resting on lias strata tranquilly de-
posited. On the tract of limestone northwards, called Broadfield Down, a conglomerate
of similar age occurs at the height of about 550 feet. On the top of an isolated hill
intermediate between these stations, at an elevation of 350 to 420 feet, occurs a lias
conglomerate varying from 30 to 70 feet in thickness, not at the base of the lias, but
likewise of the age of the white lias. This bed of conglomerate therefore descended
from the shores on each side and crossed the valley at a lower level. The continuity
of this bed renders highly probable the inference that the strata which are subjacent
to this lias conglomerate on the hills, were also more or less continuous from shore

to shore.

    If these views be correct, if the order of succession presented by the strata accu-
mulated on the slopes of the hills correspond with the order of time at which they
were formed, then a means is afforded of approximating to the age of any given bed
resting on the older rocks, by reference to some other bed of known age at a limited
distance from the hills and at a lower elevation, with which the given bed may have
been in continuity.

   The dolomitic conglomerate containing the Saurians is situated about300 feet above
mean sea level. The nearest horizontal formation is the base of the lias, which is
at nearly the same height. The deposits of similar age at a distance of nearly one
mile, are lower by about 100 feet, and similar strata at two miles from the limestone
range are depressed to the extent of 150 feet. Combining these facts with the prin-
ciples previously indicated, the Saurians, which form the subject of inquiry, may be
pronounced to have lived during the time of the latest parts of the new red sandstone.

   Remarks in confirmation were made on the affinity of the Saurians with the Rhyn-
chosaurus, and on the improbability that any part of the Permian system exists within

the limits of the Bristol district.

    Mr. H. E. Strickland exhibited some specimens of vegetable remains in the keuper
sandstone of Longdon, Worcestershire, where they were first noticed by the Dean
of Westminster. These are for the most part fragmentary and obscure, but some of
them appear referable to the genus Calaniites, and one specimen seems to be a J'^ollxia,
a genus found in the new red sandstone of the continent, but only once before met
with in Britain. [This was in magnesian limestone of Northumberland, see Lindley,
Fossil Flora, plate 195.] Tile state of preservation of these remains is remarkable;
for instead of being black and carbonaceous, as is usual with fossil plants of so great
antiquity, they are of a light brown colour, and highly elastic, resembling recent dead

leaves. When viewed under the microscope these vegetable fragments exhibit the
cellular texture in great perfection. The only other locality in Great Britain wlicre

plants have been found in the keuper sandstone is at Ripple, three miles E. of Long-
don, where Calamites occur, but the sandstone is not quarried there at present. The
only animal remains found at these localities are small teeth and dorsal spines of the

ffybodus.

   Mr. S. Stufclibury exhibited a large cylindrical bone found by Mr. Thompson of
Aberdeen in the " Bone-bed " of Aust Cliff on ihe Severn, and presented to the Bristol
Institution. The strata at this spot consists of the insect limestone, landscape marble,
and bone-bed of the lias, resting on the marls of the new red sandstone system. But
since the fish remains in the bone-bed belong to the Triassic type, it may be equally
well to compare any reptilian remains found in it with those of the new red sand-
stone. The present bone, though wanting both extremities, is two feet in length, and
more than five inches in diameter at one end, where it is broken off" abruptly : it is
unlike any bone of Chelonian or Enaliosaiu", but presents some i-esemblance to the
long bones of small recent Batrachia, on which account Mr. Stutchbury considers it
referable to the great Labyrinthodon of the new sandstone.

On the Cause of the general Presence of Phosphorus in Strata and in all fertile
   Soils ; also on Pseudo-Coprolites, and the Conversion of the Contents of Sewers
   and Cesspools into Manure. By The Dean of Westminster, F.R.S.

   Since Liebig first suggested the application of fossil phosphates to the same pur-
poses with recent bones and guano in agriculture, many inquiries have been directed
to such localities as promised to afford a supply of bones, coprolites, &c. ; the bone-
bed of the lias, exposed on the shores of the Severn, has not yet been worked, and
will not repay the cost of working, but the red crag of Felixstow on the coast of Suffolk
has afforded many thousands of tons of phosphoric pebbles, mixed with bones of whales
and elephants and other large mammalia, and with flint pebbles, siliceous sand and
crag-shells ; the phosphoric bodies show upon analysis a composition nearly identical
with that of the true coprolite. The origin of the pseudo-coprolites in this remarkable
deposit must be sought in a period antecedent to the crag, during which the London
clay was in progress of formation, and when the muddy bed of the Eocene sea received
daily accessions of phosphoric compoimds from the dead bodies and fteces of fishes
and Molluscs which inhabited it. The remains of these creatures, decomposing in the
mud, evolved ingredients which, combining with the surrounding sediment, became
fixed in Septaria and smaller concretions, in deposits of siliceous sand no such com-
binations could take place, and hence the barrenness of siliceous sands when converted
into dry land. Phosphate of lime exists largely in all organized bodies, and is soluble
slowly in water charged with carbonic acid : we may assume that all sea-water con-
tains it; it exists in marine vegetables, and in herbivorous and carnivorous fishes and
Molluscs. The combination of these phosphates with the earthy concretion not only
purifies the water of the ocean and maintains it in a state adapted for the existence
of living things; it serves also to form a continually increasing store of fertility against
the time when the sea-beds shall be elevated and converted into corn-fields. While
the crag was in progress, much of the London clay has been wasted by denudation,
and its Septaria mixed with the shells and bones during the later period of the forma-
tion of the crag. It is probable that the Septaria absorbed a still further quantity of

phosphoric matter during their accumulation in the crag : it is possible, also, that

the peroxide of iron which pervades these pebbles and bones in the crag may have
added to the phosphate when all the ingredients were in a semi-fluid state at the
bottom of the sea. The Dean then referred to the discovery by Mr. Payne of beds
of pseudo-coprolites in the upper greensand of Farnham. Here sponges and other
organic bodies appear to have served as recipients of the phosphates; the Kimme-
ridge clay of Shotover Hill contains abundant casts of the air-chambers of Ammo-

nites filled with marl, and containing 20 or 30 per cent, of phosphate of lime. Since
all strata containing organic remains have more or less phosphoric compounds, these
must also be present in the soils produced by their decomposition. Another large
class of soils is produced from the decomposition of volcanic rocks and granite ; in
these phosphoric matter is also present, either combined with lime (apatite), or as
phosphate of iron, and here its presence is unconnected with organized remains.
In Spain the apatite forms an immense vein in ancient schists; and every specimen
brought home by Dr. Daubeny has a radiated and stalactitic structure, showing that
they were deposited from water, which must have taken it up previously from other
rocks. In conclusion, it was suggested that, since clay and marl and lime are em-
ployed by Natvire to absorb the phosphoi'ic acid produced by the decomposition of

                                                                                                      5*

 organized bodies at tlie bottom of ancient seas and lakes, so they might be applied
artificially to deodorize and combine witlj the phosphates in the sewerage of large
 towns.

 On an original broad Sheet of Granite, interstratified among Slates with Grit
    Beds, betiveen Falmouth and Truro in Cornwall. By the Rev. D. Williams,
    F.G.S.
    This bed of granite is the only one of the kind ever seen by the author, who has

 traced it over a breadth of four miles by two. It varies in thickness from 4 feet
,9 inches to 16 feet, and in dip from 15° to 40° ; in some places it undulates repeatedly
 with the slates, and in one there is a small shift in the slates, whilst the granite is
 only bent.

On some Chatiges in the Male Flowers of Forty Days' Maize.
                 By Robert A. C. Austen, F.R.S.

The specimens I herewith send were taken from a crop of that variety of the Zea
Mais which has recently been introduced into this country as the Forty Days' Maize :

the seed was said to have been raised on the slopes of the Pyrenees, at an elevation
of 3000 to 4000 feet, and the variety was considered as more likely to succeed than
any of those as yet cultivated in this country.

   As is well known, the Zea Mais is a monoecious grass : the male flowers are borne
in distinct terminal panicles, which rise high and clear of the leaves ; the female
flowers are contained in lateral cobs, which consist of bracts enveloping a cone;
these consist of several double rows (8-10) of flowei's; of these the pistils project be-
yond the bracts. Several female flowers are grouped together ; one only of each
group usually perfects its seed, but the abortive ones can be detected, and help to ac-
count for the number of valves which are to be found in conjunction with each seed.

   The external bracts serve to protect the whole cone of associated female flowers of
the maize, and which are not therefore provided for by the hardening of the valves
of the corolla, as in Plialaris, &c. ; these envelopes are therefore but imperfectly repre-
sented in the ears of maize; and it will be observed that where the seed is abortive
they are developed more fully.

    Compared with a crop of four varieties of American maize, of which the heads of
male flowers were all full and branched, the contrast was striking : a large proportion
of the flowers of the forty days' maize were single like ears of wheat; another pecu-
liarity was, that it presented a number of heads of naked grain; this change has been
noticed, but instances may not have come within the observation of English botanists.
Mr. Turpin, as quoted by Moquin-Tandon, thus describes it : " Where the transforma-
tion of stamens into pistils takes place, there is sometimes a single supernumerary
ear, which is usually situated near the summit of the principal axis; sometimes
several; in this case each branch bears its own." This is a true description of the
appearance which the heads commonly exhibit ; it is in the lower portion of the ear
that the grain is wanting in wheat, particularly in cold situations or in cold seasons.

    With the conversion of stamens into pistils in the terminal panicles, there is fre-
quently a suppression of the lateral cobs.

   The monoecious grasses are mostly tropical or sub-tropical ; but in the present in-
stance we seem to have an example of a hardy variety of Zea taking the character of
the inflorescence of the grasses of the temperate and colder zones.

       On a Series of Morphological Changes observed in Trifolium repens.
                             By Robert A. C. Austen, F.R.S.

    In a paper by Dr. Lankester to the Natural History Section of this Association
last year, he referred to instances, he had recently observed, of proliferous clover. In
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  60

consequence of some remarks which fell from the several gentlemen named in that

paper, at the time the specimens were observed, my attention was drawn to the sub-

ject: the results I here offer in the shape of a few notes to explain the drawings*.

   To such as seek for illustrations of this branch of botanical inquiry, instances will
rapidly accumulate from a large list of plants. Some genera however seem to present
such changes more readily than others ; and again, in some species of a genus they

will be frequent, in others rarely, if ever, occur. Morphological changes are very

common in TrifoUum repens, occasional in TV. pratense, but in this species they sel-
dom extend beyond the calyx, whilst in TV. incarnatum I have never yet detected an

instance, though I have cultivated it for s:;me years.
    Mr. Babington, in his ' Manual,' after the description of TV. repens, observes, " that

in damp seasons the pod is often protruded in the form of a horn, or changed into a

small leaf." This is an exact description of an appearance which the flower-heads fre-
quently present, but the formations of pod or leaf seem to be exhibitions of contrary
tendencies; in the one the plant hastens to accomplish its end, in the other it breaks
away and reverts to the production of leaves.

   About the end of May in this year, the flowerets consisted of a calyx of the usual

size ; the petals and stamens were rudimentary, and the plant, as if passing over two
stages of its flower-structure, proceeded directly to the production of a pod. These
pods contained ovule-like bodies, and were very much larger than the ordinary seed-
pods of the plant.

   About the beginning of June the clover-heads with enlarged pods had a very dif-
ferent appearance ; one of the white petals was to be seen protruding beyond the
calyx, and partly enclosing the pod ; this petal was always the vexillum ; the re-
maining parts of the flower being suppressed as before.

   As the season advanced, the production of the "horn-like pod" was less frequent;
and it was then principally that the substitution of leaves for flower-organs was to be
observed : and at the present moment (Sept. 4) it would be diflicult to find a single

instance of change.

   From this it would seem, that, according as the conditions at any particular moment
may be favourable to vigorous growth or otherwise, the plant advances to the pro-
duction of floral organs or reverts to leaves ; and as the formation of the several parts

of the flower follow in succession, from the calyx upwards, so the part of the flower
exhibiting the change will be higher according as the plant's flowering-season has
advanced.

 --The changes indicated in the drawings accompanying the paper were as follows :

   I. Calyx. The calyx-teeth often rise into single leaves ; but when compound leaves
are formed, the division seems to be as follows -. the two large equal teeth, which are
opposite the vexillum, form one ternate leaf, and another leaf is formed from the three

--remaining teeth.
   II. Corolla. The part which here most frequently reverts to a leaf is the vexillum,
and this a perfect one. Of these leaflets, the alse are often seen forming simple leaves,

--as also the carina, but their perfect union into a ternate leaf is less common.
   III. Stamens. Whatever changes the flower may exhibit, these organs are always
in a state to be recognised, and their reversion to leaves less frequent than in any
other part; so that there is more difficulty in detei-mining the number of leaves
which go to form this portion. As two ternate leaves form the calyx and corolla, it
might be supposed that the stamens were constructed out of the same number. The

figures represent cases of a stamen reverting to a leaf with a true stamen attached
to its stalk on either side ; the single anterior stamen, when it reverts, seems always
disposed to form more than a simple leaf, and it is therefore probable that the ten

stamens (O-j-l) may be formed out of four sets of ternate leaves.
   IV. From the well-known character of the pod and pistil in LcguminoscE, it might

be expected that instances of reversion to leaf would be most frequent in this part of
the flower ; and a series might easily have been produced which would have repre-
sented it in every stage of passage j some of these were given. From these it would
appear that the pod is not formed of a whole compound leaf, as either two scales, or
two abortive leaves, are constantly to be seen at the base of the imperfect pod on
either side ; the pod is therefore usually formed out of the middle leaflet. In one

             * The paper was accompanied by a series of dravrings on an enlarged scale.
--70 REPORT 1849.

flowev-head however each division of the pistil-leaf had become a pod, with a distinct

stem, and the ovules inwards.

Ovules seem to be produced only when junction of the edges of the pistil-leaf takes

place ; in other cases leaflets are produced in the place of ovules.

In cases where every other part of the floral series has been regularly developed,

the pistil occasionally will take the form of a perfsct ternate leaf, and then the axis of

the plant is continued through the flower.

Some of these changes have been already noticed and described ; but one com-

plete series, extending from the calyx through every part of the flower, has not, that

I am aware, been recorded as to this, or indeed any other plant.

With respect to the leaves of Tr. repens, it is stated by M. Moquin-Tandon that

they occasionally take additional leaflets, and he quotes instances of four, five and seven.

In Link's ' Re]iort on Botany ' (Ray Soc. Translation), M. Walpers is quoted for a no-

tice of " a monstrous seven-leaved leaf" of this species, who considers the three leaves,

as well as the simple leaves, as shortened pinnated leaves.

   From the very common occurrence of three simple leaves in the place of the com-

pound one ; from the instance already noticed of the termination of the axis in three

opposite pistils, as well as from the structure of the base of the stalk of the ordinary

leaves, it would seem rather that they consisted of unions of three simple ones. Though

MM.directed to look for instances of pinnated leaves by these notices of  Moquin-

Tandon and Walpers, I was not able to meet with any.

On Fairy Rings, with Notes on some of the Edible Fungi by which they are
                            caused. By Prof. Buckman, F.G.S.

  After detailing at some length the experiments of Mr. Way on the composition of

fungi forming the fairy rings, Prof. Buckman gave an account of the various species
which formed fairy rings in the neighbourhood of Cirencester. He stated that at dif-
ferent seasons of the year no less than three species of Agaricus appeared on the same
ring. The species of Grasses also that composed the ring were found by the author to
be constantly the same in the inner and outer parts of the circle in the rings which he
examined. The Cirencester species of fungi in the rings were edible, and much sought
after by the students of the college, being the Agaricus prunulus.

    On a remarkable Monstrosity of a Vinca. By Prof. E. Forbes, F.R.S.

    In this monstrous flower the calyx and petals were normal ; the stamens converted
into petals, with traces of anthers on the margin of their attenuated bases; within them
were six carpels ai-ranged in two whorls ; the outer three had no styles and exhibited
no sutures on their inner faces; the three inner ones were larger; two were sutured
along their inner faces, two bore styles on their tips, the summits of the three styles
had luiited by their basal rings ; below the stigma, which was common to all three,
two of the styles had been broken away in consequence of the growth of a prolongation
of the axis from among the centre of the ovaries ; this elongation bore upon its summit
a rudimentary flower, consisting of five outer lanceolate segments equivalent to sepals,
five linear bodies alternating with the former equivalent to petals ; a five-lobed fleshy
ring, which might be regarded as a circle of stamens, but which showed no traces of
anthers ; the four bodies equivalent to carpels, two of them larger than the other two,
and one of the two bearing a style terminating in a stigma. The monstrosity did not end
liere ; in the midst of these ovaries, arose another but very short prolongation of the axis
bearing a cup-like disc, bordered by five leaf-like lobes, and within the margin of the
cup was a circle of minute ovule-like bodies ; all the parts of the prolonged axis were
green. The observer was inclined to regard this singular monstrosity as an instance
of true folial and true axile placentation co-existing in the same flower.

   The monster was found among some flowers brought to Covent-garden this spring.

       On the Varieties of the Wild Carrot. By Prof. E. Forbes, F.R.S.

   Two species of Daitcits, D. carota and D. mari/imus, are enmnei-ated as indigenous

in our British Floras, and a third has been indicated with a doubt and referred to the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  'jl

D. g'mgidium. The object of this communication was to show that the characters by
which these supposed species were distinguished are by no means constant, but on tlie
contrary extremely variable ; that iheDaucus carola passes gradually into the Daiicus
maritimus as it approaches the neighbourhood of the sea, and that the plant which
has been referred to Daucus gingidium is also a sea-side variety of Carota. There is
liowever an unnoticed form, probably of an extreme variation of the supposed r/iw-
gidium, occurring on the coast of Dorsetshire, which is remarkable for having dusky
yellow petals with ciliated margins, whereas all other forms of our carrots have white
petals with entire margins. To this variety it is proposed to apply the name clliatus.
This plant, which at first sight has much the aspect of a veritable species, is probably
the one mentioned by Decandolle as occurring near Dieppe, and referred by that
author to Daucus hispidus of Desfontaines. It does not appear probable however
that the plant so called by Algerine botanists is identical with that from the shores of
the Atlantic, nor is there any sufficient evidence that either Z). gingidium, D. hispanicus,
or D. littoralis of Mediterranean floi-as have been found (as has been asserted) north
of the Bay of Biscay. Living specimens of the plants described were exhibited to

the Section.

             On some Abnormal Forms of the Fruit of Brassica oleracea.
                         By Edwin Lankestee, M.D., F.R.S.

   The specimens in which the monstrosities were observed were gathered from under
the Culver Cliff in the Isle of Wight. In many of the specimens the fruit exhibited
the external form of the silicle rather than the silique. The beak and the stigma,
which normally are fully developed, were reduced to a mere rounded point, and in
many cases the distance from the stigma to the pedicel was not more than the sixth
of an inch. On opening these fruits no vestige of a septum could be found, and the
partly developed ovules adhered on each side to a continuous mass of vascular tissue
uniting the two carpels. Each carpel was broader than it was long, and was com-
posed of a little leaf-like bag, which was puckered and contracted at its union with its
fellow on the opposite side. Reticulated veins were easily observed on each of
the metamorphosed carpels. From the fruits in this state up to those normally de-
veloped, were a series of transitionary forms presenting almost every possible variety
of form. The author suggested that these changes in the fruit of a cruciferous plant
suggested the possibility that the septum, the beak, and stigma in the Cruciferae were
not, as had been suggested by previous writers, foliar or carpellary structures, but that

tbey had a true axile origin.

             On the Vegetable Productions of Algiers. By G. Munby.

   In this paper the author gave a sketch of the various plants which give a charactev

to the vegetation of Algiers. He mentioned those which are used as the food of man.

Amongst these he entered into a discussion of the species of plants which had been
supposed to yield the lotus of the ancients. He also described the Lichen esczdentus,
a plant of rapid growth belonging probably to the order of Fungi, and which covers
some of the desert wastes of Algeria. It has a sweet taste, is eaten by the Arabs, and
is quite capable of sustaining animal life. Mr. Munby suggested that the manna re-

corded in Scripture might be a pi-oduction of this kind.

On the Nervous System and certain other Points in the Anatomy of the Bryozoa.
                          By Prof. Allman, M.D., M.R.I.A.

   The first notice of a nervous system in the Bryozoa is due to M. Dumortier, who
mentions the existence of a transparent body at the base of each of the tentaculiferous
lobes in his genus Lophopus, established for the Polype a Panache of Trembley, these
bodies being considered by Dumortier as true nervous ganglions.

   In referring to the nervous system the appearance just mentioned. Dr. Allman was
of opinion that this naturalist has fallen into an error ; but it is nevertheless quite cer-
tain that Dumortier had observed the true nervous centre in a yellowish body which
exists on the rectal aspect of the oesophagus just behind the mouth, and which he has

referred doubtfully to the system of the nerves.
--72 REPORT 1849.

   Without any knowledge of Duniortier's discovery, Professor AUnian had demon-
strated some years ago the existence of this organ in Crhtatella, and had also referred
it to the nervous system, describing it as the great oesophageal ganglion of the Bryo-

zoon.

   Professor Allman was now enabled to lay before the meeting some additional facts
connected with this subject, as he had recently discovered filaments proceeding from
the ganglion, so that the distribution of the nerves could now no longer be considered
as a matter of doubt. The author described the great oesophageal gfmglion in Plunia-

tella repens as sending ofFa large filament to each of the tentaculiferous lobes, a smaller
one passing off at each side to embrace the oesophagus, while a very short one ap-
peared to proceed from the ganglion and dive into the substance of the oesophagus,
where it could no longer be traced, and another set of filaments was observed to pass
forwards and distribute themselves to the organs about the mouth.

   Among other points in the anatomy of the Brijozoa, Professor Allman mentioned

his detection of strife in the muscles, and the tendency of the muscular fibre to break

itself into discs. The tube of the tentaculae was shown to be lined by a distinct mem-

brane; the invaginated part of the internal tunic was proved to be composed of two
portions distinct in structure, separated from one another by a sphincter, and a com-
plete system of muscles was demonstrated in connexion with the oral valve.

   From the facts now laid before the meeting, Professor Allman maintained the ne-
cessity of removing altogether the B/i/ozoa from the position among the radiate
classes in which they had been placed by authors, and raising them at once to the
sub-kingdom of the MoUusca.

     On a Neic Freshwater Bryozoon. By Prof. Allman, M.D., M.R.I. A.

   The subject of this communication was discovered in the Commercial Docks on the
'I'hamcs, during a late examination of that locality in company with Mr. Bowerbank.
It possesses many points of resemblance with Plttmatella repens, but differs essen-
tially from this animal in the circumstance of each cell being separated from its
neighbour by a distinct septum, as in Paludicella.

           On the Reproductive System of Cordylophora lacustris, Allm.
                             By Prof. Allman, M.D.. M.R.I.A.

    Certain branches of Cordylophora lacustris, instead of terminating in polypes, bear
upon their extremities an oval vesicle, into which the contained matter of the stem is
continued. These vesicles arefilled with spherical bodies, and must be viewed as the
tnie ovarian receptacles of the zoophyte.

  On Lophopus crystallina, Dumortier. By Prof. Allman, M.D., M.R.I.A.

     In this communication the author noticed the occurrence of Lophopus crystal/itia in
 the pond of the Dublin Zoological Gardens. This elegant zoophyte is the Polype a
 Panache of Trembley, and had been first characterized as a genus by Dumortier. It
 has since been confounded with other genera, and Dr. Johnston, in his excellent
 · History of L'ritish Zoophytes,' adduces Trembley 's Polype a Panache as a synonyme

 of Alcyunella stagnorvm. An examination however of the present zoophyte must

 convince us of its true generic distinctness, and of the correctness of the views main-
tained by M. Dumortier, and subsequently by M. Van Beneden, who has figured and
 described it in his memoir ' Sur les Polypes d'eau douce de Belgium.'

   Mr. R. Ball exhibited a new dredge which he had recently constructed for natural
history purposes, being an improvement on the instrument called Ball's dredge.

Mr. R. Ball exhibited a drawing, and described the structure of a specimen of

Bryarea scolopiendra found in Dublin Bay by Dr. (/orrigan.  ^

covered by the glutinous substance, which when dried forms the cement and tubing
of the case. With its mouth the creature places the sand upon its back and then
rolls itself from side to side, and again puts forth its tentacula in search of fresh ma-
terial. The whole internal cavity of the worm in which the viscera exist is filled by
a fluid, by which the animal has the power of moving, the loss of which entails de-
struction of all motive power ; to preclude which circumstance, upon receiving any
external wound, the animal will divide itself by contraction of the annular muscles
anterior to the wound, which operation it will also perform in order to escape from
the grasp of an enemy.

   From the head of the animal to about the lower extremity of the stomach is a mass
of white granular material, which the author presumes to be the ovaria, on either
side of which are ducts leading into several pear-shaped sacs. Early in February

the author noticed active motion of the fluid within passing in one direction, excited
by a powerful set of cilia; shortly after some particles of the fluid existing within these
sacs seemed to unite together, which became the earliest formation of a new creature;
this little animal exists by the introduction within its own system of the parent fluid
by which it is surrounded; this is done through a circular umbilical pulsating heart
which opens by a slit, situated about the centre of the young creature. Shortly after,

what the author has termed umbilical circulation ceases, and the young worm moves
within the uterine sac ; as the creature progresses the intestinal canal also becomes
more perfect, and shortly after it leaves the sac and enters into a passage or oviduct,
one of which on either side traverses the walls of the parent and opens into the rectum
beyond the point where the intestinal tube is incorporated with the outer walls of the

--worm, and there voided.
    Sabella alveolata {Hermella, Savigny). After speaking of the habits of this an-
nelide and the circulatory system, the author says, in relation to the organs of pro-
gression, besides all these there are other setae situated upon the back ; these perform
a most important office in the osconomy of these creatures, which is to eject from the

cell the fffical matter ; that this may be accomplished the more easily, the intestinal
canal is extended beyond the creature, making a sort of tail about one-fourth of the
whole length of the animal, which is turned forward upon the dorsal surface; the ex-
pelled material is taken up by these delicate setae and passed forwards from one to
the next until it reaches the entrance to the abode, where, when under water, it is

ejected with considerable force, but at other times it is deposited at the entrance and
washed away by the first passing wave.

         Notes on the Boring of Marine Animals. By C. Spence Bate.

   The latest theory which, possessing novelty, has been advanced, is that of Mr.
Hancock (Brit. Association, Swansea, 1848, and Annals of Nat. Hist. October 1848).
Prof. Forbes at the same meeting stated, that " he endeavoured to find the crystalline
spiculae (with which the author affirms the foot to be armed for boring), but without
success, either by the aid of the microscope or by chemical tests."

   Throughout his paper Mr. Bate accepted the presence of these crystalline bodies as
a thing proved, and endeavours to show that the holes dwelt in by marine animals
could not owe their existence to any mechanical force by a creature so armed and
formed, even supposing the rock sufiiciently soft to be mechanically fretted away.

   The author of this paper noticed a hole so deviating from the cylindrical in figure,
that a prominent portion of the matrix projects so as to occupy a position between
the anterior edge of the two valves. This fact he argues is in opposition to either of
the three theories which naturalists have most favoured.

   First. It is opposed to the theory of mechanical attrition by an armed foot, since
the greatest protuberance exists in juxtaposition with the aperture in the mantle
through which the foot must extend itself, and is thus shown to be ineflicient for the

purpose.

   Secondly. To that advanced by Mr. Osier, that part which is nearest the foot and
consequently the most liable to be acted upon, is the least so.

   Thirdly. To that which presumes that the animal wears the rock by the means of
its own shell, using it upon the principle of an auger ; since the presence of such an
irregularity precludes the possibility of either valve from moving ventrally forwards,
and consequently from a rotatory motion.
--74 REPORT 1849.

Similar evidence may repeatedly be seen where Pliolas parva bores into chalk: the

depression between the posterior margin of the valves occupied by the hinge cor-

responds with a ridge in the matrix, a circumstance which it was impossible could

have occurred if the animal had rotated.

Opposing tluis all mechanical action, the author resumed the idea of a solvent, but

was of opinion that the solvent should be looked for in tlie element in which the ani-

mals exist, and not in the resources of the animal itself. lie presumed that it would be

found  in  the  presence  of  tlie/ree                                     carbonic  acid  held  in  solution  by sea-water                                                        the oeco-
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

nomy of the boring animals being simple and uniform tln-oughout creation, the solvent

only being directed by them according to their habits, through the process of re-

spiration and ciliary currents.

He next proceeded to show the action of sea-water upon limestone coasts, attributing

tlieir peculiar appearance to the presence of carbonic acid in the sea-water ; and upon

rolled limestone pebbles, particularly those which had been previously bored by small

annelides, which he presumed gave a passage for sea-water to the centre of the stone,

and tended to wear them rapidly and irregularly, evidence of which may be frequently

seen in those which have been perforated by sponges, becoming half-buried in sand,

where the exposed side is corroded, whilst the protected part remains luiinjured.

The author's opinion was, that the boring of Saxicava was to be attributed to the

same means, the animal only causing the solvent to act more uniformly. He

believed that the perforations of Saxicava were the work of time, and his experience

went to show tliat the animal could not bore deeper into the rock after it had lost the

power of locomotion, which was very early in its existence ; after which, excavation

only continued to enlarge the cavity so as to adapt it to the increasing bulk of the

animal, as well as the entrance to the excavation, which in the young barely exceeds

the sixteenth of an inch, while in that of the adult it often equals the diameter of the

animal, and always bore a corresponding ratio to the thickness of the shell; thick-

ness of shell denoting age, and with years the diameter of the bore increases.

With regard to the Pholas tribe, he presumed that they penetrate soft clays through

a modification of the same power ; that is, in all the Lithophagi the calcareous rock

is dissolved by the carbonic acid in the cui-rents induced by the animal, but in that

of the borers into clay, the wearing power is the mechanical action of those currents,

which are greatly increased by the muscular power of the animal ; the carbonic acid
still taking up any calcareous matter which may be present, as in the case where they

are foxmd to bore in soft triassic sandstone. In this opinion he considered that he was

supported by the observations of Mr. Oslei-, who in explaining how (what he presumes
to be) the rasped waste is expelled during the process of excavation, says, " When the

projected syphon is distended with water, the Pholas closes the orifices of the tubes

and retracts them  suddenly                                           the  water which  they contain  is thus ejected forcibly from
                                                                   ;

the opening of the mantle, and the jet is prolonged by the gradual closing of the

valves to expel the water contained within the shell : the chamber occupied by the

animal is thus completely cleansed.'' That the Pholas expels material by the force of

currents, is sliown in this passage, but it is only hypothetical that it had been pre-

viously rasped off by the shell. The foregoing evidence shows that Pholas cannot

rotate within its cavity ; consequently the waste, seen to be expelled by Mr. Osier,

could not have been first rasped off; therefore it is not unfair to presume that it was

worn off by the mechanical force of the current excited by the animal. It is only by

presuming such to be the case that we can account how Pliolas Candida can be found

to bore into clay and peat on the coast of Wales, pure sand at Exmouth, and lias at

Lyme Regis.

The remarkable manner in which shells and rolled pebbles are perforated by Cliona,

will easily, the author presumed, be explained by the same theory. He argued that

a sporulo of Cliona (which is a true sponge in all its conditions) first obtains a footing

in some crevice, where itdevelopes itself so as to penetrate the whole fabric, destroying

the shell or pebble by simply fulfilling the condition of its existence, \vhich is by

poimng its currents in a given direction, until a passage be broken through by the

corroding power of the carbonic acid in those currents. He mentioned a case which fell

under his observation, in which a Saxicava was not only checked but turned aside and

deformed by coming into contact with Cliona. Neither, from their own power, were

ciipable of effecting a passage through the other. The sponge from its nature could not

be acted upon by the solvent, which it is presumed the nioUusk uses; neither could
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  75

Cliona (although using the same solvent) destroy the shell of the Saxicava, as both
were capable of wearing the oyster-shell, because the Saxicava was protected by an

--epidermis, a membrane which he presumed was given to moilusca in general for the

specific purpose of defending the shell from the corroding action of the carbonic acid

contained in the water in which they exist.
   The author also mentioned an instance of two specimens of Saxicava found by him

boring in the valve of an oyster, tlie one at right angles with the other, the one which

met tlie other full on the side being flattened by the contact ; this circumstance, to-
gether with the wound caused being still in apposition, clearly proves that neither
has advanced or moved during a considerable portion of their existence ; moreover a
portion of the shell into which they have bored opposite to the opening of the mantle,

as stated before, remains prominent, so as to stand between the anterior edges of the
two valves, proving beyond a doubt the impossibility of the animal's capability of ro-

tating upon its own axis.
   Of the boring of Patella, the author argued that its form will preclude all idea of

its boring by the action of its shell.
   His observations upon the boring of the Buccinum into the shells of other moi-

lusca attributed their power of perforation to the same source, that is to a current
charged with carbonic acid passing through the buccal apparatus of that tribe, the

lingual riband having no part in the operation ; the portion of the incomplete per-
foration which would most correspond with this siliceous apparatus was left the most
prominent part. The animal, he stated, takes about two days to pei-forate the shell of

the common mussel, and performs the work without the least action on the part of
the shell, as must be the case whenever a circular hole is bored by mechanical action.

   The same theory he presumed will hold in the absorption of the columella in the
family of the Purpuriferse ; that which follows the long-continued residence of the
Pagurus in the shell of Trachelipods : as also the groove sunk by Spiroglyphus, which
annelide affords a good example to illustrate the theory ; for it not only sinks a
groove in the shell on which it has erected its own, but should its contortions bring
it " into contact with any portion of its own shell, it absorbs it equally with any

other."

   Upon the boring of Teredo lie had nothing new to offer, never having had an op-
portunity of examining any but dead animals in old wood ; he believed that their
anatomy being so different from the moilusca which bore into clay and stone, would
account for a different action on the part of the creature, except in Xylophaga, which

being free, bored probably, as it is presumed, the Pholas bores ; in this idea the author
is, he argued, supported by the fact that this animal rarely bores more than an inch
deep, and that only into saturated wood, invariably shunning the harder kinds.

   The Prince of Canino made a few remarks on the characters which distinguish the
little Blue Magpie of Spain {Pica Coolcii) from that of Siberia {Pica cyanea, Pallas).
He also stated that the new Caprinuilgus of Hungary belonged to the genus Cordylis.

       On the Genera of British Patellacea. By Prof. E. Forbes, F.R.S.

   The great similarity existing between patelliform shells, the animals of which are
so different that they cannot be included in the same genus, has long been known
to naturalists, and is one of those apparent anomalies which have been laid stress
upon as sources of uncertainty in palajontological inductions: without however vei-y
good reason, for the remains of the mollusks in question are rarely found in the fossil
state, and the great majority of fossils of that class of animals are such as can be con-
fidently depended on. In the course of the researches undertaken by the author and
Mr. Hanley for their joint work on the " History of British Moilusca," now in progress
of publication, a fresh inquiry was required to be made into the propriety with which
the British Patellacea had been assigned to known genera. It resulted that among
our species we had two forms, for which it becomes necessary to construct new ge-
neric types, viz. the so-called Lottia julva and Lottia ancyloides. Neither of these
belong to Acmaa, with which Lottia is synonymous, but both differ essentially in cha-
racters of head, mantle, dentition, and in the latter case, position of body with respect
to shell. As no established genus can receive them, for the former a new genus.
--76 REPORT 1849.

Pilidium, is proposed, to which Patella ctsca of the ' Zoologia Danica* also belongs;

and for the latter a new genus, PropUidium. Pilidium is allied to Acmaa on the

one hand, and to PropUidium on the other, having the position in the shell of the
former genus, and the tongue of the latter. PropUidium links Acmcea and its allies
with Puncturella and Emarginula, like which it has the apex of the shell turned away
from the head of the animal, but has a ver}' different dentition.

   The British Patellacea may be arranged as follows :

1st Group. PATELLiDiE. Cyclobrauchiate auimals ; apex of the shell anteal.
    1. Patella. K. Branchial laminae extending in front of head ; branchial impression

in shell unsymmetrical.

                                                             1. Patella vulgata.

                 2. Patella athletica.

B. (Patina). Branchial laminae deficient in front of head; branchial impression

subsymmetrical.

                 3. Patella pellucida.

2nd Group. Acm^ead^. Branchiae cervical ; apex of shell variable ; rachis of tongue
        of comparatively single elements.

   1. Acmaa. Transverse element of tongue double ; tentacula oculiferous; apex of

shell anteal.

                 1. Acmaea testudinalis.
                 2. Acmaea virginea.

2. Pilidium. Transverse element of shell anteal.
                                               1. Pilidium fulvum.

3. PropUidium. Transverse element of tongue single; tentacula eyeless ; apex of

shell posteal.

                 1. Propilidium ancyloide.

   Then follow Emarginula (two species) ; Puncturella (one species) ; and Fissurella
(one species) ; all members of a third group, linking the two former with Haliotis and
Trochus. Capulus and Calyptrcsa are members of another family.

On Beroe Cucumis, and the Genera or Species of Ciliograda which have been
                    founded upon it. By Prof. E. Forbes, F.R.S.

   At the Birmingham Meeting of 1839, the author, in conjunction with Professor
Goodsir, communicated an account of the British Ciliograde Medusae. They then
announced the existence in our seas of the true Beroe Cucumis of Otho Fabricius,

which they had taken on the coasts of Zetland.
   Since that time Prof. E. Forbes has availed himself of many opportunities for the

observation of these animals, and has been successful in discovering some new features
in their oeconomy. He has taken the Beroe Cucumis in many parts of the coasts of
England and Scotland, from the Zetland Isles to the Isle of Wight, and has not been
able to find any sufficient differences among the individuals to warrant the recognition
of more than one species. They vary greatly in size and colour; in the Hebrides
they are not unfrequently taken 3 inches in length, but are usually very much
smaller on the English shores. He has found that apparently at certain seasons nu-
merous individuals of this Beroe produce in the line of their ciliary ribs, and from
the belts of motor tissue at the base of the cilia, ovate egg-like pedunculated bodies
of a bright orange colour. These can also be produced from the finer ciliary circles
of the mouth and of the dorsal extremity. When the animal is in this state, any

irritation near the ciliary ribs causes it to contract the neighbouring portion of the

body over them, so as to protect them, sheathing the eggs as it were in deep mem-
branous canals. Particular attention is directed to these gemmules or egg-like bodies,
which may prove to be intermediate states of the Beroe. When the animal is in egg
it is extremely irritable, and when irritated gives out the most brilliant vivid green

phosphorescent light, always from the vessels beneath the ciUary ribs and from no

other part.

    The badness of the majority of delineations of this animal and a misconception of
its true structure, have caused numerous false species and several genera to be con-
structed out of one. Thus in the ' Histoire des Acalephes,' by Lesson, all the fol-
 lowing appear to be founded on Beroe Cucumis : in the genus Beroe, Beroe Forskahlii,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  77

Milne-Edwards, a name proposed for the Medusa Bero'e of Forskall, which is the
Mediterranean form of the species, and to which Professor Mihie-Edwards, in an
admirable memoir, very rightly assigned the Bero'e ovatus of Lamouroux, the Bero'e

elongatus of Risso, the Bero'e rufescens of Eschscholtz, the Idi/a ForskaUi, Bero'e albens,

Bero'e Chiajii of Lesson himself. The author suggested its probable identity with the
Bero'e ovatus of Brown, the Bero'e Cucumis of Otho Fabricius and Sars, the Bero'e
Capensis and Bero'e punctata of Chamisso, and the Bero'e macrostomus of Peron and
Lesueur. In spite of the elucidation of the subject by Milne-Edwards, several of the
so-called species, as Bero'e albens, B. punctata, ovatus and Capensis, were retained by
Lesson and distributed even under different genera. Bero'e fallax, founded on a figure
by Scoresby, is probably the same species. In thegenus/c?»/aofTremonville, retained
on account of the animal having its "body open at the two poles" (a misconception
founded on some of the curious contractile changes which these animals assume), we
find Idya Peronii, which is Bero'e macrostomus of Peron, Idya Capensis, Idya Cucumis,
the names annexed to Fabricius's species, Idya elongatus, a six-ribbed monstrosity,
mistaken for a species by Risso, Idya borealis, so far as the reference to Scoresby
goes, and Idya ovata (^Bero'e ovatus of Brown), all almost without a question identical.
Then follows the genus Medea of Eschscholtz (this to Lesson is a Bero'e with in-
terrupted bands of cilia), in which he places Medea fulgens, the species discovered by
Macartney, and Medea dubia, founded on the fountain-fish of the old voyager Mertens,
Doth undoubtedly Bero'e Cucumis; whilst Medea arctica, founded on one of Scoresby's
figures, was probably the same. The genus Cydalisia of Lesson himself follows,
instituted on account of the presence of " two little ciliated openings" at the pole op-
posite the mouth. Every person who has examined a Bero'e knows that the two
little rays of cirrhi which Lesson means by this phrase, are present in every individual.
The Cydalisia punctata is certainly Bero'e Cucumis, and the C. mitraformis probably
that species. Then comes the genus Pandora of Eschscholtz, which is defined on
account of the ciliary bands being lodged in furrows bordered by membranous folds
evidently the condition of Bero'e described in this communication. The Janira hex-
agona, founded on a figure of Slabber, was probably also the species before us.

   Thus there would appear to be about fifteen species distributed under four if not six
genera, constructed out of this one animal. Such proceedings tend to confuse zoolo-
gical science, and are the more inexcusable since the full and accurate dissertation of
Milne-Edwards on Bero'e ForskaUi was at hand to guide, and is even quoted in Lesson's

work.

   Prof. E. Forbes laid upon the table several papers containing observations made by
the Dredging Committee. He hoped that the Committee would soon be able to present

to the Section some general facts as the result of the investigations which had now
been going on for so many years.

If Vitality he a Force having Correlations with the Forces, Chemical Affinities,
   Motion, Heat, Light, Electricity, Magnetism, Gravity, so ally shown by

   Professor Grove to be modifications of one and the same Force ? By R.
   Fowler, M.D., F.R.S.

   The author, after having shown that each of these modified forces can be excited by
any other, or in its turn be the exciter of all the rest, and consequently the antecedent
or consequent indifferently of each of the others, proceeded to show that this is equally
true of vitality, and that the coils in which these forces are latent, and by whose mo-
difications in an excited state they are rendered apparent to our senses, constitute one
of the differences between them. For instance, the change of temperature to which
the infant is necessarily exposed at its birth, the heat going rapidly out of it, excites
the motion necessary for inspiration. This gives the oxj'gen of the air access to the
carbon of the blood by endosmosis ; this again to animal heat. From that electricity
may be obtained ; and from electricity, by an appropriate coil, magnetism. Gravity
the infant acquires by its growth, and can counteract by its muscular contractility.
It may be said that an infant affords no evidence of the production of the forces, light,
electricity and magnetism, but the experiments of Dr. Faraday have demonstrated
that all these may be produced by the vitality of the Gymnotus, and rendered palpable

--with nil other forces. But tliere still remains a difference vitality is the artist of its

own cutis. No other force can make an organ of either an animal or a plant (the
coil hy means of which their vitality is evinced). Neither a Volta nor an Qirsted

could have invented an eye or an ear, or even a graft by which the sap of a fruit-tree
is so modified as to differ from that of the parent stock.

   The author added instances of the light of fire-flies, glow-worms, and some marine
animals, as instances of production of light, apparent to the vision of others by vitality.
And any person may satisfy himself of the ease with wliich a flash of light, the pi'o-
ducts of his own vitality, may be rendered perceptible to himself, by putting a plate
of zinc between the gums and the cheek in one side of the mouth and the broad
handle of a silver spoon in the other, and then (in the dark) he will see a flash of
light at every instant of contact and separation of the zinc and silver.

   Tliat mind and vitality recijirocally excite and depress each other must be obvious
to all who are attentive to their daily feelings; and all conversant with surgical prac-
tice must be aware of the difference in healing of wounds in a healthy or exhausted

subject.

        On Lucernaria inauriculata. By Professor Owen, M.D., F.R.S.

   Professor Owen communicated a description of the external characters and anatomy
oi & Lucernaria which he had found near low-water mark on the flat rocks to the east
of Dover, August 1819, attached to the Ulva latissima : it differed from the Lucernaria

cpiadricornis, or L.fascicularis, in h.aving the eight tentaculiferous lobes equidistant
from each other, and it differed from the Lucernaria auricula in the absence of any ear-

like appendage at the middle of the border of the connecting webs between those
lobes. It differed from the Lucernaria canipanulata in the absence of the " two series
of foliaceous processes arranged on each side of a white line*," extending from the
sides of the mouth along the middle of each connecting web ; and by the presence of
a convoluted coloured filamentary body extending from the circumference of the
mouth to the tentaculiferous extremity of each of the eight lobes. It also differed
from the L. cyalhiformis in the tentacles being supported, in clusters, at the extremity
of lobes produced beyond the margin of the infundibular disc.

   The specimens varied from an inch to half an inch in length. One variety had ten
lobes. The stem of the polype, which is ordinarily slender and as long as the ex-
panded body, terminates in an adhesive disc or base, in the centre of which is
a small triradiate pore or pit, with a thickened border or sphincter. There is no car-
tilaginous lamina in this disc. Four canals commence from the central pore or pit,
and ascend the stem projecting into the central digestive cavity, hut separated from
the cavity by its lining membrane, which is i-eflectcd upon the four canals; forming
as many longitudinal folds projecting into the digestive cavity.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  7^

   The four canals bifurcate, and are continued along each of the eight lobes to tlieir
extremities, where they subdivide, and are continued along each of the thirty or thirty-
two tentacles forming the terminal cluster of the lobe. Professor Owen described a
small triradiate pore at the round expanded end of each tentacle, and assigned rea-
sons for regarding it as the orifice of the canal traversing the tentacle. He entered
into a disquisition as to the function of this system of ramified canals, which is equally
distinct from the digestive and generative systems, and contains a clear colourless
liquid, with minute organic particles or granules; and expressed his opinion that the
system of ramified canals was homologous with the partially-divided abdominal or
aquiferous cavity from which the canals of the tentacula are continued in the Actinice.

   The generative organs were arranged in eight filamentary masses, disposed in
short wavy folds along the inner surface of each of the eight lobes. Each mass con-
sists of a central lobulated body containing the fusiform capsules of the spermatozoa,
similar to, but smaller than those of the ActinicR, and this body is surrounded by the
looser stroma containing the ova. The large mature and impregnated ova dehisce
from the inner surface, or that next the cavity of the infundibular web of the polype.

   Professor Owen having travelled from Dover to the meeting at Birmingham, had

not had the opportimity of comparing his observations with those of any other au-
thor, except such as were given in Dr. Johnstone's excellent work on ' British

--Zoophytes,' the best manual for the sea-side observer. In reply to some remai'ks

respecting the four longitudinal muscles or ligaments, described by Sars and others
as^rising up within the pedicle, he remarked that nothing was easier or plainer than
the demonstration of the areas of four corresponding canals in his Luccrnaria : it re-
quired only a neat transverse section of the stalk or peduncle to see that they were
not solid, but hollow bodies. The pores on the clavate ends of the tentacles were best
seen by viewing them as opake objects with a good reflected light.

    Since making the above communication, the author has compared his species with
all the extant descriptions and figures of Zwce/vwria, and finds so close a resemblance
in that figured in the late French illustrated edition of Cuvier's ' Regne Animal,' as
to lead him to conclude that it is the same species. It is referred in that work, how-
ever, to the Lucernaria auriadata, although differing, like the Dover specimens, in
the absence of the eai'-like appendages to the webs signified by the name. If those
appendages be constant, the specimens described by Prof. Owen, as well as that
figured in the ' R^gne Animal,' are a distinct species, for which the name Lucer-

naria inauriculata is proposed.

    On Improvements in Pathological Drawing. By James Paxton, M.D.

   The intention of this communication is to recommend the style of cartoon painting
as well-adapted to pathological representations. Tlie author has shown that the pic-
torial features of pathological drawings ought not to be deficient in the beauties of
fidelity of expression and execution, but should possess these qualities in common
with works in the fine arts of a more inviting character. Fortius purpose he has in-
troduced a corresponding mode of painting ; namely, illustrations of morbid anatomy
by cartoons, with plate glass to give the transjiarent lustre which belongs to oil paintings,
examples of which were exhibited to the Section. The colours employed were opake
and solid permanent white being the medium for moderating the intensity of each

                                             ;

tint, in lieu of the transparent medium commonly used on white paper. The lighter
and brighter parts of the object are brought out by penciling an opake body of colour
on a darker ground. By this method -a person has a singular facility of copying the
apj^earances displayed by disease. Thus a coloured sketch of Scirrhus Pylorus was

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            .

executed in an hour. To produce as much of the character of disease on white paper
with transparent media, would have occupied several hours. In a highly-finished
drawing oi Bright' s disease of the kidney, it appeared the labour was vastly diminished
by penciling the indications of granular fibrinous deposits upon a deeper colour.

    The advantages of adopting this melhod of pathological drawing were pointed out as
manifold. First. That we obtain a portraiture of practical medical anatomy in a com-
paratively short space of time, and this circumstance is an important consideration, since
all dead animal substances speedily undergo a succession of changes in colour. Second.
Cartoon painting is peculiarly suited to morbid subjects, inasmuch as it displays their
surface, organic development and texture, with greater distinctness and force than

any other style the author is acquainted with. Moreover it is a style which most
readily admits of being rectified wherever it is observed to be defective, as the
drawing is uninjured by laying one colour over another to any extent thought needful.
Third. Placing plate glass before the picture gives both the brilliancy and softness of
varnish on the surface.

   The last suggestion mentioned relative to pathological delineation is, that while the
drawing is in progress, the morbid specimen should be kept under a glass dome or
roof; the latter, of a prismatic form, was preferred, from its not reflecting surrounding
objects. The escape of any infection or unpleasant effluvia is thus prevented. Be-
sides which, this plan preserves the part from the dryness and corrugation which soon
take place from exposure to the atmosphere.

On the Lumiiiosity of the Sea on the Cornish Coasts. By C. W. Pkach.

   The author described the state of the weather at the time of observation, comparing
it with that which occurred soon after, as well as the animals observed on those occa-

-- --sions. He exhibited drawings of many some new to the British coasts, one at least

of which has been found in the Mediterranean. These were abundant in July, but
were destroyed by a heavy gale of wind, since which they have not been noticed

Observations and Experiments on the Noctiluca miliaris, the Animalcular

   Source of the Phosphorescence of the British Seas ; together with a few ge-
  neral remarks on the phcenomena of Vital Phosphorescence. By Dr. J. H.
   Pring.

The author referred to the various theories which have been advanced on the sub-

ject of the phosphorescence of the seas, and to the instances of phosphorescence occur-

ring both amongst land and marine animals. After reciting various observations by

others on the phsenomena of vital phosphorescence, he proceeded to detail his own

experiments at Weston-super-Mare, upon a small vesicular animal, not exceeding the

one-thousandth part of an inch in diameter, which possessed very remarkable lu-

minous properties. This animal the author believed to be the Noctiluca miliaris,

and he regarded it as the most common source of the phosphorescence of the British

seas. It occurred sometimes in such large quantities, and was so luminous, as to give

the sea the appearance of a sheet of fire. Viewed by aid of the microscope, the

animalcule is seen to consist of a spherical portion, and a tentaculum, which appears

to be a motor organ. It does not appear to possess any special luminous apparatus,

but the phosphorescent power is believed by the author to reside in a flocculent mucus

secreted by the little animal. In giving the results of his experiments on the light

emitted, the author found that galvanism produced no perceptible effect, but the

electro-magnetic current sensibly increased the luminosity. Oxygen gas increased

the light, without exerting any marked influence over the din-ation of the life of the

animal. Contrary to what might have been expected, carbonic acid gas was likewise

found to increase the light to a veiy remarkable degree, far exceeding in this respect

the eflTects  of oxygen                                           but the animal was killed by it when immersed in it only for
                                                               ;

a comparatively short space of time. Sulphuretted hydrogen speedily deprived the

animal of life, and consequently destroyed the light ; nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and

hydrogen produced little or no effect on the luminosity ; strong mineral acids in-
creased for a moment but speedily afterwards destroyed the light ; ather instantly

destroyed the life of the animal ; chloroform increased the light and then destroyed the
animal. The author then instituted a comparison between his own experiments and

those of Prof. Matteucci on the glowworm ; and after examining the various theories
put forward to account for the luminosity of animals, concluded that the phsenomena

could not at present be referred to any more general fact with which we are ac-

quainted.

Notice of two additional bones of the Long-legged Dodo or Solitaire, brought
             from Mauritius. By H. E. Strickland, M.A., F.G.S.

   These bones have been recently sent to England by the officers of the Royal Society
of Arts and Sciences of Mauritius. They consist of two tarso-metatarsal bones, of
which one is incrusted with stalagmite, and seems to belong to the same individual as
those figured in the ' Dodo and its Kindred,' plates xiii. xiv., which are now in the Paris
Museum. The other specimen is far more perfect than any examples of this bone
before known, but though apparently belonging to an adult individual, it is of small
dimensions, being only 5 inches 8 lines in length. The only defective portion is the
posterior surface of the ecto-calcaneal process, which is slightly abraded. The form
of the bone precisely agrees with that of the Solitaire, and though of small size, it is
doubtless identical in species with that bird. It exhibits in great perfection all those
peculiar characters which prove both the Dodo and the Solitaire to have been closely
allied to the family of Pigeons; especially the position of the calcaneal canal, which
in those birds passes externally to the posterior ridge, whereas in the gallinaceous
birds it passes on the inside of that ridge.

   The author took this opportunity to allude to a paper on the Dodo, in the Boston
Journal of Natural History, in which Dr. Cabot, though wholly unacquainted with
the researches of Mr. Strickland and Dr. Melville, arrives independently at precisely
the same conclusion, viz. that " the Dodo was a gigantic pigeon."

              On the Growth of Silk in England. By Mrs. Whitby.

myI had proposed offering to the British Association a short account of  progress

in the art of cultivating silk in England, but I left Newlands before all the produce

1849.                                                             "6

of this year could be wound off' from the cocoon, and it will not therefore be in my

mypower to make  report as full or as statistical as I could desire.  I am however

tuiwilling that this meeting should pass without endeavouring in some way to satisfy

the expectations of those who have been sufficiently liberal to pay regard to my con-
victions, that the cultivation of silk may with little trouble or expense be made gene-

ral, and in the end become a pi-ofitable speculation.

   From the period when I bad the honour to place before you an account of my

  early trials, I have paid attention to the cultivation of the mulberry, especially of that
 species which I introduced in 1846, viz. the Morus multicanlis of the Philippine

< Islands. I have three other kinds of white mulberry, which all grow well at New-

lands, but as none are so easily propagated as the Multicauli, or bear so great a weight

myof leaf, I have increased  plantation with them chieflj'.

I  mysaid in  letter  to   the Royal Agricultural Society in 1844, that it was  as easy

to do so as to propagate the willow. I now say that it is much easier, and the pro-

duce is more abundant. The produce of the leaf this year has been immense, and

even now, after having plucked them closely to feed my silkworms, they are strong

and vigorous, and present a luxuriance of growth scarcely to be credited unseen.

I find the cuttings, which are rooted in the open ground, produce stronger and

healthier plants than those struck under glass.

   One of my earliest pupils has a productive nursery at Godalming of the Morus

alba; many others in different parts of England are planting; and if gentlemen in

England and Ireland, who have a few acres or roods of land to spare, would plant

mulberries for posterity as they do their oaks, we should in a few years be independent

of other countries for our supply of raw silk.

   With regard to the rearing of the silkworm : as their habits become more practi-
cally known to me, I find less difficulty in bringing them to perfection ; and am con-

firmed in my belief, that with due attention to their peculiarities they may be reared

in England as well as in any other country, and with as little loss by death. Equable

warmth throughout the period of their existence (which may be shortened or prolonged

at pleasure), cleanliness, classification and ventilation, with the adaptation of the food

(as to its maturity) to the different ages of the insect, will ensure success.

   I have been this season very successful in rearing the worms I was able to hatch
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

they had no disease of any kind ; they made their cocoon in thirty days ; and the silk

I have been able to wind off is as strong and bright and beautiful as that which, in

1844 and 1845, was pronounced superior to the best Italian raw silk.

There are many persons in England, and a few in Ireland, who have begim the

experiment on a small scale. It requires time to mature and perfect any undertaking;

but if I live long enough, and the growth of the mulberry becomes generally encou-

raged, I have no doubt my ardent wish to see the cultivation of silk established in

England will be realized.

On S077ie remarkable Primitive Monuments existing at or near Carnac

   (Britanny) ; a?id on the Discrimination of Races by their local and Jixed

  Monuments. By Dr. Blair.

Dr. Blair described a visit made in 1834, with Mr. Francis Ronalds, to the bourg

--of Carnac, in the department of the Morbihan,--the territory of the ancient Veneti,
    on the south coast of Britanny, for the sake of examining certain very remarkable
monuments of the kind usually held for druidical, but of peculiar character and

unusual dimensions, and hitherto but slightly known in this country. He observed
upon the surprising richness in these remains of the small district, hardly six miles

east and west from Carnac, which they explored. Their minute description of up-

                                         --i

wards of seventy notable objects had been printed, and accurate drawings of the

-- Ausual classes, pillars, dolmens or cromlechs, tumuli, circles, &c. stone of sacrifice
was mentioned, hollowed for receiving the back and shoulders of the resupine human

victim ; an obelisk, now fallen and broken, measuring sixty-four feet in length, and

computed to weigh upwards of 300 tons ; and the Mont St. Michel, a large tumulus

surmounting a natural hill, having on it a chapel dedicated to St. Michael, whence its

pristine design and use as a temple were inferred. The chief objects of interest,

however, were five instances of an arrangement hitherto not elsewhere found.

Nine, eleven, thirteen parallel rows or lines of pitched stones, varying from a huge

to an almost diminutive size, form so many parallelitha, traversing and featuring

the country. The lengths, too, are various. One springing near the bourg of

Erdeven, extends a mile and three furlongs. Adjoining the heads of the parallelitha,

are inclosures, viewed as temples, to which these long avenues led. Three of sets of

lines lie consecutively and suggest the impression that they were continuous. The

remaining two lie apart from them, and from each other. If, as the Rev. John

--Bathurst Deane, the precursor, and, by his excellent chart of the ground, (in the
--twenty-fifth volume of the ' Archfeologia,') the main guide of these travellers, has

reasoned, the intervening spaces were once occupied by similar series, connecting the

five into one enormous Dracontium or temple of serpent-worship, imitating the

windings of the deified reptile, the whole monument must have been the most stu-

pendous of its kind in the world. To this were compared certain Scandinavian monu-

ments, having the same character of Fields of Stones ; differing herein, that the

stones are disposed for the marking out of promiscuous graves ; some being set to

express the figure of a boat. The Swedish antiquaries account them battle-fields,

turned into the cemeteries of the slain ; the boat indicating where some illustrious

sea-king or sea-hero lies. Attention was invited to this agreement between the

monuments of the old Scandinavians and their historically-known spirit and man-

·ners ; whilst those of the Bretons represent, if aright understood by us, that domina-

tion of the great druidical hierarchy, which stands out as the most conspicuous fea-

ture in the social constitution of ancient Gaul. Subordinate discriminations of the

same tendency were pointed out in certain Scandinavian circles, considered as courts

of law, suitably to the jealous respect for law and the litigious temper of the old

Norseman at home                                                                            whilst the sacerdotal character of the Celtic remains re-appears,
                                                                                         ;
--in the Logan or Rocking stones, spread over the Celtic unknown seemingly on the
--Germanic soil, and supposed ministrant in oracular uses. The importance of thus

identifying the characters and monuments of nations, was urged in an ethnological

view. The extraordinary remains at Carnac invite alike the scientific and the traveller

for mere pleasure.

  On the Alphabet of the Indian Archipelago. By J. Craufurd, F.R.S.

   The paper summed up by stating that the nine alphabets of the Archipelago are
the produce of five large islands only out of the innumerable ones that compose it.
The most fertile and civilized island of Java has produced the most perfect alphabet,
and that which has acquired the widest diffusion. The entire great group of the

Philippines has produced a single alphabet; even this one is less perfect than the

alphabets of the western nations, in proportion as the Philippine islanders, when
first seen by Europeans, were in a lower state of civilization than the advanced
nations of the west of the Archipelago. * * * * The Indian islanders write on palm
leaves, which have received no other preparation than that of being dried and cut in
slips ; on the inner bark of trees, a little polished only by rubbing ; on slips of the
bamboo- cane simply freed from its epidermis ; and on stone, metal, and finally
paper. The palm-leaf employed is that of the Contar, or Lontarus flahelliformis.
· * * The instrument for writing with on the palm-leaf, on bark, and on the bamboo
is an iron style ; and the writing is in fact a rude engraving, which is rendered legible
by rubbing powdered charcoal over the surface, that falls into the grooves, and is
swept off the smooth surface. The Javanese alone understand the manufacture of
a kind of paper. This is evidently a native art, and not borrowed from strangers ;
as is plain from the material, the process, and the name. The plant, in the Javanese
language, is called gluza, Broussonetia papyrifera, and the article itself dalwwan
changed into dalancan for the polite language. The process is not the ingenious
<me of China, India, Persia, and Europe, but greatly resembles that of making the

                                                                                               6*

Egyptian papyrus, and still more closely the preparation of the South Sea cloth, the
raw material being exactly the same. With the exception of the Javanese, it does
not seem that the natives of the Archipelago ever wrote with ink before they were
instructed by the Arabs. Even paper is generally known to the Indian islanders by
its Arabian name of Kartas : so that it is probable that a true paper was imported
long before the arrival of Europeans, although the natives were never taught the art
of preparing it. At present European paper is in general use by all the more civilized

nations, to the exclusion of Asiatic.

On the Oriental Wards adopted in JSnglish. By J. Crawfurd, F.R.S.

   The following is a list, according to Mr. Crawfurd, of such words of Oriental lan-
guages as in comparatively modern times have found their way into our own tongue.

The greater number will be found in Todd's edition of Johnson's Dictionary ; and
the rest, with few exceptions, in Webster's American Dictionar)'. The words that

--he has collected amount to 160, and came to us, he says often indirectly, how-
--ever, from the Arabic, the Persian, the Turkish, the Hindu, the Malay, the Chinese,

and the Polynesian tongues. Following this arrangement of languages, ^fr. Craw-

--furd gave the list in alphabetical order for each class.
    Words derived from the Arabic : Admiral, Alchemist, Alchemy, Alcohol, Alcoran,

Alcove, Alembic, Algebra, Alkali, Amber, Ambergris, Arab, Arabian, Arabesque,

Arabic, Arrachi, Arack, Assassin, Barb, Cadi, Caliph, Chemistry, Civet, Chouse,
Coffee, Coffin, Cotton, Damaik, Damaskeen (damson). Dragoman, Faquaer, Gal-

lant, Gallantr)-, Hegira, Hookah, Hur, Huri, Islam, Lemon, Lime, Mahomet, Mame-
luke, Minaret, Mohair, Moslem, Musselman, Mosque, Xabob, ^sadir, Naphtha, Nard,

Spikenard, Olihanum, Opium, Orange, Otto of Roses, Ottoman, Ryat, Salam, Saracene,
Saracenic, Scullion, Sherbet, Shrub, Sofa, Soldan (sultan), Sophy, Tabour, Tam-
bourine, Talisman, Tamarind. Examples of these derivations : Alcohol. Al kahala
means the sulphuret or common ore of antimony, used by the Arabian women to
blacken the eyelashes. According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Academy, the

alchemists were in the habit of distilling this mineral along with ardent spirit,

believing that a highly concentrated spirit was the result ; and hence the word

--alcohol, a corruption of al kahala. Alembic. Anbik, a still, with the article al pre-
--fixed. Coffee. Arabic, kahwah, Turkish, kahve. The English word evidently

comes direct from the Turkish. The coffee plant is a native of Abyssinia, and not

of Arabia, for it was not known at Mecca until 1454, only forty years before the

discovery of America.  The   true  name  of  the plant  is  ban                    and  kahwa,  or  coffee
                                                                                ;

means " wine," as a substitute for which the decoction was used, although the

legality' of the practice was long a subject of dispute by the Mohammedan doctors.

From Arabia it spread to Egypt and Turkey, and from the last-named country was

brought to England in 1650.

Before quitting the list of Arabic words, Mr. Crawfurd said it might be noticed

that the Arabs had effected, although in a rude way, far more than the Greeks and

Romans towards making the eastern and western worlds acquainted with each other

and communicating arts and knowledge. These (until inspired by the fanaticism of

a new religion) house-keeping barbarians pushed their religion, arms, arts, and trade

·within thirty years to the western confines of India, and in eighty-eight years to

Spain. They pushed their commerce to China and the remotest islands of the Indian

WeOcean, which neither Greek nor Roman had ever reached.                           owe to their fana-

ticism cotton, coffee, the sugar-cane and culture of sugar, paper, arithmetical nota-

tion, race-horses, the whole citron or orange tribe of fruits, and all the various pro-

ducts of distillation.

 --From the Persian and Turkish languages there are, Bashaw, Can, Caravan, Cara-

outang. Malay, oran-utan, literally man of the forest, but more correctly a rude or
uncivilized man, a savage, a clown, a rustic. The accent, as in nearly all Malay
words, is on the penultimate in both words, and not, as we make it, on the last
syllable. The naturalists, taking the Bornean individual as the type, establish a
class of monkeys under the name of Ourangs ; but the propriety of the term is
very questionable indeed, seeing that orang means a human being, and is translated
by the Latin word homo. The name of orang-outang for any kind of monkey is

--unknown to the Malays, and the natives of Borneo call the animal mias.
   From the Chinese are, Bohea, Congou, Hyson, Mandarine, Nankin, Soy, Tea.
The number of these is small, owing to the imperfect monosyllabic dialects of China,
which do not, of course, find a ready way into our polysyllabic language. Neeu^ly
the whole foreign trade of China is carried on in a jai'gon of English.

--From the Polynesian, Mr. Crawfurd finds but three words in general acceptance
   Kangaroo, Taboo, and Tattoo. Kangaroo. This word has found a place in our
dictionaries, and was certainly supposed to be an Australian word by Capt. Cook,

           On Tutntdi in Yorkshire. By John Phillips, F.R.S.

   In this communication the author explained, by descriptions of certain parts of
the old Brigantian territory, and notices of the contents of tumuli which had been
opened therein, the kind of aid toward tracing the physical character of ancient in-
habitants of Britain which researches into tumuli might be expected to yield.

   By recent excavations into tumuli on the dry chalk wolds, skulls of British, Anglo-
Saxon, and Danish periods had been discovered, and as far as they had been inter-

preted they seemed to confirm the opinion that essential differences existed between
the crania of Celtic and Teutonic races. Authentic data on this subject have been
rarely produced in Britain ; but the search for them appears likely to add the valuable
evidence of physical structure to the conclusions of philology.

as to the general diffusion of a race akin to the Finns over the whole of Europe
anterior to the immigration of the Indo-European tribes. The Celt, generally con-
sidered as the earliest inhabitant of the British Isles, has a skull remarkable for its
diameter from front to back. Such, also, are the skulls found in barrows of se-
condary antiquity. In the most ancient, however, the skull has its chief develop-
ment from side to side ; the conformation of the aboriginal nations hypothetically
allied to the Finn and Laplander.

On Prussian Statistics. By Chevalier Bunsen.

The author made a statistical statement of the proportions of the races in Prussia,

and on the railroads and schools of that country. His information was chiefly derived

from the ' Statistischen Tabellen des Preussischen Staats,' by M. Dieterici, the head

of the Statistical Bureau at Berlin, and from private information supplied by the same

Wegentleman.  give a few of the points of this communication. Prussia had, ex-

clusive of Neufchatel, 15,o36,734 inhabitants. At the end of 1846, 16,112,938.

It therefore ranks fifth as to population of the European States. From Dieterici's

tables we find the population of the /^reat States in 1843 was as follows :

European Russia, with Poland  54,762,207
Austrian empire               35,877,864
France                        34,230,178
England                       26,991,517

Prussia

Prussian Germany contains 1,940,000 Sclavonic inhabitants. There are in tiie world
42,000,000 who speak German. In the United States, 4,750,000 of Germans, or
their immediate descendants, still speaking German, In Pennsylvania, 49 per cent
are German speaking people. In Prussia a census is carefullytaken every third year.
In 1815 Prussia had 10,250,000 inhabitants. The increase of population from 1815
to 1849 cannot be less than 6,250,000; for according to the constant proportion of

increase, the census of 1849 will give a total nearer to 17 miUions than to 16 million?

and a half; this is equal to the population of Belgium and Denmark. This increase

is greater than in any other part of the continent. Prussian statistics do not afford a
confirmation of the theories of Malthus. Of the increase, 20 per cent, is from immi-
gration, the emigration to America being deducted. The chief emigration has been

from the neighbourhoods of Minden and Treves. In 1815, Berlin contained 150,000
inhabitants; in 1848, 420,000; in 1849, 11,000 less. Of the population, 4,500,000

are inhabitants of towns. In Prussia, there are to every 100 males 103 females; in

France 104^. More boys are born than girls. In the earlier periods of life, males
are to females as 100 to 99. The standing army of Prussia is 137,000 ; men capable

of bearing arms, 837,000. In 1843, of 4,800,000 women, 2,200,000 are unmarried,
or rather without husbands, as widows are included. The average age of marriage
for women is from 20 to 21 ; for men, 25 to 26. Protestants are to Roman Catholics

as 5 to 3; Jews number 206,500. The conversions of Jews were from 100 to 150 a

year ; but since their disabilities were removed, the conversions have increased 50

per cent.      ___^_^__

           On the County of Warwick Asylum for Juvenile Offenders.
                              By C. HoLTE Bhacebridge.

The paper stated that the asylum was established about thirty years ago upon a

Asimple plan.  few acres of land were attached to the farm-house engaged for the

asylum, but they were subsequently let off, as the soil was not adapted for cultivation

by boys, and they were now simply instructed in shoemaking and tailoring. The

boys had all committed offences for which they were tried at sessions or assizes, and
the coming to the asylym was entirely voluntary on their part, nor was there any
means of detaining them. The education given was of a very plain and simple kind,

but had been rendered more valuable by the pastoral care of the clergyman of the

parish, the Rev. Mr. Powell. The committee of management consists of county

magistrates chosen at quarter sessions. The average proportion reformed had been

during the last three years about 65 per cent., and the average cost had been

16/. 6.S'. 8d. per annum, although 46/. 17s. might be considered the price the

Abenevolent have paid for each reform. [?]  comparison showed that the expense of

punishing a criminal boy without reforming him cost the country more than it did

to reform him, amounting as it did to 18/. l6s. lOd. per head, exclusive of expenses
defrayed by Government in the prosecution and in the transportation to penal set-

tlements.

On the Fluctuations of the Annual Supply and average Price of Corn, in France,
   during the last seventy years, with particular reference to the four periods
   ending in 1792, 1814, 1830, and 1848. By J. T. Danson.

   It appeared from official sources that there are few of the departments of France
in which the average consumption of grain of nil kinds per head, per annum, falls
short of an imperial quarter; that considerably more than half (by measure) of all
the grain food thus consumed consists of wheat ; and that though the use of wheat

as a large proportion of the food of the people is confined to particular localities,

these localities are so distributed that whatever changes materially affect them may
be safely assumed to affect, more or less, the whole country. Hence it was inferred,
in the first instance, that the official average prices of wheat might be safely ac-
cepted, in France as in England, as indicating the current price of food. The first
period of sixteen years (1778 to 1793) was distinguished from every subsequent period
of similar length, and from most of those preceding, by the low average range and
also by the uniformity of its prices. The ten years' average of 1766 to 1775 was 18f.
66c. per hectolitre. From 1778 to 1787 it was only 14f. 33c. In any subsequent
period of ten years the average had been very little over or under 20f. The average
 of the six years, 1788 to 1793, was 21f. 81c.; and during this period the most distress-
 ing fluctuations occurred; the average price of 1789 being more than fifty per cent,
 above that of 1787, and the price of 1793 (35f.) being more than a hundred per cent,
 above that of 1791 . Thus ten years of low prices were followed by six of high prices
 and these closed the period. The second period embraced the prices of eighteen
 years (1797 to 1814). From 1797 to 1802 prices were generally high in France, as they
 88 REPORT--1849.

 were throughout Europe. But in the eight years, 1803 to 1810, prices were constantly
 low in France, giving a general average of only 18f. 60c. ; and in each of these years,
 but especially the last seven, grain was more or less largely exported.

    The averages here stated are, as usual, those of the astronomical, not of the agri-
 cultural year.5. They may therefore be taken to indicate the market value of about
 two-thirds of one crop and one-third of the next. So the first of the seven good years

--is to be referred to the harvest of 1803 of that summer during which Bonaparte

 formed the camp at Boulogne, and prepared his election to the Imperial throne in
 the following spring. The last ended with the gathering of the deficient harvest of

--1810 the year in which the events of the Peninsular war began to run decidedly

 against France, and in which Napoleon determined upon urging his final and fatal

 dispute with Russia..

  --The common average of the three years 1811, 1812, 1813 was 27f. 66c. an ad-

 vance of more than fifty per cent, upon the average of the preceding eight years ; and
 the whole rise of price, from 1809 to 1812, was from 15f. to 34f. per hectolitre. The
 harvest of 1813 was good, and after it was gathered prices fell; but this period was
 closed virtually by the battle of Leipsic in October, and formally by the abdication
 of the following April. The third period embraces the sixteen years from 1815 to
 1830. It has a striking resemblance to the one preceding. The years 1816, 1817,
 1818 were years of general scarcity, like those of 1800, 1801, 1802. Then also there
 was a middle period of plenty, marked by the nine years, 1816 to 1827, of moderate or
 low prices. The lowest prices, as before, were in the last years of this time of plenty
 and they were succeeded by the scarcity and high prices of 1828, 1829, 1830. The
 price of bread in Paris was actually higher in 1829 than at any time in 1816, 1817
 or 1818, or at any time since 1800. During the fourth period (the seventeen
 years from 1831 to 1847 inclusive) were nearly repeated the features which had
 distinguished the three preceding. At its commencement were two years of high
 prices. Then followed thirteen years (1833 to 1845), during which the general average
 of 20f. was only once materially exceeded, when, in 1839, the annual average rose
 to 22f. 49c. The common average of this period was 18f. 43c. But the period ended
 precisely as its predecessors had ended ; with two years of prices, which, notwith-
 standing the use of foreign supplies, more than twice as large as had ever been im-
 ported in a similar period, were unusually high. Mr. Danson then went over the

--same ground again with another test that afforded by a statement, from the Cus-

toms account, of the quantity of grain and flour of every description actually ex-
ported (of French produce), or exported and taken into consumption (of foreign
produce), in each year ; and exhibited, by tables and diagrams, a remarkable coinci-
dence of the results obtained by the two methods. And finally, applying both tests
conjointly to the period often years, 1838 to 1847, he showed the probable value of the
excesses of exports and imports respectively, as indicating the addition to, or drawn
upon, the national resources consequent upon the annual superabundance or de-
ficiency of the home supply. The estimated value of the excess of imports in 1847
exceeded 320,000,000r.; and they were sufficient, according to the best authorities,
to feed the whole population with grain food for forty-five days. In conclusion, two

--inferences were suggested : 1. That the political dates, 1792, 1814, 1830, and 1848,

are also the natural divisions of a history of the French Corn Market since 1778;
and 2. That the history of prices (especially as it regards the food of the people)
might, in the order of practical importance to mankind, take precedence of the
history of politics.

On the Progress of Emigration from the United Kingdom during the last Thirty
      Years relatively to the Growth of the Population. By J.T. Danson.

   The first complete census of the three kingdoms in 1821 gave us the total popu-
lation 21,193,000 ; in 1831 the number returned was 24,306,000, showing an increase
of 3,113,000 in ten years. Whether the number added in each year of this period
was greater or less than the number added in the year preceding, could not be known
from any comparison of these returns. But in 1841 the number returned was
26,916,000, showing an increase of only 2,610,000. It may therefore be presumed
that the number added to the population in each year is now less than was added in
the year before ; but further, against this decreasing increment of the population, we
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  89

have of late years to place a rapid increase of emigration. During the ten years
1821 to 183l", the total number of emigrants was 738,582 ; and in the seven years
1842 to 1848 inclusive, the number was no less than 985,953. And according to the
latest complete returns obtained by the Emigration Commissioners (down to the 20th
of June last), the number of emigrants in the first half of 1849, was no less than
196,973. Hence it appeared that the emigration from the United Kingdom during
the last three years was fully equal to, if it did not exceed, the natural increase of
the population ; and, in short, that emigration has now been carried on to such an
extent, as, if it were maintained, must effectually prevent the further growth of the

population.

Ott the Diseases and Causes of Disability for Military Service in the Indian

                                 Army. By C. Finch, M.D.

   The native soldier is not subject to a variety of diseases incidental to the European,
and many of the complaints common to both are less severe, less complicated, and
less fatal in the Indian, from physical constitution, simple nature of his food, and regular
and temperate habits. He is in a great degree exempt from many of the acute,
febrile, and inflammatory disorders so fatal to the European within the tropics. There

--is a marked difference in the character of the complaints common to both those of

the native being of the asthenic, and those of the European being of the sthenic

diathesis. In the Asiatic, though there is a less tendency to a rapid course, there is
less vigour to resist the encroachment of disease, which exhibits a proneness to be-
come chronic and inveterate, occasionall}' terminating more tardily, but not less
certainly, in death. This inferior power of the constitution renders them more prone

to disease under slight exciting causes, less able to bear active depletory measures,

or on the invasion of disease in an acute form they sink so rapidly that the mortality
in the two classes is in a great degree equalized. From this inferior power of rallying
from the attacks of disease, many disorders which at their commencement are acute
become in their progress chronic, and terminate in rendering the native soldier inca-
pable for service. In order to ascertain the particular diseases which incapacitate
the Sepoy, and their relative frequency, it may be deemed requisite that an exami-
nation should be made, on a comprehensive scale, of the invaliding rolls, which
besides containing a statement of the numbers, enumerate the diseases and causes of

disability. On inquiry. Dr. Finch finds no such documents are procurable in this
country; hitherto mere numerical returns have been made to the India House. In
the absence of more extensive returns, he has been obliged to satisfy himself with the
results of a more limited examination, but which will afford a close approximation to

a knowledge of the real causes of disability, and enable us to form an estimate of

their relative frequency. He has submitted to examination the invaliding rolls of

--three regiments for a period of nine years from 1834 to 1842. These rolls are of

the men presented for examination belonging to the 31 st, 40th, and 57th regiments
of Native Infantry on the Bengal establishment. Undoubtedly there are many cir-
cumstances which have a temporary as well as a permanent influence on the health
of corps. The chief of these are climate, locality, and nature of the duties required
of the men. By a fortunate coincidence, arising from a diversity in the course of

their service during these nine years, he is enabled to give illustrations of the effects

of these agencies. The 31st had lately returned from service in Affghanistan. The

40th had, within the period selected, completed three years' service to the eastward,
at Kyak Phyon, and the 57th had returned from Barrackpore, after a triennial resi-
dence at that unhealthy station. By a reference to the general table exhibiting the

numbers invalided, we find the following results :--That there were invalided from

susceptibility to fever 5, and general debility, a frequent consequence of fever, 24
enlargement of the spleen, induced by fever, 3 ; or from fever and its consequences,
a total of 32. That there were transferred from these regiments for rheumatism and
contractions of the joints, a common consequence of rheumatic disease, no fewer than

--68. That there had been incapacitated by asthma not fewer than 28 ; by dyspnoea

not less than 6 ; and by consumption, 1 ; from pulmonic disease altogether, 35.

from diseases of the brain, apoplexy, mania, paralysis, and epilepsy, 13. There have

been rendered non-effective by bowel complaints, by diarrhcea, 3; by dysentery, 5;

total 8. Diseases affecting the whole system, such as scrofula, leprosy, syphilis, and

                                                           ;

Incapacitated by diseases of the extremities, 13; 5 by wounds, of which 2 were re-

ceived on service; by ulcers, 1 ; and by a peculiar disease, called "burning in the
feet," 6. From cutaneous affections, 3. The other causes of disqualification, either

accidental or anomalous, such as hernia, haKmorrhoids, &c., 25. During the nine

years stated, 54 men have been incapacitated by general infirmity, or having become

--unfit in fact, "worn out." An abstract of the general tabular statement shows, as
--disqualified for further service, 282 equivalent to 91 from each corps in this period,

or 10 annually; and taking the strength of a native regiment to be 800, v.c have a

Hrate of per cent. It appears by the list that 54 men have retired from being worn

out in the space of nine years. This class included all men who, by reason of their

age or length of service, have become unfit for further duty. It is worthy of inquiry

to ascertain what are the average periods of life and service at which the native

soldier becomes incapable of further duty. In following up this inquiry, it will be

necessary to ascertain the averages of ages and service of the several grades sepa-

rately; for were the ages and periods of service of all ranks to be taken collectively in

forming an estimate of the mean age or service of those who have been declare4

" worn out," it would be by no means a just one. Some of the native commissioned

officers serve upwards of forty years, and are beyond sixty years of age at the period

of their transfer to the invalids. By including their ages and periods of service in

striking an average, we should obtain one obviously too high. It is therefore ne-

cessary to subdivide the men invalided, from having been worn out, into three

classes, according to the several grades they were in when transferred, viz. commis-

sioned officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates. The higher rate of pay, the

lighter duties, and the superior pension, induce the native commissioned officers to

hang on for a longer period than they would have done had they been in the inferior

grades, and even to require a little gentle persuasion to present themselves to the

invaliding commissioners when no longer fit for duty. The same advantages, though

in a lesser degree, may have their influence on the minds of the non-commissioned,

and induce them to continue in the ranks a few years longer, though, as far as regards

pension or duty, there is no difference between the grades of non-commissioned

officers, the Naicks and Havlldars. Not having attained to these benefits, the Sepoy

or private has no great inducement to remain longer in the service than he possibly

can ; and if he sees no immediate chance of promotion to the next grade, is anxious

to exchange the active duties of his condition for the ease and comfort of retirement,

and accordingly exaggerates his disability. These considerations have their weight,

and may account for the comparative numbers of the several ranks, and the relative

ages and periods of service of those who are annually removed. These remarks do

not apply exclusively to those who are declared "worn out," but to all pensioned,

whatever may have been their disqualifying causes for military duty. There have

been fourteen commissioned officers pensioned in the period we have submitted for

examination; their average age is 58 years 2 months, and their length of service 38

years 3 months. Twenty-five non-commissioned officers have been transferred in the

same time to the invalid establishment from these three corps, of whom the average

age is 47 years 8 months, and their length of service 26 years 6 months. During the

nine years 11 Sepoys have been struck off the strength of these three corps, having

been declared " worn out " after a service of 24 years 8 months, and at an average

age of 44 years 8 months,

   Annexed to the paper are the ' Vital Statistics of the East India Company's Annies

in India,' by Col. Sykes; and in vol. iii. of our Transactions are tabular statements
of the transfers and casualties on the invalid pension establishment ; of the average
length of service before transfer ; average age at period of disease, and number of years
each grade remained on the pension list for the years 1843 and 1844-45 for Bengal,
and for Madras for the years 1842-43 and 1843-44. These statements include the
whole native force of the Bengal and Madras Presidencies during the years specified,
and ofter, on an extensive scale, an opportunity of comparing the average periods of
service and ages therein stated with those of the men invalided in the three native

corps whose rolls have been submitted to examination. It will be seen that there
is a close approximation in the averages stated at which the men of these regiments
were transferred to the invalid establishment, and the periods mentioned in the tabular
statements referred to. The average period of service before transfer of the two
grades of commissioned officers in the Bengal Presidency was, in 1843-44, 38 years
2 months 5 days, and in 1844-45, 38 years 10 days. The average age of the com-
missioned officers was 56 years 4 months in 1842-43, and 51 years in 1844-45, The
average age of non-commissioned officers was 47 years 6 months in 1843-44, and
period of service before transfer, 27 yeais 9 months 18 days. The average period of
the native soldier, or Sepoy, previous to transfer, was 16 years 10 months 4 days; and
his age at date of transfer was 42 and 41 years respectively, for the years 1843-44

and 1844-45.

          On a Form of Table for Collecting Returns of Prices in Ireland.

                   By Prof. W. N. Hancock, LL.D., M.R.I. A.

    The primary object of the table is to direct attention to the observation of the
facts which give the most correct indications of the state of the poorer classes. The
statistical investigations which have been hitherto instituted into the condition of the
population have been too much directed to quantities, whilst the more important
observations of values have been neglected. Thus we have the census taken in
Ireland in the most elaborate manner, showing, not only the number of the popu-
lation, but the number of the trees, the number of the cattle, and even of the poultry,
in the country. Then we have returns showing the sizes of farms ; and the agri-
cultural returns, showing the number of acres under cultivation for different kinds of
crops. Now, I do not propose to undervalue these investigations ; but as long as
these returns are not accompanied by returns of prices, the partial knowledge deduced
from them is likely to mislead. Thus, the most mistaken propositions have been

stated as to over-population, from considering the population fables without re-
ference to the rate of wages. Specious theories have with equal boldness been put
forward as to the size of farms, from considering the land returns without any refer-

ence to the rent obtained from farms of different sizes. As to capital, again, we have
had the boldest assertions respecting its want or abundance, arising from a consider-
ation of the quantity of money in circulation, the deposits in the savings' banks, or
some other quantity of capital, without any reference to the rate of profit. In like
manner we have been told that there is no hope for a nation which lives on potatoes,
or that the salvation of Ireland depends on the introduction of green crops, or of flax,
without any scientific investigation of the average prices of such crops, or of the rent
which they will produce. But economic science teaches us the real facts from which
the condition of a population can be ascertained, and the advantage of different
systems of management compared j and this table is constructed for the purpose of
having these facts observed. If we want to compare the condition of the labourer
in Connaught with that of the labourer in Ulster, in Scotland, in England, or in
America, what do we require to know ? Why, two sets of facts. First, what are the
money wages or price of labour in Connaught as compared with the money wages
or price of labour in one of the other places. Secondly, what are the prices of the
commodities consumed by the labourer in Connaught as compared with the prices of
the same commodities in other places ? From these we can at once determine the re-
lative condition of labourers at different places at the same time ; and by sinylar inves-
tigations we can compare the condition of the labouring classes at different times in the
same place. Thus, if we ascertain that the average price of agricultural labour is in
Connaught 6d,, in Ulster lOrf., in Scotland \s. Ad., in England Is. 8rf., and in America
3«., whilst the prices of the commodities consumed by the labourer do not, on an
average, rise in the same proportion, we see at once that the labourers in America
are better off than those in England, who are again better off than those in Scotland,
whilst the Scotch are better off than the Ulstermen, and they than the Connaught-
men. But the observations for which the table is constructed would, if systematically
pursued, serve a scientific purpose of far greater importance. They would enable us
to perfect the principles of economic science, and place them on a firm and lasting
basis, by applying to them, more extensively and systematically than has been hitherto
done, the inductive method of reasoning which has led to such wonderful results in

the natural sciences j for observations of changes in values and prices are to the eco-
nomist what observations of the movements of the heavenly botlies are to the astro-

On the Use to be made of the Ordnance Survey in the Registration of Judgments

     and Deeds in Ireland. By Prof. W. N. Hancock, LL.D., M.R.I.A.

   He said that the Ordnance Survey at present was used to ascertain boundaries for
all public purposes, and was also extensively used by private parties. The townland
maps were complete for all Ireland, on which the name of every townland was marked
with the number of acres contained in it. From the structure of the maps they af-

forded the greatest facility, for having tenements marked on them as well as town-
lands; as all the boundaries of tenements were on the sheets, except in some ofthe
northern counties, the survey of which was first published, and on which the boun-

daries were now being inserted. On the brass plates from which the maps were taken,
all these lines were laid down. He proceeded to show that the Ordnance Survey was
thus adapted to be made the basis of a general registry of land, by requiring every

deed or judgment to contain the names of the townlands and number of tenements
affected by it. The reason which hitherto prevented the adoption in England of a
plan of registry with reference to a general map, was the expense. As that expense
had been incurred in Ireland, there was no reason why the maps should not be used.
He proceeded to explain how the Survey might be used in registering judgments in
Ireland ; and said that the effect of tiie adoption of his suggestions would be to get
rid of the delay and cost of negative searches for judgments and for deeds, which
must now be incurred on every sale of every portion of land however small. In
every case where the seller had a common name, or sold a number of portions of
land, the delay and cost were at present excessive, and in the sale of small proper-
ties operated as a complete barrier to the transfer of land. The changes which he
suggested would also diminish the delay and costs of Chancery proceedings, as
the names and residences of all parties entitled to notice respecting the sale of any
portion of land would be at once disclosed. This would lay the foundation for ap-
plying the doctrine of market overt to land, and obviate the lengthened investigation

of title required in every case of sale; as with a perfect registry based on the Ord-
nance Survey, it might safely be enacted that after due notice to all parties on the
register a public sale by a party having a power of sale should confer a parliamentary
title, the purchase-money, if anybody required it, being lodged in the Court of Chan-

cery; He concluded by quoting the opinion of the Real Property Commissioners,

that "the subject of registry of deeds and instruments relating to land exceeded in
magnitude and importance all the subjects which they had to consider," and " that
the regulations of the Act of General Registry in Ireland were imperfect, and occa-

sioned unnecessary trouble and expense."

            --The Usury Laws. Statistics of Pawnbroking.

                   By Prof. W. N. Hancock, LL.D., M.R.I.A.

   In the course of some investigations into the condition of the poorer classes in
Ireland, Professor Hancock's attention was directed to the state of the trade of lend-
ing money among them. He found that while the larger farmers resorted to regular
banks to make deposits and obtain loans, there were no banks established for the
--94 REPORT 1849.

smaller farmers and labourers, who were thereby forced to carry their deposits to
charitable banks, and obtain their loans from charitable loan-funds at 9^ per cent.,
or else resort to local usurers at from 25 to 100 per cent. He ascertained that this
arose from the laws relating to usury, which made it illegal to charge more than 6 per
cent, for loans under 10/. where no pawn was made, although pawnbrokers were
allowed to charge on some "sums inoie than ten times that per-centage. Some per-
sons alleged the rates of interest which pawnbrokers were allowed to charge to be
exorbitant ; if this was true, the best remedy would be to leave the trade in money
perfectly free, and then the competition of money-lenders would reduce the rate of

discount, wheiher on deposit or on personal security, to the least possible amount.
But there were two circumstances which indicated that the rate of interest was not so
excessive as it appeared to be ; first, the effects produced by the lower scale allowed
to be charged in England and Scotland ; secondly, the failure of the Monts de Piete
established in Ireland for the purpose of lending upon pawns en more favourable
terms than pawnbrokers. The restricted per-centage allowed to be charged on small
sums by the regular pawnbrokers in England and Scotland had set up a class of
tradesmen, known in London as "dolly-shop keepers,'' and in Scotland as "wee-
pawns," who evaded the law by nominally purchasing from a borrower articles of less
value than the licensed pawnbroker will receive, with a tacit agreement that if the
latter comes back in a month or six weeks at furthest, he will get his goods on paying
the sum lent, and a bonus, this bonus being a penny per week for one shilling, or
at the rate of 433^ per cent, per annum. The obvious remedy for the evils of " wee
pawns," and the other evils connected with the trade of pawnbroking, was, in Pro-
fessor Hancock's opinion, to leave that trade perfectly free; let borrower and lender
make their own bargain, and let the law not interfere except to enforce bond fide
contracts, and to protect against frauds. As to Monts de Piet6 (whose introduction
had been advocated by Mr. Henry John Porter at the Meeting of the British Asso-
ciation in 1840), the attempt to establish them in Ireland had, after the trial of several
years, ended in a complete failure. The whole investigation of the facts with regard
to pawnbroking, " dolly-shops," " wee-pawns," and Monts de Piete, taught a lesson of
the folly of legislating on different principles for the poor and rich. The real remedy
for the evils of the system was to establish the same freedom in lending small sums
that had for some years existed with regard to large suras. The defenders of the pre-
sent state of the usury laws could be reduced to a complete dilemma. For how stood
the case ? The merchants applied to Parliament for a suspension of the usury laws,
on the ground tiiat these laws, instead of keeping down the rate of interest when any
commercial crisis tended to raise it above the legal rate, really raised it much higher
than it would have risen, compelling them to pay 20 or 30 per cent, when they need
only have paid 8 or 10 per cent. If this reasoning were correct, as all economists
admitted it to be, could anything be more cruel than to expose the poor to the evils
from which rich merchants had been relieved? But if tfie economists were mis-
taken, whv was the suspension of the usury laws not repealed, and why were pawn-
brokers allowed to violate the spirit of these laws ? In the commercial crisis of 1847,
whilst the Prime Minister advised the Bank Directors not to charge less than 8 per
cent, on loans on approved security, to the rich merchants of London, the law made
it illegal for any one to lend small sums to poor farmers to help them through the

same crisis at a higher rate than 6 per cent. How were they to get money at 6 per
cent, when the market rate of interest was 8 per cent,? When merchants were al-
lowed to borrow at 8 per cent., why should farmers and the poor be prohibited from

borrowing at the same rate ?

On the Discovery of Gold in California.

By Prof. W. N. Hancock, LL.D., M.R.I.A.

--Professor Hancock proposed to investigate the following questions : First, on

what causes did it depend whether prices in the British dominions would be affected

Howby this discovery ? secondly.  could we ascertain whether as a matter-of-fact

our prices were affected by it ? and thirdly. If our prices were likely to be altered

by it, how could we guard against any extensive change in prices being produced ?

These questions were of immediate and practical importance, for the discovery of

the abundant gold and silver mines in America in the sixteenth and seventeenth
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  95

centuries produced the most remarkable changes in prices at that period, so that
the prices of all commodities were quadrupled in the short space of seventy years.
Although this change did not begin to take place till twenty years after the disco-
very of Potosi, yet a similar change at the present day, if the causes were in ex-
istence to produce it, must be expected to happen with much greater rapidity, as the
facility of transit and the promptness with which labour and capital were applied
to industrial undertakings would bring the produce of the American mines into the
European market with much greater rapidity than in past centuries. It must also
be recollected that there was not the slightest provision in the present or past ar-
rangements of the British currency to prevent changes in prices being produced to
any extent by the gold mines of California if their fertility were sufficient to effect
such changes. In investigating the cause of changes in prices, there were two classes
of changes to he considered which were perfectly distinct from one another.

    Sometimes the prices of particular commodities varied without any corresponding
variation in the prices of other commodities. At other times the prices of all com-
modities partook of simultaneous changes of the same proportion and in the same
direction. Changes of the first class arose from causes affecting the value of the par-
ticular commodities in the prices of which they occurred. Changes of the second
class were quite independent of the value of the commodities, and arose solely from
changes in the value of the metal or other commodity that was used as money.

   The price of a commodity in any place meant its value estimated in the monej"^ of
that place, or, in other words, the quantity of money that could ordinarily be there
received in exchange for it ; and this quantity might increase either from the com-
modity becoming more valuable or from the money becoming less valuable. As gold
was the standard of value in England, it followed at once that whatever cause af-
fected the value of gold as a commodity would affect prices in Great Britain ; so
that it was only necessary to consider whether the discovery of gold in California
would affect the value of gold as a commodity. But this depended entirely on the
cost of production of gold there. The answer to the first question might be stated
in a few words. The extent to which British prices could be affected by the disco-
very of gold in California depended on the difference between the cost of obtaining
gold there and the cost at the least fertile mine now worked, or which continued to
be worked after the discovery.

    As to the second question, it was manifest that it could not be solved directly.

No statistical investigation, however carefully pursued, could enable us to ascertain

the cost of production in California; for there the prices of labour, of the use of
capital and of raw materials of every kind, were in a state of most rapid fluctuation.
It would also be extremely difficult to discover with that certainty which the import-

ance of the question would require, the least fertile mine. But there was fortunately
an indirect method of discovering the effect of the Californian gold without sending
statisticians to that perilous region ; and this indirect method gave results far more
certain than any that they could discover for us. Let the price of silver be observed
 in England where gold was the standard of value, and the price of gold on the Con-
tinent where silver was the standard. If it were found that the price of silver was
 rising in England and the price of gold falling on the Continent by the same amount,
 it might reasonably be inferred that the Californian discovery was affecting the value
of gold. But this conclusion could be corrected and verified by a very simple me-

 thod. Let there be a systematic set of observations of the prices of all the chief

--commodities in some place in England say in London. Select from this list of

 observations the twelve commodities that were ordinarily most constant in value.
Observe whether there was now any simultaneous change going on in the prices of
 these commodities. If they were found to be all increasing in value by the same
 amount at the same time, it might be inferred that gold was changing in value ; for
 it was highly improbable that twelve commodities ordinarily constant in value should
 all change in value to the same extent from causes peculiar to themselves.

     Should the result of these observations prove that prices had begun to be affected

--Howby the discovery, then it would be necessary to consider the third question

 manner in which the subject was alluded to in conversation and noticed in the
 public prints, it would seem that the community in general was ignorant of the
--96 REPORT 1849.

frightful evils which arose when the standard of value, either from natural causes
or from the culpable neglect of government, became variable to any serious extent.
But those evils were plainly demonstrated by the results of a variable standard in the
reigns of Henry the Eighth, James the First and James the Second. The remedy
for these evils could be discovered in a very simple way from considering the reason
why gold had been maintained as our standard of value. It had been so maintained
because for two centuries it had been of all commodities the least variable in value,
and therefore the best fitted to serve as the measure of the value of other commodi-
ties. Should it now from any cause become variable in value, the same reason that
has impelled us hitherto to select it would lead us to take in its place as a standard
the commodity which would then become least variable in value. This commodity
would, he believed, be found to be silver. Silver was our standard of value for many
centuries after the Conquest. It formed a mixed standard along with gold from
1717 till 1774. It was now used as a standard in France, Hamburg and many
other European states, and also in the United States of America. There was no
reason, therefore, why we should not, if necessary, adopt silver as our standard, and
so entirely obviate any variation in prices being produced by the discovery of gold.

                    On the Tenure of Land in the Island of Madeira.
           By the Very Rev. G. Peacock, D.D., Dean of Ely, F.R.S.

   The surface of the island of Madeira is singularly corrugated and mountainous ;
with the exception of a small portion near the level of the sea on the western coast
and the table-lands of the Paul de Serra, a very lofty mountain range, there is abso-
lutely no level ground. From the central region of the Curral, which reaches an
elevation of more than 6000 feet, a series of steep and precipitous ridges, with deep
ravines, the chaimels of the mountain torrents, radiate in all directions to the sea,
reaching it at various elevations, exceeding 2000 feet at Cape Giram about two
miles to the west of Funchal, and forming almost everywhere a coast line of great
boldness and magnificence. The rocks are entirely volcanic, presenting every va-

--riety of basalt, compact, vesicular and scoriaceous tufas, which are sometimes loose

and friable and at others more or less solid and decomposing slowly under the influ-

--ence of the atmosphere extensive beds of white lapilli and pumice, intermixed with
--earthy particles, and not disposed in the order of gravity beds of volcanic mud in
--various states of consolidation as affected by the action of the overlying lavas others

of volcanic cinders and fragments of volcanic rocks and also of scoriae, occasionally of
great thickness, which it would be sometimes difficult to distinguish from the pro-
ducts of an iron furnace. The surface which is capable of cultivation, in an island

--thus physically constituted, bears a small proportion to the whole more than half of
-- --it the region of the vaccinium and arborescent heaths is either too barren or too

elevated for the successful growth of the cerealia, and affords a very scanty pasturage

for cattle, sheep and goats. Much of the remainder is either sterile rock or too pre-

cipitous for tillage.

   Of the parts of the island which are capable of cultivation, a great portion is only
maintained in tiiat state by walls and terraces, succeeding each other frequently within
the distance of a few feet, which not only divide the several occupations from each
other, but serve to protect tlie vegetable soil from being washed into the ravines
and torrents by the violent rains which are known to prevail, in their proper seasons,
in a semi-tropical island. The richer soils are found generally in the lower lands
near the sea-coast and at the bottom of the ravines.

  The finest wines are producedbetvveen Funchal and CamadosLobos and the Etreito,
and in a few other favoured localities on the southern parts of the island. No wines
of a superior quality are produced at an elevation exceeding 1000 feet j its cultiva-
tion ceases altogether when we reach 2000 feet.

  Among other productions of these more favoured regions we find cofl«e of a very

superior quality. Sugar, which was once extensively cultivated, and formed a large

article of export, is grown in suflScient quantity to supply, in the form of molasses, the
wants of the labouring population. The arrow-root is of first-rate excellence. The

--usual fruits of countries bordering on the tropics the banana, custard-apple, guava,
--oranges, &c. are found in great abundance, but rarely cultivated with much care or

skill. Wheat, beans and barley, form, besides the vine, the principal articles of cul-

tivation, but the produce is quite insufficient for the wants of the population. Maize

Ais beginning to be grown in small quantities in some parts of the island.  species of

yam, which is very productive, is cultivated on lands capable of irrigation on the banks

of the torrents. The potato, which formed the principal food of the people and which

was produced abundantly in the mountains as well as lower lands, has been attacked

with the prevalent disease, and its loss has produced the usual disastrous effects which
have been observed in other countries amongst those who depended upon it for their

support. Sweet potatoes, cabbage and other garden vegetables, are produced in abun-

dance, but nowhere of first-iate excellence-- no attempt, in fact, is made to procure
improved seeds or new species of plants or trees. The fruit-trees are such as are na-
turally produced, and are never grafted. The cultivators follow rigorously the prac-

tices of their forefathers, and resist with characteristic obstinacy all attempts at inno-

vation. They are too poor or depressed, or too imperfectly educated, to look out either
for new methods of cultivation or new articles of produce.

The peculiar tenure of land in Madeira (which prevails more or less in Portugal,

Spain and Italy, a relic of the dominion of the Romans, and which once prevailed,

though under a modified form, in France) is intimately connected with the condition

both of the cultivation and of the people. During my stay in Madeira, in the course

of the last winter, I paid particular attention to the conditions of this tenure, and to

the consequences which it appeared to produce, it is a subject about which it is diffi-

cult to procure very accurate or precise information. There are no Portuguese books

(or at all events none which I could procure) which describe it. There are no pub-
lished statistical detaif^ and none which are easily procurable. The codes also of the

Portuguese law, thoughljxcellent in principle, and such as, if executed, would be very

effective in their operation, are very imperfectly or very corruptly administered, so as

to place in many important cases the theory and the practice in striking contrast with
each other. Under such circumstances I felt myself compelled to depend partly upon
personal inquiries and observations, and partly upon a series of replies made by a most

intelligent Portuguese gentleman to queries which I had prepared very carefully so as

to include nearly all the points which could affect the relation of landlord and tenant,

and the effects which they produced upon the cultivation of the land and the condition

of the people.

   By the ancient laws of Portugal, a proprietor could alienate by will to a stranger,
away from his natural and compulsory heirs (children or grandchildren, father or mo-
ther, grandfather or grandmother), one-third part of his possessions ; and he who had

Ano such heirs could dispose of them at his pleasure. custom afterwards arose, under

the authority of the Church, of instituting vinculos, or perpetual entails, upon the

natural heirs, on condition of providing for the performance of certain masses and

distributing certain alms for ever for the souls of the entailers and his progenitors.

All that remained when these claims were satisfied became the property of the pos-

sessor for life, and passed in succession to his heirs, male or female, one or both, ac-
cording to the conditions of the vinculo, and upon their failure reverted to the Crown,
During the continuance of the entail the estate could not be charged in any way
whatever, nor let for any period extending beyond four years of the life in possession,
or beyond eighteen years of the same event, with the especial consent of the heir in
succession, who claimed, in both cases, the rent with the inheritance : no provision
could be made for other members of the family : it continued for ever a life posses-

sion, and a life possession only in the strictest sense of the term.
   The union of several vinculos constituted a morgado, and the sariie term is applied

in the Portuguese language both to the possession and possessor.
   The effect of this system, whether due to the influence of the Church or to the

passion, so natural to mankind, to transmit their naaae and influence, in connexion with
their possessions, to their most distant posterity, was the absorption of nearly the whole

territory (which was not in the possession of the Crown, or of religious establishments)
in the hands of the morgados. Their further institution, however, was forbidden by a

law of Don Jose the First in 1 770, under the bold but generally wise administration of

the Maiquis de Ponibal, which declared the system to be contrary to the just rights of
Aproperty, and to the just claims of the other members of the family.
                                                                       further and a

more serious assault upon the system was made by the law of Don Pedro of the 4th of

April 1832, which removed the entail from every separate vinctdo which produced a

smaller revenue than 200 dollars a year, and from every morgado or union of mnciilos of

less than twice the amount. The effect of this law is already beginning to be felt in

sales of land to English and other capitalists, and the range of its operation is rapidly
extending in consequence of the great depreciation of land in Madeira, from the rapid

reduction of the value of the wine, which is the staple product of the island. It
would appear, however, from the most careful inquiries which I could make (though

correct information on the subject is not easily obtainable), that nearly four-fifths of

the cultivated lands are still under the operation of the vinculo.

   There is some land (but not of great extent) belonging to three convents of nuns, the
only religious communities which survived the revolution of 1821 : some is in possession
of the Crown ; there are also some customary freeholds held by peasants in the moun-
tains ; but the greatest portion of the mountain pasture is in possession of the namaras
or municipal bodies of the different parishes, and is commonable by all the occupiers of

lands within their limits. So defective, however, is the execution of the law in every
part of the island, that those districts are treated as common property, whether for
pasturing cattle or collecting fuel, by cutting furze, broom, brushwood or timber,
without any system or control. From this cause the noble forests of the interior,

consisting of the til, the vignatico, the folhada (all species of laurels), and the tree

heaths, many of them of gigantic size, are rapidly disappearing. They served an im-

portant purpose in collecting the moisture and feeding the springs and torrents in

those lofty regions, which are a principal source of the fertility of the cultivated re-

gions below, to which they are conducted by an elaborate system of levadas or water,
courses, which have been in the course of construction during many ages, and many

of which are still in progress.

The morgados formerly possessed country-houses, sometimes of great extent and

magnificence, always with a chapel attached to them, where the masses required

by the deed of their foundation were performed. They expected and received
many acts of homage and of service from their tenantry, who regarded them as
their masters or feudal lords. They brought offerings of their produce upon his

marriage or the birth of his heir. They brought fowls to him at Christmas, and

a portion of the head of every pig which they killed : if he removed from his
country to his town house, or in his other journeyings, they bore his hammock

(for there are no carriages in Madeira) and his baggage ; during the war also,

when the island was ip English occupation, and the resort of our Eastern convoys

and ships of war, and when their wines bore an exorbitant price, they were gene-
rally rich and prosperous, and profuse in their expenditure. The revolution of 1821

swept away these and other feudal distinctions, and loosened the bonds which con-

nected the rich and the poor, whilst the rapid fall of the price of their wines reduced
their incomes far below the scale of expenditure which most of them had adopted.

They began in consequence to anticipate their revenues, by selling the reversion of
their crops for years to come to the English merchants. The consequences were
equally ruinous to themselves and to the progi-ess of improvement ; they became more

and more severe in their exactions from their tenantry ; their residence in their coun-
try-houses became neither convenient nor safe, and they have since been very gene-

rally abandoned.

  The caseiros or occupiers, the successors of the Roman coloni, held their lands

universally upon the metayer system, where the gross produce is divided equally
between them and the landlord. They build their own cottages, the walls (of

rough massfs of basalt or tufa) which surround their occupations or support their
soil : they plant their own vines, chestnut, orange, or other fruit-trees ; if water be
brought to their lands from the levadas it is at their own expense ; whatever, in fact,
is necessary to bring their land into cultivation is done by them. These improve-
ments, provided they are useful, or even when they are not so (for though there is a

distinction between them in law there is none in practice), or bemfeitorias, are the abso-
lute property of the caseiro, who cannot be removed from his occupation until his land*

lord has paid him their full value as ascertained bj' two public valuers appointed by the
camara or municipality of the district. The value thus assessed far exceeds in most
cases the real or marketable value (such as the c.iseiro would obtain if he should sell
them, as he is authorized to do, to another person), and it is only in very extraordi-
nary cases that the landlord becomes the purchaser. The eflfect of this regulation is

to give the caseiro very nearly a perfect fixity of tenure.

   The other relations of the landlord and tenant are regulated entirely by the law, or
rather the custom of the country, and rarely, if ever, by special contract ; a lease is
absolutely unknown, at least as far as concerns the occupation of land ; the lord takes
one-lialf of the wine when it issues from the wine-prejs, one-half of the corn when
trodden out from the straw on the threshing-floor, as well as one-half of the straw itself,
one-half of the sugar-cane, fmits, garden and other produce, one-half of the grass or of
the very various produce which is sold as grass, which is not consumed on the premises.
It should be remarked, however, that-before this division is made, the tithe of all the
produce is claimed by the officers of the Government. The more liberal landlords
give the seed, and do not claim the smaller articles of produce; but those who are
very needy or have leased their claims to a rendeiro or middle-man, as is very com-

monly the case, exact their rights with great and oppressive severity.
   The produce of cattle, pigs, and poultry which aie fed on the farm belong entirely to

the caseiro. Sometimes the landlords furnish the cattle, &c. at a price agreed upon, and
divide the profit upon them when sold, equally, or in some proportion agreed upon with
the tenant; it is not unusual, also, to agree upon a money price of the corn and other
produce, before it is gathered, leaving the risks to the tenant : this is very rarely done
in the case of wine. The consequences of these arrangements, where a kind and con-
fidential feeling does not exist (as is very rarely the case) between the landlord and
the tenant, are such as might be anticipated : frauds become rather the rule than the
exception. The ears of corn and other articles are abstracted and concealed or sold.
If the factor who watches the interests of the landlord or the middle-man is too vigi-
lant he is threatened, and in some cases murdered. If a landlord resides upon his

estate in the country and exercises too close an inspection of the productions of his
tenants, he is subjected to annoyances and losses, which render his residence amongst
them uncomfortable at least, if not dangerous. The occupations of the tenants are
generally extremely small. In the richer and more productive districts, they rarely
reach an acre of ground ; much more frequently not one-half or even one-tenth of that
 quantity. There is, in fact, hardly any limit to the extent of these sub-divisions. If
a caseiro dies, his children succeed to the inheritance in common, and either divide

it, building cottages on their occupations, or hold it in common ; for it rarely happens

 that they possess sufficient money to be able to buy up the portions of the bemfeitorias

 which belong to the other claimants.
    The cultivation is generally of the rudest kind. In large districts we find that wheat

has been grown on the same land for twenty or thirty years in succession. The crops,

as may be expected, are extremely poor. I could obtain no answer to my inquiries

 respecting the average produce per acre : I should think that it rarely reached fourteen

--bushels in most cases not half the number. Many of the crops which I examined

 in April last, a very favourable season, would hardly, in this country, be considered

 worth the trouble of reaping.

    On the mountains, at elevations not exceeding 2000 or 2500 feet, the broom and
 furze is burnt once in six or seven years, and the ashes manure the land for a crop
 of rye of the most miserable description. The land is said to be exhausted by the

 effort, and the experiment is not repeated until the end of another septennial period.

 In the smaller occupations, we find the mixture of productions which we should

 naturally look for in gardens, without the clean and laborious cultivation which is

  essential to its success : wheat or barley, sugar-cane, vines, arrow-root, coffee in
 many protected situations, vegetables, peach, fig and orange trees, are intermixed
 without order or arrangement ; weeds of all kinds are allowed to grow freely, parti-

  cularly under the vines, and are cut from time to time, and used or sold as fodder
 for the cattle ; the succession also of many of their productions in a country with a
 temperature of perpetual spring or summer is almost independent of the season ; but
  no advantage seems to be taken of this singular felicity of the climate: no selection

  of seeds or plants, no proper pruning, no grafting, no system, no horticultural or
                                                                                                   7*

aerJcultural knowledge ; they follow the practices which they have been taught by
their fathers, and resist or neglect all change or instruction with a pertinacity which
no prospect of profit can overcome. It is very common to see occupations unculti-
vated, but never abandoned ; for though the law gives the landlord a control over the
cultivation, and the means of punishing or ejecting a refractory or a negligent
tenant, it can only be practically enforctd through the purchase of the hemfeitorias.
The caseiro may be engaged in other occupations more profitable than the cultiva-
tion of his land, or influenced by other motives ; whilst the landlord will acquiesce in
the loss of the produce which the land is capable of yielding rather than incur the
cost of the purchase of improvements, or what are so considered, more particularly
when estimated far beyond their value. There are considerable tracts in some of the
most favoured situations of the island which are in the situation I have described.

    Of all the productions of the island the vine is the most extensively and most care-
fullycultivated; the soil most adapted to it is amixtureof the red and yellow tufa, called
the saibro and Xhe pedra molle, the latter of which is very light and loose, and would be
easily washed away if not mixed with other soil ; another soil, called the cascalha, a de-
composing basaltic conglomerate, is also well adapted to the purpose. The clayey soil,
called vtaumpez, unless largely mixed with lighter and more friable materials, must be
carefullyavoided. The vines are planted in trenches dug to the depthof five or six feet;
they are trained upon a framework formed by the stalks of the reed (^Arundo sagiltata)
supported upon wooden posts or stone piers at an elevation of five or si.\ feet from the
ground, and tied together wiih twigs of the red willow {Salix rubra) : vegetables and
weeds of all kinds are cultivated or allowed to grow beneath them, which are gene-
rally cleared (tway in the summer season when the vines are in bearing. It is a
necessary effect of this system that the vines are pruned not to but from the root, so
as to add during every year to the length of the ancient stem through which the sap
is transmitted to the fruit : they thus become weaker instead of stronger with the
increase of age ; and at the end of little more than twenty years a vineyard must be
destroyed and replanted. The fruit also decreases in flavour and richness the further

--it is removed from the ground, a fact which the French and German vine-growers

fully understand, and consequently have adopted a totally different system. The
vineyards are seldom of great extent, the largest not exceeding three or four acres;

they are very rarely if ever (except in the gardens of quintas in and around Funchal)
cultivated by the proprietors, but almost always by caxeiros, the same division of the
produce prevailing in the richest and the poorest vineyards ; their produce will vary
from one to three pipes per acre. The price to the producer during the last year
varied from about 40 dollars in the best districts, to 10 or 12 dollars per pipe;

towards the end of the last war the price was nearly three times as much. The
 vine in its progress to maturity is exposed to a variety of enemies; the innumerable
 multitude of lizards, rats and bees destroy generally one-sixth part of the produce.
The grapes, which are allowed to hang until they are perfectly matured, produce the
 wines of the richest flavour, and the wine-merchants will frequently double the price
per baril for wines which are thus preserved ; but when the grapes of the neighbour-
ing vineyards are gathered, their enemies crowd to the plunder of those which re-
main : it is only by speedily gathering them that they can be saved from entire de-

struction.

    Most of the occupations are too small, or in situations too precipitous for the use
 of the plough, which is an instrument of the rudest materials and form; but even
 when it might be advantageously applied it is not generally used : the favourite and
 almost exclusive instrument of cultivation is the enc/iada, a slightly incurved pick-
 axe, which they use with great dexterity to break up rather than upturn the surface
 of the soil ; the spade is rarely used, and they have neither rakes nor harrows. The
 soil is generally light and friable, and rarely requires the careful breaking-up and tri-
 turation which is necessary in other countries. The caseiro is not allowed to sell
 the straw or manure which is produced on his tenure; but little care is used either
 in preserving or preparing it, and the use of artificial manures is altogether unknown.
 Water in this, as in all warm countries, is the most essential element of fertility. In
 Madeira, it is diverted into channels or levadas, from the mountain-stream at high
 elevations, and conducted by them to the several occupations in the cultivated di-

 stricts which have acquired by purchase or hiring the privilege of using it. It is di-

vided into a monthly cycle of giri or turns of one hour each, and conducted, in its

proper succession, into the several channels which connect it with the separate oc-

cupations. Of the public works of Madeira, the levadas are much the most consi-

derable and much the best managed.

The oxen, of which the breed in the island is very active and well-formed, are

the only beasts of draught. Carts and carriages, and even wheelbarrows, are un-

known : heavy burdens are drawn on sledges by two oxen : lighter burdens of all

kinds are carried on the heads of men and women. One-third at least of the in-

habitants of the island are thus employed as beasts of burden, carrying fuel from

the mountains, articles of produce and skins of wine from their farms. There

are some portions of road  which are   very  carefully  constructed  and  paved                                but
                                                                                                            ;

there is hardly a single continuous well-formed road to be found ; none to connect,

for purposes of draught, the distant parts of the island with each other. Their

steepness also in many cases is formidable. There is a principal road in the

northern part of the island near St. Anne, with an inclination of 27°. One of the

most carefully-paved roads, only recently made, leading from Fnnchal to the moun-

tains, has an inclination of 23° : a road with an inclination of 1 in 4 is considered
practicable and convenient: the Simplon has an inclination of 1 in 12, which is

nearly the limit of that which is practicable for carringes. All the horses, or rather

ponies, are shod with particular reference to these steep and precipitous roads.

   The condition of the people in the villages and remote districts is miserable in the
extreme, more particularly since the failure of the potatoes. With the exception of
Skibbereen and a few other places in Ireland, I have nowhere seen such squalid
poverty : their food is chiefly maize, pumpkins, salt fish, and the tunny-fish, which is

caught in great_ abundance off the island. Begging is universal and very importunate,
yet the people are generally very patient and courteous. They never meet a stranger
without a salutation. They are contented with the means of existence, and would
maintain no steady or continuous exertion to attain much beyond it ; but the occa-

sional labour which they will go through, more particularly in bearing heavy burdens

across the mountains, is astonishing.

On a Comparative Statement of Prices and Wages during the Years from
                   1842 to 1849. By G. R. Porter, F.R.S.

   The usefulness, not only to ourselves, but to those who will come after us, of records
such as those which I have now to bring forward as a sample, will be apparent to every
one who has at any time attempted to investigate the comparative condition at different
periods of our working population. To begin with what is emphatically called "the
staflFof life," and the price of which is a thing of the very first importance to those
who depend upon daily or weekly wages. The four-pound loaf of bread sold in the
bakers' shops in London has been, in the month of July of each year from 1842 to

1849, as follows :

in the accounts of markets cannot be taken as the prices actually paid for their re-

tail purchases by the families of working men ; they will, however, -afford accurate
means for comparison, since no doubt the wholesale price of the carcass must indicate
the retail prices charged for its constituents. The following prices are those given

June in each year, 1842 to 1849 :

    In the course of inquiries made among London tradesmen while collecting the
foregoing lists of prices, it was stated that as respects cheese, the working^ciasses

seldom or never buy it by weight, but apply at the shop for sixpennyworth or three-
pennyworth, or whatever may be the sum to be laid out, the dearness or cheapness

of the article affecting the quantity that they receive for their money. Another fact
of the same nature was ascertained from the proprietor of a very large establishment

for the sale of linens, woollens, haberdashery, and the like goods. The working man
or woman is accustomed to pay certain prices for certain articles, and does not vary

the outlay with the varying markets, but buys a 3*. or 3s. hat or bonnet, a shirt or
shift for so much, and so on through the whole list of articles of clothing. The be-

nefit of cheapness reaches them in the quality of their purchases ; and as the ten-

--dency has for very many years been towards lessened prices, we now see such at

--least is the case in London that the working classes are better clad than formerly,
--keeping in this respect their relative position with the more easy classes, whose dress

    especially among ladies-- is generally not only better in quality but actually more

costly than when the articles used were of much higher prices than now. When

-- --engaged upon an inquiry similar to the present fifteen years ago I was informed

by a person who gave constant employment to 1200 people, men and women, in
making up articles of clothing used by the working classes, that, taking one article
with another, the materials used then cost not more than one-half what they had
cost at the close of the war in 1815; and we know that, since 1834, there has been
a further and very great abatement in the cost of most if not all such materials.

Strong cotton cloths, the wholesale price of which in 1810 was iOd, per yard, sold
in 1820 for 9d., had fallen in 1S33 to 4d., and may now be bought at from 2d. to
2iflf. per yard. Printed calico, which sold in 1810 at 2s. 2d., in 1820 at Is. 4d., in
1830, the excise duty having been removed, at 6c?. to 8rf., may now be bought at from
3s. 6d. to 6s. per piece of 28^ yards, or from l^d. to S^d. per yard. The increased
use of cotton in this country, so far beyond the increase in our export of cotton
goods, proves that the people, and especially the working people, who are the great
consumers of cotton goods among us, have fully profited by their progressive cheap-
ening. The consumption of such articles as are of home production we have no
satisfactory means of determining ; but we may feel quite certain that as respects
such of them as are articles of necessity, as well as those which have become so
through the usages of society, a fall in price when unaccompanied by circumstances
that oppress the people, must be accompanied by an increase in their use. If we
had any doubts upon this head, they must, however, be dispelled when we find that
other articles of which, being brought from distant countries, we know the quantities
used, are so used in greatly increased quantities. The consumption in each year

from 1842 to 1848, in those articles of which retail prices have been given and which

are imported, have been,

     On the Agricultural Statistics of Ireland. By G. R. Porter, F.R.S.

  A volume of considerable interest and importance, entitled ' Returns of Agri-

cultural Produce in Ireland in the year 1848,' has recently been distributed to the
members of the two Houses of Parliament, and it is thought that a short abstract of
its contents may prove interesting to the Section. This volume more than fulfils the
promise set forth in its title-page, since it comprises also the returns of agricultural
stock and produce in the preceding year, 1847, and thus enables us to draw a compa-
rison between the two years as regards this most important branch of the national in-
dustry, under circumstances which give to such a comparison an interest far greater
than it would have possessed at almost any other period. The returns have been ob-
tained at the desire of Lord Clarendon, under the direction of Capt. Larcom of the
Royal Engineers, who, it will be remembered, read before this Section at the meeting
of the Association held at Cork in 1843, a valuable and elaborate paper on the Census
of the Population of Ireland in 1841, in which paper a considerable amount of infor-
mation was given that will admit of the comparison as respects some matters con-
nected with agriculture being carried back to the year 1841. The returns embraced
at both periods the number of farms or holdings, distinguished in different classes,
according to their acreage contents, information of deep importance considering the
faulty, it might rather be said, the fatal subdivision of the soil in that island ; and
it must be gratifying to learn that a change in this respect is going forward, if not so
rapidly as could be wished, j^et more rapidly than could have been expected, from
the known tenacity wherewith the Irish cottier had previously adhered to his patch
of ground. The condition of the country in this respect in each of the three years
above-mentioned was

and the actual produce in each of the years 1847 and 1848 are given in the returns

hardly be expected that a starving people should continue to rear things so easily

convertible into food, or into that which would procure food for the owners. These

facts, which are proved beyond controversy by the inquiries of tiie Irish government,

place in a very conspicuous light the disadvantage of peasant holdings, as compared

with farms which from their extent require to be cultivated by persons who, pos-

sessing some capital, are not driven, on the occurrence of the first calamitous season,

to measures destructive of their own future prosperity and injurious to the public at

large. The question of the advantage, or otherwise, of maintaining a class of peasant

proprietors, is one upon which it would not be advisable to dilate on this occasion,

but the figures brought forward in the returns under examination appear to be so im-

portant, as exhibiting the consequences of farming without the needful appliances,

that it was impossible to pass them by without this one word of comment. The

table exhibiting the number of acres devoted in 1847 and 1848 respectively to the

production of the different cereal grains, shows a result for which we could hardly

have been prepared. There was a falling ofFin the breadth of wheat sown of 178,125

acres, or 24 per cent, upon the quantity in 1847. Of oats there was a lessened

sowing of 278,464 acres, or 12^ per cent. Of barley the cultivation was lessened by
40,352 acres, or nearly 14 per cent. On the other hand, the tendency to continue

dependent for a great part of their daily food upon potatoes, has been shown by the

Irish peasantry in the marked increase of the land devoted to their growth, which

amounted to 458,783 acres, or 160 per cent, upon the number of acres so employed

record the result of that cultivation, serve to show that the actual produce of the land

be expected. It appears upon calculation that the produce of the cereal grains in

bushels, and of potatoes in tons, in each of the two years was as follows :

                Contributions to the Statistics of Sugar produced in India.

                              By Lieut.-Colonel Sykes, F.R.S.

    Colonel Sykes stated that the Goverment of India having called for returns of the
quantity of sugar produced in the different collectorates in India, he was enabled to
lay before the English public, in a condensed form, the substance of those returns.
Unfortunately it was necessary to have recourse to estimate in so many instances,
 that the results can only be looked upon as approximations to the truth, but they
 are the only approximations hitherto furnished from India.

    Colonel Sykes states that sugar in India is produced from the sugar-cane and frona
trees of the palm tribe, the Date {P/icenix dacti/lifera). Palmyra (Borassus Jlabelii-
fonnh), and Cocoa-nut {Cocos nucifera), which trees give no inconsiderable return of
 sugar: for instance

of proper reference. Up to that time they had not had a single default in payment of

the rent, and general satisfaction was expressed by the tenants with the extra com-

forts and accommodation afforded them. The balance-sheet showed that the building

had cost 13,252^. 17s. lid. The last report is dated May 1849. It is the first oc-

--casion in which details of a year's occupation can be given, and they are satisfactory

throughout. The directors say " It affords your directors great satisfaction to state

that all the dwellings have been occupied, almost without interruption, from the date

of their completion, and several applicants have been and still are waiting for va-

cancies ; 59 families have continued tenants since their respective dwellings were

ready for occupation in Januarj', February, March, and April 1848. The total num-

ber of tenants has been J73, several of whom having left their apartments have sub-

sequently wished to return. Not only have the tenants expressed themselves pleased

with the superior accommodation afforded to them, but have also proved, by regularly

paying their rents, and their general strict observance of such rules as your Directors

have thought proper to lay down for the management of so large a building, iJiat they

are desirous of assisting them in preserving a high character for respectability in its

occupants." Col. Sykes remarked that the last trait mentioned by the Directors is of

extended bearing and importance ; it holds out a prospect that not only will such com-

munities be advanced in their physical and social condition, but that a feeling will ori-

ginate within themselves to maintain a certain moral standing, a certain pride of cha-

racter, which will prevent individuals or their neighbours in this community from

offending against a public sentiment. The total number of shares taken at the date of
the Report was 1527. The buildings up to that date had cost 17,225^. 5s. Sd. Colonel
Sykes proceeded to consider how far, in addition to certain physical and ceconomical

advantages, this Association acts as an efficient auxiliary in thegreat efforts nowmaking

to improve the sanitary condition of towns. The best test, he says, for this would

be the health of  the population inhabiting the buildings of  the Association                                                            and he

accordingly requested the Hon. Secretary, Mr. GatlifF, to have drawn out for him a

weekly return for one year of the inhabitants, showing the male and female heads of

families, children, weekly changes of population, number of deaths and previous oc-

cupation, age, and disease. The weekly outgoings and incomings rendered it a

somewhat complicated matter to determine accurately the per-centage of deaths,

and he consulted his friend Mr. Neison. The Return shows that there has not oc-

curred a single'case of cholera, although the fatal disease was all around the buildings.

Having viewed this picture in detail, in which a population is represented as

comfortablj' housed, with the proper accompaniments of ventilation, proper supply

--of water and cleanliness, let us turn. Col. Sykes says, to a state of things the contrast

of this picture : In December 1847, a Committee of the Statistical Society of London

inspected the dwellings, room by room, and condition of the inhabitants of Church

--Lane, St. Giles's, London. On the l7th of January, 1848, their report was made to the

Statistical Society : Church Lane was 290 feet long, 20 feet wide, and contained 32

houses. The population examined was 463 ; the number of families 100, and the

number of bedsteads amongst them 90. There was an average therefore of above 5
souls to a bed, and many rooms were inhabited by as many as 22 souls, without water,

without drainage, and without privies. The whole condition of these people was so

revolting, that the Committee concluded their Report in the following terms :
" Your Committee have thus given a picture in detail of human wretchedness, filth,

and brutal degradation, the chief features of which are a disgrace to a civilized coun-

try, and which your Committee have reason to fear, from letters that have appeared

in the public journals, is but the type of the miserable condition of masses of the

community, whether located in' the small, ill-ventilated rooms of manufacturing

towns, or in many of the cottages of the agricultural peasantry. In these wretched

dwellings, all ages and both sexes, fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, grown

up brothers and sisters, stranger-adult males and females, and swarms of children,

the sick, the dying, and the dead, are herded together with a proximity and mutual

pressure which brutes would resist ; where it is physically impossible to preserve the

ordinary decencies of life ; where all sense of propriety and self-respect must be

lost, to be replaced only by a recklessness of demeanour which necessarily results

from vitiated minds ; and yet with many of the young, brought up in such hot-beds

of mental pestilence, the hopeless, but benevolent attempt is making to implant, by

means of general education, the seeds of religion, virtue, truth, order, industry, and
cleanliness ; but which seeds, to fructify advantageously, need, it is to be feared, a
soil far less rank than can be found in these wretched abodes." Such an evil con-
dition of things could have but evil results, and the Registrar-General gives the foU

lowing mortality from cholera in Church Lane :

Thus while the miserable abodes in Church Lane teemed with death, and the con-
sequent panic put to flight and dispersed the mass of the wretched inhabitants, there

                On a Centrifugal Pump. By J. G. Appold.

The model of a centrifugal pump exhibited was capable of discharging 10 gallons
of water per minute, and was only 1 inch diameter. One the same shape and 12

inches diameter, will discharge at the same speed of the outside circumference, or
one-twelfth the number of revolutions, 1440 gallons per minute. The author gives
various other calculations, and observes, that from the results of various experiments
he found the loss of power would not be more than 25 per cent. He also gives
calculations of the height to which the pump will raise water without discharging
any ; as, for example, 1272 revolutions of the 1-foot pump will raise water 64 feet.

He has'actually so raised water 67 feet 8 in. by 1322 revolutions. The 1-inch
pump will discharge its contents above 30,000 times in a minute.

 On the Copying Telegraph, and other recent Improvements hi Telegraphic

                     Communication. By Mr. Bakewell.

   In the copying telegraph the corresponding instruments are made as exactly alike
as possible, so as to impart equal and steady movements to a cylinder on each in-
strument. Motion is given to the cylinders by weights, accelerated velocity being
prevented by rapidly-revolving fans. Parallel to the cylinders are screws, which
turn with the cylinders and carry traversing nuts. To these nuts ivory arms are ta-
tached, at the end of each of which there is a binding screw to hold a metal point
that presses on the cylinder, and is carried by the revolution of the screw from one
end to the other. Upon the cylinder of one of the instruments the message to be
transmitted is attached. The message is written on tinfoil with a pen dipped in
Onspirit varnish, which is sufficient to obstruct the passage of the electric cuirent.
to the cylinder of the corresponding instrument the paper to receive the message is
applied. It is moistened thoroughly with a solution which electricity will readily
decompose, so that a mark may be made on the paper whenever the electric circuit

 is completed through it.

    By this arrangement, as the metal style which presses on the written message

 passes over the unprotected tinfoil, the electric circuit is completed, and a blue line
 is drawn on the paper of the receiving instrument ; but whenever the circuit is in-
terrupted by the varnish-writing a blank is left on the paper. In this manner, as
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  Ill

the point passes several times over different parts of the same line of letters, an exact
copy of the written communication is made, the letters appearing of a light colour
on a background of closely-drawn spiral lines. There are numerous electrolytes
adapted to mark the paper, but the one that has hitherto been found most available
is the prussiate of potash dissolved in a diluted acid. Very complicated chemical
actions ensue when the electric current passes from a steel point through paper sa-
turated with such a solution, the result of which is to leave a stain of prussian blue

on the paper. When the paper is moistened with diluted acid alone, the message is

impressed invisibly on the paper, and it is brought out by afterwards passing the

paper through a solution of prussiate of potass. By the arrangements described
copies of writing may be made at any distance to which an electric current can be
conveyed, provided the two instruments are moving exactly together. One of the

alleged advantages of this telegraph, as compared with needle telegraphs, is that it
will be free from the perturbing influence of atmospheric electricity. By another
invention connected with the copying telegraph, independent connections with dif-

ferent stations and with branch lines may be obtained. The cost of the instrument
would be 301.

On a Machine for Ventilating Coal Mines. By William Brunton, C.E.

   Although this paper referred to rarefaction as a means of ventilation, and not to
the manner in which the air is coursed or conducted through a colliery, the author
briefly noticed the principle upon which the air is conducted in the best ventilated
collieries, that is, by dividing the workings of the colliery into districts, so that in no
case does the air traverse through the whole of the workings, but being apportioned by
the wasteman to each of the districts through regulating doors, and passing through
the internal ramifications, the air of each district is ultimately and separately dis-
charged into the waste or return air-course which conveys it to the upcast shaft.

   As the tendency of the current is to take the shortest course, it becomes necessary

to retard the current of the shortest, or first district, in order to ventilate the second,
and the second to ventilate the third ; and, in short, it is by judicious retardation

that the air is made to pass efficiently through all, and more especially through the

last or longest district.

   Though the division of a colliery into districts is found, upon the whole, a very
great improvement upon the original method of coursing all the air through the
whole extent of the works, yet it is manifest that it has rather increased the neces-
sity for care, skill, and constant supervision on the part of the wasteman, and under

particular circumstances presents less security against explosion.

   The author described the furnace (the ordinary power of rarefaction) for which
the machine he has invented is intended to be a substitute, and proceeded to point
out wherein that mode of rarefaction is defective and ill-adapted to the purpose.

    Having thus endeavoured to state the nature of the furnace, and also what he
conceives to be its inherent defects, he entered upon the description of the apparatus

which he has invented and applied as a substitute. He drew attention to the prin-

--ciple of its action, namely, centrifugal force, and also to its construction an inte-

gral drum, with radial or curvilinear compartments supported and revolving upon a
vertical axis, whereby the air contained in the compartments is discharged with a
force (and a corresponding measure of rarefaction is produced in the central part of
 the drum) due to the velocity with which it revolves.

    Its construction is of the most simple character ; it has no valves or separate
 moving parts, has no attrition, and all the friction is resolved into a foot pivot
 moving in oil : when at rest, it presents no impediment to the air ascending the pit,
 is vei-y inexpensive, and liable to no derangement. In short, it is a simple in-
 tegral implement, whereby any degree of rarefaction necessary to the ventilation of

 a colliery is rendered certain and regular, under all the changes that so injuriously

aflfect the furnace, and subject to visible inspection on the surface by the constant

application of the water-gauge.

The machine erected by Mr. Powell, at Gelly Gaer Colliery, was for the express

purpose of ascertaining its power of rarefaction and general applicability to the

purpose of mine ventilation, in order to its application to his larger and more ex-

tensive collieries. The trial has been made, and a letter expressive of his entire

satisfaction was produced.

The machine is applied to the colliery by an air culvert connected with the upcast

shaft, which of course is closed at the top. The diameter of the drum is 22 feet,

the radial length of the compartments 6 feet, leaving the central space 10 feet dia-

meter : 16 feet being the mean diameter of the radial compartments, the centrifugal

force at 120 revolutions per minute is 39-25, which, multiplied by the weight of
= tWo6 cubic feet of air
                            of a pound, will give or produce a rarefaction to 17"5 lbs.

on the square foot in the upcast shaft. The following table expresses the rarefac-

tion consequent upon the velocities stated :
               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.        113

It has been objected that machinery of anj' kind, from its liability to fracture or

derangement, is inappropriate to the ventilation of a colliery ; but this broad objec-

tion is daily overruled. To machinery, in a much more complex form, we commit

ourselves with confidence to be carried by land at the rate of fifty miles per hour,

or conveyed across the Atlantic. But where this objection may yet prevail, an ad-

ditional or spare cylinder, with its appendages, may be attached to the opposite end

Aof the frame ready to be applied if necessary.  suspension of the revolving of the

ventilator would not be attended with immediate danger, for it offers no resistance

to the ascending current, which would continue long enough for the men to with-

draw from the pit, and repairs would be performed with less loss of time than is

the case in the repair of furnaces.

With respect to cost, a ventilating machine with steam-engine complete, suited to

an extensive colliery, can be supplied, erected, and put to work for about .^350

and where there are suitable boilers already at the collierj' from which steam can

be obtained, the cost would little exceed half the above sum. Lastly, with respect
to the power of rarefaction, the maximum effect of the furnace under the most

favourable circumstances gives 12i, whilst with the apparatus at Gelly Gaer 24 lbs.

on the square foot has been produced.

But beyond the mere substitute for the furnace as applied to all the ordinary

purposes of ventilation, the ventilating machine possesses advantages to which the

furnace has no applicability. One of these is, that in the event of an explosion, the

machine being on the surface, and placed with respect to the upcast shaft out of

the reach of injurj', can be immediately applied to clearing the pit of the choke

damp consequent on explosion, and thus save the lives of men which would other-

wise be lost.

Another, and what the author esteems by far the most important peculiarity pos-

sessed by the machine is, that it has such power of rarefaction that the atmosphere

of a colliery may be subjected in half an hour to an artificial exhaustion of three-,

four- or five-tenths of an inch of mercury, producing in the colliery, during the

absence of the workmen and their lights, the very same exudation of the gases that

would have taken place during the natural change of the atmosphere indicated by a
like fall of the barometrical column ; and before the men re-enter the mine the ma-

chine will discharge the noxious gas by a current of fresh air more copious and

eflFective than can be produced by any other means in use. All that is needful to

effect this is, upon the retirement of the workmen and their fights that the air

be prevented entering the workings from the downcast shaft ; the exhaustion al-

luded to will immediately commence, for the quantity of air ascending the upcast

shaft being decreased, the drum will be accelerated, and the whole extent of the

workings will thus be subjected in a few minutes to the full measure of rarefaction

obtained in the upcast shaft ; upon the fresh air being permitted to enter, the colliery

will be found in a state of extraordinary purity of atmosphere, and freedom from

the risk of explosion.
   It is the concurrent testimony of all intelligent underground men, that the fire-

damp exudes copiously during the fall of the barometer, and also that during its rise
the reverse takes place* ; the fissures that during the fall were discharging gas, now
absorb or draw in atmospheric air ; but the effects attendant upon a fall of the
barometer must necessarily be more or less dangerous, in proportion to the time it
has been rising or nearly stationarJ^ when a large portion of the gas evolved during

that period will have accumulated in the goaf- basins or vaults.
   From these observations it is obvious, that if the fire-damp be drawn oft' at short

intervals, as at every twenty-four hours, the accumulation and consequent danger
will be very little, compared with what it frequently is through the continuance of
weeks of fine weather ; and the daily discharge of these minor accumulations will
maintain the colliery whilst the men are at work in that state of safety experienced
whilst the barometer is rising (see Messrs. Lyell and Faraday on the Goaf, p. 17).

   Possessing thus the power of anticipating the sudden exudation of gas by draw-
ing it off when it can do no harm, and of rendering the colliery much more safe and
healthy for the workmen, may we not reasonably hope that the subject will receive
the attention it deserves, and that a system of alternate exhaustion and restoration

lamp shall be no longer necessary for the common collier, the danger of explosion

On i/te Use of Rockets in effecting a Comimmication with Stranded Vessels.
                                 By A. G. Carte.

           On a Desiccating Process. By Robert Davison, C.E.

   All previous modes of drying which have been employed consist in generating
heat by simple radiation, or throwing off heat from a heated surface, whether the
surface be brick Hues, cockles, steam or hot-water pipes. Heat is easily attainable
in this way, and almost to any grade of temperature, but heat is not the only essen-
tial for drying. Heat facilitates the evaporation of the watery particles, but a cur-
rent is necessary ; otherwise all the water which is thus converted into vapour will
only tend to charge the chamber with steam, and it is not until the steam has ar-
rived at a certain excess or pressure that it will make its escape and the operation
of drying really commence. The amount of current obtainable in this way is pro-
portioned to the rarefaction and quantity of air admitted and allowed to come in
contact with the heated medium.

   The paper then proceeds to show that it is not only a moving, but a rapid current
which is the great desideratum for all drying purposes, and that it is the impulsion
of atmospheric air at the velocity of the hurricane, or 120 feet per second, or any
increased speed, combined with elementary heat under perfect control, which con-

stitutes the desiccating process.

   The means by which the two operations of current and heat are created and kept

--up are as follows : The apparatus consists of a series of cast-iron pipes of a semi-

circular form, so united together with straight pipes at their base as to form one

continuous pipe ; these being set in brickwork, with a common furnace in the centre,
comprehend the heating medium. The current is created by a common blowing-

fan, which can of course be driven at any required speed. It therefore only remains
to be observed on this head, that the chief difficulty has been to discover what
amount of surface or metal was necessary to secure or maintain a certain tempera-
ture in a given space : this has been found to he 28 feet superficial, or about 10 cwt.
of metal for every 1000 feet of space of chamber.

    In speaking of the application of the process to purifying brewers' casks, the au-
thor mentions, as a proof of the success of this portion of the invention, that
upwards of one million casks have been thus cleansed and purified, and that the cost
does not exceed 1 Id. each cask ; whereas any other method where unheading is re-
sorted to, the cost is Qd. at least. Messrs. Guinness of Dublin are mentioned as
having adopted the process.

   The paper proceeds to describe the theory upon which dry heat is more important
than moist or steam heat for this purpose, and also why water in the pores of the
wood, and acid from the beei", are direct antagonists, quoting on this subject the
experiments of Mons. Dutrochet, who discovered that one drop of acid in one ounce
of water became mouldy in eight days.

    In speaking of the application of the process to the seasoning of wood, the author
alludes to the numberless treatises and cures for what is termed dry rot, but which
a writer says is a misnomer, " the rotting prittciple being moisture," and asserts his
belief that all immersions in water or exposing the wood to steam is calculated not
only to dissolve and wash away the gums which nature has provided to bind the
fibres together, but that ail such methods have a tendency to sodden and decompose
the woody fibre itself; while, on the other hand, the desiccating process is attended
with an opposite result. The improvements are thus described :

    1. The process is a true imitator of nature, or those elements which are acknow-
ledged to be the best seasoners of wood, viz. the March wind and summer heat, with
the advantage of both being continuous and controllable until every grain or atom
of moisture is expelled.

   2. The greener the wood the easier and more perfect the expulsion of the watery

particles.
{ TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                 115

3. The native strength of the fibre secured by the immediate evaporation of all

vegetable juices likely to ferment and carry on decomposition.

4. The gums, instead of being removed, are coagulated and hardened, and the

texture of the virood generally having been brought into its most complete state of
aggregation and densitj', is much less liable to imbibe atmospheric moisture, and

altogether less prone to decay.

5. The colour of mahogany and other fancy woods is not only preserved but

improved.

6. Shrinkage is entirely obviated.

7. Cost of desiccating less than the interest of money on the value of wood, laying

up to season in the ordinary way.

8. Inferior woods made useful and equally durable as the more expensive, all the

chief elements of decay and mischief being expelled.

In general, there is the absolute certainty to the consumer that wood so treated

is thoroughly dry, a matter which, according to the old system, is one of great doubt.

The author adduces proof from experiments, and exhibits specimens of the suc-

cess of the process ia the above particulars.

Two tables are appended, one showing the average per-centage of moisture re-

moved from 100 different specimens of wood, which was 21^ per cent., the average

time occupied in desiccating the same being thirty-six days, together with the ratio

of time in which equal degrees of desiccation were effected by the natural and arti-

ficial processes, which were as 40 to 1, the thickness being 1 to 12 inches.

  A table giving the result of a few of the above specimens with their duplicates,

which were afterwards submitted to a strain until they broke, the weight, deflection

and average increase of strength by desiccating being noted, the additional strength

           On English oak                      14*0

   Reference is made to the system of impregnating wood with preservative mix-
tures, and the author explains that where such is deemed desirable, that the most
effectual mode of accomplishing the object is first to desiccate the timber, and im-
mediately on its removal from the heated chamber to plunge it into any of the mix-
tures referred to in a cold state. But the author is of opinion, that by removing all

the vegetable juices or elements of decay, there is little occasion for impregnating the

wood with any foreign raatter.
   The author appends notices of the mode of conveying the currents of heated air

into drying chambers generally ; the application of the process to purposes where a

high degree of heat is necessary ; and to the roasting of coffee.
   The paper proceeds at some length to describe the imperfections which exist in

the ordinary modes of roasting, and states that in the desiccating method, intended
to remedy these defects, the coffee is put into cylinders perforated throughout, or
into cylinders made of gauze wire ; currents of hot air are impelled into the midst
of the berries, thereby driving off through an aperture in the cover of the apparatus

"all the first water," to use a phrase, as in boiling potatoes.
   The pernicious watery vapour being fairly expelled, the operator proceeds to ad-

just both the admission- and escape-valves, by which means the roasting is perfected
in (to all intents and purposes) a close vessel, thereby retaining all the really essen-

tial flavouring properties of the cofi'ee.

   As a proof of the charring and deteriorating effect of coffee roasted solely by a
highly heated metallic surface, 112 lbs. of raw coffee seldom produces more than
91 lbs., or at most 92 lbs. of roasted coffee, whereas the new mode has been found
to produce, on an average of six months' working, 93 lbs. G oz.

On the Manufacture of the Finer Irons and Steels, as applied to Gun-Bar-
    rels, Swords, aiid Railway Axles, By W. Greener, Birmingham.

   The first innovation on the old principle of manufacturing gun-barrels entirely
from old horse-nail stubs was due to the late Mr. Adams of Wednesbury, who

                                                                                                          8*
116 REPORT-- 1849.

brought out what is termed Damascus iron, which is constructed of alternate layers
of steel and iron faggoted, drawn down into rods, then tortuously twisted, and when
welded into barrels forms the Damascus barrel. The success of this experiment,
both in point of beauty and strength, was so great, as to be under-estimated at
50 per cent, as compared with the strength of stub twist iron. The next experiment
was to blend more intimately than the above steel with the horse-nail stubs in the
proportion of one to two of the latter. The paper described the mode of this ; and
then went on to narrate that the next and most important improvement in metals
was the manufacture of gun-barrels from scrap steel entirely, and for this purpose
old coach springs were generally in request : by clipping these into pieces, perfectly
cleansing them, and welding in an air-furnace, a metal is produced which surpasses
in tenacity, tenuity and density any fibrous metal ever before produced. The tena-
cit)' of it when subjected to torsion in a chain-testing machine is as 8 to 2^ over
that of the old stub twist mixture. The perfect safety of barrels produced from it
is astonishing ; no gunpowder yet tried has power to burst them when properly
manufactured. These experiments had induced others on a more extensive scale ; to
effect this, ingots of cast, steel were taken to the mill made to No. 3 in the scale
of carbonization. These, after rolling into flat bars, were clipped into small pieces,
immediately mixed and welded as before in the air-furnace, drawn down into rolls,
and re faggoted ; these were subsequently drawn down, and were then ready for
being made into gun-barrels, either with or without spirally twisting them, to form
Damascene barrels. It was discovered that the density and tenacity of the metal was
sufficiently great to effectually resist the enormous force of the great charge of gun-
powder. The manufacture of swords was another article to which this improvement
applied. All the investigations of the writer had tended to satisfy him that the Arabs
thus produced their finely-tempered Damascus swords ; namely, using two steels of
different carbonization, mixing them in the most intimate manner, and twisting them
many fantastic ways, but observing method in that fancy ; and it was a fact that no
European sword has ever yet been produced equal to the Damascus. The Government
inspector of small arras was of opinion that the swords made in Birmingham were not
fit to be used in the army. The writer's investigations had satisfied him that tem-
pering by crj'stallizing the steel, that is to say, tempering in the ordinary way, was
far from the wisest. The Damascus blade in its fibrous state or hammer hardened
is more difficult to break by 100 per cent, than the best English-made blade. This
had been tried ; but temper it the same way, and it showed no greater tenacity than
our own ; the Damascene figure was destroyed by the carbon becoming equally

--diffused ; nor would acid develope it it was entirely gone. From these and other

facts the conclusion might be drawn, that swords constructed of dissimilar steels
tempered by condensation of its fibres, either by repeated rollings, hammering, or

--many other processes, which our perfect machinerj' gave us the facility to do are

the best. Therefore in time we might hope to see every soldier of the empire armed
with a weapon as good if not so costly as the highly-prized Damascene. The re-

--maining part of the paper referred to a subject already much discussed the manu-

facture of railway axles.

    On the Cause and Prevention of the Oscillation of Locomotive Engines oh
                   Railways. By George Heaton, Binningham.

   The author exhibited a model to show the cause and prevention of the oscillation
of locomotive engines upon railways, made to a scale of ^, to represent a locomotive
engine with driving wheels 6 feet diameter, cylinders 16 inches diameter; stroke of

piston 22 inches. A handle in connexion with the machine turns once round for 20
strokes of the piston. When the handle is turned slowly round, the machine stands

still where it is placed ; but by increasing the speed, it will begin to oscillate and
jump about, although each wheel has a balance- weight in it equal to the weight of
the crank-pin and the weight that the connecting rod bears upon the crank-pin.

    If weights are placed on the wheels equal to the weight of the pistons and gearing,
or all that moves in a horizontal line, the oscillations will cease, but the machine will
begin to jump perpendicularly up and down.

   This machine is intended to show the importance of moving weights in opposite
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  11/

directions to each other at high velocities. It will be found when an engine of
 20-inch strokes with 6 feet driving-wheels goes 15 strokes per minute or 3 miles
per hour, it requires one-tenth of the weight moving along the horizontal line (that
is, the pistons and gearing moving backwards and forwards within the engine-framing)

to stop it and turn it again.
    At 35 strokes per minute, or about 7 miles per hour, one-half its weight ; at 74

strokes per minute, or about 15 miles per hour, 1 J time its weight ; at 100 strokes

per minute, or about 20 miles per hour, four times its own weight will be required
for the same purpose. By attaching a weight with connecting rod and an auxiliary
crank to the head of the crank-pin, equal to the piston and its gearing, so as to make
the weight run to the left-hand at the same instant the piston goes to the right, the
blow to stop the piston and make it return at each end of the stroke will be received

in the auxiliary crank instead of in the wheels, producing a neutral point in the

centre and steadiness of motion ; for when the blow is received in the wheels, the
cranks being at right angles, it is communicated through the axle and gives a twisting
motion to the whole framing of the engine ; this being repeated with regularity, pro-
duces an effect similar to the rocking of a boat. This oscillation is found to be
greatest when the engine is running most regular for speed and the piston going the
same way with the oscillation of the carriage. The wire screwed to one of the piston
frames with a loose piece of iron upon it, is intended to show at what speed the wire
can move backward and forward before it begins to slip. If a weight be moved in a
similar manner with a 20-inch stroke, it will slip at 35 strokes per minute, or less
than 2 feet in a second ; therefore, when it is considered that the pistons of locomotives
frequently travel at the rate of 18 feet in a second, or come to a dead stop and turn
again 10 times in a second, it must be evident that the blow is sufficient to make the
whole engine oscillate and jump in a most fearful manner ; when it is also considered
that an engine running at 100 strokes per minute, or the pistons and gearing tra-
velling at about 5 J feet per second, require four times their own weight to stop them
and turn them again, when the weight of each piston, &c. frequently exceeds 400

pounds.

   To prove that the steam has no action in causing the oscillation, but merely to
blow the different bodies apart, I bored a small hole in the middle of a gun-barrel,
and placed 2 pieces of iron weighing 20 ounces each, which fitted the bore of the
barrel up to each side of the hole. I then put a few grains of gunpowder between
them, the barrel being placed upon a bed of sand to show if it moved, and then fired
the gunpowder ; the pieces of iron were each blown the same distance from the hole,
and the barrel remained where it was placed.

   Experiment 2, I then placed 10 and 20 oz. in the same position as before, and
fired, the barrel remaining still; the 10 oz. weight was blown 4 times the distance

of the 20 oz.
    Experiment 3. I then placed 5 oz. and 30 oz. in the same position and fired it, the

barrel remaining still, but the 5 oz. weight was blown 40 times the distance of the

30 oz.
   The oscillations of the machine do not increase in violence regularly as the speed

increaaes, for if the pistons do not keep time with the oscillations of the machine, it
is then tremulous motion until the pistons go with the machine every second stroke,
and so on to any speed, similar to a railway train that will shake violently when
running along a straight level line at about 23 or 24 miles per hour ; increase the
speed 2 or 3 miles per hour, it will become nearly steady ; by further increasing the
speed the oscillation becomes again violent, just as the whole weight of the engine
can oscillate in proportion to the weight of the piston and its gearing compared with

the whole weight moved.
   In making some experiments with this machine I raised 10 cwt. l6 feet high, and

attached it to the shaft the handle is upon, and then let it run down ; it came to the

floor in 242 seconds. I then attached the auxiliary crank with connecting rod,
balance weight, &c., and raised the weight to the same height as before ; it came to

the floor in 210 seconds, although adding so many more moving joints the friction

of which had to be overcome.

               On the Strength and Elasticity of Stone and Timber.

                     By Professor E. Hodgkinson, F.R.S.

   This was the result of a series of carefully conducted experiments on the power of
stone, timber and other bodies, to resist tension, compression and transverse force.
The experiments have long been in progress, and will be very numerous and varied
when completed ; theyjwill include the strength of most of the stones used in archi-
tecture in this country', and of thirteen kinds of timber. The results of some of them
were laid before the Association, at the Manchester Meeting in 1S40 ; but as they are
incomplete, the author is desirous of giving no more at present than this notice of
them, except to state that they point to some important general conclusions.

071 a Calctclating Instrument. By H. Knight.

The inventor of the machines exhibited is a Mr. Slonimski of Byalystock in

Poland. The first instrument submitted to the notice of the Section was one for

performing the arithmetical processes of addition and of subtraction. It consists of

a thin box of wood or metal, covered by a plate of metal, in which are perforated a

convenient number of circular apertures and openings, around which are engraved

or marked the several figures or digits to 9, and behind which are indented plates

or wheels, having in each a suitable number of teeth, some of which are shaded, or

Ablack, the others being left clear, or white,  small pointer, or style, is furnished

with the instrument, for the purpose of turning round the indented plates or wheels,

by inserting the instrument between two contiguous teeth, and moving it in the re-

quired direction. The style is required to be inserted between those two teeth which

appear under the particular figure engraved on the plate, which corresponds with

the number required to be added or subtracted; one general rule being to be

attended to, viz. that if the style be placed between two clear or white teeth, it must

be turned to the extreme right-hand of the circular opening ; but if between t-wo

dark teeth, it must be turned to the extreme left-hand thereof. The upper part of

the instrument is to be used for addition, and the lower part for subtraction, as en-

graved thereon. The multiplication instrument consists of a rectangular box, about

15 in. square and 3 in. deep. It contains cylinders having printed tables of figures

on the circumference of each, which cylinders revolve separately, by means of the

knobs at the bottom of the box ; and by other knobs, the upper part of each cylinder

is moveable in a vertical direction also, the rotative and the vertical motions being

regulated by figures termed indices, that appear through small holes over the axes

of the cylinders. In addition to the index holes, there are nine other rows of holes,

on the surface-plate of the instrument, the lower row of holes being for the mul-

tiplicand, and the corresponding rows of holes above it to exhibit the products of

that multiplicand by each of the nine digits ; and these products are produced
almost immediately, and without requiring any mental elfort. The horizontal

number of holes in this instrument is eight ; and it is therefore calculated to give

the product of any number having seven places of figures, or to millions, what-

ever may be the order of those figures. This instrument is the result of a new

theorem of figures discovered by M. Slonimski.

   The following are the facts, &c. deduced from a series of experiments, made by
myself and the Messrs. Allingham of DubHn, conjointly. The species of engine toi
which they have reference is exemplified by the model, now working before the

Section.

   No one knew better than Watt the excellence of the ordinary engine, and yet he

was extremely anxious to construct a rotary engine : indeed he, with this object.

patented contrivances, which, had they been successful, would not have been re-

markable for simplicity.

The chief inconveniences attending the use of the ordinary engine are, first, the

loss of power arising from the ohliqtiity of the connecting rod ; and, secondly, that

which is the necessary consequence of bringing large masses of matter alternately
--Ainto a state of rest and motion, many times in a minute.
                                                             great waste of power

must follow from the obliquity of the connecting rod, since it is a fundamental
principle in mechanics, that " power is lost when the force which we have, and that

which we require, do not act in precisely the same direction." The oscillating

engine obviates, to a greater or less extent, the inconvenience arising from olliquity ;
but it increases, to a very serious amount, the quantity of power consumed in

stopping and moving large masses of matter. The seriousness of such an evil

was perceived very clearly by the experiments witnessed in this Section, on Friday

morning last, regarding the oscillations produced in locomotive engines, by the

alternate motion of the piston and the parts in connection with it. The ingenious

contrivance, on that occasion brought before the meeting, was admirably calcu-

lated to prevent the oscillation ; but, so far from diminishing the loss of power,

due to the bringing into alternate rest and motion the reciprocating parts of the

machine, it adds to the evil by increasing the weight of these parts. Loss of power

--and oscillation at high velocities, are far from being the only inconveniences which

follow from this cause. With powerful engines, intended to move machinery, there

is an irregularity of motion arising from it, which, though not perceptible in ordi-

--nary circumstances, becomes exceedingly injurious, where regularity is as in many
--manufactures of deep importance. The wear and tear, also, consequent on great

strains in opposite directions, is very considerable.

   Rotary engines may be conveniently divided into two species : in one of them
the steam produces, at once, a rotary motion ; in the other, it produces that mo-
tion indirectly, by means of the crank, or some such contrivance. As to any of

those engines which produce a rotary motion directly, I cannot but feel convinced,

that, however ingenious they may be, or however smoothly they may work, from

the very nature of things, the most simple of them must be far more difficult to con-

struct than the ordinary engine; and, if it is at all possible to keep them steam-

tight, it can be effected only by a complication of parts, which renders them greatly
inferior to reciprocating engines, whatever their defects may be. Undoubtedly many

such rotary engines are extremely beautiful, and, externally, appear sufficiently

simple ; but they depend too much, in general, on accuracy of original construc-

tion, and do not fulfill a condition which I believe indispensable to a good engine,
which is, that " the more it works, within reasonable limits, the better and more
steam-tight it will be." This condition, I may venture to assert, belongs in the
fullest degree to the engine now brought before the Section.

While most persons admit that the ordinary engine has considerable imperfec-

tions, all are not agreed as to the causes whence they arise. Many, confusing the

facts connected with the cranlc, fall into errors regarding it ; some concluding

that because, as a lever, it does not destroy power, its application to the steam-

engine is attended with no loss; while others infer that because its use is accompa-

niedhy a loss of power, it therefore itself destroys power. Neither opinion is cor-

rect : and I am even free to admit that the engine now before you contains, in prin-

--ciple, a crank which, as we are taught by the very first principles of mechanics,

during every part of its revolution, gives back, though modified, all the force com-

municated to it. We, therefore, did not propose to ourselves to obviate the necessity
of using a crank, but to change the mode of its application, since to this is due the

loss of power arising from its use.
   None being more convinced than we of the excellent qualities of the ordinary

engine, our whole object was to retain its good points, while we endeavoured to

exclude its defects. Nothing can be more simple nor effective than the ordinary
piston, cylinder, slide valve, &c. : we have retained them. It is highly advan-
tageous to work the steam expansively : we effect this as easily, and I think I could

show to a greater extent, than can be done by the ordinary engine, and by a con-

trivance which is completely under our control.
--120 REPORT 1849.

   It is seen, by the model at present working, that we effect our object by using
gravitation, as a medium for ob-

taining the power of the steam.

Weights A and B are raised

twice every revolution, through

a space equal to the stroke ; and

in falling, give back the force

which raised them but little di-

Dminished.  is a counterpoise

to the cylinder N, and the parts

connected with it. The cylin-

der, piston and rod, steam-

chest V, &c., are like those of

the ordinary engine ; the whole
revolves on standards, one of

which is seen at Q, bolted on

a bed-plate T. The axle turns

in brasses, which are in the upper part of the standards, and are quite independent

of the valves, placed on the extremities of the axle, for the purpose of admitting the

steam or carrying off the waste : these valves work against metallic plates, into
which are screwed respectively the steam and waste pipes, and which are bolted

to, and adjustable on shelves cast upon the standards. The weights are attached to

the cross-head of the piston-rod, which, as well as eyes fixed to the other extremi-

ties of the weights, slide upon the guide-rods F and F. So little povver is wasted

by this engine, that we found 82i to represent the effective force, the whole power

of the steam being considered as 84. The action of the steam is precisely in the

required direction, at whatever part of the revolution the weights may be raised.

The plan we have endeavoured to carry out has, no doubt, occurred to many

persons long since ; but we have reason, from our own experiments, to conclude that
it was most probably abandoned, whenever tried, on account of difficulties which

would scarcely have been anticipated, at least to their full extent ; and which would

have discouraged us, were we not determined to persevere, as long as any prospect

of success should remain. To overcome these difficulties cost us more than three

--years of labour and the expenditure of several hundred pounds. One of the chief

of them was the stopping, with sufficient gentleness, those masses of matter con-

tained in the weights. The moving parts of the ordinary engine are gradually set

in motion or brought to  rest,  chiefly  by  means  of  the  crank                              and  whatever  con-
                                                                                             ;

sumption of steam or loss of power occurs, is nearly, if not entirely, concealed from

the ordinary observer. But, in our case, if the reciprocating parts were not, with

gentleness and certainty, brought into a state of rest, the engine would be greatly

injured, or destroyed. The weights, which are thrown up with very considerable

velocity, cannot be stopped by solid or unyielding matter, since it would cause the

most injurious concussions. On the small scale, springs might be used for the pur-
pose, although any person who makes the experiment will find, that while they prevent

concussion they cause a very objectionable amount of vibration : on the large scale,
they would be quite inadmissible. But, as is perceived by the model now working,
so gently are the weights moved and stopped by the means we employ, that not
the slightest noise, concussion, or vibration is produced. And I pledge myself that

increasing the size does not diminish these advantages. I work almost every day,
and often for many hours a day, an engine which, among others, I constructed myself

upon this principle. Its weight amounts to about 160 lbs., and it makes ordinarily

120 revolutions per minute, that is, J 60 lbs. are stopped and put in motion 240

times per minute ; and yet this produces no more noise nor vibration than is per-

ceived with the smallest model. It is so free from any kind of strain, that I

--habitually work it at its highest velocity, while merely resting on its bearings there

Mybeing nothing whatever pressing down on the axle to keep it in its place.                          friend

Mr. John J. Allingham has now nearly finished an engine which may be worked

up to eight-horse power, and I am perfectly satisfied that it will revolve with the

same gentleness and silence.

It might at first be supposed, that we should require large and clumsy weights :
                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                            121

the contraiy will, however, be evident to any one who takes the trouble to make the
necessary calculations. The relative size of the weights diminishes as the engine

becomes large.

Since the whole engine acts as a fly, we require no fly-wheel, and there is no

temptation to make any portion weak ; since the heavier and stronger it is, the

greater its power. Its entire weight may be less than that of the fly-wheel of an

ordinary engine of the same power, and it will not occupy more space than would

be required for the fly-wheel only.

It might be thought that such large masses, at one side of the centre of motion,

must necessarily cause great strain and vibration. But I beg to call attention to

the important difl^erence there is between the uncounterbalanced masses being mowrf

by the power, and being themselves the power. If they are moved by the power they

will cause a very great strain and vibration, as might be illustrated by fixing even a

small fraction of them to a wheel having the same diameter as the circle, in which
--Wetheir centre gravity revolves when they are attached to the engine.
                                                                         soon found

Dit necessary to counterbalance the cylinder, &c. by the counterpoise H, which

at the same time, serves also as a strong and convenient support, along with the

cylinder, for the guide-bars F, F. On the other hand, the weights themselves,

however great, being the medium through which the force is transmitted, require no

counterpoise.

   Since the steam is used very expansively, the upward motion of the weights is
gradually retarded, and any small quantity of it, which remaining would cause con-

cussion or vibration, is destroyed by a portion of the waste steam. There is not,
however, any obstacle offered to the exit of the latter, which has, at least, as great

facility for escape as in the ordinary engine ; and whatever quantity of it acts as a

cushion, is so much towards the filling of the c^'linder at the next stroke.

  We do not require a governor, since the engine contains within itself more than

one principle of self- regulation, which prevents its speed being sensibly altered, even

with extreme variations of resistance.

   It might be supposed that we lose power by centrifugal force, but this is not the
case, since whatever extra force may be necessary, on account of it, during one part

of the stroke, is given out during the other. It affords us one principle of self-regula-

tion ; for if the engine even slightly exceeds the proper speed, the increased centrifugal

force causes the weights to be projected upwards with increased velocity ; but the

waste not having then sufiicient time to escape, the stroke is shortened, and by con-

Asequence the velocity is diminished.   little consideration will show that the con-

sumption of steam is exactly proportioned to the length of stroke, and therefore to
the power of the engine.

   I may take this opportunity of remarking, that the rotary motion is another

source of self-regulation ; for it not only, by means of a fixed excentric, opens the
ports at the proper time after their having been closed by the upward motion of the

weights, but also, by cutting off the steam more rapidly, and diminishing the velo-

city with which the waste escapes, shortens the stroke, and thus reduces the speed

of revolution.

   The slide-valve has two motions quite independent of each other, and yet the con-
trivances by which they are effected are, to a certain degree, connected together. The
fixed excentric opens the ports exactly at the proper time, whenever that may be;
and the upward motion of the weights, in whatever position reused, closes them to
the required extent. These movements, though, as is perceived by the model, so

simple and effective, are the result of long and troublesome experiments.
   The overrunning of the piston at high velocities, was, at first, one of our great dif-

ficulties, but it is now highly advantageous to us. The piston, at high velocities,
moves so rapidly, that the steam, not having time to follow it, is used still more ex-

pansively than in other circumstances.
   The weights are, no doubt, /aZ^intjr bodies, but our velocity is not on that account

limited, since they are in reality bodies which continually fall, and therefore have
their velocity increased till it reaches a maximum, dependent on circumstances.

   The portions of the weights which are at one side of the' centre of motion do not

--counterbalance those at the other. The common centre of gravity of the recipro-

cating masses is lifted through a distance equal to the stroke, and before it can be

again raised by the steam, must, in falling, have given back the force which raised
it, minus that which is destroyed by friction at the axle, and which, from the latter
merely resting, as we have seen, on its bearings, must be inconsiderable.

   At first we experienced much inconvenience from the difficulty of getting the
steam conveniently in and out of the axle, since we were not satisfied with the
arrangements employed with the oscillating engine. But we found that this dif-

--ficulty might be removed, by a valve of great simplicity and which has now been,
--for a considerable time, working most effectively. It has but little friction, because

it is exposed to equal and opposite pressures, and its rubbing surfaces are metallic.
   This engine works equally well in either direction, and may be reversed without

--turning off the steam, by means of a handle seen in the figure over the standard

Q, and a little to the right-hand.

   The details may be varied in a great many ways. The weights may be placed

respectively at the extremities of the piston-rod, trunnions being cast or bolted on
the centre of the cylinder. The weights themselves may act as cylinders, the steam
being transmitted through hollow piston-rods, fixed to the hollow axle. Also a
single cylinder, moving backwards and forwards on a hollow piston-rod, having the

--piston in its centre, and a variety of other modifications may be employed ; but the

form exemplified by the model working at this moment before the Section, has the
advantage of resembling, in almost all its details, the simplest form of the ordinary

engine.

On an Instrument, called the " Upton Draining Tool," as illustrating a prin-
   ciple by which the resistance of Soils to Agricultural Implements may he
  considerably diminished. By A. Milward.

   When we consider the rudeness of the agricultural implements in actual use over

a great part of the country, and the want of fixed principles in the construction of
the more complicated kinds, it may not perhaps be altogether useless to draw atten-
tion to a general cause of resistance to the efficient working of agricultural tools,
and to show how, in the use of a particular tool, that cause of resistance has been

very materially diminished.
    It is not until very recently that the accurate researches of science have been

brought to bear on the practical operations of agriculture. The services of chemistry
have, it is true, been great ; the experiments and energy of Mr. Josiah Parkes and
others have thrown considerable light on the action of water upon soils, and thence
established certain principles of draining ; and skilful mechanics have materially
improved our old implements, and invented many others of very great utility. But
much, nevertheless, remains to be done in determining the nature and extent of some
of those natural causes which it is the business of the farmer to overcome or turn

--to his own advantage. The laws of capillary attraction, the porosity and fineness
-- --of division of different kinds of matter, particularly as connected with the former

subject, the phcenomena of friction and adhesion, have been so little investigated,
that it is impossible to apply them with any exactness, or draw satisfactory conclu-
sions from them. All these subjects are nevertheless intimately connected with the
processes of agriculture ; but it is unfortunately but too true that the ignorance of

practical men, and the indiflFerence of men of science, leave them to undeserved

neglect.

   The cause of resistance, to which I have alluded above, is what I may distinguish
by the name of after resistance, by which I mean resistance arising from the friction
of the after parts of an instrument when dragged through or over the ground. If
we take the case of the common spade, we find that it requires very little force to

cause it to enter an inch into a stiff soil ; but as it descends, the closing of the elastic
soil around it occasions so great a friction and adhesion along the after part of the

tool, that a strong man is soon unable to drive it further. If, on the contrary', the

spade be driven in on the side of an open cutting, the slice of earth cut off falls for-
ward, the after resistance is much diminished, and the facility of working sufficiently
marked. This simple consideration points out to us the utility of providing that
the fore-part of any instrument for penetrating the soil shall as much as possible
detach the soil from the parts around, and so prevent their closing upon the tool and
                                               TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                    123

increasing the after-resistance. The different forms of ploughs, many of which vio-

late this principle, illustrate a remark previously made, that too little attention has

been bestowed on the reasons for agricultural practice. The peculiarity of running

the share of the plough several inches beyond the coulter evidently occasions a loss

of power, because that projecting portion is pressed on every side by the undivided

soil. It is true that an advantage is claimed on the ground of the plough working

more steadily and not tilting up ; but that advantage might be secured without so

unnecessary a waste of power. Again, the varying degree of polish on different

forms of ploughshares shows a variation in the resistance accompanying those

forms, but which has by no means been subjected to careful investigation. In the

case of mould-boards something has been                 done                       but  I  am not aware that    even this
                                                                                ;

subject has been treated in a scientific manner, although eminently suggestive of

such treatment.

The Upton draining tool, it will be perceived, is trough-shaped, or consisting of

two sides united at an angle of 60°, so that its section would be like the letter V.

The spit of earth taken out by such a tool is evidently an equilateral prism, and such

a prism is one of those regular solids which will fill up space, so that the length of
a drain may be meu-ked out into successive prismatic spits of earth fitting against

one another. This consideration suggested the peculiar use of the tool, which I will

presently describe.

Previous draining implements have consisted of two kinds, according as the blade

is plain or curved, and with all of them it has been considered necessary to excavate
the upper part of the drain 10 or 12 inches wide, when a narrower tool is substi-
tuted for the requisite depth beneath. The width actually necessary at the bottom

of a drain for the insertion of draining pipes does not exceed 3 inches, so that the

greater width at the top, if it can be avoided, is only a waste of time and labour.

    It will be found that in the practical use of both the flat and curved tools three
thrusts are made by the workman for every spit of earth withdrawn. In a clay soil,

the adhesion of the spit of earth to the sides of the drain is too strong to allow of

its being forced out without the assistance of lateral thrusts to detach it from the

sides. The workman therefore uses his tool as is represented in plan in fig. 1, where
the black lines show the marks on the surface which are made by the insertion of

the tool, and the Nos. 1, 2, 3 indicate the spits of earth thus successively removed.

What is here done by three thrusts the instrument now described effects by one.

                                               Fig. 1.

The manner in which the instrument is used is represented in plan by fig. 2. Here,

as in the preceding figure, the black lines represent the marks made by the insertion

of the tool                                    and it will be seen that the right and left sides  of  the tool  are placed
                                            J
--124 REPORT 1849.

 alternately against the right and left sides of the drain, the letter h indicating the
  position of the handle.

     The larger tool, the blade of which is 20 or 22 inches in length, will excavate the
 drain to the depth of about 20 to 22 inches, and the smaller tool, which is usually
 longer, will at one stroke increase that depth to Sj feet, or even more. I have had
 the opportunity of seeing a drain excavated by these tools, which was only 4 J inches
 wide at the top, 3 inches at the bottom, and upwards of 5 feet deep. The soil was
 a stiff loam and free from stones, which is necessary to the advantageous use of such
 narrow excavations.

    When a commencement has once been made, the facility of working is remark-
 able ; the tool is pressed down, and the spit of earth detached, with much less exer-

 tion of force than in the case of any other tools. This arises from the spit of earth
 being completely separated from the surrounding soil as the tool descends, so that
 the after-resistance is avoided ; and it is only the fore-part of the tool which has an

 obstacle to overcome. On examining tools which have been some time in use, I

 have found the varnish still remaining after the first few inches, showing that the
 upper or after part was but little subjected to friction.

   A Httle dexterity is requisite in keeping the tool properly along the side of the

drain, and also in withdrawing the spit of earth when cut out. On the latter ac-

 count the tool must be inclined from the perpendicular, as in the case of other drain-

ing tools, and not thrust straight down into the ground. On account of the dimi-

nished resistance, the size and weight of most other draining tools is rendered un-
necessary, and the handles may be constructed of a lighter and cheaper wood.

    The tool which has been described is the invention of one of the Life-members of
the Association, who was led to its adoption from a consideration of the advantages
to be gained by attending to the principle before alluded to, and from a practical
acquaintance with the subject of draining in a country where the soil is compara-
tively free from stones.

                    On an Oil Test. By James Nasmyth.

   The author has contrived an instrument by means of which the comparative value
of various kinds of oil, as lubricating agents, may be ascertained. In all the con-
trivances which have been proposed as oil tests, a most important element has been
left out, viz. time, inasmuch as the evil which is experienced from the use of a bad
quality of oil is only developed after the lapse of several days, when, by the action
of the oil upon the metal with which it is in contact, together with the action of
the air, such oils become viscid, and begin to clog instead of facilitating the move-
ments of the parts of the machinery it was intended to lubricate.

    In the more delicate descriptions of machinery, such as chronometers, watches,
clocks, &c., such a defect as the thickening of the oil by lapse of time is a most
serious evil ; and in examining into the comparative fitness of certain oils for such
applications, if we do not include time as an element in our examination, we shall
be led to form most false conclusions, inasmuch as it is the case that for the first
day or two some kinds of oil (linseed oil for example) perform the lubricating duty
very well, but at the end of the second or third day they become so thick and viscid
as to entirely arrest the motion of the machinery.

   The most valuable quality in an oil intended for the lubrication of machinery is
permanent fluidity. That oil which will for the greatest length of time remain fluid
in contact with the iron or brass is without doubt the most useful for the purpose.
Hence, as before said, the necessity of including the element of time in any experi-
ment on the comparative value of such oils.

   Some idea may be formed of the importance of having the means of arriving at
correct conclusions on this subject, when we know that in some spinning establish-
ments there are upwards of 50,000 spindles in motion at the rate of 4000 or 5000
revolutions per minute ! The slightest defect in the quality of the oil in such a case,
by its becoming viscid, tells in the most serious way upon the quantity of fuel con-
sumed in generating the power required to maintain at this high velocity such a
multitude of moving parts.

   The slight increase of fluidity consequent on the rise of temperature, caused by the
                     TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  125

lighting of the gas in the rooms of a cotton-mill, makes a difference of several horse
power in the duty of the engine of an extensive establishment.

   The oil test consists, as will be seen, of a plate of iron 4 inches wide by 6 feet
long, on the upper surface of which six equal-sized grooves are planed. This plate

--is placed in an inclining position, say 1 inch in 6 feet. The mode of using it is as

follows : Suppose we have six varieties of oil to test, and we are desirous to know
which of them will for the longest time retain its fluidity when in contact with iron
and exposed to the action of the air ; all we have to do is to pour out simultaneously

at the upper end of each incUned groove an equal quantity of each of the oils under
examination. This is very conveniently and correctly done by means of a row of
small brass tubes. The six oils then make a fair start on their race down hill ; some
get ahead the first day, and some keep ahead the second and third day, but on the
fourth or fifth day the truth begins to come out ; the bad oils, whatever good pro-

gress they may have made at the outset, come soon to a stand-still by their gradual
coagulation, while the good oil holds on its course, and at the end of eight or ten
days there is no doubt left as to which is the best ; it speaks for itself, having
distanced its competitors by a long way. Linseed oil, which makes capital progress

the first day, is set fast after having travelled 18 inches, while second-class sperm
beats first-class or refined (?) sperm by 14 inches in nine days, having traversed in
that time 5 feet 8 inches down the hill. The annexed table will show the state of
the oil race after a nine days' run.

it susceptible of small quantities passing through it under light pressure ; this may

be illustrated by what takes place in actual practice in dry meters, and shows the

difference between the wet and the dry meter. The wet meter, a simple wheel or
drum revolving partially in water, without a click, clack or valve ; its passages are

alternately sealed or immersed in water, preventing the possibility of escape of gas
without being registered. The dry meter consists of diai)hragms, valves, levers,
cranks, stuffing-boxes, &c., and may be compared to two or three steam-engines,

the only difference being the diaphragms instead of cj'linders and pistons. In prac-
tice, as may be expected, the valves become defective, and oftentimes allow large

quantities of gas to pass unregistered, and at ail times small quantities, unless when
new and perfectly clean and oiled ; whereas the wet meter, until actually worn out
by time or corrosion, continues to register every particle of gas passing through it.

--These two descriptions, therefore, will serve to illustrate the two kinds of water

meters the one consisting of valves, pistons, &c., the other without, as brought

before the notice of the British Association by the patentee, and in which the press-

ure is put under perfect control before the water enters the body of the meter, and

so limits the supply to a maximum quantity, and thus gets rid of the evil of being

over-driven and derangement. The next question is, how to get a supply to the

upper rooms of a house. No difficulty can occur here if the pressure of water be

always on and sufficient to reach such elevation                                                                                                                                                                                                                     there can be no necessity to mea-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

sure the water before it ascends ; it is only necessary to place the meter at the high-

est point ; the water will of course descend by its own gravity, and supply every room

or closet below, thus ridding this meter of the difficulties which the other had to

contend with, and reducing it to one of easy construction, comparative cheapness,

and not easily deranged. Its durability may be calculated to be as great as that of

Athe gas-meter, which often goes twenty-five and thirty years without repair.

greater durability in this may be looked for, from its always working in pure water,

and from its extreme simplicity; the measuring- wheel or drum being similar to that

in the gas-meter, the regulating apparatus which reduces the pressure to the proper

level, at fixed periods, being accurately measured, and all the parts self-acting ; and
it is supposed that now Water Companies have a fair chance to get paid for all they

sell, it will be to their interest to keep up an uninterrupted supply ; although this

does not prevent the old cistern being supplied by meter, it is evident that a larger

meter would be required. By the new system, the whole apparatus may very con-

veniently be placed inside the house free from the effects of frost, the annoyance

from this and short supplies ; to these advantages may be added the assurance of

justice and equity between buyer and seller.

                    The Sheet-Metal Moulding Machine.

                  By Richard Roberts of Manchester.

This machine, of which a drawing, on a scale of one and a half inch to a foot, was

shown, is furnished with two shafts, which project beyond one of the side-frames,

in which the lower shaft turns ; the upper shaft is mounted on a balance swing*
frame, and is connected by spur gear with the lower shaft, in such a way that the
distance between them may be adjusted to any required extent, without altering the

depth of the wheels in gear. On the projecting ends of these shafts are put the

rollers with which the mouldings are to be formed. The lower roller is generally

in one piece only ; but the upper roller is made in one or more parts transversely,
as may be best adapted to form the required mouldings. These parts are made to

approach each other, by being slid along the shaft, which is hollow, by means of a

screw within, that acts upon the back part of the top roller, by means of a cotter

that passes through the shaft and the screw, and on the front part by means of a

nut, which is screwed from time to time by hand.

The machine is furnished with a third roller, by which it is adapted for giving any

degree of curvature to the mouldings. For some mouldings, two or more pairs of

Whenrollers are used in succession.  two pairs are used, the first pair is to crease

the metal preparatory to its being formed into the required moulding by the second

pair of rollers.

In another drawing, sections of a railway bar or rail, in two stages of raanufac-

ture from the " pile " of iron, were shown. The finished bar differed in shape from
that called the " bridge " form, insomuch that it had additional tlanches on the inner
side, giving it the appearance of a square tube. It was suggested that deep, narrow

girders might be rolled with facility on the above plan.

                On correct Sizing of Toothed Wheels and Pinions.
                     By Richard Roberts of Manchester.

   Although much has been written on this subject, and on the best form of teeth,
there is still much difference of opinion on both points, which difference is not con-
fined to individuals, as it embraces the merabeis of the trade or profession to which

they belong ; for instance, engineers, millwrights, and machinists in general, adopt
the plan of extending the teeth of the pinion and wheel to the same distance beyond
the pitch-line, and the majority of them are agreed as to the best form of teeth,
namely, the cycloid for wheels to work in straight racks, and the epicycloid for
wheels to work in other wheels or in pinions ; they are not, however, so well agreed

respecting the length of the teeth ; whilst the makers of watches, clocks and chro-
nometers, do not extend the teeth of the pinion, beyond the pitch-line, more than

one-half as far as they do the teeth of the wheel : hence the preference given by those
trades to the " bay-leaf" form for the teeth of the pinion, as no other form would
pitch with their sizing.

    Various rules are given in works on horology for sizing wheels and pinions ; but
I believe movement makers generally, English and foreign, use for that purpose an
instrument (called a sector) resembling a two-feet rule, which is divided into equal
parts throughout its length, commencing about half a division from the centre of the
joint. The numbers up to 10 or 12 on the sector are usually subdivided, for the use

of artisans who may prefer pinions a little larger than the corresponding number
on the sector would give.

   Knowing it to be essential to the correct performance of any machine where wheels
and pinions are employed that they should be properly sized, I have thought it might

be useful to parties whose experience on the subject has been more limited than my

own, to be informed i-especting the plan which I have adopted for more than thirty
years for sizing toothed wheels. It has long been the practice in Manchester to make
those wheels which come under the denomination of clockwork with a definite number
of teeth to the inch diameter, taken at the pitch-line, and to distinguish the pitch ac-
cordingly. I have done this, and have adopted the same plan in respect to mill-gear,
substituting the foot for the inch diameter in designating the pitch (naming the pitch
by the number of teeth in afoot diameter), instead of naming it by the distance from
the centre of one tooth to the centre of the next, which is, I believe, the universal
practice, I may here mention, that, in the year 1816, I had a set of change-wheels

made by a factory clockmaker, which were so much out of pitch as to direct my

attention to the cause of the defect ; and having found that the error had arisen
from the defective principle of the sector, I immediately contrived a sector, which

dift'ered from the clockmaker's sector, principally in the joint being adjustable like
that of the proportionable compasses. The use of this kind of joint was to enable
parties to pitch wheels correctly, and to suit themselves as to the depth of the teeth.
After I had sold a number of sectors of this kind, I found that for all ordinary pur-
poses a fixed joint would answer equally well, provided the centre of the joint were

equal to two of the divisions of the sector below zero. This circumstance led me to
make sectors (if serrated bars of brass may be so called) of a cheaper kind, whilst
they were better suited for the workshop. This kind of sector, which I believe is

made by my firm only, has the tenth number at the twelfth division from the start-

ing-point, the two divisions being added for the depth of tooth beyond the pitch-line.
There are two scales on each of these sectors, one on each edge, which scales are
marked according to the number of teeth to the inch diameter (pitch-line) they are
adapted for. These sectors are made in sets, ranging from three to thirty in the inch.

We use one set for sizing working- wheels, and another set for sizing pattern-wheels,

the latter being one per cent, coarser than the former, to compensate for the con-
traction of the metal in cooling. In a patent which I recently took out for improve-
128 REPORT-- 1849.

ments in watches, &c., I included a sector adapted for sizing small wheels and pinions,
by which the calibre (distance between the centres) of the wheels may be found.

  A specimen of the Genevese watch-sector, and one of each of the other sectors

above referred to, were produced ; also a jointed and a straight sector for sizing
mill-gear, both of which had the allowance of two divisions for the length of the
teeth beyond the pitch-line.

                      The Excentric Sheet-Metal and Wire' Gauge.

                     By RiCHAKD Roberts of Manchester,
  A plate of brass, about four inches and five-eighths diameter, and a quarter of an

inch in thickness, is recessed on the upper side to the depth of an eighth of an inch
and diameter of four inches, leaving a margin of five-sixteenths of an inch broad.
In the centre of the recess is a hole, into which is fitted a steel pivot, whose upper
end is riveted into a steel disc three inches and eight-tenths diameter and one-six-
teenth of an inch thick ; the pivot is excentric to the disc one-tenth of an inch, and
consequently one point in the periphery of the disc touches the inner edge of the
brass margin, with which the top of the disc is level. To the under side of the brass
plate a small slide is fitted, to the outer end of which is attached (by screws) a piece
of steel that passes up through a notch in the brass margin about half an inch, and
forms the inner or sliding jaw of the gauge; the outer jaw is formed of a similar
piece of steel, also passed through the notch in the brass margin, and is attached to
the brass plate by screws.

   The inner edge of the sliding jaw is rounded to a radius of one-sixteenth of an
inch, and is kept in contact with the periphery of the excentric disc by t\ spring
(under the disc), which acts against a stud in the slide, projecting through the brass
plate. The margin of the brass plate is divided through one-fourth its circumference,
commencing at the centre of the sliding jaw, into seventy-five equal parts, which
are numbered decimally. The extremity of the disc is then set at zero on the scale,
and the jaws accurately adjusted to touch each other, after which the extremity of
the disc is turned to the tenth division, and a line is made on the disc to correspond
with zero on the scale, at which point the jaws will be open a little. The disc is
turned to the required gauge-Muwiier by means of a milled button or two studs, and
is fixed there by a milled nut, on the end of the pivot below.

   It may be convenient to have the numbers extended from seventy-five on a fourth

of the circumference to one hundred on a third ; but the law of increase in the sizes
above sixty-five would be reversed. It will be obvious that gauges having different
numbers and dimensions may be more suitable for certain descriptions of work, and

hkewise that the excentric principle may be applied to gauges in various ways.

 -- AThe excentric metal gauge possesses the following properties : First. corre-

sponding gauge may be made, without expensive tools, from a written description
of the means employed to make the original. Secondly. It admits of accurate con-
struction and easy readjustment. Thirdly. Each succeeding number being larger

than the preceding in a progressively increasing ratio, adapts the gauge equally well
for high and low numbers.

   N.B. The excentric gauge is not recommended for the workshop, but as a standard
to make and test shop-gauges by.

   Mr. Richard Roberts of Manchester described, by reference to drawings, his patent
apparatus, by which the influx and efflux of the tide are rendered available as agents
for effecting (by hoisting weights for that purpose) the motions of clockwork ; thus,
on a shaft, in connection with the clockwork, or other apparatus requiring motive
power, a chain-wheel (No. 1), provided with studs or projections to prevent the
chain slipping, is made fast ; on a second shaft, which may be in line with the former
one, is a similar chain-wheel (No. 2), also made fast ; over each of the chain-wheels
one side of an endless chain is passed, so as to form a loop on each side the shafts
from a pulley in one of the loops formed by the chain the going-weight is sus-
pended, and from a pulley in the other loop is suspended the counter-weight (the
going-weight being heavy enough to actuate the clockwork and raise the counter-
weight), by which arrangement, if the second shaft be kept stationary, the clock-
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.     129

 work ·will be actuated until the going-weight be run down, to prevent which
 taking place, the influx and efflux of the tide are, b)' means of the following mecha-
 nism, made to rewind the going-weight. Loose on the second shaft are two
 other chain-wheels, provided with clicks, which take alternately into ratchet-wheels
 fast on the shaft. Over one of the last-mentioned chain-wheels a chain is passed,
 which, after passing under a pulley on a stud in the framing, is passed over the
 other chain-wheel, so that both ends of the chain hang on the same side of the shaft.
 To one end of the chain a weight is suspended, heavy enough to wind the going-
 weight before referred to ; to the other end of the chain a hollow weight is attached,
 which is heavy enough to wind its counter-weight and the going-weight. The
hollow weight is suspended in a tank, with which the tide has free ingress and

 egress, except as hereinafter explained.

  --The action of the apparatus is thus ; On the flow of the tide the water rises in

the hollow tank and buoys up the hollow weight, which operation allows the weight
at the other end of the chain to descend, and that weight, by means of the chain-
wheel (No. 3) and ratchet-wheel and click above referred to, turns the second shaft
and chain-wheel (No. 2), and thereby winds the going-weight. With the efflux
of the tide, the hollow weight descends and rewinds its counter-weight, and at the
same time, by means of the chain- wheel (No. 4) and ratchet-wheel and click, turns
the second shaft, which again rewinds the going-weight by means of the chain-
wheel (No. 2).

   As during the descent of the going- weight and ascent of the counter-weight, the
length, and consequently weight, of the chain actuating the clockwork continually

varies, another chain of equal weight per foot is attached, by its extremities, to the
going- and counter- weights, below which it extends, beyond the range of the weights ;
consequently, as the going- and counter-weights descend or ascend, the weight of
chain is diminished as much at one end of the weights as it is increased at the other
by which means the effect of the apparatus is rendered equimotive.

   As the level of high- and low-water will vary considerably at different seasons, it
is evident that some limitation of the height to which spring tides would raise the
going- weight must be effected, insomuch as, unless this were done, the ebbing of
those tides would cause it to be overwound, and the machinerj' damaged. To pre-
vent which the action of the winding apparatus is limited thus : on the orifice through
which communication is made between the tide and the water in the tank, a valve
opening inwardly is placed, which is connected by a cord or chain to one arm of a
lever, whose fulcrum is above the tank, and on the other arm of which a weight,
just sufficient to keep the valve open, is placed ; the weighted arm of the lever is
then attached, by means of a cord (or chain) to the lower end of the going-weight,
the length of the cord being adjusted to cause the going- weight to lift the weighted
arm of the lever and close the valve before the ebbing tide overwinds the going-
weight, the descent of which, by the going of the clock or other mechanism, will

open the valve previous to the returning flow of the tide.

On the Supenorify of Macadamized Roadsfor Streets oflar^ Towns.

                  By J. PiGOTT Smith, Birmingham.

There is a prevalent feeling against the employment of broken stone roads for

streets, because, as they are usually managed, they are the cause of great inconve-

nience to householders and others by the dirt and dust they occasion, and also be-

cause their maintenance and repairs are very expensive, while the draught of vehicles

upon them is verv heavy. The object of this paper is to prove, from long-continued

experience on a large scale, that those objections do not necessarily accompany the

use of such roads. In discussine; this question the interests of two parties must be

--considered: those who principally use the road, the owners and employers of
-- --horses and vehicles, and those who pay for it, the rate-payers, the parties who

would be injured and annoyed if it were unduly expensive or unnecessarily dirty,

dusty and noisy. It is a common error to consider that road the cheapest which

costs the least in direct expenditure. If, however, this so-called cheapest road causes

waste of horse- power, undue wear and tear of horses and vehicles, loss of time by

being unfit for rapid transit, and occasions loss to the inhabitants by filling their

130 REPORT-- 1849.

dwellings with dust and covering their clothes with dirt, it is evident that such a

road is reallj' very dear. There is an apparent diversity of interest between these

who use and those who pay for our public streets ; as the principal loss from bad

roads falls directly upon those who keep or employ horses and vehicles, while the

Aexpense of road repairs falls upon the inhabitants generally.                             little consideration,

however, will show that this diversity of interest is more apparent than real. It is

the interest of all that there should be easy, safe and cheap means of transit through

the public streets ; and any increase in the cost of transit is a source of indirect
expense even to those who have no horses of their own, as it must add to the cost

of everything carried through the streets, and of all hired vehicles, and of all the

numberless conveniences which accompany residence in a large town. It must also

be remembered that it is very wasteful to allow a road to go out of repair, since it

is less costly to keep a road up than to restore it. That roadway is best for the

owner or user of a horse or vehicle which can be travelled over most easily, safely,

quickly, and cheaply ; and that ease, safety, speed and reconomy are to be obtained

by having the road firm, even and smooth, and perfectly free from mud or dust, or

any form of unattached materials. It is evident that the same qualities will render

the roadway most free from noise, dirt and dust, the three great causes of annoy-

ance and injury to the inhabitants of all ordinary streets. The question which re-

mains to be considered is, whether the advantages of good roads to the inhabitants

generally are worth their cost ? If the question had to be decided in accordance

with the interest of the users and owners of horses merely, no doubt whatever would

be entertained. Of whatever nature the surface of a road is to be, it is essential

that its foundation should be of firm material, well consolidated, and perfectly

drained ; if not, the crust becomes loosened and destroyed, the road is rough and

uneven, and wears into holes and ruts. Having obtained a good foundation, the

next point is to cover it with a hard, compact crust, impervious to water, and laid

to a proper cross section. The stones must be broken to one regular size, well

raked in, and fixed by a binding composed of the grit collected in wet weather by

the sweeping machines and preserved for this purpose. This binding must be laid

on regularly, and watered until the new material is firmly set, which it will do very

quickly and with the regularity of a well-laid pavement.' The sharp angles of the

stones are preserved, and there is both great saving of material and a firmer crust

--formed than by the common method of leaving the material to work into its place

without the use of binding, in which case the angles of the stones are worn off and

reduced to powder, and at least one-third of the material is wasted in forming a

binding in which the stones may set. By the improved method, the binding is formed

of material that would otherwise be useless. Many road-makers object to the use

of binding, on the ground that the road is rendered rotten by it, and that when the

road is set it has to be carted away again. This is apt to be the case under bad

management, and when ordinary soil is used, the fine particles of which work it into
mud and keep the road from setting firmly. But the coarse grit obtained by the

sweeping-machine off the roads is the very same material as is produced by wearing
away the angles of the stones, and when judiciously applied to a new coating it will

speedily become as well consolidated and firm as an old road. In the common me-

thod, not only is there great waste of material, but the loose stones occasion delay

by their resistance, great fatigue to the horses and danger to their feet, while the

noise produced by their grinding together is annoying to the inhabitants. Upon

the improved method the inconveniences of road repair are incomparably less than

those of pavement. Both recoating and repairs may be made without stopping the

traffic. Under no circumstances must any imperfection of surface be allowed. If

a hollow be not immediately stopped, it very quickly extends over the surface. All

loose stones should be carefully picked, as every loose stone passed over by heavily

laden carriages, if not ground to powder, breaks the crust of the road, and if water

be permitted to lodge on the surface it will cause great mischief. It is the neglect

of these essential precautions that has led many to consider macadamized roads ex-
pensive. They are expensive if neglected. Oii a well-made road heavy showers do

good,  by  cleansing  them                            so  also  does artificial  watering  if the road  be  clean or
                                                   ;

Aswept quickly after it is watered.                             road which is perfectly dry loses its tenacity

and the surface grinds into dust ; whence the oeconomy of judicious watering in hot

weather, which preserves the road as well as prevents the annoyance of dust. The

practice so common in London and elsewhere of heavy watering a dirty road with-

out cleansing it, and thereby converting the dust into mud, is very injurious to the
-- Aroad, and merely changes one nuisance into another, dust into mud.
                                                                        great

source of waste, both to those who use and to those who repair a road, is to allow

it to be dirty. The draught on a dirty road is twice as heavy as on a clean one,

that is, a horse must exert double force to draw his load with the same speed. The

cost, however, of employing double force is so great, that the expedient of diminish-

--ing the speed is generally adopted, as a horse can exert greater pulling force at a

slower pace, less power being required to carry his own body. It often happens

that the extra resistance occasioned by dirt diminishes the speed one-fifth or one-

fourth. The eflfect of the dirt, therefore, is to increase the work by twenty or twenty-

five per cent. It will easily be believed that such a waste far exceeds the cost of the

most perfect cleansing. This is the case when cleansing is done by scrapers (the

greatest enemy a macadamized road has to contend against). By their use the stones

are dragged from their places, and the adhesive dirt is not effectually taken away.

Sweeping is the only mode of cleansing that should be allowed, either on streets or

on turnpike roads. Sweeping by the wide brooms of Mr. Whitworth's machine is

preferable to all other modes of cleansing yet tried. It must be evident, that the

fact of these wide brooms sweeping longitudinally, with a pressure that can be ad-

justed according to circumstances, tends powerfully to preserve the road and to con-

solidate its surface. They press most upon the ridges, and least upon the hollows,

Whenthus tending to reduce the former, and fill up the latter.  the dirt is stiff and

adheres firmly to the stones, it should first be well-watered, when it may be com-

pletely removed bjr the machine, without disturbing the crust, leaving the surface

firm and compact. The use of water for this purpose has been objected to by high

authorities, on the ground that it does remove the useful grit ; but the contrary has

been proved by ample experience. I have found that the use of the sweeping-

machines, with the proper employment of water, has reduced the amount of mate-

rial required for the repair of roads in Birmingham one- third, namely, from about

20,000 to 13,000 cubic yards. The first-named amount is the average for seven

years preceding the introduction of the machines, the latter of the three years sub-

sequent. I communicated these details to a friend in London, and he determined to

test their correctness. The following is the result of bis experiment, to settle whe-

ther useful grit was or was not removed by water and machine-sweeping. On the

22nd of March last, the Quadrant, Regent Street, was covered with a thick layer of

dirt, which was causing great annoj'ance as well as injury to the road, but could

not be removed by scraping without removing also much of the new stone, to which

it adhered. It was determined to sweep half of it dry, and half after proper water-

ing. This was done, and the sweepings removed were washed, to separate the refuse

from the stony matter mingled with it. One-third part of that which was taken

dry consisted of coarse grit, which would have been useful on the road ; one-twelfth
part only of tha': which was removed in the form of slop was stony matter ; and

that was so completely pulverized as to be of scarcely any use ; it had done its

work. After the two portions of the road had been cleansed, the difference between

them was very striking. That which was swept dry was still covered with adhesive

matter, which was lifted by the wheels, together with the stones to which it ad-

hered, the whole road being rough and uneven ; the portion which had been swept

with water was perfectly even and smooth. On the 24th both portions were swept,

but only one quarter as much dirt was taken from that which had been water-swept
as from the other. On the 26th it rained, and three times as much slop was taken
off the part of the road which had not been water swept on the 22nd. The preser-

vative effect of water machine-sweeping was most evident by the decidedly better
condition of that portion of the road cleansed in this effective manner. The great

objection urged against macadamized roads for streets is the annoyance by dust and

dirt which they occasion, and many persons prefer submitting to the deafening

noise of pavement in order to avoid these ; but this would not be the case if water

and machine-cleansing was adopted, the cost of which would be saved in diminished

wear and tear. The entire cost of cleansing and watering Birmingham is about

5000i. per annum, or about one penny per week for each house, or half a farthing
                                                                                      9*

per week for each of its inhabitants. It has been objected to macamadized roads
that the draught upon them is heavier than upon pavement ; and with carriages
altogether similar this is the case, and especially so with vehicles travelling slowly.
But it must be remembered that the proportion of the draught is only one of the
circumstances by which the labour of the horse is to be estimated. Another very
important consideration is the surface which gives tlie horse the safest footing; and
his footing on pavement is so much less secure than upon a good broken stone road,
that he does not receive the full advantage of the smaller draught. Again, carriages

-- --especially those travelling quickly are exposed to much more violent concussions

upon pavement than upon a smooth macadamized road : consequently, not only
must the carriages be stronger and therefore heavier, but the increased frequency
and violence of the concussions consume a larger portion of power, which goes far
to counterbalance the diminished friction. There can be no doubt that the wear and
tear of both horses and vehicles is far greater upon pavement than upon mac-
adamized roads. In reckoning the real cost of a road, all expenses attending its
use should be calculated ; and if this were done, pavement would be perceived to be
exceedingly expensive. Carriages roll so smoothly over a well-maintained mac-
adamized road, ard horses are so little injured either by falls or strains, that I con-
ceive the wear and tear upon them is not half of what it is on pavement.

    On a 3Iethod of supplying the Boilers of Steam-Engines with Water.

                               By W. Sykes Ward.

   Mr. Ward's suggestion was to use a small supplementary pumping-engine, having
a working cylinder with valves so arranged that the piston may be put in motion by
either steam or water passing through it, to be supplied with steam bv a steam-
pipe, the entrance to which is somewhat narrow, and inserted in the boiler to be
supplied a little above the level at which it is desired to maintain the water therein.
Such aperture should also be about the centre of a marine boiler. The working
cylinder should be attached to a pump of such size as to be easily worked by the
pressure of the steam. The exit-pipe of the steam-cylinder must communicate with
the inlet-pipe of the pump, so that if the cylinder be actuated by steam, the steam
will be condensed, and its heat communicated to the water to be supplied to the
boiler ; or if the working cylinder be worked by water proceeding from the boiler, a
considerable part of such hot water will be returned by the pump. The mode of
operation of such apparatus will be, that whenever there is a working pressure of
steam in the boiler, the apparatus will be in action ; but if the level of the water be
below the aperture of the small steam-pipe, the action will be moderately rapid, and
a supply of water be pumped into the boiler ; and when the water in the boiler rises
to the aperture, this being small, will be as though choked by the water, which will
be forced through the working-cylinder, moving the piston and pump very slowly
a portion of the water thus escaping from the boiler will be returned by the pump.
Such last-mentioned action cannot continue long, inasmuch as the level of the water
must be reduced ; therefore the average level of the water in the boiler will be, with
slight oscillations, maintained at the height of the aperture of the steam-pipe.

      On Chain Pipes for Subaqueous Telegraphs. By F. Whishaw.

    Three links of a full-sized pipe, for enclosing the wires of electric telegraphs in
crossing rivers, &c., were laid before the Section. As the title implies, the pipe is

formed by so many links connected together by sockets. Each link varies, accord-
ing to circumstances, from 18 inches to 24 inches in length, and from 1 inch
to 2^ inches internal diameter, according to the number of wires to be enclosed.
These pipes, being of wrought iron, are exceedingly strong, and are required merely
as a protection to the wires, which are previously insulated by means of gutta
percha. Pipes of somewhat similar construction are laid under the Rhine and other
rivers in Prussia, where the underground system of telegraph is adopted by the
Prussian government (already to the extent of 120!) miles), although many of the
railway companies suspend the wires between posts, as practised in England,

America, France, &c.

On the Present State of Electro- Telegraphic Communication in England,
                Prussia, and America. By F. Whishaw.

Mr. Whishaw stated that the object of his present communication was not to

bring before the Section the numerous telegraphic instruments now in use and re-
cently made public, but to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the three

great systems of electric telegraphs now in operation in England, Prussia and Ame-

rica. In England, the wires, being suspended from post to post along the sides of

--railways, are exposed to the following disadvantages running of trains off the lines,

by which posts and wires are all carried away together, and thus the communica-

tion is stopped. Secondly, from atmospheric influences, whereby irregular and un-

certain deflections of the needles in Cooke and Wheatstone's telegraphic instruments

take place, besides occasional destruction to parts of the instruments, &c. Thirdly,

from snow-storms, as in the case of the South-Eastern telegraph which occurred

during the last winter, when the wires and posts were all removed, and considerable

interruption was caused in the transmission of communications. Fourthly, from

damage by malicious persons, who sometimes twist the wires together ; and for
whose apprehension rewards have frequently been offered by the English companies.

Fifthly, the wires have sometimes been connected together by a fine wire nicely

soldered to the line wires, and thus the communications have been diverted from

their right channel. Sixthly, the expense, viz. 150L a mile, for the above-ground

system, with an annual expenditure for repairs. Seventhly, and consequently, heavy

chargesfor the transmission of messages. Eighthly, the time required in learning per-

fectly the manipulations of the needle telegraph, so that if a telegraphist is from any

cause disabled, there is no one at hand to take his place. With regard to the charges,

the following facts will suffice to show the advantages of oeconomical telegraphs.

In America, the charge for twenty words transmitted by the telegraph to the distance

of 500 miles is but 4s. ; whereas by the English company's charges the same com-

munication would only be transmitted 60 miles, or less than one-eighth the distance,

and by the South-Eastern Company's charges not 20 miles, or one-twenty-fifth

of the 500 miles. Again, a communication of ninety words in America may be
transmitted from Washington to New Orleans, 1716 miles, for 41s. 8cZ. ; whereas

by the Electric Telegraph Company's charges it would only be transmitted a little

more than 200 miles, and by the South-Eastern Company's scale under 100 miles.

The extent of telegraphs in Great Britain at present is about 2000 miles ; and there
yet remain railways to an equal extent without telegraphs. Mr. Whishaw expressed

a hope that within a short time every principal town in the kingdom would be con-

nected by telegraph, as the underground system may be effected without the aid of

railways, viz. under turnpike-roads and towing-palhs, &c. This plan has been

practically carried out in Prussia, where at the present time there are 319 German

Amiles=1492'92 English miles in actual operation.    single wire coated with gutta

percha is laid under the railway at a depth of two feet, and connected with the in-

Astruments and batteries at the different stations.  colloquial and also a printing

--telegraph are used in each principal station both worked as required by the single

wire. 'The experiment as to burying the gutta percha v^ire in the ground was com-

menced some years ago, and being found to answer perfectly, the Prussian Telegraph

Commissioners appointed in 1844 determined on adopting the underground plan

entirely for the government telegraphs, which were commenced in July 1848, so

that no time has been lost in carrying them out. At Oderberg, the Prussian system

is in connexion with the telegraphic line now in course of construction between

that place and Trieste via Vienna ; and as regards the Prussian Government Tele-

graphs, the public has the advantage of them by payment of certain fixed rates.

The cost of the Prussian system is under 40^ a mile. The American system is re-

markable for the great extent to which it is already carried, viz. 10,511 miles, cost-

ing less than 20^. a mile. It consists of a single iron wire supported from post to

post, but is carried far beyond the limits of railways, and is consequently frequently

damaged, so that a code of rules is established for the repair of the wires, which is

undertaken by gentlemen living along the lines, and who are furnished with a set of
tools for the purpose, their reward being the free use of the telegraphs for their own

private communications. The reconoray of first cost, however, causes a vei y

low tariff for the transmission of communications, so that the poorest person is
enabled for a few cents to send a communication to a considerable distance. From
the actual operations of the three sj'stems, it appears that the Prussian is the most
simple, effective and oeconomical, for annual repairs are not required to the line

wires, as in the cases of England and America, where they are exposed to so many

casualties.

  --On Kosman's Patent Cistern as a Sanitary Machine. By Wood.

   Mr. Wood observed that the great object of this apparatus was to cause a simul-

taneous flow of water from the respective houses of each street, by which a thorough
cleansing from the source of deposits may be obtained. The cistern is so contrived
that it may be caused by a self-acting valve to discharge a periodical flow of water
through the drains of the house, which, combining with a similar simultaneous dis-
charge from the other houses, would sweep the sewers clean every three or four
days or more, as may be found desirable. The advantage is considered to be, that
instead of stagnant collections of soil, we have a perfectly fluid and attenuated flow
at short intervals, easily carried off by the waters of a river and leaving nothing be-
hind. The cistern is divided into two unequal parts : the larger part for domestic
purposes, the smaller part to discharge its contents into the drain suddenly and with
great force through a large pipe, which operation is accomplished by the means of
a chain which is attached to the arm of the ball and to the valve at the bottom of
the cistern.
