arrangement dating from 1871, the acceptance of Memoirs, and the days on which

they are to be read, are now as far as possible determined by Organizing Committees
for the several Sections befoi-e the beginning of the Meeting. It has therefore become

necessary, in order to give an opportunity to the Committees of doing justice to the
several Communications, that each Author should prepare an Abstract of his Memoir,

of a length suitable for insertion in tlie published Transactions of the Association,

--and that he should send it, together with the original Memoir, by book-post, on or
before  , addressed thus 'General Secretaries, British Associa-

venient to the Author that his paper should be read on any particular days, he is

requested to send information thereof to the Secretaries in a separate note. Authors

who send in their MSS. three complete weeks before the Meeting, and whose papers

are accepted, will be furnished, before the Meeting, with printed copies of their

the President of the Committee thinks expedient, but shall, under any
circumstances, meet on the first Wednesday of the Annual Meeting, at
11 A.M., to nominate the fii'st members of the Sectional Committee, if
they shall consider it expedient to do so, and to settle the terms of their
report to the General Committee, after which their functions as an
Organizing Committee shall cease.'

                      Constitution of the Sectional Committees.'^

     On the first day of the Annual Meeting, the President, Vice-Presi-

dents, and Secretaries of each Section having been appointed by the
General Committee, these Officers, and those previous Presidents and

Vice-Presidents of the Section who may desire to attend, are to meet, at

2 P.M., in their Committee Rooms, and enlarge the Sectional Committees

by selecting individuals from among the Members (not Associates) present
at the Meeting whose assistance they may particularly desire. The Sec-
tional Committees thus constituted shall have power to add to their
number from day to day.

     The List thus formed is to be entei'ed daily in the Sectional Minute-
Book, and a copy forwarded without delay to the Printer, who is charged
with publishing the same before 8 a.m. on the next day in the Journal of

the Sectional Proceedin-g"&s·-.

following Thursday, Friday, Saturday,^ Monday, and Tuesday, from 10 to

11 A.M., punctually, for the objects stated in the Rules of the Association,
and specified below.

     The business is to be conducted in the following manner :
       1. The President shall call on the Secretary to read the minutes of
                 the previous Meeting of the Committee.

      2 No paper shall be read until it has been formally accepted by the

                 Committee of the Section, and entered on the minutes accord-

       3. Papers which have been reported on unfavourably by the Organiz-
                 ing Committees shall not be brought before the Sectional

                  Committees.*

     At the first meeting, one of the Secretaries will read the Minutes of
last year's proceedings, as recorded in the Minute-Book, and the Synopsis
of Recommendations adopted at the last Meeting of the Association and

printed in the last volume of the Transactions. He will next proceed to

read the Report of the Organizing Committee.^ The list of Communi-
cations to be read on Thursday shall be then arranged, and the general
distribution of business throughout the week shall be provisionally ap-
pointed. At the close of the Committee Meeting the Secretaries shall
forward to the Printer a List of the Papers appointed to be read. The
Printer is charged with publishing the same before 8 A.M. on Thursday in

On the second day of the Annual Meeting, and the following days,

the Secretaries are to correct, on a copy of the Journal, the list of papers

which have been read on that day, to add to it a list of those appointed

to be read on the next day, and to send this copy of the Journal as early

in the day as possible to the Printer, who is charged with printing the

same before 8 a.m. next morning in the Journal. It is necessary that one

of the Secretaries of each Section (generally the Recorder) should call
at the Printing Office and revise the proof each evening.

Minutes of the proceedings of every Committee are to be entered daily

in the Minute-Book, which should be confirmed at the next meeting of

the Committee.

Lists of the Reports and Memoirs read in the Sections are to be entered

in the Minute-Book daily, which, with all Memoirs and Copies or Abstracts

of Memoirs furnished by Authors, are to be forwarded, at the close of the Sec-
tional Meetings, to the Secretary.

     The Vice-Presidents and Secretaries of Sections become ex officio tem-
porary Members of the General Committee (vide p. xxix), and will receive

on application to the Treasurer in the Reception Room, Tickets entitling
them to attend its Meetings.

    The Committees will take into consideration any suggestions which may

be offered by their Members for the advancement of Science. They are

specially requested to review the recommendations adopted at precedinc

Meetings, as published in the volumes of the Association and the com-

munications made to the Sections at this Meeting, for the purposes of

selecting definite points of research to which individual or combined

exertion may be usefully directed, and branches of knowledge on the

state and progress of which Reports are wanted ; to name individuals or

Committees for the execution of such  Reports or researches                                                                                                   and to state

whether, and to what degree, these objects may be usefully advanced by

the appropriation of the funds of the Association, by application to

Government, Philosophical Institutions, or Local Authorities.

     In case of appointment of Committees for special objects of Science
it is expedient that all Members of the Committee should be named, and
one of them appointed to act as Secretary, for insuring attention to business.

     Committees have power to add to their number persons whose assist-

ance they may require.

     The recommendations adopted by the Committees of Sections are to
be registered in the Forms furnished to their Secretaries, and one Copy of

each is to be forwarded, without delay, to the Secretary for presentation

to the Committee of Recommendations. Unless this be do7ie, the Recom-

--mendations cannot receive the sanction of the Association.
    N.B. Recommendations which may originate in any one of the Sec-

tions must first be sanctioned by the Committee of that Section before they
can be referred to the Committee of Recommendations or confirmed by
the General Committee.

     The Committees of the Sections shall ascertain whether a Report has

been made by every Committee appointed at the previous Meeting to whom

a sum of money has been granted, and shall report to the Committee of
Recommendations in every case where no such Report has been received.'

Grants of money sanctioned at any one Meeting of the Association

expire a week before the opening of the ensuing Sleeting; nor is the

Treasurer authorized, after that date, to allow any claims on account of

such grants, unless they be renewed in the original or a modified form by

the General Committee.

No Committee shall raise money in the name or under the auspices of

the British Association without special permission from the General Com-

mittee to do so ; and no money so raised shall be expended except in

London, W.C., for such portion of the sums granted as may from time to

time be required.

In grants of money to Committees, the Association does not contem-

plate the payment of personal expenses to the members.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

Be;port of the Council for the year 1885-86, presented to the General
            Committee at Birmingham, on Wednesday, September 1, 1886.

The Council have received reports during the past year from the
General Treasurer, and his account for the year will be laid before the
General Committee this day.

     Since the Meeting at Aberdeen the following have been elected

--Corresponding Members of the Association :

Professor Putnam.  I Dr. Max Schuster.
Rev. Dr. Renard.
                          M. Jules Vuylsteke.

                   |

    As Professor Huxley was unable to accept the office of a Vice-President

for the present meeting, the Council have nominated in his stead Professor
Stokes, Pres.R.S.

     The Council have received a letter from Sir Charles Tapper, Hio'h
Commissioner for the Dominion of Canada, enclosing important com-
munications from the Government of that Dominion, in reference to the
record and preservation from obliteration of such traces as still remain
of tbe indigenous characteristics of the native races of America, which
subject, the General Committee will recollect, was mentioned in the
Report of the Council at the Aberdeen Meeting. Copies of this corre-
spondence will be communicated to the Sections interested in the subject.

     Invitations have been received from Bath and from Sydney for the
year 1888 ; and the invitation from Melbourne, given at Montreal, has
been renewed.

     The following resolutions were referred by the General Committee to
the Council for consideration, and action if desirable :

     (a) ' That the Council be requested to consider the desirability of
admitting ladies as OiEcers of the Association, or as Members of the
General or Sectional Committees.'

     The Council, after careful consideration of the question, are of opinion
that the time has not yet come when it would be for the advantage of the
Association to depart from the established custom.

     (l) 'That the Council be requested to consider the advisability of
rendering the special Reports of the Association more accessible to the
scientific public by placing them on sale in separate form.'

     (c) ' That the printed Reports on Special Subjects be offered for sale
to the general public at the time of the Meeting, or as soon afterwards as

possible.'

     There are several matters of detail, requiring careful consideration, in
the subject of these two resolutions, and the Council, owing to exceptional
circumstances during the past year, have not been able to come to a

decision regarding them. They recommend that the question should be

referred to the next Council.

                                                                                           d2
        ----

Ixviii  --REPORT 1886.

     (fZ) ' That the Council be requested to so modify the Rules of the
Association as to permit of a Sectional Meeting being held at an earlier
hour than eleven, and the Sectional Committee previously, due notice
being given to the Section on the previous day.'

     The Council have considered this recommendation, and think it un-

desirable to alter the general rules, the resolution passed at Southport
three years ago meeting the particular case of Saturday.

     (e) ' That a memorial be presented to H.M. Government requesting
them to enlarge the existing Agricultural Department of the Privy Council,

with the view of concentrating all administrative functions relating to
Agriculture in one fully equipped Board and Department of Agriculture.'

     The Council, after a full consideration of this difficult and intricate
question, are not at present prepared to memorialise the Government on
the subject of the enlargement of the Agricultural Department of the

Privy Council.

      (/) ' That the Council be requested to consider and take steps, if they
think it desirable, to memorialise the Government to undertake the more
systematic collection and annual publication of Statistics of Wages, and a

periodical industrial census.'

     The Council, in view of the recent promise of the late President of the
Board of Trade in Parliament as to the collection of Statistics of Wages,
are of opinion that it is inexpedient at present to memorialise H.M.
Government on the subject, but they empowered a committee of their
members to communicate, if necessary, with the Department engaged in
the collection of Statistics of Wages, with the view of eliciting informa-
tion as to the method proposed to be employed, and to make such sug-

gestions as appear to be expedient.

     (g) ' That a memorial be presented to H.M. Government in favour

of the establishment of a National School of Forestry.'

   A Committee was appointed to consider this subject, but has made no

report to the Council.

     The General Committee will remember that the question of the feasi-
bility of instituting a scheme for promoting an International Scientific
Congress, described in the Report of the Council presented at Aberdeen,
was in effect referred back to the Council to consider whether it would be
possible to devise such a scheme. The question has been further con-
sidered during the past year, and the Council are of opinion that the
difficulties and objections foreseen by several members of the Association
have not been met in any of the communications which have been laid
before them, and are, in their judgment, so great that they cannot at
present recommend any further steps being taken in the matter.

     In accordance with the regulations the five retiring Lfembers of the
Council will be

Mr, J. W. L. Glaisher.     Dr. H. C. Sorby.
Professor T. McK. Hughes.
                           D. W. H. Perkin.

        Mr. J. F. La Trobe Bateman

     The Council recommend the re-election of the other ordinary Members
of Council, with the addition of the gentlemen whose names are distin-
guished by an asterisk in the following list :

                                                      PRESIDENT.

Twenty-one years have passed away since the last meeting of the British

Association in this great central city of England. At the third Birming-

-- --hana meeting that of 1865 I had the pleasure of being present, and had

the honour of being one of the Vice-Presidents of Section C. At that

meeting my friend John Phillips, one of the founders of the Association,

occupied the Presidential chair, and I cannot better introduce what I

--have to say this evening than by the eloquent words in which he then

addressed you : ' Assembled for the third time in this busy centre of

industrious England, amid the roar of engines and clang of hammers

where the strongest powers of nature are trained to work in the fairy

chains of art, how softly and fittingly falls upon the ear the accent of

Science, the friend of that art, and the guide of that industry ! Here

where Priestley analysed the air, and Watt obtained the mastery over

steam, it well becomes the students of nature to gather round the stan-

dard which they carried so far into the fields of knowledge. And when on

other occasions we meet in quiet colleges and academic halls, how gladly

welcome is the union of fresh discoveries and new inventions with the

solid and venerable truths which are there treasured and taught. Long

may such union last                                                                                           the fair alliance of cultivated thought and  practical
                                                                                                           ;

skill                      for by it labour is dignified and science fertilised, and the condition
                        ;

of human society exalted.' These were the words of a man who, while

earnest in the pursuit of science, was full of broad and kindly sympathy for

his fellow-men, and of hopeful confidence in the future. "We have but to
turn to the twenty Reports of this Association, issued since 1865, to see

 --aciiieved. In one department alone that to which my predecessor in this

  chair so eloquently adverted in Aberdeen, the department of education in

 --science how much has been accomplished since 1865. Phillips himself

 lived to see a great revolution in this respect at Oxford. But no one in
  1865 could have anticipated that immense development of local schools of
 science of which your own Mason College and your admirable technical,
 industrial, and art schools are eminent examples. Based on the general
 education given by the new system of Board schools, with which the

 name of the late W. E. Forster will ever be honourably connected, and

 extending its influence upward to special training and to the highest
 university examinations, this new scientific culture is opening paths of

 honourable ambition to the men and women of England scarcely dreamed of
 in 1865. I sympathise with the earnest appeal of Sir Lyon Playfair, in his

 Aberdeen address, in favour of scientific education ; but visiting England

 at rare intervals, I am naturally more impressed with the progress that
 has been made than with the vexatious delays which have occurred, and am

 perhaps better able to appreciate the vast strides that have been taken
 in the direction of that complete and all-pervading culture in science
 which he has so ably advocated.

     No one could have anticipated twenty years ago that a Birmingham

 manufacturer, in whose youthful days there were no schools of science-
for the people, was about to endow a college, not only worthy of
this great city, but one of its brightest oi'naments.' Nor could any-
 one have foreseen the great development of local scientific societies, like

your Midland Institute and Philosophical Society, which are now
flourishing in every large town and in many of those of less magnitude..

 The period of twenty-one years that has elapsed since the last Birming-

ham meeting has also been an era of public museums and laboratories

for the teaching of science, from the magnificent national institutions at
South Kensington and those of the great universities and their colleges,

down to those of the schools and field clubs in country towns. It has besides
been an era of gigantic progress in original work and in publication,.

--a progress so rapid that workers in every branch of study have been

reluctantly obliged to narrow in more and more their range of reading and
of efibrt to keep abreast of the advance in their several departments.
Lastly these twenty-one years have been characterised as the ' coming of
age ' of that great system of philosophy with which the names of three
Englishmen, Darwin, Spencer, and Wallace, are associated as its founders.

Whatever opinions one may entertain as to the safiiciency and finality of

this philosophy there can be no question as to its infiuence on scientific

thought. On the one hand it is inaccurate to compare it with so entirely

diS'erent things as the discovery of the chemical elements and of the law
of gravitation ; on the other, it is scarcely fair to characterise it as a .

mere ' confused development ' of the mind of the age. It is indeed a new

attempt of science in its maturer years to grapple with those mysterious
questions of origins which occupied it in the days of its infancy, and

it is to be hoped that it may not, like the Titans of ancient fable, be

hurled back from heaven, or like the first mother find the knowledge

to which it aspires a bitter thing. In any case we should fully under-
stand the responsibility which we incur when in these times of full-grown

science we venture to deal with the great problem of origins, and should
be prepared to find that in this field the new philosophy, like those which
have preceded it, may meet with very imperfect success. The agita-

tion of these subjects has already brought science into close relations,
sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, it is to be hoped in the end help-

ful, with those great and awful questions of the ultimate destiny of

humanity, and its relations to its Creator, which must always be nearer

to the human heart than any of the achievements of science on its own

ground. In entering on such questions we should proceed with caution

and reverence, feeling that we are on holy ground, and that though, like
Moses of old, we may be armed with all the learning of our time, we are in

the presence of that which while it burns is not consumed ; of a mystery

which neither observation, experiment, nor induction can ever fully solve.

     In a recent address, the late President of the Royal Society called

attention to the fact that within the lifetime of the older men of science

of the present day, the greater part of the vast body of knowledge

included in the modern sciences of physics, chemistry, biology, and

geology, has been accumulated, and the most important advances

made in its application to such common and familiar things as the rail-

way, ocean navigation, the electric telegraph, electric lighting, the tele-

phone, the germ theory of disease, the use of anesthetics, the processes

of metallurgy, and the dyeing of fabrics. Even since the last meeting

in this city, much of this great work has been done, and has led to
general results of the most marvellous kind. What at that time could

have appeared more chimerical than the opening up by the enterprise of

one British colony of a shorter road to the East by way of the extreme

west, realising what was happily called by Milton and Cheadle ' the

new North-west Passage,' making Japan the next neighbour of Canada

on the west, and ofiering to Britain a new way to her Eastern pos-

sessions                                     or than  the  possibility of this Association holding  a  successful

meeting on the other side of the Atlantic ? To have ventured to predict

such things in 1865, would have appeared quite visionary, yet we are

now invited to meet in Australia, and may proceed thither by the

Canadian Pacific Railway and its new lines of steamers, returning by

the Suez Canal.* To-day this is quite as feasible as the Canadian

visit would have been in 1865. It is science that has thus brought the once

widely separated parts of the world nearer to each other, and is breaking

down those geographical barriers which have separated the different por-

tions of our widely extended British race. Its work in this is not yet

complete. Its goal to-day is its starting-point to-morrow. It is as far
as at any previous time from seeing the limit of its conquests, and every

victory gained is but the opening of the way for a farther advance.
    By its visit to Canada the British Association has asserted its imperial

character, and has consolidated the scientific interests of Her Majesty's

dominions, in advance of that great gathering of the industrial products

of all parts of the empire now on exhibition in London, and in advance of

any political plans of Imperial fedei'ation.' There has even been a project

before us for an international scientific convention, in which the great

English republic of America shall take part, a project the realisation of
which was to some extent anticipated in the fusion of the members of the

British and American Associations at Montreal and Philadelphia in 1884.

As a Canadian, as a past President of the American Association, and now

honoured with the Presidency of this Association, I may be held to repre-

mysent in  own person this scientific union of the British Islands, of

the various Colonies, and of the great Republic, which, whatever the

difficulties attending its formal accomplishment at present, is certain

to lead to an actual and real union for scientific work. In further-

ance of this I am glad to see here to-day influential representatives

of most of the British Colonies, of India, and of the United States.

We welcome here also delegates from other countries, and though the

barrier of language may at present prevent a larger union, we may enter-

tain the hope that Britain, America, India, and the Colonies, working

together in the interest of science, may ultimately render our English

tongue the most general vehicle of scientific thought and discovery, a

consummation of which I think there are, at present, many indica-

tions.

     But, while science marches on from victory to victory, its path is

marked by the resting-places of those who have fought its battles and
assured its advance. In looking back to 1865 there rise before me the

once familiar countenances of Phillips, Murchison, Lyell, Forbes, Jeffreys,

Jukes, Rolleston, Miller, Spottiswoode, Fairbairn, Gassiot, Carpenter, and

a host of others, present in full vigour at that meeting, but no more with
us. These were veterans of science ; but, alas ! many then young and

rising in fame are also numbered with the dead. It may be that before
another Birmingham meeting many of us, the older members now, will
also have passed away. But these men have left behind them ineffaceable
monuments of their work, in which they still survive, and we rejoice to
believe that, though dead to us, they live in that company of the great and

Economics, which was one of the results of the Montreal meeting.

good of all ages who have entered into that unseen universe where all

that is high and holy and beautiful must go on accumulating till the time
of the restitution of all things. Let us follow their example and carry

on their work, as God may give us power and opportunity, gathering in

precious stores of knowledge and of thought, in the belief that all truth
is immortal, and must go on for ever bestowing blessings on mankind.

Thus will the memory of the mighty dead remain to us as a power

                                                                         Like a star
                            Beacons from the abode where the eternal are.

     I do not wish, however, to occupy your time longer with general or
personal matters, but rather to take the opportunity afforded by this
address to invite your attention to some topics of scientific interest. In

attempting to do this I must have before me the warning conveyed by Pro-

fessor Huxley, in the address to which I have already referred, that in our

time science, like Tarpeia, may be crushed with the weight of the rewards
bestowed on her. In other words, it is impossible for any man to keep

pace with the progress of more than one limited branch of science, and

it is eqaally impossible to find an audience of scientific men of whom

anything more than a mere fraction can be expected to take an interest
in any one subject. There is, however, some consolation in the know-

ledge that a speaker who is sufficiently simple for those who are advanced

specialists in other departments, will of necessity be also sufficiently simple

to be understood by the general public who are specialists in nothing.
On this principle a geologist of the old school, accustomed to a great variety
of work, may hope so to scatter his fire as to reach the greater part of the

audience. In endeavouring to secure this end, I have sought inspiration
from that ocean which connects rather than separates Britain and America,

--and may almost be said to be an English sea the North Atlantic. The

geological history of this depression of the earth's crust, and its relation

to the continental masses which limit it, may furnish a theme at once

generally intelligible and connected with great questions as to the struc-
ture and history of the earth, which have excited the attention alike of
physicists, geologists, biologists, geographers, and ethnologists. Should
I, in treating of these questions, appear to be somewhat abrupt and
dogmatic, and to indicate rather than state the evidence of the general
views announced, I trust you will kindly attribute this to the exigencies

of a short address.

    If we imagine an observer contemplating the earth from a convenient
distance in space, and scrutinising its features as it rolls before him, we
may suppose him to be struck with the fact that eleven-sixteenths of its
surface are covered with water, and that the land is so unequally dis-
tributed that from one point of view he would see a hemisphere almost

exclusively oceanic, while nearly the whole of the dry land is gathered in

the opposite hemisphere. He might observe that the great oceanic area
--8 REPORT 1886.

--of the Pacific and Antarctic Oceans is dotted with islands like a shallow
--pool with stones rising above its surface as if its general depth were

small in comparison with its area. He might also notice that a mass or

belt of land surrounds each pole, and that the northern ring sends off
to the southward three vast tongues of land and of mountain chains,
terminating respectively in South America, South Africa, and Australia,
towards which feebler and insular processes are given off by the Ant-
arctic continental mass. This, as some geographers have observed,'
gives a rudely three-ribbed aspect to the earth, though two of the three
ribs are crowded together and form the Europ-asian mass or double con-

tinent, while the third is isolated in the single continent of America. He

might also observe that the northern girdle is cut across, po that the
Atlantic opens by a wide space into the Arctic Sea, while the Pacific is
contracted toward the north, but confluent with the Antarctic Ocean. The
Atlantic is also relatively deeper and less cumbered with islands than the
Pacific, which has the higher ridges near its shores, constituting what
some visitors to the Pacific coast of America have not inaptly called the
* back of the world,' while the wider slopes face the narrower ocean, into
which for this reason the greater part of the drainage of the land is
poured.2 The Pacific and Atlantic, though both depressions or flattenings
of the earth, are, as we shall find, different in age, character, and conditions
and the Atlantic, though the smaller, is the older, and from the geological
point of view, in some respects, the more important of the two.

     If our imaginary observer had the means of knowing anything of the
rock formations of the continents, he would notice that those bounding
the North Atlantic are in general of great age, some belonging to the

Laurentian system. On the other hand, he would see that many of the

mountain ranges along the Pacific are comparatively new, and that
modern igneous action occurs in connection with them. Thus he might
be led to believe that the Atlantic, though comparatively narrow, is an
older feature of the earth's surface, while the Pacific belongs to more
modern times. But he would note in connection with this that the oldest
rocks of the great continental masses are mostly toward their northern
ends, and that the borders of the northern ring of land and certain ridges
extending southwards from it constitute the most ancient and permanent

elevations of the earth's crust, though now greatly surpassed by moun-

tains of more recent age nearer the equator. Before leaving this general

survey we may make one further remark. An observer looking at the

earth from without would notice that the margins of the Atlantic and
the main lines of direction of its mountain chains are north-east and
south-west, and north-west and south-east, as if some early causes had

of Liverpool, has well illustrated this point and its geological consequence.
ADDRESS.  1'

determined the occurrence of elevations along great circles of the earth's

surface tangent to the polar circles.

   We are invited by the preceding general glance at the surface of the

earth to ask certain questions respecting the Atlantic. (1) "What has at

first determined its position and form ? (2) What changes has it expe-
rienced in the lapse of geological time ? (3) What relations have these

changes borne to the development of life on the land and in the water ?

(4) What is its probable future ?

     Before attempting to answer these questions, which I shall not take

up formally in succession, but rather in connection with each other, it is

necessary to state as briefly as possible certain general conclusions re-

specting th£ interior of the earth. It is popularly supposed that we
know nothing of this beyond a superficial crust perhaps averaging 50,000
to 100,000 feet in thickness. It is true we have no means of exploration

in the earth's interior, but the conjoined labours of physicists and geo-

logists have now proceeded sufficiently far to throw much inferential
light on the subject, and to enable us to make some general affirmations

with certainty ; and these it is the more necessary to state distinctly,
since they are often treated as mere subjects of speculation and fruitless

discussion.

     (1) Since the dawn of geological science, it has been evident that the
crust on which we live must be supported on a plastic or partially liquid

mass of heated rock, approximately uniform in quality under the whole
of its area. This is a legitimate conclusion from the wide distribution of
volcanic phenomena, and from the fact that the ejections of volcanoes,
while locally of various kinds, are similar in every part of the world.

It led to the old idea of a fluid interior of the earth, but this is now

generally abandoned, and this interior heated and plastic layer is regarded

as merely an under-crust.

    We(2) have reason to believe, as the result of astronomical investiga-

tions,' that, notwithstanding the plasticity or liquidity of the under-crust,

-- --the mass of the earth its nucleus as we may call it is practically solid

and of great density and hardness. Thus we have the apparent paradox

of a solid yet fluid earth ; solid in its astx'onomical relations, liquid or

plastic for the purposes of volcanic action and superficial movements. ^
      (3) The plastic sub-crust is not in a state of dry igneous fusion,

 but in that condition of aqueo-igneous or hydro-thermic fusion which

     ' Hopkins, Mallet, Sir William Thomson, and Prof. G. H. Danvin maintain the
solidity and rigidity of the earth on astronomical grounds ; but different conclusions
have been reached by Hennessy, Delaunay, and Airy. In America it was taught
from 1858 by Sterry Hunt, and later by Shaler and Le Conte.

    " An objection has been taken to the eifect that the supposed ellipsoidal form of

the equator is inconsistent with a plastic sub-crust. But this ellipsoidal form is not
absolutely certain, or, if it exists, is very minute. Bormey has in a recent lecture

suggested the important consideration that a mass may be slowly mobile under long-

continued pressure, while yet rigid with reference to more sudden movements.
10 REPORT 1886.

arises from the action of heat on moist substances, and which may either

be regarded as a fusion or as a species of solution at a very high tempera-

ture. This we learn from the phenomena of volcanic action, and from

the composition of the volcanic and plutonic rocks, as well as from such
chemical experiments as those of Daubree and of Tilden and Shenstone.'

     (4) The interior sub-crnst is not perfectly homogeneous, but may be

roughly divided into two layers or magmas, as they have been called : an
upper, highly siliceous or acidic, of low specific gravity and light-coloured,
and corresponding to such kinds of plutonic and volcanic rocks as granite
and trachyte ; and a lower, less siliceous or more basic, more dense, and
more highly charged with iron, and corresponding to such igneous rocks
as the dolerites, basalts, and kindred lavas. It is interesting here to
note that this conclusion, elaborated by Durocher and von Walters-
hausen, and usually connected with their names, appears to have been
first announced by John Phillips, in his ' Geological Manual,' and as a mere

common sense deduction from the observed phenomena of volcanic action

and the probable results of the gradual cooling of the earth. ^ It receives
striking confirmation from the observed succession of acidic and basic
volcanic rocks of all geological periods and in all localities. It would
 even seem, from recent spectroscopic investigations of Lockyer, that there

is evidence of a similar succession of magmas in the heavenly bodies,

 and the discovery by Nordenskiold of native iron in Greenland basalts,

 affords a probability that the inner magma is in part metalHc.^
      (5) Where rents or fissures form in the upper crust, the material of

 the lower crust is forced upward by the pressure of the less supported
 portions of the former, giving rise to volcanic phenomena either of an

 explosive or quiet character, as may be determined by contact with water.
 The underlying material may also be carried to the surface by the agency
 of heated water, producing those quiet discharges which Hunt has

> Phil. Trans. 1884. Also Crosby in Proc. Boston Soo. Nat. Hist. 1883.

2 Phillips says {3Ianval of 6eolo(/y, 1855, p. 493): 'If we regard them (the

internal crystalline rocks) as acquiring solidification by cooling in zones parallel to

the surface, we should have sheets of granitic and basaltic rocks generated below,

the first uppermost, the last undermost, while above the several strata were produced

in a series beginning at the bottom. In this sense the rocks of fusion may be called

with Lyell liypogene. Certainly under particular areas of country are found evidence

of the liquefaction of one set of igneous products after the solidification of others.

Many dykes of basalt traversing granite show themselves to have been in fusion after

the solidification of the granite.' In various forms Phillips returns to this idea, as at

pp. 556 and 564, in that unpretending manner which was his wont. Dr. Sterry Hunt

myhas kindly directed  attention to the fact of Phillips's right of priority in this

matter. Durocher in 1857 elaborated the theory of magmas in the Annales des Mines,

and we are indebted to Dutton, of the United States Geological Survey, for its

detailed application to the remarkable volcanic outflows of Western America.

3 These basalts occur at Ovifak, Greenland. Andrews has found small particles

of iron in British basalts. Prestwich and Judd have referred to the bearing on

general geology of these facts, and of Lockyer's suggestions.

named crenitic. It is to be observed here that explosive volcanic pheno-

mena, and the formation of cones, are, as Prestwich has well remarked,

characteristic of an old and thickened crust quiet ejection from fissures
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and hydro-thermal action may have been more comm.on in earlier periods

and with a thinner over-crust.

(6) The contraction of the earth's interior by cooling and by the

emission of material from below the over-crust, has caused this crust to

press downward, and therefore laterally, and so to effect great bends, folds,

and plications ; and these modified subsequently by surface denudation
constitute mountain chains and continental plateaus. As Hall long ago

pointed out,* such lines of folding have been produced more especially
where thick sediments had been laid down on the sea-bottom. Thus we

have here another apparent paradox, namely, that the elevations of the

earth's crust occur in the places where the greatest burden of detritus

has been laid down upon it, and where consequently the crust has been

Wesoftened and depressed.  must beware, in this connection, of exagge-

rated notions of the extent of contraction and of crumpling required to

form mountains. Bonney has well shown, in lectures delivered at the

London Institution, that an amount of contraction, almost inappreciable in

comparison with the diameter of the earth, would be suJ9&cient ; and that

as the greatest mountain chains are less than y-Joth of the earth's radius
in height, they would on an artificial globe a foot in diameter be no more

important than the slight inequalities that might result from the paper

gores overlapping each other at the edges.

     (7) The crushing and sliding of the over-crust implied in these move-
ments raise some serious questions of a physical character. One of these

relates to the rapidity or slowness of such movements, and the consequent

degree of intensity of the heat developed, as a possible cause of meta.

morphism of rocks. Another has reference to the possibility of changes
in the equilibrium of the earth itself as resulting from local collapse and

ridging. These questions in connection with the present dissociation of

the axis of rotation from the magnetic poles, and with changes of climate,

have attracted some attention,^ and probably deserve further considera-

tion on the part of physicists. In so far as geological evidence is con-

cerned, it would seem that the general association of crumpling with

metamoi'phism indicates a certain rapidity in the process of mountain-

making, and consequent development of heat, and the arrangement of the

older rocks around the Arctic basin forbids us from assuming any extensive

movement of the axis of rotation, though it does not exclude changes to

a limited extent. I hope that Professor Darwin will discuss these points

in his address to the Physical Section.

I wisli to formulate these principles as distinctly as possible, and as

the result of all the long series of observations, calculations, and discus-

sions since the time of Werner and Hutton, and in which a vast number

of able physicists and naturalists have borne a part, because they may be

considered as certain deductions from our actual knowledge, and because

they lie at the foundation of a rational physical geology.

   We may popularise these deductions by comparing the earth to a

drupe or stone-fruit, such as a plum or peach, somewhat dried up. It has

a large and intensely hard stone and kernel, a thin pulp made up of two

layers, an inner more dense and dark-coloured, and an outer less dense

and lighter-coloured. These constitute the under-crust. On the outside

it has a thin membrane or over-crust. In the process of drying it has

slightly shrunk, so as to produce ridges and hollows of the outer crust,

and this outer crust has cracked in some places, allowing portions of the

--pulp to ooze out in some of these its lower dark substance, in others its

tipper and lighter material. The analogy extends no farther, for there is

nothing in our withered fruit to represent the oceans occupying the lower

parts of the surface or the deposits which they have laid down.

Keeping in view these general conclusions, let us now turn to their

bearing on the origin and history of the North Atlantic.

     Though the Atlantic is a deep ocean, its basin does not constitute so
much a depression of the crust of the earth as a flattening of it, and this,

as recent soundings have shown, with a slight ridge or elevation along its

middle, and banks or terraces fringing the edges, so that its form is not

so much that of a basin as that of a shallow plate with its middle a little

raised. Its true permanent margins are composed of portions of the over-

crust folded, ridged up and crushed, as if by lateral pressure emanating

Wefrom the sea itself.  cannot, for example, look at a geological map of

America without perceiving that the Appalachian ridges, which intervene

between the Atlantic and the St. Lawrence valley, have been driven

bodily back by a force acting from the east, and that they have resisted

this pressure only where, as in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Catskill

region of New York, they have been protected by outlying masses of very

old rocks, as, for example, by that of the island of Newfoundland and that

of the Adirondack Mountains. The admirable work begun by my friend

and fellow-student Professor James Nicol, followed up by Hicks, Lap-

worth, and others, and now, after long controversy, fully confirmed by

the recent observations of the Geological Survey of Scotland, has shown

ihe most intense action of the same kind on the east side of the ocean in

the Scottish highlands ; and the more widely distributed Eozoic rocks of

Scandinavia may be appealed to in further evidence of this.^

If we now inquire as to the cause of the Atlantic depression, we

must go back to a time when the areas occupied by the Atlantic and
its bounding coasts were parts of a shoreless sea in which the earliest

gneisses or stratified granites of the Laurentian age were being laid

down in vastly extended beds. These ancient crystalline rocks have been
the subject of much discussion and controversy, and as they constitute
the lowest and probably the firmest part of the Atlantic sea-bed, it is
necessary to inquire as to their origin and history. Dr. Bonney, past
President of the Geological Society, in his Anniversary address, and
Dr. Sterry Hunt, in an elaborate paper communicated to the Royal
Society of Canada, have ably summed up the hypotheses as to the origin
of the oldest Laurentian beds. At the basis of these hypotheses lies the-

admission that the immensely thick beds of orthoclase gneiss, which are

the oldest stratified rocks known to us, are substantially the same in
composition with the upper or siliceous magma or layer of the under-
crust. They are, in short, its materials either in their primitive condition
or merely rearranged. One theory considers them as original products

of cooling, owing their lamination merely to the successive stages of the
process. Another view refers them to the waste and rearrangement of
the materials of a previously massive granite. Still another holds that all
our granites really arise from the fusion of old gneisses of originally

aqueous origin, while a fourth refers the gneisses themselves to molecular
changes effected in granite by pressure. These several views, in so far

as they relate to the oldest or fundamental Laurentian gneiss, may be

arranged under the following heads : (1) Endoplutonic, or that which
regards all the old gneisses as molten rocks cooled from without inward

     It will be observed, in regard to these theories, that none of them

fsnpposes that the old gneiss is an ordinary sediment, but that all regard
it as formed in exceptional circumstances, these circumstances being the
absence of land and of sub-aerial decay of rock, and the presence wholly or
principally of the material of the upper surface of the recently hardened

--crust. This being granted, the question arises, ought we not to combine

these several theories, and to believe that the cooling crust has hardened
in successive layers from without inward ; that at the same time fissures
were locally discharging igneous matter to the surface ; that matter held
in suspension in the ocean and matter held in solution by heated waters
rising from beneath the outer crust were mingling their materials in the
deposits of the primitive ocean ? It would seem that the combination of

all these agencies may safely be invoked as causes of the pre-Atlantic

deposits. This is the eclectic position which I endeavoured to maintain

in my address before the Minneapolis Meeting of the American Association

in 1883, and which I still hold to be in every way probable.

    A word here as to metamorphism, a theory which, like many others, has

been first run to death and then discredited, but which to the moderate de-
gree in which it was oi-iginally held by Lyell is still valid. Nothing can be
more certain than that the composition of the Laurentian gneisses forbids
us to suppose that they can be ordinary sediments metamorphosed. They
are rocks peculiar in their origin, and not paralleled unless exceptionally

in later times. On the other hand, they have undoubtedly experienced

very important changes, more especially as to crystallisation, the state of
combination of their ingredients, and the development of disseminated

minerals ; ' and while this may in part be attributed to the mechanical

pressure to which they have been subjected, it requires also the action of

hydi'othermic agencies. Any theory which fails to invoke both of these

Tcinds of force must necessarily be partial and imperfect.

by the central mass, was the source of mineral springs, holding in solution the silicates
which built up the ancient gneisses and similar rocks. Granitic veins and zeolites
are due to survivals of the process which generated the gneissic rocks. The hypo-
thesis of their formation from materials brought to the surface by mineral springs
from the primitive basic layer affords, it is claimed, the elements of a complete and
intelligible exx^lanation of the origin of the Eozoic rocks. This upward lixiviation of
the primitive mass, and the deposition over it of an acidic granite-like rock, would
leave belovr a highly basic material, and the division of the mass thus established
would con-espond to that of the trachytic and doleritic magmas, which have been
conjectured to be the sources of two great types of eruptive rocks. Inasmuch, how-
ever, as according to the present hj^pothesis these two layers of basic and acidic
matters are the results of aqueous action, and not of an original separation in a
ylntonic mass, as imagined by Phillips and Durocher, their composition would be
subject to many local variations.'

     ' The first of these is what Bonney has called Metastasis. The second and third
come under the name Metacrasis. Mcthylosis, or change of substance, is altogether
exceptional, and not to be credited except on the best evidence, or in cases where
volatile matters have been expelled, as in the change of Hematite into Magnetite, or
of bituminous coal into anthracite.

Bat all metamorphic rocks are not of the same character with the

gneisses of the Lower Laurentian. Even in the Middle and Upper Lan-

rentian we have metamorphic rocks, e.g., quartzite and limestone, which

must originally have been ordinary aqueous deposits. Still more in

the succeeding Huronian and its associated series of beds, and in the

Lower Palfeozoic, local metamorphic change has been undergone by rocks

quite similar to those which in their unaltered state constitute regular

sedimentary deposits. In the case of these later rocks it is to be borne

in mind that, while some may have been of volcanic origin, others may

have been sediments rich in undecomposed fragments of silicates. It is

a mistake to suppose that the ordinary decay of stratified siliceous rocks

is a process of kaolinisation so perfect as to eliminate all alkaline matters.

On the contrary, the fact, which Judd has recently well illustrated in the
case of the mud of the Nile, applies to a great number of similar deposits

in all parts of the world, and shows that the finest sediments have not

always been so completely lixiviated as to be destitute of the basic matters

necessary for their conversion into gneiss, mica-schist, and similar rocks

when the necessary agencies of metamorphism are applied to them

and this quite independently of any extraneous matters introduced into

them by water or otherwise. Still it must be steadily kept in view that
many of the old pre-Cambrian crystalline rocks must have been different

originally from those succeeding them, and that consequently these last
even when metamorphosed present different characters.

    I may remark here that, though a palaeontologist rather than a
lithologist, it gives me great pleasure to find so much attention now given

in this country to the old crystalline rocks, and to their study micro-

scopically and chemically as well as in the field, a work in which Sorby

and Allport were pioneers. Aa a pupil of the late Professor Jameson,

of Edinburgh, my own attention was early attracted to the study of

minerals and rocks as the stable foundations of geological science · and

as far back as 1841 I had learnt of the late Mr. Sanderson, of Edinburo-h

who worked at Nicol's sections,' how to slice rocks and fossils                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and since
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

that time I have been in the habit of examining everything with the

microscope. The modern developments in this direction are therefore

very gratifying to me, even though, as is natural, they may sometimes

appear to be pushed too far or their value over-estimated.

    That these old gneisses were deposited not only in what is now the

bed of the Atlantic, but also on the great continental areas of America

and Europe, anyone who considers the wide extent of these rocks repre-
sented on the map recently published by Professor Hull can readily under-

stand.2 It is true that Hull supposes that the basin of the Atlantic

itself may have been land at this time, but there is no evidence of this

more especially as the material of the gneiss could not have been detritus

derived from sub-aerial decay of rock.

     Let us suppose, then, the floor of old ocean covered with a flat pave-

ment of gneiss, or of that material which is now gneiss, the next question
is how and when did this original bed become converted into sea and
land. Here we have some things certain, others most debatable. That
the cooling mass, especially if it was sending out volumes of softened

rocky material, either in the exoplutonic or in the crenitic way, and piling
this on the surface, must soon become too small for its shell, is apparent

but when and where would the collapse, crushing, and wrinkling inevit-
able from this cause begin ? Where they did begin is indicated by the
lines of mountain-chains which traverse the Laurentian districts ; but the
reason why is less apparent. The more or less unequal cooling, harden-
ing and conductive power of the outer crust we may readily assume.
The driftage unequally of water-borne detritus to the south-west by the
bottom currents of the sea is another cause, and, as we shall soon see, most
effective. Still another is the greater cooling and hardening of the crust
in the polar regions, and the tendency to collapse of the equatorial pro-

tuberance from the slackening of the earth's rotation. Besides these the
internal tides of the earth's substance at the times of solstice would exert
an oblique pulUng force on the crust, which might tend to crack it along

diagonal lines. From whichever of these causes or the combination of the
whole, we know that within the Laurentian time folded portions of the

earth's crust began to rise above the general surface in broad belts running

from N.E. to S.W., and from N.W. to S.B., where the older mountains
of Eastern America and Western Europe now stand, and that the subsi-

dence of the oceanic areas allowed by this crumpling of the crust permitted

other areas on both sides of what is now the Atlantic to form limited

table-lands.' This was the beginning of a process repeated again and again

in subsequent times, and which began in the Middle Laurentian, when
for the first time we find beds of quartzite, limestone, and iron ore, and
graphitic beds, indicating that there was already land and water, and
that the sea, and perhaps the land, swarmed with animal and plant life
of forms unknown to us, for the most part, now. Independently of the
questions as to the animal nature of Eozoon, I hold that we know, as
certainly as we can know anything inferentially, the existence of these
primitive forms of life. If I were to conjecture what were the early
forms of plant and animal life, I would suppose that just as in the

Palaeozoic the acrogens culminated in gigantic and complex forest trees,
so in the Laurentian the algae, the lichens, and the mosses grew to
dimensions and assumed complexity of structure unexampled in later
times, and that in the sea the humbler forms of Protozoa and Hydrozoa
were the dominant types, but in gigantic and complex forms. The land
of this period was probably limited, for the most part, to high latitudes,

      ' Daubr6e's curious experiments on the contraction of caoutchouc balloons, partially

hardened by coating with varnish, shows how small inequalities of the crust, from

·whatever cause arising, might affect the formation of wrinkles, and also that trans-
verse as well as longitudinal wrinkling might occur.

and its aspect, though more rugged and abrupt, and of greater elevation,

must have been of that character which we still see in the Lauren-

tian hills. The distribution of this ancient land is indicated by the

long lines of old Laurentian rock extending from the Labrador coast

and the north shore of the St. Lawrence, and along the eastern slopes of

the Appalachians in America, and the like rocks of the Hebrides, the

Western Highlands, and the Scandinavian mountains. A small but in-

teresting remnant is that in the Malvern Hills, so well described by HoU.

It will be well to note here and to fix on our minds that these ancient

ridges of Eastern America and Western Europe have been greatly denuded

and wasted since Laurentian times, and that it is along their eastern

sides that the greatest sedimentary accumulations have been deposited.

    From this time dates the introduction of that dominance of existing

causes which forms the basis of uniformitarianism in geology, and which

had to go on with various and great modifications of detail, through the

successive stages of the geological history, till the land and water of the

northern hemisphere attained to their present complex structure.

So soon as we have a circumpolar belt or patches of Eozoic i land and

ridges running southward from it, we enter on new and more complicated

methods of growth of the continents and seas, depending on the new

conditions established by the elevation of the earliest continents and the

consequent determination of ocean currents and of sedimentation along

the continental margins. Portions of the oldest crystalline rocks, raised

out of the protecting water, were now eroded by atmospheric agents,

and especially by the carbonic acid, then existing in the atmosphere

perhaps more abundantly than at present, under whose influence

the hardest of the gneissic rocks gradually decay. The Arctic lands

were subjected in addition to the powerful mechanical force of frost
and thaw. Thus every shower of rain and every swollen stream would

carry into the sea the products of the waste of land, sorting them into

fine clays and coarser sands                                                                                                                         and  the  cold  currents  which  cling  to  the
                                                                                                                                                  ;

ocean bottom, now determined in their courses, not merely by the

earth's rotation, but also by the lines of folding on both sides of the
Atlantic, would carry south-westward, and pile up in marginal banks of

great thickness, the debris produced from the rapid waste of the land

already existing in the Arctic regions. The Atlantic, opening widely to
the north, and having large rivers pouring into it, was especially the
ocean characterised, as time advanced, by the prevalence of these pheno-
mena. Thus throughout the geological history it has happened that, while

the middle of the Atlantic has received merely organic deposits of shells

of Eoraminifera and similar organisms, and this probably only to a small
amount, its margins have had piled upon them beds of detritus of immense^

thickness. Professor Hall, of Albany, was the first geologist who pointed
out the vast cosmic importance of these deposits, and that the mountains.

of both sides of the Atlantic owe their origin to these great lines of de-
position, along with the fact, afterwards more fully insisted on by Rogers,
that the portions of the crust which received these masses of clebris^ became
thereby weighted down and softened, and were more liable than other

parts to lateral crushing.'

     Thus in the later Eozoic and early Palaaozoic times, which succeeded
the first foldings of the oldest Laurentian, great ridges were thrown up,
along the edges of which were beds of limestone, and on their summits
and sides thick masses of ejected igneous rocks. In the bed of the central
Atlantic there are no such accumulations. It must have been a flat,
or slightly ridged, plate of the ancient gneiss, hard and resisting, though
perhaps with a few cracks, through which igneous matter welled up, as
in Iceland and the Azores in more modern times. In this condition of
things we have causes tending to perpetuate and extend the distinctions
 of ocean and continent, mountain and plain, already begun; and of these

we may more especially note the continued subsidence of the areas of

 greatest marine deposition. This has long attracted attention, and affords
 very convincing evidence of the connection of sedimentary deposit as a

 cause with the subsidence of the crust.

    We are indebted to a French physicist, M. Faye,^ for an important

 suggestion on this subject. It is that the sediment accumulated along
 the shores of the ocean presented an obstacle to radiation, and conse-
 quently to cooling of the crust, while the ocean floor, unprotected and
 unweighted, and constantly bathed with currents of cold water, having
 great power of convection of heat, would be more rapidly cooled, and so
 would become thicker and stronger. This suggestion is complementary
 to the theory of Professor Hall, that the areas of greatest deposit on the

      ' The connection of accumulation with subsidence was always a familiar con-
 sideration with geologists ; but Hall seems to have been the first to state its true
 significance as a geological factor, and to see that those portions of the crust which
 are weighted down by great detrital accumulations are necessarily those which, in
  succeeding movements, were elevated into mountains. Other American geologists,
  as Dana, Rogers, Hunt, Le Conte, Crosby, &c., have followed up Hall's primary sug-
  gestion, and in England, Hicks, Fisher, Starkie Gardner, Hull, and others, have
  brought it under notice, and it enters into the great generalisations of Lyell on these

   subjects.

      2 Button in Report of U.S. Geological Survey, 1881. From facts stated in this re-

 port and in my Arcadian Geology, it is apparent that in the Western States and in the

  coalfield of Nova Scotia shallow-water deposits have been laid down up to thicknesses

  of 10,000 to 20,000 feet in connection with continuous subsidence. See also a paper

  by Ricketts in the Geol. Mag. 1883. It may be well to add here that this doctrine

  of the subsidence of wide areas being caused by deposition does not justify the con-
  clusion of certain glacialists that snow and ice have exercised a like power in glacial
  periods. In truth, as will appear in the sequel, great accumulations of snow and ice
   require to be preceded by subsidence, and wide continental areas can never be covered
   with deep snow, while of course ice can cause no addition of weight to submerged

    areas.

margins of fclie ocean are necessarily those of greatest folding and conse-

Wequent elevation.       have thus a hard, thick, resisting ocean-hottom

which, as it settles down toward the interior, under the influence of
gravity, squeezes upward and folds and plicates all the soft sediments

deposited on its edges. The Atlantic area is almost an unbroken cake

of this kind. The Pacific area has cracked in many places, allowing the

interior fluid matter to ooze out in volcanic ejections.

    It may be said that all this supposes a permanent continuance of the
ocean-basins, whereas many geologists postulate a mid-Atlantic continent ·

to give the thick masses of detritus found in the older formations both in
Eastern America and Western Europe, and which thin ofi" in proceeding

into the interior of both continents. I prefer, with Hall, to consider these

belts of sediment as in the main the deposits of northern currents, and de-

rived from Arctic land, and that like the great banks of the American coast

at the present day, which are being built up by the present Arctic current,

they had little to do with any direct drainage from the adjacent shore.

We need not deny, however, that such ridges of land as existed along the

Atlantic margins were contributing their quota of river-borne material,

just as on a still greater scale the Amazon and Mississippi are doing now,

and this especially on the sides toward the present continental plateaus,

though the greater part must have been derived from the wide tracts of

Laurentian land within the Arctic Circle or near to it. It is further

obvious that the ordinary reasoning respecting the necessity of continental

areas in the present ocean basins would actually oblige ns to suppose

that the whole of the oceans and continents had repeatedly changed

places. This consideration opposes enormous physical difficulties to any

theory of alternations of the oceanic and continental areas, except locally

at their margins. I would, however, refer you for a more full discussion of

these points to the address to be delivered to-morrow by the President of

the Geological Section.

But the permanence of the Atlantic depression does not exclude the

idea of successive submergences of the continental plateaus and marginal

slopes, alternating with periods of elevation, when the ocean retreated

from the continents and contracted its limits. In this respect the Atlantic

of to-day is much smaller than it was in those times when it spread

widely over the continental plains and slopes, and much larger than it

    ' Among American geologists, Dana and Le Conte, though from somewhat differ-

ent premises, maintain continental permanence. Crosby has argued on the other

side. In Britain, Hull has elaborated the idea of interchange of oceanic and conti-
nental areas in his memoir in Trans. Dublin Society, and in his work entitled The
Physical History of the British Islands. Godwin-Austen argues powerfully for the
permanence of the Atlantic basin, Q. J. Geol. Society, vol. xii. p. 42. Mellard

Eeade ably advocates the theory of mutation. The two views require, in my judg-

ment, to be combined. More especially it is necessary to take into account the
existence of an Atlantic ridge of Laurentian rock on the west side of Europe, of
which the Hebrides and the oldest rocks of Wales, Ireland, Western France, and
Portugal are remnants.

                                                                                         c2

has been in times of continental elevation. This leads us to the further
consideration that, -while the ocean-beds have been sinking, other areas have
 been better supported, and constitute the continental plateaus ; and that
it has been at or near the junctions of these sinking and rising areas that
 the thickest deposits of detritus, the most extensive foldings, and the
greatest ejections of volcanic matter have occurred. There has thus been
a permanence of the position of the continents and oceans throughout

geological time, but with many oscillations of these areas, producing
submergences and emergences of the land. In this way we can reconcile

the vast vicissitudes of the continental areas in difiFerent geological

periods with that continuity of development from north to south, and

Wefrom the interiors to the margins, which is so marked a feature.

have for this reason to foi-mulate another apparent geological paradox,
namely, that while in one sense the continental and oceanic areas are

permanent, in another they have been in continual movement. Nor does

this view exclude extension of the continental borders or of chains of
islands beyond their present limits, at certain periods ; and indeed the
general principle already stated, that subsidence of the ocean-bed has
produced elevation of the land, implies in earlier periods a shallower ocean

and many possibilities as to volcanic islands, and low continental margins

creeping out into the sea ; while it is also to be noted that there are,
as already stated, bordering shelves, constituting shallows in the ocean,
which at certain periods have emerged as land.

   We are thus compelled to believe in the contemporaneous existence

in all geological periods, except perhaps the earliest of them, of three
distinct conditions of areas on the surface of the earth. (1) Oceanic
areas of deep sea, which always continued to occupy in whole or in part
the bed of the present ocean. (2) Continental plateaus and marginal
shelves, existing as low flats or higher table-lands liable to periodical

submergence and emergence. (3) Lines of plication and folding, more

especially along the borders of the oceans, forming elevated portions of
land, rarely altogether submerged and constantly affording the material
of sedimentary accumulations, while they were also the seats of powerful
volcanic ejections.

     In the successive geological periods the continental plateaus when
submerged, owing to their vast extent of warm and shallow sea, have

been the great theatres of the development of marine life and of the de-

position of organic limestones, and when elevated they have furnished
the abodes of the noblest land faunas and floras. The mountain belts,
especially in the north, have been the refuge and stronghold of land life
in periods of submergence, and the. deep ocean basins have been the
perennial abodes of pelagic and abyssal creatures, and the refuge of mul-
titudes of other marine animals and plants in tim.e3 of continental eleva-

tion. These general facts are full of importance with reference to the
question of the succession of formations and of life in the geological history
of the earth.

So much time has heen occupied with these general views that it

would be impossible to trace the history of the Atlantic in detail through

Wethe ages of the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and Tertiary.  may, however,

shortly glance at tbe changes of the three kinds of surface already re-

ferred to. The bed of the ocean seems to have remained on the whole

abyssal, but there were probably periods when those shallow reaches of

the Atlantic which stretch across its most northern portion, and partly

separate it from the Arctic basin, presented connecting coasts or con-

tinuous chains of islands sufficient to permit animals and plants to pass

over.' At certain periods also there were not unlikely groups of volcanic
islands, like the Azores, in the temperate or tropical Atlantic. More espe-

cially might this be the case in that early time when it was more like

the present Pacific ; and the line of the great volcanic belt of the Mediter-

ranean, the mid-Atlantic banks, the Azores, and the West India Islands

point to the possibility of such partial connections. These were stepping-

stones, so to speak, over which land organisms might cross, and some of

these may be connected with the fabulous or prehistoric Atlantis.^

In the Cambrian and Ordovician periods the distinctions, already

referred to, into continental plateaus, mountain ridges, and ocean depths

were first developed, and we find already great masses of sediment accu-

mulating on the seaward sides of the old Laurentian ridges, and internal

deposits thinning away from these ridges over the submerged continental

areas, and presenting very dissimilar conditions of sedimentation. It

would seem also that, as Hicks has argued for Europe, and Logan and

Hall for America, this Cambrian age was one of slow subsidence of the

land previously elevated, accompanied with or caused by thick deposits of

detritus along the borders of the subsiding land, which was pi'obably

covered with the decomposing rock arising from long ages of sub-aerial

waste.

    In the coal-formation age, its characteristic swampy flats stretched in
some places far into the shallower parts of the ocean.^ In the Permian

the great plicated mountain margins were fully developed on both sides
of the Atlantic. In the Jurassic the American continent probably ex-
tended further to sea than at present. In the Wealden age there

was much land to the west and north of Great Britain, and Professor

    ' It would seem, from Geikie's description of the Faroe Islands, that they may be

a remnant of such connecting land, dating from the Cretaceous or Eocene period.

Bonney has directed attention to the evidence of the existence of
this land as far back as the Trias, while Mr. Starkie Gardner has
insisted on connecting links to the sonthward as evidenced by fossil
plants. So late as the Post-Glacial, or early human period, large tracts

now submerged formed portions of the continents. On the other

hand the internal plains of America and Europe were often submerged.
Such submergences are indicated by the great limestones of the Paleo-
zoic, by the chalk and its representative beds in the Cretaceous, by the
Nummulitic formation in the Eocene, and lastly by the great Pleistocene
submergence, one of the most remarkable of all, one in which nearl}^ the
whole northern hemisphere participated, and which was probably sepa-
rated from the present time by only a few thousands of years.' These
submergences and elevations were not always alike on the two sides of
the Atlantic. The Salina period of the Silurian, for example, and the
 Jurassic, show continental elevation in America not shared by Europe.
 The great subsidences of the Cretaceous and the Eocene wei'e proportion-
 ally deeper and wider on the eastern continent, and this and the direction
 of the land being from north to south cause more ancient forms of life to
 survive in America. These elevations and submergences of the plateaus
 alternated with the periods of mountain-making plication, which was
 going on at intervals at the close of the Eozoic, at the beginning of the
 Cambrian, at the close of the Siluro-Cambrian, in the Permian, and in
 Europe and Western America in the Tertiary. The series of changes,
 however, affecting all these areas was of a highly complex character, and
 embraces the whole physical history of the geological ages.

    We may note here that the unconformities caused by these move-

 ments and by subsequent denudation constitute what Le Conte has called
  ' lost intervals,' one of the most important of which is supposed to have
 occurred at the end of the Eozoic. It is to be observed, however, that as
 every such movement is followed by a gradual subsidence, the seeming
 loss is caused merely by the overlapping of the successive beds deposited.

     We may also note a fact which I have long ago insisted on,^ the regn-

  lar pulsations of the continental areas, giving us alternations in each
  great system of formations of deep-sea and shallow- water beds, so that

 the successive groups of formations may be divided into triplets of shal-

  low-water, deep-water, and shallow-water strata, alternating in each
  period. This law of succession applies more particularly to the forma-
  tions of the continental plateaus, rather than to those of the ocean margins,
  and it shows that, intervening between the great movements of plication,
  there were subsidences of those plateaus, or elevations of the sea-bottom,

       ' The recent surveys of the Falls of Niagara coincide with a great many evidences

   to which I have elsewhere referred in proving that the Pleistocene submergence of
  America and Europe came to an end not more than ten thousand years ago, and was
   itself not of very great duration. Thus in Pleistocene times the land must have been
   submerged and re-elevated in a very rapid manner

whicli allowed the waters to spread tbemselves over all the inland spaces
between the great folded mountain ranges.

    In referring to the ocean basins we should bear in mind that there are

--three of these in the northern hemisphere the Arctic, the Pacific, and

the Atlantic. De Ranee has ably summed up in a series of articles pub-
hshed in ' Nature ' the known facts as to Arctic geology, and I have
myself been favoured with opportunities to study many of the collections
brought home by the Arctic voyagers, and which are of much interest
when viewed in connection with Canadian geology. From these sources
we learn that this area presents from without inwards a succession of

older and newer formations from the Eozoic to the Tertiary, and that
its extent must have been greater in former periods than at present,

while it must have enjoyed a comparatively warm climate. The relations

of its deposits and fossils are closer with those of the Atlantic than with
those of the Pacific, as might be anticipated from its wider opening into
the former. Blanford has recently remarked on the correspondence of
the marginal deposits around the Pacific and Indian oceans,' and Dr.

Dawson informs me that this is equally marked in comparison with the
west coast of America,^ but these marginal areas have not yet gained much

on the ocean. In the North Atlantic, on the other hand, there is a wide belt
of comparatively modern rocks on both sides, more especially toward the
south, and on the American side ; but while there appears to be a perfect
correspondence on both sides of the Atlantic, and around the Pacific
respectively, there seems to be less parallelism between the deposits and
forms of life of the two oceans as compared with each other, and less
correspondence in forms of life, especially in modern times. Still in the
earlier geological ages, as might have been anticipated from the imper-
fect development of the continents, the same forms of life characterise
the whole ocean from Australia to Arctic America, and indicate a grand
unity of Pacific and Atlantic life not equalled in later times,^ and which
speaks of contemporaneity rather than of what has been termed homo-

taxis.

    We may pause here for a moment to notice some of the efiiects of

    * A singular example is the recurrence in New Zealand of Triassic rocks and fossils
of types corresponding to those of British Columbia. A curious modern analogy

appears in the works of art of the Maoris with those of the Haida Indians of the
 Queen Charlotte Islands, and both are eminently Pacific in contradistinction to

 Atlantic.

 mechanical deposits of the close of the Palseozoic in the Indian Ocean, whether these
 are glacial or not, would seem to show a correspondence with the Permian conglome-
 rates and earth-movements of the Atlantic area ; but since that time the Atlantic
 has enjoyed comparative repose. The Pacific also seems to have reproduced the
 conditions of the Carboniferous in the Cretaceous age, and seems to have been less
 affected by the great changes of the Pleistocene.

Atlantic growth on modern geography. It has given na rugged and

broken shores composed of old rocks in the north, and newer formations
and softer features toward the south. It has given us marginal moun-

tain ridges and internal plateaus on both sides of the sea. It has pro-

duced certain curious and by no means accidental correspondences of the

eastern and western sides. Thus the solid basis on which the British

Islands stand may be compared with Newfoundland and Labrador, the

English Channel with the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bay of Biscay with

the Bay of Maine, Spain with the projection of the American land at

Cape Hatteras, the Mediterranean with the Gulf of Mexico. The special

conditions of deposition and plication necessary to these results, and their

bearing on the character and productions of the Atlantic basin, would

require a volume for their detailed elucidation.

Thus far our discussion has been limited almost entirely to physical

causes and effects. If we now turn to the life-history of the Atlantic,
we are met at the threshold with the question of climate, not as a thing

fixed and immutable, but as changing from age to age in harmony with

geographical mutations, and producing long cosmic summers and winters

of alternate warmth and refrigeration.

"We can scarcely doubt that the close connection of the Atlantic and

Arctic oceans is one factor in those remarkable vicissitudes of climate ex-

perienced by the former, and in which the Pacific area has also shared in

connection with the Antarctic Sea. No geological facts are indeed at first

sight more strange and inexplicable than the changes of climate in the

WeAtlantic area, even in comparatively modem periods.  know that in

the early Tertiary perpetual summer reigned as far north as the middle

of Greenland, and that in the Pleistocene the arctic cold advanced, until

an almost perennial winter prevailed, half-way to the equator. It is no

wonder that nearly every cause available in the heavens and the earth has

been invoked to account for these astounding facts.

It will, I hope, meet with the approval of your veteran glaciologist

Dr. Crosskey, if, neglecting most of these theoretical views, I venture

to invite your attention in connection with this question chiefly to the old

Lyellian doctrine of the modification of climate by geographical changes.

Let us, at least, consider how much these are able to account for.'

     ' The late Mr. Searles V. Wood, in an able summary of the possible causes of the
succession of cold and warm climates in the northern hemisphere, enumerates no
fewer than seven theories which have met with more or less acceptance. These are :^

     1. The gradual cooling of the earth from a condition of original incandescence.
     2. Changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic.
     3. Changes in the position of the earth's axis of rotation.
     4. The effect of the precession of the equinoxes along with changes of the eccen-

tricity of the earth's orbit.

     5. Variations in the amount of heat given ofE by the sun.
     6. Differences in the temperature of portions of space passed through by the earth.
     7. Differences in the distribution of land and water in connection with the flow
of oceanic currents.

The ocean is a great equaliser of extremes of temperature. It does

ithis by its great capacity for heat and by its cooling and heating power

when passing from the solid into the liquid and gaseous states, and the

reverse. It also acts by its mobility, its currents serving to convey heat

to great distances or to cool the air by the movement of cold icy waters.

The land, on the other hand, cools or warms rapidly, and can transmit its

influence to a distance only by the winds, and tbe influence so transmitted

is rather in the nature of a disturbing than of an equalising cause. It

follows that any change in the distribution of land and water must affect

climate, more especially if it changes the character or course of the ocean

currents.'

At the present time the North Atlantic presents some very peculiar

and in some respects exceptional features, which are most instructive with

reference to its past history. The great internal plateau of the American

continent is now dry land                                                                                                                    the passage  across  Central America  between

the Atlantic and the Pacific is blocked ; the Atlantic opens very widely to

the north                                              the high mass of Greenland towers in its northern part.                                                                     The
                                                    ;

effects are that the great equatorial current running across from Africa and
embayed in the Gulf of Mexico, is thrown northward and eastward in the

Gulf Stream, acting as a hot- water apparatus to heat up to an exceptional

degree the western coast of Europe. On the otber hand, the cold Arctic

current from the polar seas is thrown to the westward, and runs down
from Greenland past the American shore. ^ The pilot chart for June of

this year shows vast fields of drift ice on the western side of the Atlantic

as far south as the latitude of 40°. So far, therefore, the Glacial age in that

part of the Atlantic still extends ; and this at a time when, on the eastern

side of the Ocean, the culture of cereals reaches in Norway beyond the

Arctic Circle. Let us inquire into some of the details of these phenomena.

    The warm water thrown into the North Atlantic not only increases the

temperature of the whole of its water, but gives an exceptionally mild

·climate to Western Europe. Still the countervailing influence of the

Arctic currents and the Greenland ice is sufficient to permit icebergs
which creep down to the mouth of the Strait of Belle Isle, in the latitude

·of the south of England, to remain unmelted till the snows of a succeed-

ing winter fall upon them. Now let us suppose that a subsidence of land

m tropical America were to allow the equatorial current to pass through

into the Pacific. The efiect would at once be to reduce the temperature
of Norway and Britain to that of Greenland and Labrador at present,

while the latter countries would themselves become colder. The northern

ice, drifting down into the Atlantic, would not, as now, be melted rapidly
by the warm water which it meets in the Gulf Stream. Much larger

       Von WcBickofE has very strongly put these principles in a review of CroU's

Jecent book, Climate and Cosmology; American Journal of Science, March 1886.
     * I may refer here to the admirable expositions of these effects by the late

Dr. Carpenter, in his papers on the results of the explorations of the Challenger.

quantities of it would remain undissolved in summer, and thus an accu-

mulation of permanent ice would take place, along the American coast

at first, but probably at length even on the European side. This would

still further chill the atmosphere, glaciers would be established on all the

mountains of temperate Europe and America,' the summer would be kept

cold by melting ice and snow, and at length all Eastern America and
Europe might become uninhabitable, except by arctic animals and plants,

as far south as perhaps 40° of north latitude. This would be simply a

return of the Glacial age. I have assumed only one geographical change
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

but other and more complete changes of subsidence and elevation might

take  place,  with  effects  on  climate  still  more  decisive                                       more  especially
                                                                                                   ;

would this be the case if there were a considerable submergence of the

land in temperate latitudes.

   We may suppose an opposite case. The high plateau of Greenland

might subside or be reduced in height, and the openings of Baffin's Bay

and the North Atlantic might be closed. At the same time the interior

plain of America might be depressed, so that, as we know to have been
the case in the Cretaceous period, the warm waters of the Mexican Gulf

would circulate as far north as the basins of the present great American

lakes. In these circumstances there would be an immense diminution of

the sources of floating ice, and a correspondingly vast increase in the

surface of warm water. The effects would be to enable a temperate flora

to subsist in Greenland, and to bring all the present temperate regions

of Europe and America into a condition of subtropical verdure.

It is only necessary to add that we know that vicissitudes not dis-

similar from those above sketched have actually occurred in compara-

tively recent geological times, to enable us to perceive that we can dis-

pense with all other causes of change of climate, though admitting that

some of them may have occupied a secondary place. ^ This will give us,

in dealing with the distribution of life, the great advantage of not being

tied up to definite astronomical cycles of glaciation, which may not

always suit the geological facts, and of correlating elevation and sub-

sidence of the land with changes of climate affecting living beings. It will,

however, be necessary, as Wallace well insists, that we shall hold to that

degree of fixity of the continents in their position, notwithstanding the

submergences and emergences they have experienced, to which I have

already adverted. Sir Charles Lyell, more than forty years ago, pub-

lished in his ' Principles of Geology ' two imaginary maps which illus-

trate the extreme effects of various distribution of land and water. In

one all the continental masses are grouped around the equator. In the

     * According to Bonney, the west coast ofWales is about 12° above the average for
its latitude, and if reduced to 12° below the average its mountains would have large

glaciers.

     - More especially the ingenious and elaborate arguments of Croll deserve con-
sideration ; and, though I cannot agree with him in his main thesis, I gladly acknow-
ledge the great utility of the work he has done.

other they are all placed around the poles, leaving an open equatorial

ocean. In the one case the whole of the land and its inhabitants would

enjoy a perpetual summer, and scarcely any ice could exist in the sea.

In the other the whole of the land would be subjected to an arctic climate,
and it would give off immense quantities of ice to cool the ocean. But

Lyell did not suppose that any such distribution as that represented in

his maps had actually occurred, though this supposition has been some-

times attributed to him. He merely put what he regarded as an extreme

case to illustrate what might occur under conditions less exaggerated.

Sir Charles, like other thoughtful geologists, was well aware of the

general fixity of the areas of the continents, though with great modifica-

tions in the matter of submergence and of land conditions. The union,

indeed, of these two gi-eat principles of fixity and diversity of the con-

tinents lies at the foundation of theoretical geology.

   We can now more precisely indicate this than was possible when Lyell

produced his ' Principles,' and can reproduce the conditions of our con-

tinents in even the more ancient periods of their history. Some examples
may be taken from the history of the American continent, which is more

simple in its arrangements than the double continent of Europ-asia.

We may select the early Devonian or Brian period, in which the magni-

-- --ficent flora of that age the earliest certainly known to us made its

appearance. Imagine the whole interior plain of North America sub-
merged, so that the continent is reduced to two strips on the east and

west, connected by a belt of Laurentian land on the north. In the great

mediterranean sea thus produced the tepid water of the equatorial current

circulated, and it swarmed with corals, of which we know no less than

one hundred and fifty species, and with other forms of life appropriate

to warm seas. On the islands and coasts of this sea was introduced

the Erian flora, appearing first in the north, and with that vitality and

colonising power of which, as Hooker has well shown, the Scandinavian

Aflora is the best modern type, spreading itself to the south. ·  very simi-

lar distribution of land and water in the Cretaceous age gave a warm and

equable climate in those portions of North America not submerged, and

coincided with the appearance of the multitude of broad-leaved trees of

modern types introduced in the early and middle Cretaceous, and which

Weprepared the way for the mammalian life of the Eocene.          may take

a still later instance from the second continental period of the later Pleisto-

cene or early Modern, when there would seem to have been a partial or

entire closure of the North Atlantic against the Arctic ice, and wide exten-

sions seaward of the European and American land, with possibly consider-

able tracts of land in the vicinity of the equator, while the Mediterranean

    · As I have elsewhere endeavoured to show (^Report on Sihirian and Devonian

Plants of Canada), a warm climate in the Arctic region seems to have afforded the

necessary conditions for the great colonising floras of all geological periods. Gray
had previously illustrated the same fact in the case of the more modern floras.
28 REPORT-- 1886.

and the Gulf of Mexico were deep inland lakes.' The eflfect of such

conditions on the climates of the northern hemisphere must have been

prodigious, and their investigation is rendered all the more interesting

because it would seem that this continental period of the post- Glacial age

was that in which man made his first acquaintance with the coasts of the

Atlantic, and possibly made his way across its waters.

   We have in America ancient periods of cold as well as of warmth. I

have elsewhere referred to the boulder conglomerates of the Huronian,

of the Cambrian and Ordovician, of the Millstone-grit period of the Car-

boniferous  and  of  the  early Permian                                                         but  would  not  venture  to  aflBrm
                                                                                             ;

that either of these periods was comparable in its cold with the later

glacial age, still less with that imaginary age of continental glaciation

assumed by certain of the more extreme theorists.^ These ancient con-

glomerates were probably produced by floating ice, and this at periods

when in areas not very remote temperate floras and faunas could flourish.
The glacial periods of our old continent occurred in times when the

surface of the submerged land was opened up to the northern currents,

drifting over it mud and sand and stones, and rendering nugatory, in

so far at least as the bottom of the sea was concerned, the effects of the

superficial warm streams. Some of these beds are also peculiar to the

eastern margin of the continent, and indicate ice-drift along the Atlantic

coast in the same manner as at present, while conditions of greater
warmth existed in the interior. Even in the more recent Glacial age,

while the mountains were covered with snow and the lowlands sub-
merged under a sea laden with ice, there were interior tracts in some-
what high latitudes of America in which hardy forest trees and her-

baceous plants flourished abundantly ; and these wei'e by no means

exceptional ' interglacial ' periods. Thus we can show that while from

the remote Huronian period to the Tertiary the American land occupied

the same position as at present, and while its changes were merely

changes of relative level as compared with the sea, these have so in-

fluenced the ocean currents as to cause great vicissitudes of climate.

"Without entering on any detailed discussion of that last and greatest

Glacial period which is best known to us, and is more immediately con-

nected with the early history of man and the modern animals, it may be
proper to make a few general statements bearing on the relative import-

ance of sea-borne and land ice in producing those remarkable phenomena

attributable to ice action in this period. In considering this question it

must be borne in mind that the greater masses of floating ice are pro-

duced at the seaward extremities of land glaciers, and that the heavy

field-ice of the Arctic regions is not so much a result of the direct freez-

ing of the surface of the sea as of the accumulation of snow precipitated

especially of glaciers in the Pleistocene age, it is necessary to keep thia

--Nowfully in view.

--would seem also in any conceivable former state of the earth it is neces-

sary that extensive evaporation should conspire with great condensation

of water in the solid form. Such conditions exist in mountainous

regions sufficiently near to the sea, as in Greenland, Norway, the Alps, and

the Himalayas                                                                                 but  they do not exist  in  low arctic lands like Siberia  or
                                                                                           ;

Grinnel-land nor in inland mountains. It follows that land glaciation

has narrow limits, and that we cannot assume the possibility of great

confluent or continental glaciers covering the interior of wide tracts of

land. No imaginable increase of cold could render this possible, inas-

much as there could not be a sufficient influx of vapour to produce the

necessary condensation ; and the greater the cold, the less would be the

evaporation. On the other hand, any increase of heat would be felt

more rapidly in the thawing and evaporation of land ice and snow than

on the surface of the sea.

Applying these very simple geographical truths to the North Atlantic

continents, it is easy to perceive that no amount of refrigeration could

produce a continental glacier, because there could not be sufficient eva-

poration and precipitation to afford the necessary snow in the interior.

The case of Greenland is often referred to, but this is the case of a high

mass of cold land with sea, mostly open, on both sides of it, giving, there-

fore, the conditions most favourable to precipitation of snow. If Green-

laud were less elevated, or if there were dry plains around it, the case
would be quite different, as Nares has well shown by his observations on

the summer verdure of Grinnel-land, which, in the immediate vicinity of

North Greenland, presents very different conditions as to glaciation and

climate.' If the plains were submerged, and the Arctic currents allowed

free access to the interior of the continent of America, it is conceivable

that the mountainous regions remaining out of water would be covered with

snow and ice, and there is the best evidence that this actually occurred

in the Glacial period ; but with the plains out of water this would be im-

Wepossible.*  see evidence of this at the present day in the fact that in

unusually cold winters the great precipitation of snow takes place south of

Canada, leaving the north comparatively bare, while as the temperature

becomes milder the area of snow-deposit moves farther to the north.

Thus a greater extension of the Atlantic, and especially of its cold ice-
laden arctic currents, becomes the most potent cause of a glacial age.

I have long maintained these conclusions on general geographical

grounds, as well as on the evidence afforded by the Pleistocene deposits of
Canada; and in an address the theme of which is the ocean I may be excused

for continuing to regard the supposed terminal moraines of great continental

already referred to and in previous geographical papers.

glaciers as nothing but the southern limit of the ice-drift of a period of

submergence. In such a period the southern margin of an ice-laden sea

where its floe-ice and bergs grounded, or where its ice was rapidly melted

by warmer water, and where consequently its burden of boulders and other

debris was deposited, would necessarily present the aspect of a moraine,

which by the long continuance of such conditions might assume gigantic

dimensions. Let it be observed, however, that I fully admit the evidence of

the great extension of local glaciers in the Pleistocene age, and especially

in the times of partial submergence of the land.

I am quite aware that it has been held by many able American

geologists ^ that in North America a continental glacier extended in tem-

perate latitudes from sea to sea, or at least from the Atlantic to the

Rocky Mountains, and that this glacier must, in many places, have

exceeded a mUe in thickness. The reasons above stated appear, however,

sufficient to compel us to seek for some other explanation of the observed

facts, however difficult this may at first sight appear. With a depression

such as we know to have existed, admitting the Arctic currents along the

St. Lawrence Valley, through gaps in the Laurentian watershed, and

down the great plains between the Laurentian areas and the Rocky

Mountains, we can easily understand the covering of the hills of Eastern

Canada and New England with ice and snow, and a similar covering of

the mountains of the west coast. The sea also in this case might be

ice-laden and boulder-bearing as far south as 40°, while there might still be

low islands far to the north on which vegetation and animals continued

Weto exist.  should thus have the conditions necessary to explain all the

anomalies of the glacial deposits. Even the glaciation of high mountains

south of the St. Lawrence Valley would then become explicable by the

grounding of floe-ice on the tops of these mountains when reefs in the sea.

In like manner we can understand how on the isolated ti'appean hill of

Beloeil, in the St. Lawrence Valley, Laurentian boulders far removed from

their native seats to the north are perched at a height of about 1,200 feet

on a narrow peak where no glacier could possibly have left them. The

so-called moraine, traceable from the great Missouri Coteau in the west, to

the coasts of New Jersey, would thus become the mark of the«western

and southern limit of the subsidence, or of the line along which the cold

currents bearing ice were abruptly cut ofi" by warm surface waters. I

am glad to find that these considerations are beginning to have weight

with European geologists in their explanation of the glacial drift of the

great plains of Northern Europe.

Whatever difiiculties may attend such a supposition, they are small

compared with those attendant on the belief of a continental glacier,

moving withont the aid of gravity, and depending for its material on the

precipitation taking place on the interior plains of a great continent.

     I have elsewhere endeavoured to show, on the evidence found in Canada,
that the occurrence of marine shells, land plants, and insects in the glacial

deposits of that country indicates not so much the effect of general

interglacial periods as the local existence of conditions like those of

Grinnel-land and Greenland, in proximity to each other at one and the

same period, and depending on the relative levels of land and the distribu-

tion of ocean currents and ice-drift.'

I am old enough to remember the sensation caused by the delightful

revelations of Edward Forbes respecting the zones of animal life in the

sea, and the vast insight which they gave into the significance of the

work on minute organisms previously done by Ehrenberg, Lonsdale, and

AWilliamson, and into the meaning of fossil remains.       little later the

soundings for the Atlantic cable revealed the chalky foraminiferal ooze of

the abyssal ocean ; still more recently the wealth of facts disclosed by the

Challenger voyage, which naturalists have not yet had time to digest,

have opened up to us new worlds of deep-sea life.

    The bed of the deep Atlantic is covered for the most part by a mud

or ooze largely made up of the debris of foraminifera and other minute

organisms mixed with fine clay. In the North Atlantic the Norwegian

naturalists call this the Biloculina mud. Further south the Challenger

naturalists speak of it as Globigerina ooze. In point of fact it contains

different species of foraminiferal shells, Globigerina and Orbulina being

in some localities dominant, and in others other species, and these changes

are more apparent in the shallower portions of the ocean.

On the other hand there are means for disseminating coarse material

over parts of the ocean-bed. There are in the line of the Arctic current

on the American coast great sand-banks, and off the coast of Norway

sand constitutes a considerable part of the bottom material. Soundings

and dredgings off Great Britain, and also off the American coast, have

shown that fragments of stone referable to Arctic lands are abundantly

strewn over the bottom along certain lines, and the Antarctic continent,

otherwise almost unknown, makes its presence felt to the dredge by the

abundant masses of crystalline rock drifted far from it to the north.

These are not altogether new discoveries. I had inferred many years ago,

from stones taken up by the hooks of fishermen on the banks of New-

foundland, that rocky material from the north is dropped on these banks

by the heavy ice which drifts over them every spring, that these stones

are glaciated, and that after they fall to the bottom sand is drifted over them

with sufl&cient velocity to polish the stones and to erode the shelly cover-

ings of Arctic animals attached to them.^ If then the Atlantic basin

were upheaved into land we should see beds of sand, gravel, and boulders

with clay flats and layers of marl and limestone. According to the

    ' Notes on Post-Pliocene of Canada, 1872. One well-marked interval only has been
established in the glacial deposits of Canada.

     " Notes on Post-Pliocene of Canada, 1872.
32 EEPORT-- 1886.

Challenger Reports, in tlie Antarctic seas S. of 64° there is blue mud with

fragments of rock in depths of 1,200 to 2,000 fathoms. The stones, some'
of them glaciated, were granite, diorite, amphibolite, mica schist, gneiss,
and quartzite. This deposit ceases and gives place to Globigerina ooze
and red clay at 46° to 47° S., but even further north there is sometimes
as much as 49 per cent, of crystalline sand. In the Labrador current a
block of syenite weighing 490 lbs. was taken up from 1,340 fathoms, and
in the Arctic current 100 miles from land was a stony deposit, some stones

being glaciated. Among these were smoky quartz, quartzite, limestone,

dolomite, mica schist, and serpentine ; also particles of monoclinic and
triclinic felspar, hornblende, augite, magnetite, mica, and glauconite, the
latter no doubt formed in the sea-bottom, the others drifted from Bozoic

and Palaeozoic formations to the north.'

    A remarkable fact in this connection is that the great depths of the

sea are as impassable to the majority of marine animals as the land itself.
According to Murray, while twelve of the Challenger's dredgings taken

in depths greater than 2,000 fathoms gave 92 species, mostly new to
science, a similar number of dredgings in shallower water near the land
gave no less than 1,000 species. Hence arises another apparent paradox
relating to the distribution of organic beings. While at first sight it
might seem that the chances of wide distribution are exceptionally great

for marine species, this is not so. Except in the case of those which

enjoy a period of free locomotion when young, or are floating and pelagic,
the deep ocean sets bounds to their migrations. On the other hand the
spores of cryptogamic plants may be carried for vast distances by the
wind, and the growth of volcanic islands may effect connections which,
though only temporary, may afford opportunity for land animals and

plants to pass over.

     With reference to the transmission of living beings across the Atlantic,
we have before us the remarkable fact that from the Cambrian age on-
wards there were on the two sides of the ocean many species of inver-
tebrate animals which were either identical or so closely allied as to be
possibly varietal forms. ^ In like manner the early plants of the Upper
Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous present many identical species ; but
this identity becomes less marked in the vegetation of the more modei'n
times. Even in the latter, however, there are remarkable connections
between the floras of oceanic islands and the continents, which establish
this conclusively. Thus the Bermudas, altogether recent islands, have
been stocked by the agency chiefly of the ocean currents and of birds,
with nearly 160 species of continental plants, and the facts collected
by Helmsley as to the present facilities of transmission, along with the
evidence afforded by older oceanic islands which have been receiving

animal and vegetable colonists for longer periods, go far to show that,

time being given, the sea actually affords facilities for the migration of the

inhabitants of the land, comparable with those of continuous continents.

In so far as plants are concerned, it is to be observed that the early

forests were largely composed of cryptogamous plants, and the spores of

these in modern times have proved capable of transmission for great

distances. In considering this we cannot fail to conclude that the union of

simple cryptogamous fructification with arboreal stems of high complexity,

so well illustrated by Dr. Williamson, had a direct relation to the neces-

sity for a rapid and wide distribution of these ancient trees. It seems

also certain that some spores, as, for example, those of the Rhizocarps,'

a type of vegetation abundant in the Palaeozoic, and certain kinds of

seeds, as those named ^theotesta and PacJnjtheca, were fitted for flotation.

Farther, the periods of Arctic warmth permitted the passage around the
northern belt of many temperate species of plants, just as now happens

with the Arctic flora; and when these were dispersed by colder periods they
marched southward along both sides of the sea on the mountain chains.

     The same remark applies to northern forms of marine invertebrates,
which are much more widely distributed in longitude than those farther

south. The late Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, in one of his latest communications

to this Association, stated that 54 per cent, of the shallow-water

mollusks of New England and Canada are also European, and of the

deep-sea  forms                                        30  out of 35                                                these  last  of  course    enjoying  greater

facilities for migration than those which have to travel slowly along the

shallows of the coasts in order to cross the ocean and settle themselves

on both sides. Many of these animals, like the common mussel and

sand-clam, are old settlers which came over in the Pleistocene period,

or even earlier. Others, like the common periwinkle, seem to have been

slowly extending themselves in modern times, perhaps even by the agency

of man. The older immigrants may possibly have taken advantage of lines
of coast now submerged, or of warm periods, when they could creep

around by the Arctic shores. Mr. Herbert Carpenter and other natu-

ralists employed on the Challenger collections have made similar state-

ments respecting other marine invertebrates, as, for instance, the Bchino-

derms, of which the deep-sea crinoids present many common species,

and my own collections prove that many of the shallow-water forms are

common. Dall and Whiteaves- have shown that some mollusks and

Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Pacific are animals which have no special
locomotive powers even when young, but they are northern forms not

proceeding far south, so that they may have passed through the Arctic
seas. In this connection it is well to remark that many species of
animals have powers of locomotion in youth which they lose when
adult, and that others may have special means of transit. 1 once found

at Gaspe a specimen of the Pacific species of Coronula, or whale-barnacle,
the G. regince of Darwin, attached to a whale taken in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence, and which had probably succeeded in making that passage

around the north of America, which so many navigators have essayed in

vain.

But it is to be remarked that while many plants and marine inverte-

brates are common to the two sides of the Atlantic, it is different with

land animals, and especially vertebrates. I do not know that any Palaeozoic

insects or land snails or millipedes of Europe and America are specifically

identical, and of the numerous species of-batrachians of the Carboniferous

and reptiles of the Mesozoic all seem to be distinct on the two sides.

The same appears to be the case with the Tertiary mammals, until in the

later stages of that great period we find such genera as the horse, the

camel,  and the  elephant appearing on the two  sides of  the Atlantic                                                          but
                                                                                                                             ;

even then the species seem different, except in the case of a few northern

forms.

Some of the longer-lived mollasks of the Atlantic furnish suggestions

which remarkably illustrate the biological aspect of these questions.

Our familiar friend the oyster is one of these. The first known oysters

appear in the Carboniferous in Belgium and in the United States of

America. In the Carboniferous and Permian they are few and small,

and they do not culminate till the Cretaceous, in which there are no less

than ninety-one so-called species in America alone ; but some of the largest

known species are found in the Eocene. The oyster, though an inhabitant
of shallow water, and very liniitedly locomotive when young, has sur-

vived all the changes since the Carboniferous age, and has spread itself

over the whole northern hemisphere.^

I have collected fossil oysters in the Cretaceous clays of the coulees of

"Western Canada, in the Lias shales of England, in the Eocene and Cre-

taceous beds of the Alps, of Egypt, of the Red Sea coast, of Judea, and

the heights of Lebanon. Everywhere and in all formations they present

ferms which are so variable and yet so similar that one might suppose all

the so-called species to be mere varieties. Did the oyster originate

separately on the two sides of the Atlantic, or did it cross over so

promptly that its appearance seems to be identical on the two sides ?

Are all the oysters of a common ancestry, or did the causes, whatever

they were, which introduced the oyster in the Carboniferous act over

Whoagain in later periods ?  can tell ? This is one of the cases where

--causation and development the two scientific factors whicli constitute the

--basis of what is vaguely called evolution cannot easily be isolated. I

would recommend to those biologists who discuss these questions to addict

themselves to the oyster. This familiar mollusk has successfully pur-
sued its course and has overcome all its enemies, from the flat-toothed

selachians of the Carboniferous to the oyster-dredgers of the present

day, has varied almost indefinitely, and yet has continued to be an oyster,

unless indeed it may at certain portions of its career have temporarily

assumed the disguise of a Gryphasa or an Exogyra. The history of such
an animal deserves to be traced with care, and much curious information
respecting it will be found in the report which I have cited.

    But in these respects the oyster is merely an example of many forms.

Similar considerations apply to all those Pliocene and Pleistocene mollusks

which are found in the raised sea-bottoms of Norway and Scotland, on
the top of Moel Tryfaen in Wales, and at similar great heights on the
hills of America, many of which can be traced back to early Tertiary

times, and can be found to have extended themselves over all the seas
of the northern hemisphere. They apply in like manner to the ferns,

the conifers, and the angiosperms, many of which we can now follow
without even specific change to the Eocene and Cretaceous. They all
show that the forms of living things are more stable than the lands
and seas in which they live. If we were to adopt some of the modern
ideas of evolution we might cut the Gordian knot by supposing that, as

like causes can produce like eS"ects, these types of life have originated
more than once in geological time, and need not be genetically connected
with each other. But while evolutionists repudiate such an application of
their doctrine, however natural and rational, it would seem that nature
still more strongly repudiates it, and wQl not allow us to assume more
than one origin for one species. Thus the great question of geographical
distribution remains in all its force, and, by still another of our geologi-
cal paradoses, mountains become ephemeral things in comparison with
the delicate herbage which covers them, and seas are in their present

extent but of yesterday when compared with the minute and feeble
organisms that creep on their sands or swim in their waters.

     The question remains. Has the Atlantic achieved its destiny and

finished its course, or are there other changes in store for it in the

future ? The earth's crust is now thicker and stronger than ever before,

and its great ribs of crushed and folded rock are more firm and rigid
than in any previous period. The stupendous volcanic phenomena mani-
fested in Mesozoic and early Tertiary times along the borders of the
Atlantic have apparently died out. These facts are in so far guarantees of

permanence. On the other hand, it is known that movements of elevation

along with local depression are in progress in the Arctic regions, and a
great weight of new sediment is being deposited along the borders of the
Atlantic, especially on its western side, and this is not improbably con-
nected with the earthquake shocks and slight movements of depression

                                                                                             d2

whicL have occurred in North America. It is possible that these slo-w

and secular movements may go on uninterruptedly, or with occasional

paroxysmal disturbances, until considerable changes are produced.

     It is possible, on the other hand, that after the long period of quiescence

which has elapsed there may be a new settlement of the ocean-bed,

accompanied with foldings of the crust, especially on the western side of

the Atlantic, and possibly with renewed volcanic activity on its eastern

margin. In either case a long time relatively to our limited human chro-
nology may intervene before the occurrence of any marked change. On the

whole the experience of the past would lead us to expect movements and

eruptive discharges in the Pacific rather than in the Atlantic area. It is

therefore not unlikely that the Atlantic may remain undisturbed, unless

secondarily and indirectly, until after the Pacific area shall have attained
to a greater degree of quiescence than at present. But this subject is one

too mnch involved in uncertainty to warrant us in following it farther.

     In the meantime the Atlantic is to us a practically permanent ocean,
varying only in its tides, its currents, and its winds, which science has

already reduced to definite laws, so that we can use if we cannot regulate

them. It is ours to take advantage of this precious time of quietude, and
to extend the blessings of science and of our Christian civilisation from

shore to shore until there shall be no more sea, not in the sense of that
final drying-up of old ocean to which some physicists look forward, but
in the higher sense of its ceasing to be the emblem of unrest and disturb-

ance, and the cause of isolation.

    I must now close this address with a short statement of some general

truths which I have had in view in directing your attention to the geo-

Welogical development of the Atlantic.  cannot, I think, consider the

topics to which I have referred without perceiviag that the history of

ocean and continent is an example of progressive design, quite as much
as that of living beings. Nor can we fail to see that, while in some im-
portant directions we have penetrated the great secret of Nature, in refer-

ence to the general plan and structure of the earth and its waters, and

the changes through which they have passed, we have still very much to
learn, and perhaps quite as much to unlearn, and that the future holds

out to us and to our successors higher, grander, and clearer conceptions

than those to which we have yet attained. The vastness and the might
of ocean and the manner in which it cherishes the feeblest and most fragile

beings, alike speak to us of Him who holds it in the hollow of His hand,

and gave to it of old its boundaries and its laws ; but its teaching ascends
to a higher tone when we consider its origin and history, and the manner
in which it has been made to build up continents and mountain-chains,
and at the same time to nourish and sustain the teeming life of sea and

land.

      Professor Gr. Forbes.

The Committee on Standards of Light met repeatedly during last
winter. It had been proposed in last year's report to carry on experi-

ments on electrical standards in the hope of arriving at an absolute

standard of light. One of the first steps was to discover a means of re-
pK)ducing a definite temperature, and certain experiments were proposed
for this purpose. At one of the first meetings of the Committee Captain
Abney announced that he had already found a means of doing this in a
different manner from that proposed in the Committee's report and de-
pending only upon the change of resistance of the carbon filament. Under
these circumstances the Committee left this part of the experimental in-
vestigation to be reported upon by Captain Abney. His further researches
have, however, led him to believe that the law which he had announced

to the Committee does not hold with all qualities of carbon filament. He

has, however, been engaged upon further experimental researches, which
are almost ready for publication, and which have an important bearing
upon the labours of the Committee.

     In last year's report attention was drawn to the value of the Pentane
standard of Mr. Vernon Harcourt as a practical reproducible standard,
and Mr. Rawson has been since then engaged in a further examination of
this standard. Sir James Douglass has also made some experiments
which are not quite completed, but have gone so far as to give great pro-
mise. Some account of these experiments in this report had been ex-
pected by the Committee, but the absence of Sir James Douglass on
official business has interfered with this.

    At one of the first meetings of the Committee the Secretary showed
what he had done in the way of improving thermopiles such as it was
hoped would be of use in the investigations recommended in last year's

report ; and he was instructed by the Committee to proceed with the
constmction of the instrument, which has been completed, and is placed
before the Section and described in a separate paper.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Gr. H. Darwin,

    Sir W. Thomson, and Major Baird, for preparing instructions
    for the practical work of Tidal Observation ; and Fourth

     Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors Gr. H. Darwin
     and J. C. Adams, for the Harmonic Analysis of Tidal Observa-

    tions. Draivn up by Professor G. H. Darwin.

       I. Record of Work during the past Tear. Datum Levels.

Major Baird's manual of tidal observations is now printed, and will be

sold by Messrs. Taylor & Francis, Fleet Street.

     The Indian tidal results of all previous years, and those given in the
^^arious Reports to the British Association, have been reduced by Major
Baird to the standard form recommended in the Report of 1883. To these
have been added the results derived by the United States Coast Survey,
and the whole has been published in the ' Proceedings of the Royal
Society,' No. 239, 1885, in a paper by Major Baird and Professor
Darwin.

      In the course of the Indian tidal operations a discussion has arisen as

to the determination of a datum level for tide-tables. The custom of the
Admiralty is to refer the tides to ' the mean low-water mark of ordinary
spring tides.' This datum has not a precise scientific meaning, but, at
ports where there ai'e but few observations, has been derived from a mean
of the spring-tides available. At some of the Indian ports this datum has
been found by taking the mean of all spring-tides on the tide diagram for
a year, with the exception of those which occur when the moon is near
perigee. The diurnal tides enter into the determination of tbe datum in
an undefined manner. It follows that two determinations of this datum
level, both equally defensible, might differ sensibly from one another.

    A datum level should be sufficiently low to obviate the frequent

occurrence of negative entries in a tide-table, and it should be rigorously

determinable from tidal theory. It is now proposed to adopt as the datum
level at any new ports in India, for which tide-tables are to be issued, a
datum to be called ' the Indian spring low- water mark,' and which is to
be below mean sea-level by the sum of the mean semi-ranges of the tides
Mg, S2, Ki, O ; or, in the notation used below,

below mean water mark.
     This datum is found to agree pretty nearly with the Admii'alty datum,

but is usually a few inches lower. The definition is not founded on any
precise theoretical considerations, but it satisfies the conditions of a good
datum, and is precisely referable to tidal theory.

     If, when further observations are made, it is found that the values of
the several H's require correction, it is not proposed that the datum level
e;hall be altered accordingly, but when once fixed it is to be always

adhered to.

                     § 1. Harmonic Analysis.

    Having been asked to write an article on the tides in a new edition of
the ' Admiralty Scientific Manual,' now in the press, I thought it would
be useful to show how harmonic analysis might be applied to the reduc-
tion of a short series of tidal observations, such as might be made when a
ship lies for a fortnight or a month in a port.

     The process of harmonic analysis, as applicable to a year of continuous
observation, needs some modification for a short series, and as it was not
possible to explain the reasons for the rules laid down within the limits of

the article, it seems desirable to place on record an explanation of the

instructions given.

The observations to be treated are supposed to consist of hourly ob-

servations extending over a fortnight or a month. In the reduction of a
long series of observations the various tides are disentangled from one

another by means of an appropriate grouping of the hourly observations.

When, however, the series is short, the method of grouping is not suflB-

cient in all cases.

     With the amount of observation supposed to be available, a determina-

tion of the elliptic tides was not possible, and it was therefore proposed to

--consider only the tides Mj, Sg, K,, Kj, 0, P that is to say, the principal

lunar, solar, and luni-solar semidiurnal tides, and the luni-solar, lunar,

and solar diurnal tides. The luni-solar and solar semidiurnal tides have,
however, so nearly the same speed that we cannot hope for a direct
separation of them by the grouping of the hourly values, and we must

have recourse to theory for completing the process ; and the like is true

of the luni-solar and solar diurnal tides.

    Also, the tides K, and P have very nearly half the speed of S2 ; hence
the diurnal tides K; and P will appear together as the diurnal constituent,

whilst S2 and Kg will appear as the semi-diurnal constituent, from the

harmonic analysis of the same table of entries.

It thus appears that three difierent harmonic analyses will suffice to

determine the six tides, viz. :

First, an analysis for M2 second, an analysis for                                                                                     ; third, an analysis
                                                                                                                                   ;  drawing up three

K,,for S2, K2,  P.

The rules therefore begin with instructions for

schedules, to be called M, O, S, for the entry of hourly tide-heights.
Each schedule consists of twenty-four hour columns, and a number of

Mrows for the successive days. In and O certain squares are marked,

in which two successive hourly entries are to be put. The instructions

for drawing up the schedules are simply rules for preparing part of the

first page of the series M, O, S of the computation forms for a year of

observation.

     In order to minimise the vitiation of the results derived from the

M sheet by the S2 tide, and vice versa, and similarly to minimise the

Ovitiation of the results from the sheet by the Kj tide, it is important to

choose the proper number of entries in each of the three sheets.

     It was shown in Section III. of the Tidal Report to the British Asso-
ciation for 1885 how these periods were to be determined. The equation
--42 REPORT 1886. .

by which, we find how many rows to take to minimise the efiect of the
S2 tide on the Mj tide is there shown to be

                                                           l°-01589582=14°-4920521r.

If r=l,      2=14-26                                             and  if r=2,  q=28-5.
                                                        ;

From a reason similar to that given in 1885 we conclude that, in

analysing about a fortnight of observation we must have 14 rows of

Mvalues on the sheet, and for a month's observation 29 rows of values.

    Similarly, to minimise the efiect of the Mj tide on the S2 tide the

equation is

                                                                 l°-01589582=15°r.

If r=l, 2=14-76; and if r=2, 2=29-5.

Whence we must have 15 , rows of values on the S sheet for a fort-

night's observation, and 30 rows of values for a month's observation.

   MThese two rules are simply a statement that on the and S sheets we

are to take a period equal to the interval from spring-tide to spring-tide,

or twice that period.                                                                       tide, the

     Similarly, to minimise the effect of the K, tide on the

equation is

                                                                 l°-09803302=13°-9430356r.

     Ifr=l, 2=12-69; andifr=2, 2=25-38.

    Whence we mast have 13 rows of values on the O sheet for a fort-

night's observation, and 25 rows for a month's observation.

    OLastly, to miniinise the effect of the tide on the Kj tide, the equa-

tion is

                                     l°-09803302=15°-0410686r.

If r=l,      2=13-70                                             and if r=2, 2=26-4.
                                                              ;

Hence, in using the numbers on the S sheet for determining the

diurnal tides, we must use 14 rows of values for a fortnight's observation,

and 26 rows for a month's observation.

    Thus, on the S sheet we use more rows for the semidiurnal tides than

--for the diurnal namely, one more for a fortnight and three more for a

month.

The rules for drawing up the computation forms then specify, in

accordance with the above results, where the entries are to stop on the

three sheets, and give directions for the dual use of the S sheet, according

as it is for finding semidiurnal or diurnal tides.

    When the entries have been made, the twenty-four columns on each

sheet are summed, and each is divided by the number of entries in the

column. On the S sheet there are two sets of sums and divisions, one

with and the other without the additional row or rows.
    The three sheets thus provide us with four sets of twenty-four mean

Mhourly values ; the sheet corresponds with mean lunar time, the hour

being 15 -=-14-49 of a mean solar hour ; both the means on the S sheet corre-

spond with mean solar time ; and the O sheet corresponds with a special

time, in which the hour is 15-=-13-94 of a mean solar hour.

     The four sets of means are then submitted to harmonic analysis : the

Msemidiurnal components are only evaluated on the sheet ; the diurnal

components are evaluated from the shorter series on S, and the semi-

Odiurnal from the longer series ; and the diurnal components from the

sheet. We may also evaluate the quaterdiurnal components from the

M and S sheets.

     It might, perhaps, be useful to evaluate the diurnal component on the

M sheet, for if it does not come out small it is certain that the amount

of observations analysed is not sufficient to give satisfactory results.
     In the article the harmonic analysis is arranged according to a rule

devised by General Strachey, which is less laborious than that usually
employed, and which is sufficiently accurate for the purpose.

                      § 2. On the Notation employed.

     It will be convenient to collect together the definitions of the prin-
cipal symbols employed in this paper.

    The mean semi-range and angle of lagging of each of the harmonic

constituent tides have, in the Tidal Report for 1883, been denoted gene-

rically by H, c ; but when several of the H's and (.'s occur in the same

algebraic expression it is necessary to distinguish between them. The

tides to which we shall refer are Mg, Sj, N, L, T, R, 0, P, and K2, Kj

   H;

the and k for the first eight of these will be distinguished by writing

Mjthe suffix letters ^, 5, ,,, &c., e.g., H,,, k^ for the                                       tide. "With regard

Kto the   tides,  we  may  put  H",  k"            and  H',  k' .
                                                ,

     Again, the factors of augmentation f (functions of longitude of moon's

--node), as applicable to the several tides, will be denoted thus : for M2,

N, L, simply f ; for K2, Kj, f", f respectively ; for O, f^.

The K2, K, tides take their origin jointly from the moon and sun, and it

will be necessary in computing the tide-table to separate the lunar from the

solar portion of K2. Now, the ratio of the lunar to the solar tide-generat-

ing force is such that ·683H" is the lunar portion and '31711" is the solar

portion of H".

     In the Report of 1885 a slightly different notation was employed for
the H's and /c's, but it is easy to see how the results of that Report are to

be transformed into the present notation.

    As in the Report of 1883, we write t, h, s for local mean solar hour-
angle, sun's and moon's mean longitude, and r, i,, v', 2i'" for functions of

the longitude of moon's node depending on the intersection of the equator

--with the lunar orbit ; also y //, t], a, tn are the hourly increments of t, h, s

and longitude of moon's perigee, and e, e, the eccentricities of lunar and

solar orbits.

Let p, p, denote the cubes of the ratios of the moon's and sun's paral-

laxes to  their mean parallaxes ;    0, l^         the  moon's and sun's declinations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

     Let P, P^, P' be the cube roots of p, p^, p'.
     Let A, A, be declinations such that cos^A, cos-A^ are respectively the

mean values of cos^?, cos-c^ : obviously A has a small inequality with the

longitude of the moon's node.

             § 3. The Reduction of the Results of Harmonic Analysis.

    We now suppose the harmonic analysis of the hourly means on the

'three sheets M, 0, S completed.

   MThe deduction of H^j, k^ and Ho, t:^ from the and O sheets follows

exactly the same rules as in a long series of observations, and the reader
is referred to the Report of 1883 for an explanation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       .

     With regard to the S sheet, the results of the harmonic analysis do not

separate the Sj tide from the Ko tide, nor the K, tide from the P tide, and

we have to employ theoretical considerations for effecting the separation.
     The semidiurnal tides will be taken first.
     The solar tide, as derived from a short series of observations, is of

course affected by the sun's parallax, and as the sun changes his parallax
slowly, the solar tide will follow the equilibrium law and vary as the cube
of the sun's parallax. Thus the height of the purely solar semidiurnal
tide as derived from our short sei'ies of observations will be p^H^ instead
of Hs, and this will be fused with the luni-solar tide K2.

     The schedules of the Report of 1883 thus show that we shall have as
the expression for this tide, compounded of S2 (with parallactic inequality)
and K2,

     =A2 P/H,cos(2<-».-,)+f"H"cos(2i+2/i-2.'"-K") . . . . (1)

    The theoretical ratio of H" to H3 is (see Schedule E, 1883) that of

·12662 to ·45631, or 1 to 3'67 ; and the tides having nearly the same speed,

we may assume k"=k^.
     Hence

has given the two components A2, B2 which are to define Rg, ^^ by the

equations

and if we put for p^ its value at the middle of the fortnight or month

as a mean value, and also put as a mean h^ @ , the value of the sun's mean

longitude at the middle of the fortnight or month, we get

The concordance between the two affords evidence of the utility of even
so short a series of observations as during a fortnight.

        § 4. Computation of a Tide-table. Semidiurnal Tides.

     The computation of a tide-table from tidal constants which do not

Ncontain the elliptic tides and L presents some difficulty, because the

total neglect of these tides would make the results very considerably in
eiTor. On this account it was found necessary to use the moon's hour-
angle, declination, and parallax in making the computations.

    We shall begin by considering only the semidiurnal tide.

     In the Tidal Report of 1885 it was shown how the expression for this
tide in the harmonic notation may be transformed so as to involve hour-

angles, declinations and parallaxes, instead of mean longitudes and eccen-

tricities of orbits.

tide, when written in the notation of § 2 is

     Now, observation and tteory agree in showing that k" is very nearly
·eqnal to K-g ; hence we are justified in substituting ».·, for k" in the small
solar declinational term of (8) involving ·317H".

      This being so, (8) becomes

                +A2=Mcos(24/-- /L£) M,cos(2i//,-/Li,)                                                                                                                (10)

   HIn the equilibrium theory each is proportional to the corresponding

term in the harmonically developed potential. This proportionality holds
nearly between tides of nearly the same speed ; hence in the solar tides

we may assume (see Sched. B, 1883, and note that cot ^ A^=^cot2 ^w)

that,

                      _co_s_^ .A317H"=3^1^ (H._H,)=H,,

and M^ reduces to

               00^ C  H.+3(P,-1)H            =  COS c                                                                                                         Marly

Now, since A,=16°-36=16° 22', sec^ A^=l-086, also P,3=p,, and there-

                        M,=l-086p, cos2 a, H,                                                                                                                        (12)

     In a similar way, according to the equilibrium theory, we should

have

                                      "3^(Hn-- Hi)=H,,.

Although this proportionahty is probably not actually very exact, yet

in our supposed ignorance of the lunar elliptic tides we have to assume

Nits truth. Also, we must assume that the two elliptic tides                                                                                                  and L

A=acos2A

A Bthen obviously «, /3 are absolute constants for the port, and and are

nearly constant, for their small variability only depends on the longitude
of the moon's node entering through A.

    Thus we have, from (9), (12), (13), (14),

--Similarly, /3 cos 25' B, the declinational correction to Knj, is called 22'''m-

    Now let A be twice the apparent time of moon's transit reduced to

ancle at 15° per hour, or the apparent time reduced at 30° per hour,

     Then the excess of the moon's over the sun's R.A. at lunar high water

is iA plus the increase of the difference of R.A.'s in the interval i. This

increase is approximately ^^^''^:,n, and at lunar high water the sun's hour-

angle is given by

     Since the difference of time between lunar high water and actual high

water never exceeds about an hour and a half, if we neglect the separation
of the moon from the sun in that time, this relationship also holds at

actual luni-solar high water.

graphical construction. If we take O as a fixed centre, O S as an initial
A Mline, and S a point in it such that O S=S, and set off the angle O equal
M M M Mto X, and
             Oequal to ; then        S is the angle n--((>, and S is the

height H.

The angle x increases by 360° from spring-tide to spring-tide, and

therefore one revolution in the figure corresponds to 15 days.

     MAs a very rough approximation, lies on a circle, but the parallactic

\ and declinational corrections ^iRm and c^Rra cause a considerable depar-

    ture from the circle.

     HThe angle f and the height are also easily computed numerically.

         If cos x is positive, let d be an auxiliary angle determined by

                           Mtan^ 6=:--. cos x,

These formulae are adapted for logarithmic computation.

             § 5. Correction for Diurnal Tides.

The tide-table has to be corrected for the effect of three diurnal tides,

designated O, Kj, P.

    If we write

                      Y,,=t+li-2s-v + 2'^ + W,

                      Y'=t+h-i'' -i

1886.
--50 EEPORT 1886.

then, in accordance with Schedales B of the Report of 1883, the expres-

sions for the three tides are

        O =f,,H,, cos (V,,-0,                                                                                                                                                            (22)

        K,=f'H'cos(V'-0,

        P =-HpCos[V'-.'-(2/i-r') + (K'-s)]

We have already seen in (6) and (7) that

        K,+P=R' cos (V'-k' + 0),

where                       -Q^.^3f-cos( 2

and © denotes the sun's mean longitude at the middle of the short period

under consideration.

    Then, if we write foHo=Ilo5 ^^^ diurnal tides, reduced to two, are

        0=Ro                cos  (V,,--
                                               k-J,
        .....Ki+P=R'cos (V'-/.'-^0
                                                                                                                                                                                      ·  (23)

<p and R', having a semi-annual inequality, may be taken as constant for

about a month, but must be recomputed for each month.

   VNow, suppose that we compute Vo and at the epoch, that is, at the

initial noon of the period during which we wish to predict the tides, and

with these values put

                                    Vo<|fo^/v-o-- at epoch,

                        V4^'=//-- ^-- at epoch,

then the speed of Vo is y--2tT, or 13°-94 per hour, or 360''-- 25°-37 per

Vday ; and the speed of is y, or 15°04 per hour, or 360°*986 per day.

Hence, if t be the mean solar time in hours on the +(/i l)th day since the

epoch,

        Vo-'.-o=360°w + 13°-94t-<ro-25°-37ji,

        V' + ^-..-'=360°n + 15°-04t-^' + 0°-986H.

+Therefore the diurnal tide at the time t hours on the (/( l)th day is

given approximately by

        0=Ro cos [14°t-- i:o-25J° X ?t],

        Ki+P=R'cos[15"t-^' + l°xw]                                                                                                                                                       (24)

If we substitute for t the time of high or low water as computed simply
from the semidiurnal tide, it is clear that the sum of these two ex-

pressions will give us the diurnal correction for height of tide at high or

low water.

    If we consider the maximum of a function,

        A cos 2n(t--a) + B cos n'(t-- /3),

where n is nearly equal to it', we see that the time of maximum is given

approximately by t=a, with a correction 3t determined from

             ....?t'=-Px 5^sin [15°t-;' + l°XJi]                     (26)

The computations are easily carried out, although the arithmetic is

necessarily tedious. Since two places of decimals are generally sufficient

for Ro and R', the multiplications by the sines and cosines are very easily
made with a Traverse Table.

     The successive high and low waters follow one another on the average
at 6h 12'" ; now, 14° x 6-2=87°, and 15° x 6-2=93°. Hence, if we compute

--14!°t Co 25^° X ft for the first tide on any day, the remaining values are

found with sufficient approximation by adding once, twice, thrice 87°
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

§ 6. Certain Details in the Computation of the Tide-table.

r It will be well to give some explanatory details concerning the manner

of carrying out the computations.

   --+The angle A is given by 16°-51 3°-44 cos Q, 0°-19 cos 2 Q, where

^ is the longitude of the moon's node. It is clear that A varies so slowly

that it may be regarded as constant for many months, and the same is

true of the factors f, f", f, f^, and the small angles v, I, v', 1v"

Approximate formulae for these quantities in terms of Q, were given in

the Report of 1885, and are used in the article in the ' Manual.'

To find the cube of the ratio of the sun's parallax to his mean parallax,

the following rule is given : Subtract the mean parallax from the parallax,

multiply the difference by 19|, read as degrees instead of seconds, look

out the sine, and add 1. This rule is founded on the fact that a mean

parallax 8"-85 multiplied by 19J gives 3 x 57", and 57° is the unit angle

or radian, whilst the sine of a small angle is equal to the angle in radians.

Similarly, the cube of the ratio of the moon's parallax to her mean

parallax is

             --1 + 3 sin [60(parx mean parx)].

That is to say, for the moon : Subtract the mean parallax from the paral-

lax, read as degi-ees instead of minutes, look out the sine, multiply by 3,
                                                                                                  e2
--52 KEPORT 1886.

and add 1. This rule depends on the fact that the moon's mean parallax

in radians is ^}q.

     For the purpose of applying the corrections c,R,,, ^2^1.1) ^·I'-'mi C2^,
r.>y, it is most convenient to compute auxiliary tables for each degree of

declination of the moon and minute of her parallax, and then the actual

corrections are easily applied by interpolation.
     These tables serve for the port as long as the longitude of the moon's

node is nearly constant, or with rougher approximation for all time.
     The declinational and parallactic corrections to high water depend on

the moon's declination and parallax at a time anterior to high water by

' the age.' Hence, in order to find these corrections we have to know the

time of high water in round numbers. Each high water follows a moon's
transit at the port approximately by the interval >'. The Greenwich

time of the moon's transit at the port is the G.M.T of moon's transit

at Greenwich, less 2 minutes for each hour of E. lougitude, less the E.
longitude in hours. Then, if we subtract from this ' the age ' and add the

interval i, we find the G.M.T's at which we want the moon's declination

and parallax.

     Thus at Greenwich, on Feb. 1st, 1885, the moon's lower, transit was
at 2'', and hence, corresponding to the lower transit at Port Blair of
Feb. 1, we require the moon's parallax and declination at 21'' Jan. 30,
G.M.T. The parallax at the nearest Greenwich noon or midnight is
sufficiently near the truth, and therefore we take the parallax at 0'' Jan. 31,

+which is 60'-0, and the excess above the mean is 3'-0, and 1 3 sin 3° is

1-157, which is the factor p'. Actually, however, we read off the correc-

tion CyR^ and the other corrections ^2^m, ^zh hr straight from the

auxiliary tables.

              § 7. On Tide-tables Computed hy the above Method.

    A great deal of arithmetical work was necessary in making trial of the

rules devised above and in various modifications of them, and I must

record my thanks to Mr. Allnutt, who has been indefatigable in working

out tide-tables for various ports, and in comparing them with official
tables. The whole of the results, to which I now refer, are due to him.
The following table exhibits the amount of agreement between a com-
puted table and one obtained by the tide-predicting instrument. It must
be borne in mind that the instrument is rigorous in principle, and makes
use of far more ample data than are supposed to be available in our
computations. The columns headed ' Indian tables ' are taken from the
official Indian tide-tables. The datum level, however, in those tables is
3-13 ft. below mean water mark, whereas ' Indian spring low-water
mark ' is 3-65 ft. below the mean. Thus, to convert the heights given in
the Indian tables to our datum 0-42 ft. or 5 ins. have been added to all

the heights in the official table.
ON THE HAEMONIC ANALYSIS OF TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.

54 BEPORT-- 1886.

instrument shows that on each of the days, 7th and 8th February, 1885,
there was only one high and low water, whereas our table, of course,
gives a double tide as usual. Again, on the 9th February there is an error
of 68 minutes in a high water. These discrepancies are to be expected,
since the approximate method is here pushed beyond its due limits ; and
for such a port as Aden special methods of numerical approximation
would have to be devised.

     In a table computed for Amherst the agreement is not quite so good
as was to be hoped; the error in heights amounts in two cases in fifteen
days to nearly a foot, and in two other cases to three-quarters of an hour

in time. It may be remarked, however, that the tides are large at

Amherst, having a spring range of 20 ft. and a neap range of 6 ft., that

the diurnal tide is considerable, and that the sum of the semi-ranges of
the over-tides M4, S4 (which we neglect entirely) amounts to 6 inches.
It appears also that the tidal constants are somewhat abnormal, for

H"=,4H, instead of H"=,.;j7H,, and further Hp=.^H' instead of Hp=^H'.
     Under these circumstances it is perhaps not surprising that the dis-

crepancies are as great as they are.

     Tables were also computed for Liverpool and West Hartlepool, but no
correction was here applied for the diurnal tides. The results were
compared with the Admiralty tide-tables for Liverpool and Sunderland.

In the case of Liverpool there were four tides in a fortnight in which there
was a discrepancy in the times amounting to 12 minutes, and four other
tides in which there was a discrepancy of a foot, and one with a dis-
crepancy of l.ft. 2 ins. It was obvious, however, that the agreement
would have been better if the correction for the diarnal tides had been
applied. The spring rise of tide at Liverpool is 26 ft.

      In the case of Sunderland there were in a fortnight two discrepancies
of 15 m., two of 14 m., two of 13 m., two of 12 m., &c. in the times, and
in the heights one discrepancy of 3 ins., and four of 2 ins., &c. The spring

rise at West Hartlepool is 14 ft.

      These two tables are quite as satisfactory as could be expected con-
sidering the approximate nature of the methods employed.

      Finally, in order to test the methods both of reduction and of predic-
tion, Mr. Allnutt took the hai-monic constants derived from our analysis

of a fortnight of hourly observation at Port Blair, from April 19 to May 2,
1880, and computed therefrom a tide-table for that same fortnight. He

then, by interpolation in the observed hourly heights, determined the
actual high waters and low waters during that period.

     The results of the comparison are exhibited in the table on next page.
     If our method had been perfect, of course, the errors should be every-
where zero.
      It must be admitted that the agreement ivS less perfect than might
have been hoped. If, however, the calculated and observed tide curves
are plotted down graphically side by side, it will be seen that the errors
are inconsiderable fractions of the whole intervals of time and heights
under consideration.

    When we consider the extreme complication of tidal phenomena,

together with meteorological perturbation, it is, perhaps, not reasonable
to expect any better results from an admittedly approximate method,

adapted for all ports, and making use of a very limited number of tidal
constants. In devising these rules for reduction and prediction I could
find no model to work from, and it seems probable that advantageous

raodificatioiis may be introduced. I spared, however, no pains to reduce
the labour of computation. Nearly half the work in forming a short

tide-table is preparatory, and would serve for a systematic computation of

tables for all time.

the expression for this tide is, in British feet,

                            --0-0579 (i-f sin^ X) cos S

Thus, at the poles this tide gives an oscillation of sea-level of 0-695 of
an inch, or a total range of 1 1 of an inch, and at the equator it is half as

great.

     In the ' Mecanique Celeste ' Laplace argues that all the tides of long
period (such as the fortnightly tide) must conform nearly to the equili-
brium law. I shall adduce arguments elsewhere ' which seem to invalidate
his conclusion, and to show that in these tides inertia still plays the
principal part, so that the oscillations must take place nearly as though

the sea were a frictionless fluid.
     With a tide, however, of as long a period aa nineteen years Laplace's

argument must hold good, and hence the equilibrium tide of which the
above is the expression must represent an actual oscillation of sea-level,
provided that the earth is absolutely rigid. The actual observation of the

19-yearly tide would therefore be a result of the greatest interest for

determining the elasticity of the earth's mass.

   A reduction of the observed tides of long period at a number of ports

was carried out in Thomson and Tait's ' Natural Philosophy,' Part II.,
1883, in the belief in the soundness of Laplace's argument with regard to
those tides, and the conclusion was drawn that the earth must have an
effective rigidity about as great as that of steel. The failure of Laplace's
argument, however, condemns this conclusion, and precludes us from

making any numerical conclusions with regard to the rigidity of the
earth's mass, excepting by means of the 19-yearly tide. The results

firmatory of Thomson's conclusion as to the great effective rigidity of the
earth's mass.

     There ai'e but few ports for which a sufiBcient mass of accurate tidal
observations are accumulated to make the detection of the 19 -yearly tide

a possibility.

    Major Baird has, however, kindly supplied me with the values of the
mean sea-level at Karachi for fifteen years. They are plotted ont in the

annexed figure. The horizontal line reoresents the mean sea-level for the
jjeriod from 1869-1883, and the sinuous curve gives the variations of
mean sea-level during that period. The dotted sinuous curve gives the
annual variations for a portion of the same period for Bombay. The full-

--line sweeping curve has ordinates proportional to cos 83, and shows the

kind of curve which we ought to find if the alternations of sea-level were

due to the 19-yearly tide.
     It is obvious at a glance that the oscillations of sea-level are not due

to astronomical causes.

     At Karachi (lat. 24° 47') the 19-yearly tide is

                                        -0"-0138cosS.

     The figure shows that the actual change of sea-level between 1870 and
1873 was nearly 025 feet, and this is just about nine times the range of

the 19-yearly tide, viz., 0-028 feet.

     It is thus obvious that this tide must be entirely masked by changes
of sea-level arising from meteorological causes.

    It seems unlikely that what is true of Kai-achi and Bombay is untrue
at other ports, and therefore we must regard it as extremely improbable

that the 19-yearly tide will ever be detected.

                                                                                            G. H. D.

     Scottish Meteorological Society in making Meteorological Obser-

    vations on Ben Nevis.

Ddeing the past year the work of the Ben Nevis Observatory has been

carried on by Mr. Omond and his assistants in a way that leaves nothing

to be desired. The twenty-four daily eye-observations have been made

uninterruptedly                                                                         and it deserves to  be recorded that,  as regards the out-

side observations, no hour has been omitted even on those occasions when

the wind blew furiously at rates considerably above 100 miles an hour.

The eye-observations, taken five times daily at the sea-level station at

Fort William, have also been made with the greatest regularity by Mr.

Livingston ; and with these are conjoined the continuous records of the

barograph and thermograph, the results of which are so valuable in

checking and discussing the observations.

    For the twelve months ending May 1886 the mean temperatures and

pressures at the Ben Nevis Observatory and Fort William were these :

at 9 A.M. of the 11th, about which it remained till 4 r.M. of the 12th,

when it fell either to a calm or the lightest airs from the north-east, when

the greatest dryness took place. On these two days the extremes of tem-

perature                              were  24-3° and     13-3°                           and at 8 a.m. of the 12th, while      the tempe-
                                                                                       ;

rature at the observatory was 23-9°, in Fort William it was 19*2°, or 4-7°

lower than on the top of Ben Nevis.

     During the twelve months the Sunshine Recorder registered 111 hours

of sunshine, which is about 19 per cent, of the possible sunshine. In the

previous year the hours of sunshine only amounted to 464. The extreme

months were July, with 162 hours, and January, with only 15 hours of

sunshine. The observations of the two years show that the annual period

of daily maximuin sunshine is the four hours from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M., the

means being 61, 67, 67, and 65 hours respectively. For the six months

from April to September the hour of most sunshine is from 8 to 9 a.m.,

the mean being 39 hours. From this time it slowly but steadily diminishes

to 36 hours for the hour ending 1 p.m., and from 4 to 5 p.m. the number

has fallen to 26 hours. The numbers for the five hours preceding, and the

five hours succeeding noon, are respectively 38 and 32 hours. The total

number of hours for the six months, from January to June, is 294, and

for the second half of the year 326 hours, the difference being wholly due

to the exceptionally large amount of sunshine in July and August 1885.

In truth the distribution of the sunshine through the year cannot be said

to be dependent on the great annual rise and fall of temperature, but on

those causes which bring anticyclones over Ben Nevis.

     The rainfall for the year ending May 1886 amounted to 128"34

inches, the largest monthly fall being 24-33 inches in December 1885 and

the smallest 2-85 inches in February following. The heaviest precipita-

--tion on any day was 534 inches on December 12, and 445 inches on

January 1 these being heavier than any previously recorded daily falls.

On the two days December 12 and 13 the precipitation amounted to

--8-86 inches. For five-day periods the following heavy falls are recorded :

for  the                              five  days  ending  December 15, 10-25              inches                                October  5, 10-02

inches                                January 3, 9-25 inches ;                            and September 16,  6-13 inches.
                                   ;

     On the other hand, the year was marked by the large number of days

on which either no rain fell or on which the amount was less than O'Ol

inch. The number of these days amounted to 126, being thus in the

proportion of two rainy days for each fair day. The largest number of

fair days in any month was twenty in August, and the least, two, in Sep-

tember. In the previous year there were only seventy-nine days without

rain, being thus forty-seven fewer than last year.

     In the meantime, the whole of the hourly observations of the observa-

tory, and the observations of the station at Fort William down to date

are in the press. The publication will appear as an extra volume of the

' Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,' and by this handsome

act on the part of the Royal Society these observations will shortly be in

the hands of scientific men in all parts of the world.

     In connection with the Ben Nevis observations the investigation of

the important question of the bearing of the results on the weather of these

islands steadily advances. The position of the observatory on an elevated

isolated peak, and that of the low-level station at Fort William, being

close to the sea and on a bank sloping down to it, renders this pair of

stations second to none anywhere yet established for the investigation of

some of the fundamental data of meteorology. Among the more im-
ON METEOEOLOaiCAL OBSERVATIONS ON BEN NEVIS.  61

portant of these is the rate of decrease of temperature with height, and

the rate of diminution of pressure with height, for different atmospheric
temperatures and sea-level pressures.

     In these aspects the double set of observations for the past two-and-a-

half years have now been discussed. The decrease of the temperature with

height is at the rate of one degree Fahrenheit for every 270 feet of ascent,
the lowest rate being one degree for every 284 feet in winter, and the most
rapid rate 247 in spring. This rate closely agrees with the results of the
most carefully conducted balloon ascents, and of those other pairs of
stations over the world which are so situated as to give trustworthy

results for the inquiry. Ben Nevis Observatory and Fort William Station
are among the very few pairs of stations yet established from which the

requisite data can be obtained, the required conditions being great
difference in height combined with close proximity, and the position of
the thermometers in situations where the effects of solar and terrestrial

radiation are minimised.

     The next point, and as regards weather phenomena the most
important point, to be determined was the normal differences between
atmospheric pressure at the top of the Ben and at Fort William for the
different air temperatures and sea-level pressures that occur. These
differences, or, as they are technically called, corrections for height, were
empirically calculated from the observations, and thereafter the departures
from these normals were ascertained for each of the five daily observations
since the observatory was opened. The results showed a diminution of
pressure from the normals on almost every occasion during the occurrence
of high winds at the observatory. In other words, in all cases when
high winds (30 miles an hour and upwards) prevailed at the observatory
the observations reduced to sea-level showed a less pressure than that
actually observed at Fort William. The differences increase with the
strength of the wind, and amount not unfrequently to the tenth of an
inch, and one day when the winds continued to blow at the rate of 120
miles an hour, the five consecutive readings showed differences exceeding
a tenth and a half. This diminution is doubtless occasioned by the winds

as they brush past the buildings, partially sucking out the air from the
interior, thus lowering the pressure. It was therefore necessary to

recalculate the table of corrections to sea-level, using in the new calcula-
tion only those observations which were made when the wind blew at

lower rates than 30 miles an hour. This recalculation has been recently

completed, and the inquiry as to the bearing of the Ben Nevis observa-

tions on the weather is being pushed forward.

      So far as the investigation has been carried, it is evident that rapid
and considerable changes from the normals, but particularly a more rapid
decrease of temperature with height than the normal decrease, as shown
by the thermometric observations, are frequently a precursor and concomi-
tant of storms of wind. This is only what might be expected considering
that such observations indicate a disturbance of the equilibrium of the
atmosphere. But when with this is conjoined a lower sea-level pressure, as

calculated from the Ben Nevis Observatory barometric readings, than what
is actually observed at Fort William ; in other words, when the barometric
 observations indicate a more rapid decrease of temperature with height
somewhere in the aerial stratum between sea-level and the top of the Ben than

 the thermometric observations alone indicate, then the indications of a
 coming storm become more decided. Conversely the absence of any

abnormally rapid decrease of temperature -witb height as revealed by all

the observations is seldom followed by storms of wind.

For a number of years past the Scottish Meteorological Society has,

through the courtesy of the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouses,

been favoured with meteorological observations from all the light-

houses,  the keepers  being  regular  observers                                                         of  the  Society                                            and  an
                                                                                                                                                                 ;

important part of their duty as such is to record the hour of beginning

and ending of all strong winds, gales, and storms which occur. The

observations, made since the establishing of the observatory in December

1883, have been plotted on monthly sheets, which show graphically when

storms   have  occurred  at  the  lighthouses                                                      and  on the same  sheets                                         have
                                                                                                ;

been entered for the respective districts all cases when storm-signals have

been hoisted under direction of the Meteorological Office. This investiga-

tion is still in progress, but the following results may be provisionally

stated.

     Leaving out of view those cases in which the barometer at the
observatory was lowered by high winds, as above explained, by far the
larger number of the remaining cases, when the calculated sea-level
pressure was less than what was actually observed at Fort William,
preceded or accompanied storms, and when the difierences were unusually
great the storms were severe and widespread.

     Again, neglecting the occasions during 1884 when the wind at the
observatory exceeded 30 miles an hour, there remain nine instances which

in the west and north of Scotland were not followed by a storm. On

eio-ht of these occasions the observations did not indicate the existence

of a disturbance in the lower stratum of the atmosphere between Fort

William and the observatory.

     The Ben Nevis Observatory may be regarded as contributing, towards

the forecasting of the weather of the British Islands, a body of facts differ-
ing wholly in kind from what is contributed by any other meteorological
observatory or station in the country. To the bearing of these observa-

tions on weather the directors propose to direct attention next year ; and

thereafter to use the results that may be arrived at in an examination of

the observations of the high-level stations of Europe in their relations to

the paths pursued by storms over the Continent.
     Mr. Omond, superintendent of the observatory, has compared the

results obtained from the registrations of Professor Chrystal's anemometer
with the estimations of wind-force made by him and the assistants on

scale to 12, and thereby determined the velocity in miles per hour for
each figure of the scale 1, 2, 3, &c. The highest figure for which the
doable observations were sufficiently numerous, so as to give a good

average, was 8, which was found to be equivalent to a rate of 73 miles an
hour. This wind-force is of frequent occurrence, and as regards the

higher estimations Mr. Omond estimates force 11, which occasionally

occurs, as equivalent to a rate of 120 miles an hour. This paper has

been published by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

    Mr. Omond has written another paper on the rainfall of Ben Nevis

in 1885 in relation to the winds. The investigation shows that, as regards

the rainfall, the winds arranged in their order of greatest frequency are

N., S.W., W., S.B., S., N.E., N.W., and E., the N.W. and E. winds being
remarkably few in number. As regards the total fall the order of the
winds for wetness is W., N.W., S.W., N., S., N.E., S.E., and E. Thus

the direction of wind with which most rain came during 188-5 was a little

north of west, and the quantity diminishes as we go round the compass

in both directions, until the driest point is reached a httle south of east,

the east again having a very low value. The dryness of S.E. winds is
remarkable. They seem mostly to occur when an area of high pressure
is moving off and a cyclonic stoi-m approaches from the west ; and this
dry character indicates that the wind shifts when the storm actually
reaches the observatory and the rain begins to fall.

     For the past two years much attention has been given by Mr. A.
Rankin, the first assistant, in making rainband observations, and he has
discussed them in an interesting paper, recently read before the Scottish
Meteorological Society, which, along with Mr. Omond's paper on the

Rainfall and Winds, will shortly appear in the Society's journal.

    A series of elaborate hygrometric observations was made at the obsei'-

vatory during August, September, and October 1885 by Mr. H. N.
Dickson, under the direction of Professor Tait and Mr. Buchan. The
observations have been discussed by Mr. Dickson in a paper recently
read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The results are of consider-

able value in determining how far Glaisher's factors, so largely used by
meteorologists in hygrometric inquiries, can be safely used. As regards

the i-emarkably dry states of the air, which form so prominent a feature
in the climate of Ben Nevis, Glaisher's factors are found to be altoge-
ther inapplicable, and the hygrometric observations will therefore require
a specially constructed set of tables. Copies of this and the other papers
referred to above will, when published, be forwarded to the Association.

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Balfouu
     Stewart {Secretary), Professor Stokes, Professor Schuster,
     Mr. G-. Johnstone Stoney, Professor Sir H. E. KoscoE, Captain
     Abney, and Mr. G-. J. Symons, appointed for the purpose of
     considering the best methods of recording the direct Intensity

     of Solar Radiation.

The Committee, in conformity with their last report, have had con-

structed by Mr. Casella an instrument of the following description :

      It consists of a cubic copper enclosure, 3^ inches square outside, the
faces of which are § of an inch thick. This cube is packed round with
felt, y^y of an inch thick, and the whole is faced outside with thin polished
brass plates, y^ of an inch in thickness.

     In that vertical face of the cube which is intended to face the sun two
holes are bored into the copper from above. These holes are equally
distant from the centre on each side, and are intended to receive the cylin-
drical bulbs of two delicate thermometers wrapped round with tin foil
so as to be in metallic contact with the copper. Let us call these thermo-

Ameters and B. In the opposite face of the cube there is one such hole

bored centrally into the copper, also intended to receive the bulb of a

thermometer, which we shall call C. Finally, in the very centre of the

enclosure there is placed the bulb of a thermometer similar to the above

which we shall call D.

     This last thermometer occupies the position that will ultimately be occu-
pied by the interior flat bulb thermometer upon which the sun is to play

through a hole, as mentioned in onr last report, only this hole has not yet

Dbeen constructed. The thermometers A, B, C, and have been carefully

verified at the Kew Observatory.

     It is proposed to place these thermometers in their respective holes,
to expose the instrument to the sun as it will be ultimately exposed, and
then to read the thermometers from time to time. If it shall be found that

Dthe central thermometer has a temperature which bears a nearly con-
Astant relation to the temperatures of the front face as represented by

and B, and of the back face as represented by C, the Committee will
proceed finally with the construction of the instrument. If, however,

Dthe temperature of be not related to those of the other thermometers in

a sufficiently definite manner, the Committee may require to reconsider

the construction of the instrument.

     The Committee have expended 91. 10s. 6d. and returned to the Asso-

ciation a balance of 101. 9s. 6d.

     They suggest that they be reappointed, and that the sum of 20?. be

again placed at their disposal.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Balfolr

     (Astronomer Royal), Professor Gr. Chrystal, Stafif Commander

     Creak, Professor Gr. H. Darwin, Mr. William Ellis, Sir J. H.

--It is with deep regret that the Committee record the death of one of

their number Captain Sir Frederick Evans, so well known for the valu-
able contributions which he has made to terrestrial magnetism. His
eminent scientific qualities combined to make him a greatly esteemed
member of this Committee, who now deplore his loss.

     The Committee have added to their number the following gentle-

men : The Astronomer Royal, Mr. William Ellis, Professor W. G. Adams,
and Mr. W. Lant Carpenter. They could hardly consider their list com-

plete without the addition of the first two names, and they are glad that,
although not members of the British Association, these gentlemen were
not unwilling to serve on one of its committees.

     Since the last meeting of the Association Mr. G. M. Whipple has made
a comparison between the method of obtaining the solar-diurnal variation
of declination adopted by Sir E. Sabine, and that of Mr. Wild. These

methods were applied to three years' observations at the Kew Observatory,

and the results were compared with those deduced by the Astronomer
Royal from the same three years at Greenwich. The comparison will be
found in Appendix IV. to this report.

     The Committee think that this comparison deserves careful study,
but they do not feel themselves able to pronounce as yet upon the com-
ON COMPARINa AND EEDTJCING MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.              65

parative merits of these various methods. Nevertheless, they are ol

opinion that it is highly desirable to record the daily mean values (un-

disturbed) of the three magnetic elements side by side with their solar-

diurnal variations.

It will be seen by Appendix III. that Sir J. Henry Lefroy has con-

tinued his comparison of the Toronto and Greenwich observations. He

--has obtained from the smooth curves that is to say, taking Mr. Wild's
--method results which appear to him to show that the turning-point of the

declination is decidedly later in local time at Toronto than at Greenwich.

Sir J. H. Lefroy attributes this to the fact that these two stations are on

different sides of the Atlantic'

Appendix II. exhibits, by aid of a diagram, an interesting comparison

of Senhor Capello between the diarnal variation of the inclination and

that of the tension of aqueous vapour. It is remarkable to notice the

great similarity between these variations ; a similarity which holds sepa-
rately for each month of the year. Senhor Capello hopes that these results

may be confirmed by a more extended series of observations.

The researches to which allusion has now been made refer to the

solar-diurnal variation, excluding disturbed observations. With respect

to disturbances Sir J. Henry Lefroy has continued his comparison of

Toronto and Greenwich, and his results are indicated in Appendix III.

    Professor W. G. Adams has, it is well known, made extensive com-

parisons between the simultaneous traces of magnetographs in various

places. He is at present engaged on such an undertaking, and the

Committee are in hopes that when this is completed he will give them

the benefit of his experience.

Captain Creak and other members of the Committee feel disposed to

consider the continuous observation of earth currents an important part

of magnetic work.

The Rev. S. J. Perry and Professor Stewart (Appendix V.) have com-

pleted their preliminary comparison of certain simultaneous fluctuations

of the declination at Kew and at Stonyhurst in a paper which has been

published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, No. 241, 1885. The

results are virtually those which were stated in the last report of the

Committee. The comparison is being continued and extended.

Professor Stewart and Mr. W. Lant Carpenter (Appendix VI.) have

Kewgiven the I'esults of other four years' reduction of  declination dis-

turbances classified according to the age of the moon. These are very

similar to the results of the first four years given in our last report. The

same observers give a comparison, extending over four years, between

declination disturbances and wind values, which appears to them to show

that there is some relation between these two phenomena. They are

anxious to continue and extend both these inquiries.

Professor Stewart has pointed out certain general considerations

which appear to him to indicate that the solar-diurnal variation may per-
haps be caused by electric currents in the upper atmospheric regions.

Dr. Schuster has likewise made a preliminary application of the Gaussian

analysis, tending, in his opinion, to confirm the hypothesis that currents

in the upper regions are the cause of these variations.^

    By this analysis Dr. Schuster obtains certain relations between the

Bolar-diurnal variations of tlie three magnetic elements which ought, in his

opinion, to hold on the hypothesis that these variations are caused by cur-

rents in the upper atmospheric regions. One of these is that the horizontal

force component of the daily variation ought to have a maximum or mini-

mum --at the time when the declination component vanishes that is to say,

attains its mean position. Another is that the horizontal force ought to

be a maximum in the morning and a minimum "in the afternoon in the

equatorial regions, while in latitudes above 45° the minimum ought to

Atake place in the moi'ning.        third is that in the equatoi'ial regions the

maximum of horizontal force ought to be coincident with the minimum

of vertical force, and vice versa.

These conclusions are considered by Dr. Schuster to be sufficiently

well confirmed by observations, and thus to render hopeful the first

attempt to apply the Gaussian analysis to the solar-diurnal valuation.

The appendices of Captain Creak (I.) and of Dr. Schuster (VII.) have

reference to this subject, and maintain the importance of some action

being taken by the Committee to prepare for a thorough application of

the Gaussian analysis to the magnetic variations. It will be seen fi-om the

remarks of Dr. Schuster that some time must elapse before observations

are obtained sufficiently good and complete to justify a systematic appli-

cation to them of mathematical analysis. This circumstance has induced

the Secretary- to lay before this Committee in Appendix VIII. a pro-

visional working hypothesis I'egarding the cause of the periodic variations

of terrestrial magnetism which has gradually gi'owu up by contributions

from various quarters.

While this Committee do not hold themselves responsible for the

various statements contained in this hypothesis, they would point out the

desirability of ascertaining to what extent well-known magneto-electric

laws may succeed in accounting for the phenomena of terrestrial magnet-

ism, and likewise the desirability of ascertaining to what extent the

magnetic earth appeal's to be subject to the laws of ordinary magnets.

   A preliminary working hypothesis of this nature might serve to elicit

facts while the material for the Gaussian analysis is being completed, and

it would add to the interest of the final result if we should obtain reason

to think that electric currents in the ui^per atmospheric regions are at

once the iraiaediate ratises of magnetic variations and the effects of atmo-

spheric motions in these regions, so that a knowledge of the one set of

currents might possibly enable us to determine the other.

In Ajipendix IX. we have a practical example by Mr. C. Chambers of

the method of reduction which he suggested in Appendix XII. of the last

report of this Committee. Finally, in Appendix X. there are some remarks

by Captain Creak on the advantages to the science of terrestrial magnet-

ism to be obtained from an expedition to the region within the Antarctic

Circle.

The Committee have drawn 10?. 10-^., and returned to the Association

a balance of 291. 10s. They would desire their reappointment, and would

request that the sum of 501. should be placed at their disposal, to be spent
as they may think best on the researches mentioned in this report.

--Dear Professor Stewart, In tlie appendix accompanying tbe last

Report of the Committee on Reducing and Comparing Magnetic Obser-
vations, so many valuable suggestions are made by various well-known

magneticians that I feel there is little left for me to add.

I have long noticed the difficulties attending Sabine's method of

separating the disturbances from the normal values of the solar diurnal

variation of the declination. It has done good work in the past, but
now the question has arisen, Has a better been proposed ? I think'that

adopted at the Greenwich Royal Observatoiy is better, and that the
whole of the Greenwich methods of reduction, as set forth in the pub-

lished volume of ' Magnetic Reductions ' of 1883, invite the attentive

consideration of the Committee, with a view to their adoption as a whole

or in part.

   _ I am, however, disposed to think that the method proposed by M. H.
Wild, of ascertaining ' the noi-mal daily path of the magnetic elements.'
has niuch to commend it, and is rather less open to the possibility of

individual bias than that of Greenwich.

     In recalling to the notice of the Committee Gauss's valuable memoir

' On the General Theory of Magnetism,' I consider Dr. Schuster has done

excellent service. Possibly the prospect of formidable computations has
prevented Gauss's treatment of magnetic observations from beino- hitherto

adopted, but if, as Dr. Schuster proposes, by selecting stations °the com-

putations may be reduced within comparatively easy limits, I would

suggest some such course as follows :

     (1) That the selected stations be fixed observatories provided with
the usual magnetogi'aphs of like pattern.

     (2) That the several Superintendents be invited to make a series of
observations for a year or more of the solar diurnal variation of the three
magnetic elements, according to a method to be decided by the Com-
mittee, with a view to their being treated after the method of Gauss.

     (3) That Earth currents be made, as far as possible, a subject of
observation at each observatory.

     In thus advocating the application of Gauss's method of calculation to

the variations of the magnetic elements, I apprehend that the most im-
portant immediate result will be the settlement of the question whether

the causes are situated above or below the surface of the Earth, and

consequently we shall thereafter be better instructed as to the path we

should follow in future observations.

     Although in these suggestions only future observations have been

considered, it is not in forgetfulness of the large and valuable series

already obtained, which all must wish to see made generally available by
being rendered in a common form.

             I remain, yours truly,

                              Ettrick W. Creak.

          II. Letterfrom Senhor Capello, Lislon, to Professor Stewart.

     Lately in studying the diurnal variation of the tension of vapour at
Lisbon, I have been struck with the great similarity of the course of this

     It will be very difficult to say what direct connection there can be
between the tension of vapour and the magnetic inclination, but the great

similarity of the carves (month by month), and also in the different

reasons (although the phases of the inclination are nearly two hours
earlier) make one think that at least the causes of the variations of these

heterogeneous elements are the same.

     One would therefore attribute to the currents of the atmosphere the
magnetic variations : can it be that the vertical currents which are sup-

posed to be the cause of the variations of the tension of vapour can also
produce the movements of the inclination needle ?

      It will be necessary to carefully verify this connection for different

places. I send you the diurnal curves for these two elements.

    III. Extract of letter from Sir J. Henry Lefroy to Professor Steivart.

    I have virtually finished the comparison of Photographic Records of

Declination at Greenwich and Toronto for 1850, and have made up mean

curves for each month from the undisturbed days alone, generally 7 or 8

in number (the total number for Greenwich is 99). On plotting the

means they give, notwithstanding the small number of days in some of

them, very regular curves are obtained, and they present a feature which

is new to me. Sabine never compared Greenwich with his colonial

stations, and has not, that I remember, remarked it. It is that the N. end

of the magnet reaches the most westerly position of the 24 hours from

1 to 1^ hour earlier at Greenwich than it does at Toronto. This appears

in  every month  compared                                                                                                      there  are  only  seven  ot  them, as the whole

    The detailed comparison of disturbed movements has not suggested

much beyond the fact that there is rarely any marked correspondence, and

that the movements are usually in contrary directions. I have transferred

be demonstrated by lithographing examples. I enclose a tracing of mean

curves from the tracings of undisturbed days, together with an abstract
of the numerical values. The Greenwich turning points agree very closely

with those at Dublin. That they are so much earlier than they are at To-
ronto seems to me likely to be traceable to some influence of the Atlantic

on the mean direction of the currents. I should add to my explanation

that, to obtain three months for the winter solstice, January from the
beginning of the year was grouped with November and December at the
end, as I had not the next following month of January.

     Senhor Capello has sent me his curves showing the general corre-

spondence of character between the diurnal changes of magnetic inclina-
tion and those of the tension of vapour in the atmosphere. Lloyd in
1849 ' showed that the area of the diurnal curves of declination gave
an annual progression closely resembling the corresponding progression
given by the area of the daily curves of temperature, with which the
tension of vapour is so intimately connected ; so that it would seem that
there is a closer connection between meteorologic and magnetic jjheno-

mena than has been supposed.

ON COMPARING AND REDDCING MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.                   /O

V. Note by the Bev. Professor Perry and Professor Stewart. Coi7iparison

                    of Magnetograms of Kew and StonyJmrst.

The existence of two magnetic observatories not veiy far apart, and

supplied with similar sets of self-recording instruments, affords a very

favourable opportunity for discussing the lesser variations that may be
Adetected in the simultaneous movements of the magnetic needle.
                                                                   first

comparison was therefore made in 18G8 between the declination magneto-

grams of Kew and Stonyhurst, and it was found that the ratio between

Athe changes at the two stations was a variable one.  further discussion

of the curves of 1883 and 1884 has lately been made by the Rev. S.J.

Perry and Dr. Balfour Stewart, and the results communicated to the

Royal Society in a paper read on December 10, 1885, The observed

difi"ei'ences in the declination ordinates between the turning-points of

certain marked fluctuations in the curves have led to the conclusion that

the fluctuations at both observatories follow the same general law as to

direction, but that there is apparently a slight diff'erence of duration at

the two stations in the case of some short period movements. In dis-

cussing the tabulated measurements it was assumed as a M'orking hypo-

thesis that the disturbances are due partly to true magnetic cJianges

and partly to secondary currents arising therefrom. The ratios of the

simultaneous changes at Kew and Stonyhurst show that the angular values

of the declination disturbances are in excess at the latter observatory,

especially when the movement is of short duration ; but these ratios

appear to be independent of the extent of the oscillation.

The Rev. S. J. Perry and Dr. Stewart are continuing this research.

VI. Note by Professor Stewart and W. L. Carpenter, Esq.

   We have reduced other four years of Kew declination disturbances aftei'

the method described in the last report of this Committee, and have

obtained the following result from the two series of four years each :

Supposed connection between disturbances and the Moon's age.

(0) = new              (4) = full moon.

    From this it will be seen that the results obtained from both series

agree together in exhibiting the same sort of fluctuation.

    We have likewise reduced the four years of Kew declination disturb-

ance, 1870-73, with the view of determining whether there is any
apparent connection between wind values and magnetic disturbances. In
doing this we have adopted the following procedure :

       We1. have obtained, by the kindness of the Kew Committee, the

              total amount in miles gone over by the wind at Kew for each

                  day of the years 1870-73, and have then converted these into

                   daily averages of three days. Let us call this table A.
76 REPOET-- 1886.

       We2. have next obtained a table B, where eacb day's value is the

                   average of 25 days of table A, all being properly placed ·with

                     respect of dates.

       A3. Taking the difference between the entries of tables and B, we

                obtain a series representing departures from the mean ^lus

         --when in excess, and minus when in deficiency whicb may be

                  taken to represent wind weather.
          4. The declination aggregate daily disturbance numbers have been

                treated in exactly the same way as the wind numbers, and the
                differences obtained may be taken to represent dishirbance

                     weather.

          5. The values representing wind weather have then been formed
               into series of twelve terms each, so chosen that maximnm wind
                 values come together at the middle of each series. The series
                 are then added up. The result is given in (a).

          6. The declination disturbance weather values have then been
                 arranged into series of twelve each, so that each entry is two

                    days previous in date to the corresponding entry in (a). Call

                 this (/3) when added up.
          7. The values representing wind weather have next been formed

                into series of twelve terms each, so chosen that minimum wind
                 values come together at the middle of each series. Let this be
                  added up and called (y).
          8. The declination disturbance weather values have then been
                 arranged into series of twelve each, so that each entry is two

                    days previous in date to the corresponding entry in (y). This
                  is added up and called (o).

     The results of these tables are given below :

        (a) Wind weather arranged so that max. values represent middle

                      of series.

                      -2384-1655-101 + 220.5 + 5935 + 7431 + 7022
                              + 4157 + 2401-360-1667-2196.

           (/J) Dec. disturbance values so arranged that each entry of (/3) is
                  two days previous to each entry of (o).

                                   + 1067 + 588 + 33-186.

          (y) Wind values arranged so that min. values represent middle of

                          series.

                             -4740-3322-1680 + 1074 + 3196.

            (2) Dec. disturbance values so arranged that each entry of (2) is
                  two days previous to each entry of (y).

                     + 679 + 177-474-1022-1227-587-260-367
                                  -1041-980-535 + 116.

     From this it would appear that high disturbance values correspond

with and slightly precede high wind values. It is our intention to reduce

all the available Kew observations in this way, and ultimately to present

 the result to the Royal Society.
ON COMPARING AND REDUCING MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.  77

'VU. Report to the Secretary of the Committee of the British Association
       appointedfor the purpose of considering the best means of comparing and

        reducing magnetic observations.

     In the suggestions which I submitted to the Committee last year I
proposed that the method of spherical harmonics employed by Gauss

should be applied to the periodic variations of terrestrial magnetism. I
have in the course of the past year examined by this method the principal
term of the solar diurnal variation ; and I hope that the results obtained
will induce the Committee to continue the examination in greater detail
of the same variation, and also the other periodic changes. Assuming
that the Committee is willing to adopt a course of action which must
necessarily lead to results of primary importance, I venture to submit to

them more definite proposals.
     If we had eight magnetic stations separated as far as possible we

should be able to obtain a fairly complete expression of the general distri-
bution of magnetic potential on the surface of the earth. For the expan-
sion in spherical harmonics, including terms of the third order, involves
fifteen constants, while the horizontal components of magnetic force at
 each of the eight stations would give us sixteen quantities to determine

them. As far as I can judge at present, periodic variations are not much

affected by local circumstances, and therefore harmonics of the first three
orders will in all probability be sufficient, as a first approximation at any
 rate. After obtaining the expression for the variable part of the poten-
tial, we can easily, with the help of the vertical component of magnetic
 force, determine the question whether the cause of the disturbance has

 its seat inside or outside the surface of the earth. I think, therefore, that

we should endeavour to obtain a complete record during a period of about

 ten years of the elements of terrestrial magnetism at eight stations, and
 that these should be reduced in exactly the same manner, under the super-
 intendence of the Committee.

     As it is important to proceed without delay, we must choose stations

 at which self- registering instruments are at present in existence. I think
 the following will be the most suitable : Lisbon, Greenwich or Kew, St.

 Petersburg, Bombay, Mauritius, Melbourne, Zi Ka Wei (China), Toronto,

 or Washington. It is a matter of regret that South America is not re-
 presented, but I do not think the deficiency is sufficiently great to justify

 delay.

       I should propose, then

      (1) To write to the chief observers at these stations at once, asking them

 for such information as will enable us to judge whether the instruments
 are in good condition, whether sufficient precautions are taken to elimi-
 nate temperature variations, and whether they are willing to pay par-
 ticular attention to the magnetic instraments for a period of ten years.

      (2) To ask these observers how far they are willing to undertake

 the reduction of their observations according to a scheme submitted to
 them by the Committee, and, in case they cannot undertake this, whether
 they are willing to forward to the Committee the necessary records.

      (53) To obtain an estimate of the cost of the reductions, which will
 have to be undertaken by the Committee.
78 REPORT-- 1886.

I cannot help thinking that on inquiry a good many difficulties which

have been raised will be found to disappear, and that in view of the great

importance of the subject the necessary funds will be forthcoming when-

ever a definite scheme is proposed which will lead to certain results.

The secular variation of terrestrial magnetism will probably require a

different treatment. Captain Creak has' informed the Committee that a

large number of observations of declination, inclination, and total force

distributed over the world have been collected by the late Sir Frederick

Evans and himself, and that he has already exhibited on a globe at a

recent soiree of the Royal Society some leading results of the distribution

of the secular change for the epoch 1880. The Committee should, in

my opinion, collect and tabulate all available records of the secular varia-

Wetions of the three components of the magnetic force.  cannot decide

on the best method of reduction until the material has been collected.

                 VIII. liemarJis on a Provisional WorJdng Hypothesis.

                            By Professor Balfour Stewart.

     1. From various quarters there have been brought together the
elements of what may be termed a provisional working hypothesis with

respect to the main causes of the periodical variations of terrestrial
magnetism.

      In this hypothesis it is supposed that electric currents in the upper

regions of the atmosphere may be the main immediate causes of the

periodical non-disturbance variations of the magnet, while small bat
abrupt changes in the magnetism of the earth along with secondary or
induced currents in the earth's moist conducting strata and also (occasion-
ally at least) in the upper atmospheric regions, in times of auroras, called

forth by these changes may account for the disturbance variations of the

masnetic needle. It will thus at once be seen that the regular variations
are supposed to be mainly due to a cause above the needle, while the
irregular variations are supposed to be mainly due to a cause beneath

the needle.

     2. The electric currents in the upper atmospheric regions which
cause the regular variations are supposed to originate in the motion of a
conductor (rarefied air) across lines of magnetic force, and it is supposed

that such electric currents will vary in the first place according to the
power of the sim as exercised in producing these atmospheric motions,
and ill the second place according to the temperature of the moving strata,
it having been remarked by Professor Stokes that such strata will become
better conductors as their temperature inci'eases. This increase in the

temperature of such strata may either be due to an increase in the sun's

radiation of such rays as are absorbed by these strata, or to a change in

their constitution with respect to aqueous vapour, a substance which may

be presumed to possess strong absorptive power for certain rays.
     3. With regard to the solar diarnal variation, the most pi'ominenfc

feature is the very simple character of this variation as far as the element
of declination is concerned. For the average of a year, and for all but

high latitudes, this variation may be represented as if due to positive electric
currents in the upper atmospheric regions flowing during those hours when

the sun has most power from the equator to the poles ; that is to say, from
ON COMPARING AND REDUCING MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.  79

 south to north in the northern, and from north to south in the southern

hemisphere, and producing about- 2 p.m. a maximum westerly deflection

 of the north-seeking pole of the magnet in the northern hemisphere,

 while that in the southern hemisphere for the same pole is of an opposite

 character, being easterly.

     4. Again we know that the air in the upper atmospheric regions

 travels from the equator to the poles, forming (in those regions) a south-

 west current in the northern hemisphere, and a north-west current in
 the southern hemisphere, these being, in fact, the well-known anti-trades.
 If, then, owing to their passage across the earth's lines of force, these
moving conductors are animated by electric currents, these currents
 mast, according to the well-known law, be in such a direction as to stop
 the atmospheric motions.'

     5. For the purpose of the following argument we may without sensible

error imagine the magnetic eartli to be really similar to the model that

is sometimes used to represent it ; that is to say, we may regard it as a

globe wrapped round continuously with insulated wires all in the same
direction, and conveying a current, the circles of these wires being small
near the jsoles, and, of course, large at the equator. If we should take a
bird's-eye view of this system from above the point which I'epresents
the north pole (which corresponds approximately to the south pole of a
magnet), we should find that the positive current in the wires would
circulate in the direction of the hands of a watch, ascendino- on the east
and descending on the west side. Such hypothetical currents may, there-
foi-e, be imagined to move along the earth's surface from east to west.

     6. Let us now take the upper systems of atmospheric currents and

consider that element of their motion which is from west to east. This

motion is common to both systems. If in the northern hemisphere these

upper winds be animated by a positive electric curi-ent goino- north,

this current will be attracted by the hypothetical magnetic current on
the west side and repelled on the east ; that is to say, there will be a
tendency to stop the easterly motion of the atmospheric current. In the

same way it may be shown that if in the southern hemisphere the upper

winds be animated by a positive current going south, this will tend to
stop the easterly motion of the atmospheric cui-rent.

      7. It thus appears that the electric currents with which, accordino- to
this argument, the upper trade-winds in the two hemispheres ouo-ht
to be animated are precisely such as will account for the solar-diurnal

variation of declination, this being alike the most prominent and the most

simple feature of the solar-diurnal variations.

     8. While it is advocated that the provisional working hypothesis thus
accounts, as far as direction is concerned, for the positive currents going

--north and south which are presumed to be the main causes of the
--diurnal variation of declination it is also necessary to remark that such

currents will naturally present a decided diurnal fluctuation. Indeed, if
this were not the case, they could not properly account for a variation

one marked feature of which is its prominence during the day as dis-

tinguished from the night hours. Now we may conceive that the upper

atmospheric currents maij be stronger, and will at any rate be better

     ' Sir J. Henry Lefroj' lias long been of opinion that the key to the mao-netic
movements in both liemispheres is to be found by studying the simultaneous effects
in both produced bv the action of the sun on the equator (see p 18'> of his

'Survey,' 1851).
80 REPOBT-- 1886.

conductors when heated by the sun, and hence, through a diminution
of resistance, the electric current will be increased. The curious
similarity detected by Senhor Capello between the diurnal variation of
the magnetic dip and that of the tension of aqueous vapour (see Appendix
II. to this report) might perhaps seem to point to a variation of

absorptive power, and hence of electric conductivity brought about in
certain atmospheric strata by the carriage of aqueous vapour.

     Again, Sir G. B. Airy (see appendix to the Greenwich observations,
1884) has expressed his opinion that the diurnal magnetic inequality is
due mainly, if not entii-ely, to the radiant heat of the sun, and he is also
led to imagine that the magnetic effect of the sun's heat upon the sea is
considerably greater than the effect on land ; while again Sir J. Henry
Lefroy (see Appendix III. to this report) having observed a difference in
the time of turning between the solar-diurnal variation of declination at
Toronto and at Greenwich, has expressed his belief that this difference is
due to the fact that these two places are differently situated with regard

to the Atlantic.

     9. The fact that the solar-diurnal variation is greater at times of

maximum than at times of minimum sun-spot frequency is explained by

the advocates of this hypothesis on the assumption that not only is the
sun most powerful on the former occasions, but that the solar radiation
then contains probably a larger proportion of such rays as are absorbed by
the upper strata of the atmosphere, while the composition of these strata

with respect to aqueous vapour may likewise be such as to cause

an increased absorption. This increased absorption means an increased
temperature, and hence an increased conductivity.

      10. It has moreover been adduced in favour of this hypothesis that
the tendency seems to be, as pointed out by Mr. William Ellis and by Pro-
fessor Stewart, that changes in the range of the daily variation of magnetic
declination lag behind corresponding solar changes in point of time.
This kind of behaviour is apparently inconsistent with direct magnetic
action of the sun operating as the chief cause, and points rather to some
indirect influence, probably caused by the radiant energy of the sun,
inasmuch as the changes and turning-points of such indirect influences

due to radiation are well known to lag, in respect of time, behind the
corresponding changes and turning-points in their cause. This subject
demands further attention.

     11. Hitherto we have been considering that portion of the motion of

the upper atmospheric currents which is from west to east in both hemi-

spheres. Let us now consider that portion of such motion which is from

south to north in the northern, and from north to south in the southern,

hemisphere.'

     Now, here it may be well to remark that it seems quite possible to

conceive a set of cui-rents to exist in the earth's atmosphere without
exhibiting a considerable diurnal variation. Let us take, for instance, an
ordinary electric current, say of a circular shape and horizontal, and heat
it by causing some source of heat, such as a lamp, to travel slowly round

it with a definite rate of progress. It will be evident that we shall have

 (assuming the current to be otherwise constant) no variation in flow due
 to this heating effect. In like manner, if there be electric currents in

      ' The discussion of this point is almost identical in wording with a similar dis-
 cussion brought by Professor Stewart before the Physical Society.
           ON COMPAEING AND EEDUCING MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                  81

the atmosphere which circulate round the earth in the direction of
parallels of latitude, such currents will not be subject to any considerable

solar-diurnal variation. For, while the conductivity of a given region

would vary according to the position of the sun with regard to it, yet the
whole circuit round the earth, which would always embrace a region
affected by the sun, would not have its total resistance altered, or at least

not greatly altered ; and, as there would be no cause for much alteration

of the total electromotive force, there would be no great reason for incon
stanoy of current--in other words, no great solar-diurnal variation.

    12. For the purpose of the following argument, we may consider the

earth to be at rest {i.e., devoid of rotation), and imagine that the sun

circulates round the equator in twenty-four hours. As a consequence of
solar influence we shall have convection currents in the upper regions of

the atmosphere flowing from the equator northwards and southwards

toward the poles. Whether these currents reach the poles or come down
in some intermediate region may be left an open question. Now, such

currents will not only be conductors, but they will form a movable

system of conductors, which we may suppose to be created at the equator
when they rise into the upper regions, and destroyed at the poles or those

intermediate regions where they descend.

    13. Again, for the purpose of this argument we may, without sensible

error,   regard the magnetic globe in  the way already mentioned                                                                                                                                                         that is to
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

say, as represented by a small globe, wrapped round with wires, conveying

currents that go round it from east to west. Now, if an external in-

sulated circuit of wire a trifle larger than the diameter of this globe be

supposed to travel from the equator to either of the poles, it will leave

behind it more convolutions of the primary globe current than it

approaches, and will therefore be traversed by an induced current in the

same direction as  that of the primary                                                                                         and  the continuous                                                                       travelling of
                                                                                                                            ;

such an external system might be supposed to increase the magnetic

power of the globe. Applying the same sort of reasoning to the earth

and to the convection currents under consideration, these may be imagined

to be traversed by equatorial electric currents, the tendency of which in

both electric hemispheres would be to increase the general magnetism of

the globe. For the reason already given such currents would have littlc-

solar-diurnal variation, but yet they would be dependent upon the state of

the sun, and would vary with it. For imagine a change to take place in the

radiation of our luminary, producing an excess of such rays as are greedily

absorbed by the upper atmospheric regions, there would be (as already

remarked) a sensible increase in the conductivity of these regions, eveii

if  the  electromotive force remained unaltered                                                                                                                                                                          and hence there would be
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

an increase in the supposed equatorial current. In other words, such

currents, while presenting no great diurnal variation due to the carriage

of a constant sun round the earth, would yet be eminently susceptible to
any inconstancy in the sun itself.

    14. Now here it will be asked. Have we any such phenomenon con-

nected with terrestrial magnetism. ? The reply to this question will be an

afi&rmatiye one. The late John Allan Broun has shown that we have

changes in the mean daily value of the horizontal force, which are aimnl-

taneous and in the same direction at places on the earth's surface very
far removed from each other; and the author of these remarks has

endeavoured to show that the changes of this nature as recorded by Mr.
Broun depend, as far as we can judge from somewhat imperfect records^

    1886.                                                                                                                                                                                                                r,

upon the state of tlie sun's surface, an increased area of spotted surface
coinciding apparently with increased values of the daily means of hori-

zontal force all over the earth.

     While such currents might be supposed to possess, as a whole, no dis-
tinct daily variation, yet at the time when the sun heats a tropical region

it might be supposed to increase the relative conductivity of that region
with respect to that of the atmosphere nearer the pole. It would thus
divert to the heated region an unusual proportion of the whole current,

so that we should have a maximum of horizontal force near noon in the
equatorial, and a minimum at the same time in the polar regions. This

is probably the case.

15. One chief object in giving prominence to this part of the subject

is with the view of advocating that the Gaussian method of analysis

should not be applied merely to the solar-diurnal variation of the three

magnetic elements, but should likewise embrace a consideration of the

simultaneous variations in the mean daily values of the elements at various

Westations.  must, in fine, consider the possibility at least of there being

in the upper atmospheric regions, not merely currents which present a

marked solar-diarnal variation, but others that have no marked solar-

diurnal variation, while yet they may be highly susceptible to changes in

the sun. The double method of treating matliematically not merely the

solar-diurnal variation, but likewise the simultaneous changes in the

mean daily values of the elements, would thus appear to be necessary

and sufficient for giving us the required information.
     16. If we turn from the solar-diurnal variations to those caused by the

moon, we find in this region likewise an attempt to explain the phenomena
by the same working hypothesis. It has been remarked by Dr. Schuster
that we Uve at the bottom of the atmospheric ocean, where lunar tides will

necesparily be small, and lie imagines that in the upper regions of the

atmosphere the motions caused by lunar tides may be very considerable.
Such motions would be subject to the same magneto-electric laws as
those caused by the sun, and we might therefore expect a lunar semi-
diurnal magnetic variation, such as, in fact, we have. The late John

Allan Broun has shown that the moon's magnetic effect varies approxi-

mately as the inverse cube of the moon's distance from the earth, a con-
clusion that would seem to point to some sort of tidal influence as the

cause of this effect.

17. Again, if this tidal iufluence be seated in the tipper atmospheric

regions, it should be greater durins: the day (when these regions are

heated, and so become good conductors) than during the night. Now,

Broun was the first to point out that the semi-diurnal lunar variation at

Trevandrum, in India, is .subject to this law, and his results have lately been

confirmed, in an independently conceived investigation, by Mr. C. Cham-

Webers, of Bombay.     might likewise expect that the lunar variation,

like the solar one, should be greatest at times of maximum sun-spot

frequency, and there is some reason to think that this is the case,

although the fact is not yet definitely established.

     18. There seems, therefore, reason to believe that the diurnal varia-

-- --tion of any one magnetic element the declination, for instance may

be due to the joint action of several causes, which we may, perhaps,

I'epresent as follows :

    In the first place, the sun may act in producing atmospheric motions

in the upper regions ; this would cause a solar diurnal magnetic effect.
ON COMPARING AND EEDUCING MAGNETIC OBSEEVATIONS.       83

Secondly, the moon would produce tides in those regions, which would

be the cause of a lunar semi-diurnal magnetic effect.

     Thirdly, the sun, acting as the moon does, would likewise produce

tides which would be the cause of a solar semi-diurnal magnetic effect.

     Fourthly, these various effects would be increased during those hours

when the sun is powerful, inasmuch as the upper atmospheric regions
become better conductors at high temperatures.

    19. If we now leave the regular variations, and turn to magnetic dis-

turbances, there seems reason to suppose that the earth, like any other

magnet, may be subject to small and abrupt changes of magnetism, and
it is quite conceivable that such changes may produce secondary currents

in the moist conducting strata of the earth, and likewise in the upper

Weatmospheric regions.  know, as a matter of fact, that there are such

earth-currents, and the observations made at Greenwich show that they

are intimately associated with the disturbances registered by the self-
recording magnetographs.

           20. The late Dr. Lloyd was the first to remark that ' the rapid changes
      of the earth currents are much greater in proportion to the regular daily

    Wechanges than the corresponding movements of the magnetometers.'

     may perhaps interpret this to mean that a smn U but abrupt magnetic

      change is associated with a larger earth-curijnt manifestation than

      another change of the same size, but of a more gradual nature. This

I would appear to be in favour of the view that such earth currents are

      secondary currents due to small but abrupt changes which take place in
      the magnetism of the earth. In conformity, too, with this hypothesis,

     ·cases may be pointed out where the magnetic disturbance, while rapidly

      varying, is yet altogether on one side of the normal, and where the cor-
      responding earth currents pass alternately from strong positive to strong

negative.

    21. Quite recently (see Appendix V. to this report) the Rev. Professor
Perry and Professor Stewart have brought before the Royal Society the

results of a preliminary comparison between the fluctuations of the

declination at Kew and at Stonyhurst (neighbouring stations), and have

derived the following conclusions :

     (1) In the very great majority of cases the angular value of the

declination disturbance is greater for Stonyhurst than for Kew.

(2) The ratio           "-^  is certainly greater for disturbances

       of short than for those of long duration.

If we add to these conclusions the fact noticed by these observers that all
the disturbances occur in couplets, we may be disposed to agree with them
that in the case of disturbance as exhibited by a suspended magnet there
are probably two causes at work, the first of these being a change in the
magnetism of the earth, and the second an induced current due to this

change.

     22. It would thus appear that in this provisional working hypothesis
the principle of current induction is brought forward with the object of
explaining both the regular and the irregular magnetic fluctuations. It
is sought to explain the former by the hypothesis that in the upper

atmospheric regions we have conductors moving across lines of magnetic

force, and hence animated by a current. It is sought to explain the latter
on the supposition that small but abrupt changes of the magnetism of the
earth by a method similar to that in a Ruhmkorff's coil cause secondary

                                                                                                           G2
--84 REPORT 1886.

currents in the moist conducting strata of the earth's surface and in

the upper atmospheric regions, which currents, as well as the magnetic

change which causes them, will, of course, influence a suspended magnet.

Why23. There is still left the question,  should there be small and

rapid changes of the earth's magnetism ? In reply to this it is argued

that we must regard the earth as we would any other magnet, the only

difference being one of size. Now, there are at least two known causes

which may operate upon a magnet to change its magnetic state. These

Sire first, mechanical disturbance; and secondly, a change in the electric
currents in whose field the magnet is placed : and it is asserted that the

changes which take place in the magnetism of the earth should be studied

from these two points of view. It is the second of these causes that has

hitherto been chiefly investigated, and magneticiaus have succeeded in

showing that disturbances vary with the state of the sun's surface, witlt

the time of the year, and with the hour of the day. Possibly, however,
considerations connected with the first of these causes might seem best

to explain the second portion of the preliminary results obtained by

Messrs. Stewart and Carpenter (see Appendix VI. to this report).

24. In conclusion, perhaps the strongest objection to this hypothesis is

that which questions the possibility of electric currents being produced

in the upper atmospheric regions. It may be said that while undoubtedly

rarefied air is a conductor of  electricity, yet it  is  not  a  good  conductor
                                                                                                                                       ;

and where can we look for sufficient potential to drive such currents

throuo-h these regions ? To this it may be replied that as a matter offad

we know that there are visible electric currents in the upper atmospheric

regions which occur occasionally at ordinary latitudes, and which are

very frequent if not continuous in certain regions of the earth. These are

known as the Aurora which, both with respect to the time of its occurrence

and to the disposition of its beams, manifests a close connection with the

phenomena of terrestrial magnetism, occurring at ordinary latitudes only

when there are great magnetic disturbances, and the disposition of its

beams having a distinct reference to lines of magnetic force. Besides,
con.oiderations of a mathematical nature induce us, as we have already

seen, to suppose that the solar-diurnal variation is due to electric currents

Wein the upper atmospheric regions.  are, therefore, justified in asserting

that there is no impossibility in conceiving a set of electrical currents

intimately associated with certain phenomena of terrestrial magnetism to

exist in the upper regions of the earth's atmosphere.

IX. Examples of the Application of a Modified Form of Sabiiie's Method of
     Reduction of Hourly Observations of Magnetic Declination and Hori-

      zontal Force to a Single Quarter s Registrations of the Magnetogra-phs at

     the Colaba Observatory, Bombay. By Chakles Chambers, F.R.S.

     On the invitation of Dr. Balfour Stewart, the Secretary of the Com-

mittee appointed by the British Association to consider the best means of
comparing and reducing magnetic observations, I submitted last year,
for the Committee's consideration, some remarks which had the honour
to find a place in their Report to the Association. Amongst the sugges-
tions which I then made was one for a trial application of a somewhat
elaborate process of reduction, the results of which it was anticipated
would, in some respects, be as definite and informing when derived from
           ox COMPARING AXD REDUCING MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  85

a comparatively short series of observations as those of Sabine's rougher

method when derived from a much longer series of observations. Such
a trial I have since been able to make upon the hourly tabulations
from the registers of the Colaba declination and horizontal force magneto-
graphs for the quarter November 1875 to January 1876 ; and the results

iire of so highly satisfactory a character, and bear so directly on the

inquiry upon which the Committee are engaged, that I deem it my duty

to place an account of them before the Committee.

    The process may be described as follows :

     1. Tabulations of hourly ordinates are entered upon monthly abstract
forms (Form A), which have the hours of the day marked at the head of
the columns, and the days of the month at the left-hand side of the lines,'
and upon these ruled forms the daily mean is taken and entered in a
column at the right-hand side of the twenty-four hourly entries of each
day, and the mean for the month of the entries in each hour column is
taken and entered at the foot of the column. Let us suppose this to have

been done for a given month, and for the two preceding and two following

months.

     2. Take the mean of the daily means for the first fifteen days of the
same month and the last fifteen days of the preceding month as the mean

ordinate for the beginning of the former month, and, for the present, let

the excess of the mean ordinate for the beginning of the next month over
this mean ordinate be taken to represent the progressive increase of the

ordinate for the given month, whether arising from instrumental change

or from secular or annual variation, and in allowing for such increase

treat it as growth at a uniform rate.

    3. On a blank strip of ruled paper cut out from one of the columns

enter the proportional corrections for progressive increase, to reduce the

tabulations to  the standard of the middle of the month                                                                                                                                                                                                                      these corrections
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

will be zero for the middle of the month, and equal positive and negative

numbers at equal intervals before and after the middle of the month, and

the sum of these for the whole column will be zero. The strip is to be

placed close up to each column in succession for reference in the operation

of separating disturbed observations.

     4. Apply Sabine's method of separating disturbances to each hour
column in succession, taking account of the corrections for progressive
increase entered on the loose slip, and calculate final normals. The

separating values adopted are for declination '048 inch of tabulation or
·00150 of force, and for horizontal force "078 inch of tabulation or -00334

of force.

      5. Substitute for each disturbed tabulation the higher or lower limit
for that hour and day of an undisturbed tabulation according as the dis-

turbance is positive or negative. The deviations of the disturbed tabu-

lations above the higher or below the lower limits respectively are to be
called positive or negative ' disturbances without the limits,' and the laws
of their variations are to be determined by the method that Sabine applied

to his 'larger disturbances.' In what follows we are to confine our
attention to the original numbers entered upon Table A, except where

these have been replaced, in the case of disturbed tabulations, by the
higher or lower limits.

     ' If the continuity of the record has been interrupted during the month, either

by accident or by instrumental adjustments, due allowances must be made to render

the whole month's tabulations comparable before proceeding further.
--86 EEPOET 1886.

     6. Construct now a new table (B), eact entry in which is the 29-day
mean of the numbers for the same hour in Table A, viz., of the numbers
for the day of the entry and of the fourteen preceding and fourteen

following days. The numbers of Table B for all the hours of a given day

we may take to represent very approximately the mean solar-diurnal

--variation plus a constant for that day, the average extending over the

lunation of which that day is the middle day. They will be affected by
progressive change of the values of the tabulations and by disturbance

within the limits.

    A7. The excesses of the numbers of Table over the corresponding

numbers in Table B, plus a constant round number, are now entered on
a third table (C). The numbers in this table will be affected only by

that part of the solar-diurnal variation which goes through a cycle of

change in a lunation, and by disturbance within the limits. On the left-
hand margin of table C mark the days of the moon's age, the number 1

being placed opposite the first day of which at least a full half follows

the time of new moon, and the other numbers, in order, up to 29 or 30.
If table C were calculated for each month of a long series of years it

would be practicable to re-arrange the days in tables, of which there
would be one for each day of the moon's age in each month, with a
probability of obtaining characteristic diurnal variations from the numbers
of each table ; but as the trial calculations extend over three months only,
these (November to January) were grouped together, and the days of
the moon's age were arranged in eight groups as follows :

          Group

where h is the solar hour, P is the mean period of a lunation, and t is the

age of the moon.
     Designating the variations for the eight different phases by (0), (1),

     These numbers are curved (in black) in figs. 1 to 4, and on the same
forms are curved (in dotted lines), for comparison, the results of a similar
treatment, but by Sabine's rougher method, of the long series of eye ob-
servations made in the winter quarters of the period 1846'0 to 1871 "0 in
the case of the declination, and of the period 1846'5 to 1873*0 in the case

of the horizontal force.

    We see at a glance that the black curves have the same general

characteristics as the respective dotted curves, with only such deviations in
form and range as might well be expected to be found in the real features
of the variations of individual quarters. They thus confirm the evidence
afforded by the longer series of observations that there is in nature

a magnetic periodicity of the kind that we have called the luni-solar-
diurnal variation ; but their special significance, and that to which we
would at present particularly direct attention, lies in the indication which
they afford that it is possible, by applying a suitable process of reduction,

to utilise short series of observations for purposes requiring a degree of
nicety that is quite beyond the powers of the older method.

     It may be worth while to mention here that each quarter's reduction,

carried out in the manner described above, occupies an Indian computer
of very ordinary capabilities about 360 hours. This includes the calcu-
lation of the luni-solar variations both for declination and horizontal
force. The computer of a temperate climate, with his greater natural
energy and better surroundings, would, of course, accomplish the work in
much less time.

     Examples are appended hereto of the construction and computations
of Tables A, B, and C, and of the combination of days belonging to the

(4th) phase of a lunation ; also of the calculation of the luni-solar-diurnal

variations.

      In the last calculation the variations are taken after instead of before
the combination of the numbers for the several phases ; this is to avoid
the inconvenience of having to deal with positive and negative numbers.

     The curves of fig. 5, exhibiting the regular solar-diiirnal variation
of horizontal force for each day of the month, are constructed from the
29-day means of Table B.

     ' In the curves for declination as sent by Mr. Chambers, the signs as given above

are reversed.

X. The Advantages to the Science of Terrestrial Magnetism to he obtained

    from an expedition to the region vnthin the Antarctic Circle, By Staif
    Commander Ettrick W. Creak, B.N., F.B.S.

      In Ganss's paper on the general theory of magnetism, published in

--England in 1839, will be found the following conclusions:

    T(1) 'It is clear that the knowledge of (or the component of the

horizontal magnetic force directed towards the west) on the whole earth,

Xcombined with the knowledge of (or the component of the hoi'izontal

force towards the north) at all points of a line running from one pole of
the earth to the other, is sufficient for the foundation of the complete
theory of the magnetism of the earth.'

      (2) ' Finally it is clear that the complete theory is also deducible

from the simple knowledge of the value of Z (or the component of the

magnetic force directed towards the centre of the earth) on the whole

surface of the earth.'

     Accepting these conclusions as thoroughly sound, and in no measure

altered since they were written by other investigators, let us now inquire
into the question how far are we prepared by observation of the earth's
mao-netism for a calculation of this kind. Thanks to the activity of
observers in many lands and over many seas during the years 1865-85,
we have been supplied with the necessary observations, which have been

utilised for compiling charts on a large scale of the normal values of the
declination, horizontal force, and vertical force for the epoch 1880 from

which the values of X, Y, Z may readily be obtained for a large portion

of the earth's surface.
      These elements for the zone contained between the parallels of 60° N".

and 50° S. are (except for some portions of Northern Asia and Central
Africa) accurate ; from 60° to 70° north latitude and 50° to 60° south
latitude they are less accurate. North of the parallel of 70° N. and south
of 60° S. are two portions of the earth of which our knowledge is far
more limited ; but whilst we have had comparatively recent observations
ill Arctic regions, nearly the whole of the Antarctic regions have re-
mained unvisited for magnetic purposes since the memorable survey
conducted by the late Sir James Ross in 1840-43, so that the charts are
correspondingly weak in those latitudes.

    A reference to the accompanying map shows that the Challenger,

whilst on her voyage from the Cape of Good Hope to Melbourne, crossed
the Antarctic circle about the meridian of 79° E. The magnetic observa-
tions during that period combined with those made at Sandy Point,
 Magellan Strait, since 1868, and some declination observations recently

made in the Soiith Pacific between New Zealand and Cape Horn in lati-

tudes between 50° and 60° S. give ample evidence that considerable change
 of the magnetic elements has occnrred since Ross's voyage. Of the extent
 of these changes our information is so limited that the old survey is of
 but little use in enabling us to complete the charts of 1880 with the

requisite amount of accuracy, and therefore the X, Y, Z required for

 Gauss's method of theoretical investigation are still wanting.

--is a woi'k of considerable labour tbe results would hardly be accepted

-as final until observation had done its work in every navigable sea and

on every shore open to the explorer, in proof of the theoretical results.

     It has already been remarked that we know far more of the earth's

magnetism from observation in Arctic regions, where the approximate

position of the noi"th magnetic pole has been determined, than in the

Antarctic regions where the position of the south magnetic pole is yet

indeterminate. Thus it appears that great advantage to the science of
terrestrial magnetism would be derived from a new magnetic survey of

the southern hemisphere extending from the parallel of 40° S. as far

towards the geographical pole as possible.

    For carrying out such a survey we have many advantages over our

predecessors in the Erehus and Terror, besides the benefit of their
experience. At Melbourne there is a magnetic observatory equipped with

all the most modern apparatus which would form an admirable base sta-

tion, whilst subsidiary base stations might be formed at the Cape Observa-

tory, and Sandy Point, Magellan Strait, for the use of the portable abso-
lute instruments. The survey, too, must in a great measure again be

carried out on board ship at sea, and here we have a powerful aid in steam

which would enable an observer in calms and moderate weather to obtain

excellent results by the process of swinging the ship. The observations

at sea might be accompanied with considerable advantage by observations

made with the portable absolute instruments on ice as frequently as pos-

sible. Ice is specially mentioned as being free from the local magnetic

disturbance which is common in islands and on i-ocky shores of igneous

formation.

But the valuable aid of steam, which enables the seaman and observer

to handle his vessel with ease and precision, involves a large increase of
iron in the ship in the form of engines, boilers, &c., and a corresponding

increase of trouble to the magnetician. Those who have read Sabine's

detailed account of the errors of the compass, due to iron in the ships

Erebus and Terror, will have found that the deviation of 3° or 4° in

the compass at Hobart Town, became 50° in the high southern latitudes,

which must have all but annihilated the earth's directive force on certain

courses and rendered the compass useless.

     Experience derived from the magnetic results of H.M.S. Challenger

and other ships of the Royal Navy points to a means of avoiding much

of this difficulty, as well as to the selection of a suitable vessel, and above

-- --all to a proper position on board considered magnetically for the

instruments. The importance of this latter point will be appreciated
when it is remembered that the errors of the observed magnetic elements

due to the direction of the ship's head can generally be eliminated by

swinging the ship, whilst those proceeding from vertical magnetic forces

--are constant for every direction of the ship's head when upright variable

when she is inclined at different angles of heel, and requiring frequent

references to a base station to ascertain their amount.

    On all accounts, therefore, it is necessary that directly a vessel is

selected for a magnetic survey, positions for the compasses and relative

magnetic instruments used at sea should be determined after careful
experiment, and all iron within 30 feet of them removed if possible.

      Subject to these precautions, a magnetic survey of the Antarcfic seas

might be made with satisfactory precision and great advantage to the

science of terrestrial magnetism.

First Report on our Experimental Knowledge of the Properties of

    Matter tuith respect to Volume, Pressure, Temperature, and
    Specific Heat. By P. T. Main, M.A.

 --Belation of Pressure to Volume ; Oases Regnaulfs Investigations, and

                                                   General Besults.

Before Regnanlt published his ' Memoires ' attempts Lad been made-

without success to detect deviations from the relation of pressure to-

volume required by Boyle's lavr. In his sixth memoire ' of tome sxi.

Rewnault describes in detail his arrangement for testing the accuracy of

Boyle's law for atmospheric air, and for the gases nitrogen, carbon

dioxide, and hydrogen. At a large number of pressures ranging fi'om.

that of a single atmosphere to that of about thirty atmospheres experi-

ments were made of the following kind : a manometer, at the middle of

which was etched a mark which divided it into (almost) exactly equal

volumes, as known by the weights of its contents of mercury, was

filled at a given exactly known temperature and pressure with atmo-

spheric  air, or the  gas to  be  examined                                                        the pressure was then increased
                                                                                               ;

until the mercury was forced up to the manometer tube, so that the top

of the meniscus was seen, by the cathetometer, to be just touched by the

mark on the middle of the manometer tube, the length of which was

about 3 metres ; the pressure was then again recoi-ded, and the ratio of

the foi-mer to the latter pressure calculated. If in all cases Boyle's law

applied with accuracy the ratio would always be 2 to 1. But it was

found for the gases mentioned that this was never accurately the case,

and that the deviation from this ratio was greater the greater the origi-

nal pressure, and that air and nitrogen under these conditions up to 'SO-

atmospheres were always more compressible than Boyle's law required,,

but that for hydrogen the compressibility was always Jess than Boyle's

law required, and that the deviations from Boyle's law were always

greater the greater the original pressure up to 30 atmos.

     For example, in the case of nitrogen the ratio of vp for, the original
and for the doubled pressure (which should be 1, if Boyle's law applied,

exactly) was

                      1-001012 for original pressure 753"96 mm.

and                   1-006784 ,, ,, 10978-20 ,,

the temperature beiug constant (4° to 5°) in each case.
     Again, for carbon dioxide the ratio was

      at 3-08°        1-007597 for original pressure 764-03 mm.
and, at 2-7°
                      1-1.53681 ,, ,, 9612-39 ,,

But for hydrogen the ratio was

           at 4-4°    0-998584 for original pressure, 969-19 mm.
and, at 8-95°
                      0-994460 ,, ,, 1183-06 ,,

     In all three cases we notice that the deviation from Boyle's law i&
o-reater the greater the pi-essure ; the deviation is much gi-eater for carbon
dioxide than for the other two gases ; for hydrogen the compressibility is-

less, for the others greater, than if Boyle's law were accurate. These.

results of Regnault's vpork have been confirmed by his successors within

the same range of pressure.

     In tome xsvi. of the Memoires, Regnanlt, in the third part of the first

memoire of the volume, determines the variations of vp for jjressures

from about one atmo up to not more than eight atmos for atmospheric

air  and   for  carbon  dioxide  again                             and for oxygen, nitrous                                                                                                                                                                                                                  oxide, nitric
                                                                ;

oxide, carbon monoxide, mai'sh-gas, cyanogen, ammonia, hydrochloi'ic

acid, hydrogen sulphide, sulphur dioxide. The variations of vp for

atmospheric air and for carbon dioxide agreed very well with the values

obtained up to 8 atmos in the former set of experiments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     and this agree-

ment is a guarantee of the general accuracy of the results for the other

gases, the gas in each case being tested and found pure and experimented

on at some fixed temperature lower than 10°.

     The deviations from Boyle's law were in all these cases found to be in

direction of greater compressibility. It should be mentioned that the

dates of publication of these two sets of memoires of Regnault were 1847

and 1862.

     The volumes, in each case, occupied by the gas at different pressures
were known by the weight of mercury corresponding to the part of the

manometer-tube occupied by the gas, and the pressure by the vertical

height of mercury supported by the gas, this height being corrected for

standard pressure and density of mercury : for Regnault found by special

experiments that mercury is compressible, and the density which at 0°

is 13'596 is at higher temperatures less, according to the rate of absolute

expansion of mercury. The results of these investigations are given in

the fifth  and  seventh  memoires  of                              tome xxi.                                             at p. 328 there is a list                                                                                                                                                          of

and the compressibility of mercury per atmosphere was investigated and
found (p. 462) to be -00000352, and for this corrections have to be applied
throughout the height of the column of mercury. It will be noticed how-

ever that for pressures of not more than 30 atmospheres the correction
due to this is inappreciable, and will in fact be drowned in inevitable or
unavoided sources of error. The constant temperature of the gas in the
manometer was always secured by surrounding it with a jacket through
which a current of water of constant temperature was passing constantly.

     Regnault, as Debray pointed out (see Ditto's ' Proprietes generales

des corps,' p. 17), omitted from his calculations the weight of the com-
pressed gas in the manometer, which being added increases the apparent
pressure of the gas, the increase in Regnault's tables being due to the
weight of a column of about 2 metres of the gas : a small correction is due
to Regnault's numbers on this account.

    Among the data required for the determination of the values of pu

mention must not be omitted of the atmospheric pressure which must
be reckoned and added to the pressure of the column of mercury.

     This outline must suffice to give some notion of the precautions taken
to avoid error, and the pains taken to secure an accurate determiaa-
tion of all the data required in these investigations, in which Regnault

obtained for many gases up to eight atmospheres, and for a few up to

thirty, the actual relations of pressure and volume, and the extent to

whicli in each gas Boyle's law is found to be, though appi'oximatelj true
for small variations of pressure, deviated from more and more as the
pressure is increased (' Memoires de I'Academie,' t. xxvi.).

     Some of the gases which Regnault selected were liquefied at the
temperature of the experiment by pressure alone, and in these cases it
was noticed that drops of liquid condensed on the mercury and on the
glass, and that while this was taking place quite a considerable diminu-
tion of volume was brought about by a small and gradual increase of

--pressure (p. 261). The liquefaction of these gases viz., H2S, SO2, 02^,2,
--NH3, CO2, and of chlorine and hydrogen chloride was known, having

been effected by Faraday many years before.'
     Andrews has shown ^ that a body in the gaseous state may be

brought to the liquid state by a continuous process, in which it is im-
possible to notice any precise point at which the gas becomes liquid, the
deviations from Boyle's law, which are hardly noticeable at first, being
gradually increased till the relation between pressure and volume is
not even approximately repi'esented by this law, the gas becoming on
still continued j^ressure less and less compressible, so as to finally be
undistinguishable in this respect from a liquid. It was thus shown
incidentally in the course of Andrews' expei'iments that for high pres-
sures the gases examined became less compi-essible the greater the
pressure, a phenomenon which was observed by Regnault for hydrogen
only, but not for the other gases at the pressures to which he subjected
them, i.e. up to 30 atmospheres.

     Before Andrews, Natterer had made experiments extending over a

-- --long time his published papers dating from 1844 to 1856 with the

object of liquefying and solidifying gases by great pressures, and he
found that up to 2790 atmospheres the gases hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
nitric oxide, as well as atmospheric air, beyond 100 atmospheres, were all
notably less compressible than Boyle's law required. ^"^ The general result
of the effect of pressure on volume in the case of gases at ordinary tem-
peratures as given by Regnault and by Natterer made it desirable to in-
vestigate this relation with all the accuracy attainable for a range of

pressures much greater than Regnault had been ahle to measure with

sufficient accuracy.

     Amagafs Investigations on Relation of Pressure to Volume in Gases.

      Amagat in the year 1880 published a paper, the first of a series, in
 which he examined air, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, marsh-gas,
 and ethylene as to their behaviour at given temperature at various pres-
 sures up to 400 atmospheres or beyond.''

      In these investigations Amagat obtained his greatest pressures by the
height of a column of mercury in narrow flexible steel tubes attached to
the side of a shaft of a mine of some hundreds of metres in depth.

     The principle of the measurement of pressures was the same, therefore,
as that used by Regnanlt.

     Yarious devices have been used by Cailletet for applying and measur-

ing increased pressures and Amagat suggests a plan which might be
                                                                                                                                                         ;

adopted, and by which the experiments might be extended to vastly in-

--creased pressures namely, having, e.g., detei'mined the law of compres-

sibility by a vertical height of TQ metres of mercury up to 100 atmos

pressure, we may extend it up to 200 atmos by exerting on the top of the
column pressures up to 100 atmos. But Amagat prefers the direct
method, and applies it up to 4B0 atmos ; though for the purpose of ex-

tending the results to still higher pressures he has ' all the apparatus

necessary.

   --One most striking fact which results from A magat's observations and

it is so uniformly true for the gases which he tised and for all the tempera-
tures at which he experimented, and whether the gas was or was not

liquefied in the course of compression, that it has the appearance of being a

--natural law is that for each gas beyond a certain pressure the law of

compressibility is more and more nearly represented by the equation

                              V (v--a)=b,

where a and h are constant for a given substance at a given temperature

and o varies but slightly for the same substances at different tempera-

tures.

    The curves by which the results are represented ^ have for abscissae

the values of p in metres, and for ordinates the values of ^ji? ; and for

above 180 metres the curve becomes almost straight.

    In the case of the gases liquefied (as, e.g., COo at 18°, one of the tem-

peratures of the experiments), as also of gases which, though not lique-

fied, were compressed near their critical points (e.g., ethylene), the

only regular part of the curve is that at high pressure, which is nearly

straight.

    For hydrogen the relation between pv and p is represented on the
diagram by a straight line for all except the very lowest pressures. The

temperatures for which Amagat obtained curves of relation of vp to p

were temperatures at intervals between about 15° and 100°, giving from

4 to 10 curves for each gas.

    So far we have said nothing of experiments made as to relation of

volume to pressure where the pressures are less than 760 mm., and espe-

cially when they are very small. Special investigations with this object

were undertaken by Siljestrom (' Pog. Ann.' 1874) ; by Mendeleeff with

others ('Ann. Cliim.' (5) ii. 1874, and (5) ix. 1876; also 'Nature,'

X.  1876-7) ;  and by Amagat  (' Ann.  Chim.'  (5)  viii. 1876 and                                                (5)  xxviii.

                                      Pressures below 1 Atmo.

     Mendeleeff and Siljestrom come to the conclusion that for small pres-
sures the compressibility is less than Boyle's law requires, and that the
limiting condition of a gas is that in which the density is nil and the
pressure finite ('Ann. de Chim. et de Phys.' 6, xxviii. p. 482).

104 REPORT-- 1886.

Amagat, on the other hand, finds the deviations from Boyle's law

--at low pressures sometimes positive, sometimes negative, and all within

the limits of error of observation in other words, he does not detect

any  deviations from  Boyle's  law for initial pressures  under  370  mm.
                                                                                             ;

any such deviations, if they occur, being unrecognisable at such small

pressures.

     There is, Amagat says,' no appearance of any sudden change in the
law of compressibility of gases at the smallest pressures to which they

have been submitted ; it is therefore, he says, well to continue to apply

Boyle's law to gases down to pressures of a few millimetres.
    As to the cause of difference between his own results and those of

-- --Siljestrom and Mendeleeff he suggests that at least for Mcudeleeff the

method of experimenting was favoui'able to giving prominence to a soui'ce

of constant error, such as a slight defect in the barometric vacuum,

p. 497.

     In 1884 Krajewitsch - attacked this question of compressibility of air

at small pressures, from 11-64 to 0'28 mm., with the general conclusion
that the compressibility diminishes with increasing pressure up to 11 '64

mm. ; and he remarks that though his results are not accurate quantita-

tively, there is no doubt of the qualitative result as substantiating the

conclusion he draws.

     The following results of observation are given in his paper :

                                  mm.

cation with a reservoir of mercary -whicli had been thoroughly heated

and dried, while the reservoir could be adjusted vertically so as to alter

the level of the mercury in the open limbs of the U-tube and therefore

to raise or lower the top of the column of mercury in the barometer-tubes.

One of the barometer-tubes was used as a barometer for comparison with

the other by a cathetometer ; the other was graduated and served for the
introduction of oxygen. It will be noticed that by the arrangement

described above the pressure of the same quantity of oxygen could be

increased or diminished at will by raising or lowering the reservoir of

mercury.

     After the introduction of the oxygen its volume in cc. is read and

the pressure in mm. of mercury at a constant temperature. Several
readings were taken at intervals of about an hour generally. No pres-

sure was finally read off after an interval of less than two hours, and

often the readings for a single pressure and volume were taken at inter-

vals of from twelve to twenty-four hours. Each result recorded is the

    The point which was alluded to above is at 0'70 mm. pressure, at

which this volume is (between                      limits) indeterminate                                                                                                so that if  the oxy-

gen is at the fixed temperature of the experiment submitted to a pressure

of very slightly less than 0"70 mm., and allowed to remain five or six

hours, the volume (and the p v) will be considerably different from that
which would be exerted by the oxygen after standing the same time at
the same temperature at a pressure very slightly more than 0'70 mm.;

thus on p. 472 {loc. cit.) for 0'70 mm. twenty-three observations gave as
mean volume 47 cc, and twenty-five observations at same pressure gave

52-41 cc. The peculiarity at this point has been verified by Bohr by re-

peated observations specially directed to it.

     As a confirmation of all these conclusions concordant results were

--obtained by using tubes of different internal diameter one of 18'5 mm.,

the other of 32 mm.

     Thus Bohr finds, for representing relation of pv to p, for oxygen at

pressures from 300 mm. downwards, a line very slightly convex and nearly

parallel to the axis of abscissEe for some distance, till from say 60 mm.
to 70 mm. it curves down very considerably ; and again from 0"70 mm.
onwards towards mm. another curve which curves rapidly down so as

to tend to become nearly vertical ; this shorter part of the whole he calls

about 20 cc. to 200 cc. in different experiments.
     The short branch of the curve he finds can be approximately repre-

sented by the formula

be disregarded when such very small pressures are concerned ; it may be

that the walls of the tube and the surface of the mercury are not wholly

    It must be allowed that Bohr has gone a long way to meet any doubt

on this head by using two tubes of very different diameters ; but further

experiments with still wider tubes, and with tubes of different varieties

of glass, would probably show whether the surface of the glass in contact

with the oxygen is in any way concerned.
     Some remarks of Regnault ^ in reference to Dalton's law of the

mixture of gases with vapours as a ' theoretical law,' and showing devia-
tions from it, due to the inner surface of the glass, are suggestive of such

an influence in other cases by analogy.
     Certainly, on the face of them, the observations of Bohr are remark-

able, and his singular point diflicult to account for in any other way than
the direct and obvious one ; and his experiments show the greatest pams

taken to minimise the effects of the possible sources of error.

    Regnault determined the dilatation of dry air by many series of

experiments and by different methods. Representing by 100« the whole

expansion of unit volume of dry air at 760 mm. between 0° and 100°, his

different series gave, taking the mean of the numerous determinations of

           1. 100a=-36623 with possible error -00140.

           2. 100a=-36633 ,,                  ,, ,, -00101.

     In the above experiments the dilatation was arrived at indirectly by

observing the increased pressure of air at constant vohime between 0° and
100°, and deducing by Boyle's laws the volume which the air at 100°

would then occupy.
    The mean of a fifth set of experiments, by which the value of 100a is

determined for expansion at constant j^ressure, gave

           6. 100a =-36706, with possible error -00025.

    Now air was found to deviate from Boyle's law in one direction and

hydrogen in the other direction when submitted to pressures of a few

atmospheres, and the efEect of the results here given is to show that both

these gases tend at higher temperatures to obey Boyle's law more nearly

than at lower.

ranging from about 20 metres to 320 metres. The gases treated in this
exhaustive manner are nitrogen, hydrogen, ethylene, carbon dioxide

      With the exception of the curves for hydrogen, each curve vt^as irre-

gular, the relation of ]}V to p becoming regular only after the pi'essure

was about 120 metres, or about 160 atmos, after which the result for any

-- =substance was expressed very approximately by the equation p (y a) & ·

where li was difi'erent for different temperatures for any substance, and a

was nearly constant for all the temperatures employed. In studyino' the

effect of Amagat's results in this paper in extending our knowledge of
Boyle's and Gay-Lussac's laws, it must be remembei-ed that the tempera-

tures were necessarily very restricted, being not over 100°, while the

pressures were very great. But the facts brought into notice by com-
paring curves for the same substance for different temperatures are im-
portant ; we will be content with indicating one or two of these.

     At high pressures, for all the gases studied, the values of piv at any-

given temperature increase continiially with the pressure, and are repre-

sented by an almost absolutely sti-aight line for the increasing abscissse p,
so that if p' and v' are higher pressure and corresponding volume

--«-  >1;  that  is,  the                                                                                                          gas  in  this   condition  is  less  comp^ressible  than  if

pv

Boyle's law were exact. The question arises, does this deviation increase
or diminish as temperature rises ? The case of any gas will do to try
this. Taking the case of hydrogen, we extract the following data

^(<1)pv(p. 378 loc. cit.) : if                                                                                                              is the ratio for hydrogen at 100m. and

320m. pressures, this ratio is

      at 177°                                                                                                                           0-830          at 60 '4°            0-853
                                                                                                                                        0-838          ,, 100-1             0-856
      ,, 40-4

whence we see that for higher and higher temperatures the ratio

approaches more and more nearly to 1, or the gas deviates less and less

from Boyle's law. But this approximation does not imply that Boyle's

law is even a theoretical condition for these very high pressures at much

higher temperatures                                                                                                                for a may approximate more and more, as tempera-

The Statical and Dynamical Methods of finding the Relations letween Tem-

Two distinct methods of finding the relation between pressure and

temperature of saturated vapours are used, one by readings of the pres-

sures of the vapour over the liquid in a mercury- vacuum at known

temperatures, and the other by the readings of a thermometer immersed

in the vapour of a liquid boiling at known artificial atmospheric pressures.

The first of these methods is called the statical, and the other the

dynamical  method ^                                                                   the  former  method is  only  applicable  to  moderate  or

ples of both are given in the case of steam,^ and the two methods are
found, when both are employed, to yield identical results for water.

In t. xxvi. p. 642, Regnault says : ' It is not evident a priori that for a

given substance the two methods (static and dynamic) give the same rela-

tion between elastic forces and temperatures. The boiling of a liquid is

in fact a very complex phenomenon. The vapour which escapes from a

boiling liquid has not only to contend against the elastic atmosphere

which pi-esses on the liquid, it has to overcome the attraction which the

liquid exerts on the molecules which have taken the gaseous state or which

tend to take it ; it has to overcome the capillary resistance of the liquid

walls, which form globules, more or less easily extensible, in which the

vapour is imprisoned while it traverses the liquid, &c., &c. These acces-

sory resistances can only be overcome by an excess of heat, and there is

the fear that the vapour may, on emerging from the liquid, possess at the
same time an excess of elastic force (pressure) and an excess of tempera-

ture. The two excesses may neutralise each other and disappear, more or

only against the pressure of the atmosphere acting on it.'
     Regnault finds that for substances of moderate volatility, for which

both methods can be applied, the two methods give identical results, pro-
vided the bodies are 'perfectly pure, but not otherwise ; he found that tbe
addition to alcohol, or to carbon bisulphide, of xwo- of ^ volatile substance
was in each case sufficient to disturb the two curves of either and to

destroy their identity. Among the subjects used by Regnault, and which

led to this conclusion, were ethyl alcohol, ethyl oxide, carbon bisulphide,
cbloroform, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide,

ethyl iodide, methyl alcohol, acetone, phosphorus terchloride ; these being-
some of the substances for which Regnault found (' Memoires,' t. xxvi.)
curves of relation of temperature and vapour-pressure by methods and
formulas similar to those used for water (' Memoires,' t. xxi.).

    When a liquid boils with bumping, as in the case of methyl alcohol,

liquid 80-2, liquid NHj, it may be heated with the vapour over it

to temperatures considerably higher than the temperature at which the
vapour in each case is, in the static method, in equilibrium with the at-

mospheric pressure (t. xxvi. p. 645).

   --Vapour-pressures from Solid and Liquid Regnault.

Regnault's experiments on the vapour-pressure on water included pres-
--sures for low temperatures down to
                                      32° i.e. for a long range of tern-

--perature during which the water is solid ice. Regnault found that the

whole curve was continuous, including this portion of it, and inferred

that the solidification of water made no break in the curve of vapour-

pressui-es; in regard to water he says (t. xxi. p. 609) it would be necessary

to make corrections of 3 or 4 hundredths of a millimetre, a quantity almost

inappreciable to observation, to bring about a complete coincidence

a  &a* c/?*, he says that the values of the vapour-pressure for

temperatures below 0° are constantly veiy slightly gi-eater than those

given by observation, and he therefore does not apply this formula to

temperatures under 0°. The fact is that the methods which were em-

ployed were not of a nature to show at once that the vapour-pressure

from solid water helow 0° and liquid water ahove 0° formed two curves

meeting at an angle at 0° or one curve. Regnault himself ' attacks this

question directly but unsuccessfully, being unable to prove, to his satis-

faction, that the state, solid or hquid, of a body exerts an influence on the

elastic force of its vapour at a given temperature in the barometric vacuum.

On p. 751 he says in reference to water, alluding to the experiments

and results obtained for it in t. xxi. : ' I have proved that the curve con-

structed on the expei'iments [for ice below 0°] presented a perfect con-

tinuity with the curve which is given by the elastic forces of the vapours

furnished by liquid water at tempei-atures above 0°.'

Regnault in this part of this mcmoire takes other easily frozen bodies

to examine ; ethylene dihromide, benzene, glacial acetic acid ; and comes to
the conclusion in all these cases that (p. 759) his experiments prove that

reference to both the above questions, if a negative answer is given, it is

important to have a quantitative determination in order that we may
know whether the dififerences in each case are of an order to be detected

by experiment, and whether they are definite. Professor James Thomson'
published an important paper in which, by the appHcation to Regnault's
very extensive and minutely investigated results for water of a thermo-

dynamical foi^mula of Sir W. Thomson - he deduced the result that the

ratio of the value of -^ for water vapour to the value for ice vapour at

the same temi^erature is 1'13 to 1. The argument of Professor James

Thomson is briefly as follows. Take a body which can exist in three states,

solid, liquid, and vapour, and which can be examined in respect to each

pair, viz., liquid- vapour,                        vapour-solid,                                                          solid-liquid                                                   on  a  plane  surface

    The line for liquid-vapour if extended with increasing temperature will

abruptly tei'miuate at the critical point.

Mwhere T is the absolute temperature), and is the rate of absorption at

which heat must be supplied to the substance 'per imit augvientation of
volume to let it expand without varying in temperature.

     Apply this formula first to steam with water, and second to steam witlu
ice, at the triple point, which is almost exactly at 0° C. In either case since

firming this result of theory that the ice- vapour and water- vapour curves
are distinct and meet at an angle.

              Effect of Pressure on Melting-point.

Professor J. Thomson had proved that the melting-point of ice must

be lowered by pressure, and had calculated the amount of this lowering

of the freezing-point by a given pressure ; his result was subsequently
experimentally verified by Sir William Thomson. The amount of the
lowering is 0073?i° for n atmospheres of pressure.'

Mousson 2 made experiments with a very powerful hydraulic press

with a view to keep ice liquid at a temperature much below zero, or to

lower the  melting-point of ice  many degrees by immense pressure                                                                                                                                                             these

experiments suggested themselves to him in consequence of Sir W.

Thomson's experiment in which by 17 atmospheres' pressure he lowered

the melting-point of ice more than one-tenth of a degree. Mousson ob-

--tained the following results : first, he succeeded by great pressure on

water in preventing the solidification of it till its temperature was lowered
to --5°; second, he lowered the temperature of a piece of ice to --18°,

and liquefied it by a pressure which he calculated to have been not less
than 13,000 atmospheres, and the diminution of volume he estimated at

13 per cent.

Bunsen^ obtained results for the raising of melting-points of some

substances which expand during fusion ; thus spermaceti at 1 atmo fuses

at 4!7'7°, but at 156 atmos at 50'9°. So paraffin melting at one atrao at

46'3° melts at 100 atmos at 49"9°. And Hopkins, with spermaceti, wax,

sulphur, and stearine, using pressures up to 800 atmos, obtained a rise of

melting-point with increased pressure."*

     Professor Dewar has quite recently ^ made a series of experiments by

a Cailletet apparatus on the relation between the temperature at which ice
melts under different pressures. The temperatures were measured by a
thermo-electric arrangement ; a thermo-junction was frozen in a test-tube

placed inside .the iron bottle of the apparatus, whilst another thermo-

junction outside was kept at the constant temperature of ice melting at
atmospheric pressui'C ; the two thermo-junctions were connected with a
galvanometer, by means of the deflections of the needle of which the difl^er-

once of temperature of the junctions was deduced.

     The freezing-point was lowered 0-18° for 25 atmos, and 2-1° for 300
atmos, giving a mean i-eduction of 0-0072 for 1 atmo. Similar results up

to 700 atmos agreed in giving the same reduction per atmosphere. By

this method, therefore, it is possible always to graduate the pressure scale
of the Cailletet apparatus or to correct the graduations.

surface jnst balances the external actual or artificial atmospheric

pressure. This view is, in fact, the basis of all practical attempts to

measure boiling-points.

     Kahlbaum has developed another view, as will be seen. In order to
understand it, it is well to bear in mind circumstances, which are not un-
common, which tend to retard or prevent the ebullition and distillation
of a liquid, so that a liquid may sometimes be heated far above its
ordinary boiling-point without giving out vapour freely. The view
commonly taken is that these circumstances are excej^tional, in the sense
that they may be artificially exaggerated and that the obstacle opposed
to boiling is of a variable amount and that therefore no definite boiling-

points can be obtained while these circumstances exist; but that if
these obstacles can be removed then there is obtained the true boiling-
point at the pi'essure (say 7G0 mm.), which does not differ sensibly
from the temperature at which the vapour given off in vacuo exerts a

pressure of 760 mm.

     Kahlbaum,' in a memoire published at Leipzig, 1884, develops a theory
of ' specific remission ' (with which we are not concerned here), and in
connection with it gives an account of determinations of relations be-
tween temperature and vapour-pressure in which he asserts that the static
and dynamic conditions of a liquid necessarily give different boiling-points

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and whereas Regnault said that the static method when it can be em-
ployed is always to be relied upon as giving trustworthy results, and always
to be preferred to the dynamic, Kahlbaum says the dynamic method alone
gives the true boiling-point. It is to be boi-ne in mind that Regnault

--had found that in many cases in which the two curves one by the
--statical method and the other by the dynamical method overlapped, they

coincided very nearly when the substances taken were pure. It is quite
clear, therefore, that the static and dynamic determinations cannot alwa3's
disagree as a matter of course, and on account of the necessity of over-

coming cohesion, &c.
      Kahlbaum ^ explains at some length his views as to the boiling-points

--as found by the statical and the dynamical methods, and defines -^ boiling-

 point thus: 'I call by the name boiling-jDoint that temperature uf
 the vapour of a liquid in agitation at which its molecules can , by their

 united energy, overcome the collective attractions of neighbouring mole-
 cules and the external pressure.'

       It cannot be doubted that, as in Dufour's and Gernez's experi-
 ments on the retardation of the boiling-point of liquids in the absence of
 air into which the liquid can evaporate, so in the cases mentioned by
 Regnault, and in others similar, the temperature of liquid and of vapour

 may rise in the dynamic method considerably above the temperature at

 which the vapour-pressure in the static method is in equilibrium with the

 atmospheric pressure ; that is, both liquid and vapour may be superheated.

       But these are exceptional cases, and bodies usually boil under circum-

 stances such that superheating may with care be avoided. Again, it is

  easy enough by avoiding necessary precautions to heat the vapour above
 the boiliag-point, and so to make the boiling-point of any liquid seem
  higher than it is.

               Analogy of Vaporisation of Solid ivith Boiling of Liquid.

     Bamsay and Young ' have obtained I'esults for ice by the dynamical

method, which are conclusive on this point, that ice has definite tem-
peratures of volatilisation without fusing, and for each temperature a
definite pressure. In the dynamical method the substance is either
boiling or volatilising when its vapour is being formed at a temperature
at which the vapour has a pressure just equal to the external pressure.

     Ramsay and Young used two flasks, each having a thermometei-,
connected at their necks by a narrow glass tube ; the tube was provided
with a side tube and a cHp, by which it could be either closed against
the outer air or attached to a pump ; or, what was found more

efficacious for excluding every trace of air, well-boiled water was put into

the flasks and boiled down in them, so that the steam expelled the air
very completely from the apparatus when the clip was closed air-tight

after the thermometers had been inserted.

     On placing one of the two flasks in a freezing mixture, ice at a low

temperature was formed, some adhering firmly to the bulb of the ther-
mometer.

     "When this flask was put in boiling water and the other in a freezing
mixture what happened was this, that after a little time the bulb of the
second thermometer was covered with ice, and soon the two thermometers
showed the same temperature, which they kept so long as the temperature
of the condenser was not altered, and so long as the bulb of the ther-
mometer in the other flask was covered with ice.

     If the temperature of the condenser was changed the two thermometers
both soon showed the same lower or higher temperature, but the variation
of the temperature of the water-bath had no effect on the temperatures

--of the thermometers in other words, on the volatilising point.

     The fixed point at which the two thermometers agreed in any experi-
ment was the temperature at which the pressure of vapour from the ice
on the bulb of the thei-mometer in the flask in the water-bath was just
equal to the pressure of the vapour from the ice on the bulb of the ther-
mometer in the flask in the condenser.

      If the air is not completely expelled, or if a very little air is intro-
duced, the flask in the water-bath shows a higher temperature than

--the flask in the condenser for this reason, that the ice in the first flask

must have a pressure of vapour more than enough to balance the pressure
of ice- vapour from the condenser flask by the pressure of the air ; the
pressure of this small quantity of air will not vary much in any one set
of experiments, and therefore by means of the different temperatures of
the two thermometers in one experiment and the vapour pressures corre-
sponding to the two temperatures we can, by taking the difference
between these two pressures, get the jjressure of the air in the appai-atus,
which pressure, being allowed for in the rest of the experiments in the
series, there was found always a satisfactorily constant agreement between
the volatilising temperature and the condensing temperature ; and not only
that, but also that the higher temperature given when air was introduced
was the temperature at which the vapour-pressure from ice and the
pressure of the air were jointly equal to the pressure found by Regnault
as the vapour-pressure of ice at that higher temperature by the statical

method. Thus the analogy is complete between the volatilisation of ice

against external pressure and the boiling of a liquid against external

pressure.

     Similar experiments were made bj Ramsay and Young with acetic
acid (melting 16'4°), with naphthalene (melting 79'2°), with camphor
(melting 175°) ; the results by heating the bulb containing solid camphor

adhering to the thermometer were confirmed by the pressures obtained
with solid camphor over mercury at different temperatures below 175°,
the results agreeing very nearly, as shown on a diagram. The general
conclusion to be drawn from this paper is that corresponding to boiling-

points of liquids there are similar temperatures for solid bodies volatilising

--without liquefying viz., temperatures which are constant while the solid

volatilises at a constant pressure, but which are different for different

pressures, the volatilising point of a solid rising with rise of pressure, and

being lower with lessened pressure, as is the case with the boiling-point
of a liquid ; and moreover that the volatilising point (for any pi-essiire) is
the same as the temperature at which the solid over a mercury-vacuum
has the same pressure, or sensibly the same ; the second method giving
the true vapour-pressure, while the former method gives a temperature

not absoluteh/ identical with that observed for the same pressure over a

mercury-vacuum, though the difference is extremely minute.

     It was not superfluous to prove by direct experiment the deductions
made by Professor James Thomson from Regnault's numbers as to the

discontinuity of the curve for the ice-vapour pressure with the curve for

water-vapour pressure, and to show by dii-ect experiment that at tem-

peratures common to the two (below the freezing-point), the curves of

vapour-pressure are distinct, the one for water-vapour pressure being

continuous  with  the                                                 curve  for     water-vapour  pressure  above 0°                                           and  it
                                                                                                                                                             ;

was important to prove that these propositions, mutatis mutandis, apply to

other substances. This task, for water, acetic acid, benzene, and camphor,

was undertaken and successfully accomplished by Ramsay and Young,

and is pubhshed in ' Phil. Trans.' Part II. 1884.

--Vapour-pressures from Solids and Liquids Banisay and, Young.

     In Naumann's ' Thermochemie ' (Brunswick, 1882), at p. 178 is a

passage, quoted by Ramsay and Young, showing that Naumann had con-

vinced himself that from naphthalene (melting 79"5°), the same vapour-

pressure is produced either from liquid or solid at the same temperature

and he alludes to former experiments (Regnault's, no doubt), which

yielded similar conclusions in the cases of water, benzene, ethene bromide,

acetic acid, cyanogen chloride, and carbon tetrachloride.

It will be remembered that no satisfactory results were obtained by

Regnault with the substances he tried. In the paper referred to ' Ramsay

and Young first give results for solid camphor, the pressures being found

for many temperatures up to the melting-point 175°, and for liquid

camphor  up to 198°                                                   and    it  is  very evident  on  the curve  of pressures
                                                                   ;

plotted out that the curves for liquid and for solid camphor meet at a

re-entering angle near 175°, which is the melting-point for a pressure of

one atmosphere. For camphor the operations were conducted by jacket-

ing a barometer-tube, very carefully ensured from the danger of entrance

of air or moisture, the tube being heated to the required temperatures by

the vapour of aniline (or methyl beuzoate) at dift'ei'ent pressures. But

the method of work and the apparatus devised were varied to suit the

requirements of each case.

     Thus for benzene (melting 3'3°) a modification described in § 17 of
the memoir cited on page 19 ' is used, the bulb of the thermometer being

covered with cotton-wool which is soaked with benzene ; the benzene

persisted in solidifying just below fi'eezing-point 3'3°.

     As in the previous case of camphor, so in this case of benzene many

experiments were made near the melting-point above and below it, and

several with the solid at long intervals below and with the liquid at long

intervals above. The lines for solid and liquid, which had slight curva-

ture, met at a re-entering angle at a point where the temperature was

between 3-0° and 3-6°.

With acetic acid it was found possible to cool it below the freezing-

point 16'4° and keep it liquid, and a large number of good results was

obtained; the curves meeting at about 16'3°, the two curves helo^r

the melting-point being very obvious, and each being the result of

numerous observations. Attempts made with the greatest care by the baro-

meter (statical) method gave, as with Regnault, no satisfactory results.

     The observed difference between the solid-vapour pressure and the

liquid- vapour pressure for the same temperature was nowhere much more
than 1 mm. This gives some idea of the accuracy required in this kind

of work.

  -- --The next and last case taken in this paper is ice and water. Com-

parative results, i.e. results at identical temperatures for ice-vapour

and  water- vapour   were  obtained  from  0°  to  --5°                            tables  are  given  of
                                                                                ;

observations of pressure for ice down to --16°; and these results when

compared with the results which Professor James Thomson obtained, as

mentioned, by recalculation of Regnault's data, are found to give

differences of vapour-pressures of ice and water gi-eater than his.

But when the observed pressures for ice, for temperatures below 0^, were

compared with the pressures calculated from a theoretical formula of

Professor Thomson, the authors found that their observed results agreed

more nearly with those so calculated than with those calculated fi-om

Regnault's results.

Thus Drs. Ramsay and Young have shown that curves for pressure^

from a liquid and a solid state of the same substance, are not continuous

in the cases of camphor, benzene, acetic acid, and water.

The process in which the thermometer. bulb is covered with cotton-

wool (or asbestos fibre), and this soaked with the substance the boil-

ing-points of which at different pressures are required, gives results^

according to Ramsay and Young, in Avhich the error due to overheating

of the vapour is got rid of, for the substance adhering to the cotton-

wool has so much free surface that it will, whether solid or liquid,

evaporate freely at the temperature corresponding to the pressure to

which it is subjected. The cotton-wool can be re-moistened continually

by an arrangement described in this paper and in ' J.C.S.' January 1885.

     In the last-mentioned paper they further describe their apparatus, and
show how it is used for solids as well as liquids, and apply it in particular

to the case of acetic acid. Regnault had obtained discordant results

                     ' FhiJ. Trans. Part I. 1884,"?. 47.

with this substance, which sometimes he attributed to the pi'csence of water
and sometimes to the presence of acetone ; and the least trace of im-

purity, as he has pointed out, affects the results seriously, especially

those obtained by the statical method ; for over the thermometer vacuum

any accidental presence of a trace of air does not get eliminated as in the

dynamical method by boiling for a short time. By their method Ramsay
and Young got a series of values of pressures for solid acetic acid

--from 5"68° to 16'41° volatilising point, and for liqtiid acetic acid from

2'72° to 117"15° boiling-point. The results so obtained agree closely with
those given by the usual process when a perfectly pure acetic acid was
used, and disagreed with vapour- pressures previously given byRegnault,'
Laudolt,^ Bineau,^ and Wiillner.''

       --Vapour-pressures from Solids and Liquids W. Fischer.

    W. Fischer,-^ independently of Ramsay and Young, and by a quite

different method, investigated the lines of solid vapour-pi'essure and of
liquid vapour- pressure for water and benzene for a range of temperature

throughout which, in each case, the body could exist either as solid or as

liquid ; he arrived at results substantially similar to those of Ramsay and
Young. He showed that the curve of pressures for each substance (for
temperatures below the melting-point) was lower for solid than for liquid.

      In the case of ice and water he gives four sets of experiments, in each
of which experiments there are given the thermometer reading below 0°,
the barometer reading and the reading of an ice- pressure mercury tube
and of a water- pressure mercury tube, the three tubes being near together
so that they can all be read with the cathetometer, as well as the thermome-

Aters giving the temperature of the ice and water in each experiment.

fifth set of experiments was made for vapour-pressure of water at tem-
peratures above 0°. From these he deduced two equations of the form

+p=-a + 'bt cir, which represented very accurately his observations, one

for p the vapour-pressure of water, and the other for p the vapour-

pressure of ice.

     These results were got in the winter of 1882-3, and they did not well
agree with theory, and especially gave a difference for ice and water at 0°,
differing too seriously from that deduced fi'om Clausius' formula.

      In the winter 1884-5 he resumed the investigation, and succeeded in
improving the method employed so as to make his results more accurate.

+ +In the equation ^=rt ii cf- he obtained the values of a, h, c, his results

for the different pairs of values of p and t giving him from the equation
between j; and t a large number of equations in a, b, and c. This was
done for water-vapour and for ice- vapour ; the equation for pressure of

--water-vapour at temperatures between 1"35° and 10'15° was

lated it at '044. This is, therefore, a tolerably satisfactory agreement.

The two curves meet at about 0-3°.

    For benzene W. Fischer found +5-8° as melting-point; Regnault had

found +4-35°. The equation for the vapour-pressure over solid benzene
was found to be

The two curves do not meet at 5"3°, but they should meet on some point on
the line of solid-liquid, and may do so at some point corresponding to a
pressure higher than atmospheric. From the diagram it appears that the
two curves would not meet for some distance from the melting-point;
this is not certain, but it is so probable as to point to some error, perhaps
arising from impurity of the benzene.

                   Yapour-pressures of Mercury.

The determination of the relations between temperature and vapour-

pressure for mercury was found by Regnault to be very difficult, on

account of the occurrence of violent bumping ; the results are published

in ' Memoires,' t. xxvi. p. 520. The temperatures were measured by an

air-thermometer of constant volume, but of small initial pressure, it

having been partially exhausted before the beginning of a series of ex-

Y^aperiments. The formula log      + +ha' cif was used, where F is the

vapour-pressure, and the constants determined by a sufficient number of

data  from  observations  including a wide  range                              thus                                                                                                                                                             the  table  on  pp.

-520, 521 was calculated from the formula. Regnault's observations were

too few and too doubtful, and the results given by him for vapour-pres-

sures of mercury at low temperatures and at ordinary temperatures have

been proved to be quite illusory.

   A few other physicists have attacked this question ; among them

Hagen, McLeod, Hertz, and Drs. Ramsay and Young.

AAssociation volume for 1883.              shallow glass tube 14 mm. diameter

containing freshly distilled mercury was suspended near the bottom of

a closed   flask of about  1'9  litre  capacity,  for nine                                                                                                                                                          days                         the  tube  was

then removed and boiling nitric acid poured into the flask and allowed

to stand some time, the nitric acid neutralised with ammonia, the solution

washed out of the flask, acidified with HCl, and treated with H2S. By

comparison with the result of operating similarly with solutions of mer-

cury of known strengths, the mercury was found to be between '00006 gms.

and -00012 gms.

The flask contained, therefore, as vapour about "00009 gms. of mercury.

A second similar experiment gave '00012 gms., therefore at ordinary

correspond  to pressure of mercury='00574 mm.                                                                                                                                                                       and McLeod                        says  this

inside of the flask.

In "Wiedemann's 'Ann.' 1882, xvii. p. 177, is an elaborate investigation

of the evaporation of fluids, especially mercury, by Hertz. His vapour-

pressures of mercury are very different indeed from Regnault's from 0° to

100°, as will be seen :

Ramsay and Young agree is a striking proof of the applicability of the
thermal relation R,'=R+ c(i'- f), explained in ' Phil. Mag.' Jan. 1886, to
the determination, with considerable accuracy of data which almost baflBe

direct experimental treatment.

      Crookes, in tlie ' Chemical News,' July 16, 188G, p. 28, writing of the
mercury left in his radiant-matter tubes even at great exhaustions,
says that, although in the cold it is impossible to get an induction spark
through the tube, the interior of it being absolutely non-condnctmg, yet

on heating the tube with aBunsen flame, keeping the coil going, suddenly
the current passes, lighting up the inside of the tube with a greenish
blue light, in which the spectroscope shows strong mercury lines. The
tube on cooling becomes non-conducting again.

      This shows, according to Crookes, that in such very highly exhausted
vacuum-tubes there is plenty of mercury present, not as vapour, but con-

densed on the metallic poles or on the inside of the glass. But a com-
plete blockade may be established, as Crookes explains in this paper,
whereby during the exhaustion of the vacuum-tube no mercury can
enter ; the blockade is effected by interposing between the vacuum-tube
and the mercury a tube containing freshly heated sulphur and iodide of
sulphur packed with freshly heated asbestos, and a glass tube containing

copper to retain any sulphur. By this means the vacuum-tube is so

freed from mercury that Crookes has been unable to detect mercury
vapour in any of the tubes, even on heating them.

      The fact that for each pressure there is a corresponding temperature
for any volatilisable liquid, constant so long as the pi-essure is the same
and for each temperature a pressure of vapour, constant so long as the

 tempei'ature is the same, can be utilised to secure a constant temperature
by boiling a liquid at constant pressure ; this is the principle of Hof-
mann's method of determining vapour-densities the constant temperature

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

 being that of a given liquid boiling at the (constant) pressure of the
atmosphere, different liquids must be used boiling at different tempera-
 tures to give a convenient temperature in each case.

      The substances which can be used must be few, as they must satisfy
 the condition of being cheap, stable, and easily obtained pure.

     Now the number of constant temperatures which can thus be obtained

is the number of such bodies the boiling points of which can be used as

 the constant temperatures ; the temperatures thus attainable will therefore
 be few and far between.

     Among the liquids satisfying the conditions mentioned are carbon

 bisulphide, ethyl alcohol, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, aniline, methyl
 salicylate, bromonaphthalene, and mercury. Their approximate boiling-

 points are 46°, 78°, 132°, 155°, 184°, 222°, 280°, and 358° ; thus we have
 eight temperatures which can be used for purposes for which a constant

 temperature is required ; and they ai-e at fairly uniform intervals from
 46° to 358°, applicable therefore to wide ranges of temperature.

     By the aid of the principle stated above, we can, by keeping constant
 any pressure below 760 mm. for carbon bisulphide, obtain another con-

 slant temperature, and in fact a whole series of constant temperatures-

in respect of relations of vapour-pressure to temperature, really very

similarly constituted in that respect if compared under physical condi-

tions, which this formula of Ramsay and Young in some way represents,

at least approximately.

                Application of the formula to Liquid Oxygen.

The case of oxygen is of such interest that it is impossible to leave-

this important paper without treating of it.

Olszewski ' published a series of determinations by a hydrogen-ther-

mometer of temperatures of liquid oxygen, and vapour-pressures corre-

-- --sponding, the temperatures varying from the critical temperature of

oxygen 118'8° C. to 211'5° C. ; and critical pressure being 50'8 atmos =:

38,608 mm., and the pressure for the lower temperature being 9 mm.

Olszewski was unable to measure any lower temperature, because at this

point so much liquid oxygen had evaporated that the bulb of the ther-

mometer was not sufficiently covered with it.

                                                                                                                     ·0008932. By inter-

polation from Olszewski's numbers, temperatures were determined for

vapour-pressures 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, and so on up to 20,000 mm.;

several pairs of temperatures compared for the same pressure for sulphur
and for oxygen ; and the calculated temperatures of oxygen agree with
the observed with an error of one degree at the most.

Question of Applicabilittj of Hydrogen Thermometer to Low Temperatures.

Wroblewski * objects that Olszewski's results cannot be true a,t very
= --low temperatures because at, for example, 61'5° (abs. temp.)
                                                                       211'5° C.

at which the vapour-pressure found by Olszewski for hydrogen is 9 mm.,
and at temperatures not quite so low as that, we must be getting

near the liquefying point of hydrogen, near enough at least to allow

of the suspicion that the behaviour of hydrogen may be getting irre-
gular, and deviating from the straight course prescribed by Amagat at
temperatures above 0° C. i.e. above 273° of absolute temperature. And

Wroblewski's criticism is probably just ; the determination of the lowest

temperatures is probably inaccurate ; but the points determined by

Olszewski, other than the very lowest temperatures, are probably very

accurate, as hydi'ogen evidently has a very low liquefying point, and is

far the most regular of the gases, as seen in Amagat's curves ; still

though we know from Amagat's results and from V. Meyer's that hydrogen

at ordinary tempei'atares and from these up to nearly 1700° C. behaves
in the most absolutely regular way in refei'euce to volume, |>ressure and

temperature, where at least the pressui'e is not excessively great, our

knowledge, however highly probable with regard to its behavioar at low

temperatures, is conjectural.

Wroblewski used two thermo-junctions arranged as a thermo-pile,

one junction being kept at constant temperature, such as 0° or 100°, the
other in the liquid the temperature of which is sought, the temperature

being inferred from the deflection of the needle of a galvanometer.
     The elements of the pile were copper and german silver, and results

--with the pile agreed with results with the hydrogen thermometer down to
    193° C. ; but disagi-eed below that temperature.

     In the series of papers ^ the authors discuss two other formulae, which
might often be useful for getting fair approximations, but which do not
give such remarkably accurate results as the formula of which we have
been treating.

iodine, and iodine monochloride.

some of the most striking of the results which Amagat five or six years

afterwards firstpublished, and long before his most complete and exhaustive

treatment of the gases he examined was                 concluded                                                 and in this disserta-

by experiment. Amagat applies Clausius' and Van der Waals' formulae

to the case of COj, and finds'* a portion of the gas well represented by

calculations from their formulae, but that neither his nor Clausius' formula

represents the whole of his curves.

                              Critical Temperatures and Pressures.

     Faraday having shown how certain gases might be liquefied, and
liaving himself liquefied a number of those which under ordinary condi-
tions are gases, Cagniard de la Tour ^ showed that when certain liquids

were gradually heated in a sealed tube partly filled, suddenly at a certain
temperature the line of demarcation between liquid and vapour dis-
appeared, and there was nothing to distinguish one part from another
part of the tube.

     Thilorier had noticed ^ that COg liquid from 0° to 30° expands four
times as much as COg gas between the same temperatures.

     Andrews ^ investigated the efiecta of pressure on COj at different

temperatures, and arrived at the conclusion that above the temperature
·30-9° C. no pressure however great can liquefy the gas, that is, separate
it in the tube in which it is confined into two portions, one denser than
the other, separated by a line of demarcation.

     At any temperature below 30-9° he showed that by some pressure

under 74 atmos the gas can be liquefied; and at a temperature the

least possible below 30'9° tlie gas just becomes liquefied by a pressiu'e of
about 74 atmos.

      The temperature 309° and tlie pressure 74 atmos were called by
Andrews the critical temperature and pressure for CO.2. In further re-
searches Andrews had found that the critical point was not a point special
to CO2 and to this body only ; he found a similar behaviour at some point
for every liquefied gas or volatile liquid he examined, and in particular for
nitrous oxide, hydric chloride, ammonia, ethyl oxide, and bisulphide of
carbon. For each of these (and he considered the property to be general)
there is a certain temperature below which the body can, by sufficient
pressure, be liquefied, and above which no pi'essure, however great, can
liquefy it. The smallest pressure which can liquefy it at immediatelij

below this critical point is the critical pressure.
      There can be no doubt that in reference to general properties of liquids

and gases the critical temperature and pressure are of the greatest im-
portance, and that the accurate determination of a number of these will,

in conjunction with Andrews' very complete examination of COo and with

the most valuable data towards a general theory of gases and liquids and

on the other hand the critical points may be arrived at by a theoretical

method, as indicated in a paper by Thorpe and Riicker.' The actual
critical temperatures at present known, besides those found by Andrews,
have been obtained for the most part by Ramsay in 1880,^ by Pawlew-
ski,^ by Olszewski and Wroblewski, by Sajotschewsky, and by Dewar.^

sures in atmospheres, of which we will mention a few :

data for each substance, and the most important points of reference when

we compare different substances, which are gasifiable, with one another.

The pressure found by both observers does not differ much from that cal-

culated by Sarrau ; but the temperature calculated is considerably higher

than that observed by either.

Hydrogen has, so far as I know, not been examined as yet in the liquid

state ; but if not, there can be little doubt that it soon will be. Wroblew-
ski, by means of nitrogen boiling in a vacuum, cooled hydrogen to a tem-

-- --perature 208° 211°, at a pressure 180 190 atmos, and found on

suddenly releasing the pressure a grey mist form, which is due no doubt

to the formation of liquid hydrogen in a very fine state of division.

     Sarrau deduced from Clausius' formula for hydrogen the critical tem-

--perature 174°, and critical pressure 98-9 atmospheres. The ratio of

absolute critical temperature to critical pressure is therefore about I'O.

Again Olszewski - has obtained his lowest temperatures by the eva-

poration of solid nitrogen under a pressure of 4 mm., a temperature

perhaps cannot give accurate temperatures in these extreme circumstances.

However, hydrogen does not seem to liquefy at this temperature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        at least

no meniscus was seen at --220° at pressures up to 180 atmos; still the

hydrogen-thermometer might, and probably would, register too low.

     The solid nitrogen which Olszewski used was obtained by evaporation of

the liquid nitrogen at 4 mm. in a glass tube surrounded by liquid oxygen.
     The temperature at which nitrogen solidifies is, according' to

Wroblewski,3 -203°.

    Dewar has recently obtained solid oxygen, but details have not yet

been published.

     Pawlewski had stated, as an empirical law, that the difference between
the critical temperature and the boiling-point is constant. This has been
found to be by no means true. Vincent and Chappuis ^ find the critical

temperature, boiling-point, critical pressure, and the ratio T/P, where T

is the absolute critical temperature, for hydric chloride, methyl chloride,

ethyl chloride, ammonia, and methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethyl-amines

     The greater part of the determinations of vapour- densities of bodies
whose vapour-densities had not been known or were doubtful up to the
last ten years has been effected by Victor Meyer alone, or in conjunction
with others ; some by Crafts and Meier.^

     After describing his apparatus as ordinarily used, V. Meyer gives

the vapour of boiling ethyl benzoate, the vapour-densities in all the cases

    V. Meyer points out that in calculating the observed densities from
the direct datum of each experiment the temperature of the bath does
not require to be known, but must be quite constant during each

determination.

    By improving his process he shows how to get much more accurate

results, thus

Troost ' gave FeoClg, AlaClg, AlaBr^, AlaTg, from about 400° to 1040° (the

boiling-point (?) of zinc). These formulfe had led V. Meyer to expect

In2Cl6, which was not given by any vapour- density determination of

indium chloride. So V. and C. Meyer find formuloe Sn2Cl4, ZnOia for

temperatures between 620° and 700° as determined by a block of pla-
tinum and a calorimeter.

     Mitscherlich had found at 571° AS4O6, and V. and C. Meyer find for

-- --a much higher temperature about 1000° the same formula AsjO^, and

for even higher temperatures SbjOg, CU2CI4, and at over 900°                              CdBr,                                                         S2

at about 1500° (?), while at temperatures below a bright red heat the

vapour-density gave Sg. They tried potassium, sodium, and then

chlorine, but found that these attacked porcelain.

The temperatures in these experiments with the calorimeter and the

heated block of platinum were not very accurate when very high tempe-

ratures -were to be measured. The highest estimated temperature 1567°

gave O2 (from AgoO), ^2) 83 as the molecular formute of oxygen,

nitrogen, and sulphur. For chloi'ine at the highest temperature of their

furnace they obtained a molecular formula f Clj, that is, from Pt2Cl4 the
chlorine given off, which at as high a temperature as about 620° had given

density corresponding to formula CI2, had given smaller and smaller

values for the densities at higher temperatures, till at the highest tem-

perature it had a density 1-60, 1-62, a little less than 1-63 calculated for

§Cl2                        admitting  that  chlorine  was  undergoing  dissociation      it  was                                                       not
                         ;

clear that it would not at higher temperatures give still lower densities

(always compared with air).

The results thus given for chlorine naturally led to speculation as to

the behaviour of bromine and iodine                         in the  same  circumstances                                                                 and as
                                                                                                                                                     ;

Deviile and Troost had {loc. cit.) found for iodine a normal vapour-

density corresponding to I2 at the bright-red heat required for reaching

the boihng-point of zinc (1040°, as found by Deviile and Troost) the

result with chlorine was considered doubtful ; this taken in conjunction
with the fact of the porcelain being attacked by alkali metals and

chlorides led to a revision of the arrangement of the apparatus. In

succeeding investigations V. Meyer, in conjunction with Ziiblin, used

a porcelain tube glazed inside and out, and placed in the furnace so

as to be heated by it when necessary to the highest temperatures. The

gases of the furnace were thus entirely unable to diffuse into the interior

of the porcelain tube, and thus the platinum tube which was inside the

porcelain tube was absolutely guarded against the action of these gases,
and operations which would be vitiated by the action, either of the gases
of the furnace on porcelain, or of the substance which was the subject of
the experiment, could be heated with safety to the highest attainable

furnace temperatures in the jjlatinum tube. The experimental tube was
filled with nitrogen, and the vapour-density determined in an atmosphere

of this gas. The temperature was now accurately determined (it having

been previously found that up to very high temperatures nitrogen,

oxygen, mercury, and, as afterwards shown, hydrogen, when compared at
the same temperature, gave always vapour-densities corresponding to the
same formula; in fact, that in all these cases the absolute densities

diminished as temperature rose always in the same ratio) by measuring
the nitrogen which filled the tube before the experiment, and the nitrogen
which filled it after the experiment.

gives the amount of nitrogen left at the highest tempei'ature of the experi-

ment. After the furnace had quite cooled the tube was again filled with

nitrogen at the temperature of the room, and the amount of nitrogen at

this temperature determined in the same way. The expansion of the

nitrogen is thus known between the two temperatures ; the highest

temperature is thus easily calculated on the faith of the accui'acy of Gay-

Lussac's law for nitrogen through this range of temperature. As an

example of this method they apply it to the case of mercury vapour, and

find in two experiments 6'89, 6'76, as against the calculated number 6'91.
    The method described above for determining the temperature may be

called the nitrogen-thermometer method ; its applicability has been amply

justified by further comparisons of its densities with those of other gases

at still higher temperatures, with, among these, the gases hydrogen,

oxygen, mercury.

The Behaviour of Iodine at High Temperature.

     In the meantime (year 1879) Crafts, using a modification of V. Meyer's
apparatus, found for chlorine no alteration of density, or at the most only

a few hundredths at the highest temperature of the furnace ; but for bro-
mine, which for Brg should have density 5"7, was found 4"39 at the
highest temperature ; while the density of iodine, which for I2 should be
8"795, was found reduced to 5'93.^ Thus Crafts found vapour- density of
iodine reduced in ratio 1'5 to 1 ; of bromine in ratio 1 2 to 1 ; and of

chlorine very slightly reduced, if reduced at all.

     V. Meyer also found the vapour-density of iodine reduced in ratio 1'5
to 1, being abnormal above 590°.

     Crafts and Meier,^ by a quite different experimental method from that
used by V. Meyer, arrived at results which showed that the temperatures
were inaccurate in Meyer's experiments with iodine, and that whereas
according to V. Meyer's figures the vapour-density of iodine remains
constant between 1000° and 1570°, Crafts and Meier ^ show that it con-
tinually diminishes as the temperature rises up to 1400°, when it has a
density less than two-thirds the density required by the formula I2. Since
then Crafts and Meier * extended their experiments to higher tempera-
tures, operating under reduced pressure. They find that they get a
vapour-pressure of iodine above 1300° (at -1 atmo pressure), which is

-- --near to half that for I2 namely, about 4'6 and which remains neaiiy

constant, slightly diminishing for all temperatures up to 1400°, the
curves showing the vapour-densities as ordinates and the temperatures

as abscissae.

     Deville and Troost,^ on referring back to an experiment made many

 years ago (in 1860) on the density of vapour of selenium by comparison
with that of iodine at some very high temperature, find a note appended,
to the effect that there must have been some mistake made in tlie weight
of iodine remaining in the flask, for with the number given, Oil gram, a
temperature of nearly 2000° would be attained ; they in this communica-
tion recognise that the experiment was accurate and that the smallness
of the weight of iodine was due to the abnormal diminution in the vapour-

--density of iodine at the very high temperature yet much below 2000°

in this experiment.
     Troost had also recognised the influence of reduction of pressure on

the vapour- density of iodine, and had in fact obtained for a constant

temperature, 440°, a series of vapour-densities of iodine (relative to air at

same temperature and pressures), as under :

Pressures . 768 mm. 67-2 mm. 48'6 mm. 48"57 mm. 34"52 mm.

Densities . 870 ,,  8-20 ,,  7-75 ,,  7-76 ,,               7-35 ,,

     The conclusion which was drawn by Crafts and Meier from their ex-
periments was that the molecule I2 had been gradually decomposed into

molecules I. Troost considered that such a dissociation could not be
effected by a simple diminution of pressure ; but there are cases of chemi-
cal compounds, which can be formed at a low temperature and by suflBi-
cient pressure, which can be decomposed, partially or wholly, either by
raising the temperature or hy diminishing the pressure, or by both con-

bined, and which can be re-formed by lowering the temperature or in-

creasing the pressure.

   A remarkable instance of this is phosphonium chloride, formed by

Ogier 1 by combining PH3 with HCl. These two gases do not combine

at ordinary temperatures, but were by Ogier brought into combination by

a pressure of about 20 atmos at 14'^, also by lowering the temperature of
the mixed gases to --30°. In the former method he fills over mercury
the ordinary tube of ' Cailletet's elegant apparatus ' with a mixture of

equal volumes of PH3 and HCl, and when a sufficient pressure has been
applied brilliant crystals of PH4CI appear on warming the upper part of

                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the tube, at about 20°, a liquid layer forms which is either liquid phospho-
nium chloride or a mixture of the liquefied gases. Ogier says that on
gradually cooling the mixed gases the deposit of crystals takes place

almost suddenly at --30°; but he thinks it possible that the gases may be

in combination at a somewhat higher temperature. That is a matter
which experiment has not decided.

    Now Van't Hoff,^ by compressing a mixture of equal volumes of the

mixture of PH3 and HCl, got the laboratory-tube of a Cailletet's apparatus

half-full of the white phosphoniura-chloride crystals. These he heated
with a water-bath ; the crystals melted at 25° ; and on heating further at
pressure of between 80 and 90 atmos till the temperature was between
S0° and 61°, the boundary between liquid and vapour disappeared ; on
again lowering the temperature there was noticed the hazy appearance
which is characteristic of the critical point.

     The liquid state (?) of the phosphonium chloride obtained by warming
the crystals, or the crystals themselves obtained by pressure at 14°, on

 gradually diminishing the pressure, gradually disappear, being converted

without changing the temperature of 14° into PH3 and HCl ; here is an

exact analogy with the case of iodine in Troost's experiments with dimi-

nishing pressure, for we may suppose the molecules I2 to gradually de-

compose, on the pressure being relieved, into molecules I.
     The theory of Crafts and Meier, accepted by V. Meyer, that molecule

I2 is split into two molecules I, though not overthrown by the experi-
ments of Troost, is barely proved by Crafts' and Meier's experiments ; for

these find only a small portion of curve representing a nearly constant

--vapour-density nearly equal to that required by the molecule I just

enough to convince all who wish to be convinced-- and until by higher

temperatures there can be shown a longer range during which the density

of iodine vapour is always (compared with air) half what it is at ordinary

temperatures, that is to say shows no tendency to diminish further, the

evidence from the experiments mentioned will be accepted as conclusive

only by chemists and physicists who have a predisposition to accept the

conclusion. But confirmatory evidence of some fundamental change in

iodine at high temperatures is given by the fact that it gives a band spec-
trum when subjected to electrical discharges of comparatively low tension,

and a line spectrum under higher tension.'

     The results obtained for chlorine and bromine were a diminution of

density continuing up to the highest furnace temperatures under which

the  experiments could be performed                                                                                                                                             it is impossible to use a much higher

     At about 970° stannous chloride was found to have vapour density

corresponding to SnClz, the density found about 200° lower corresponding

to  Sn2Cl4                                  and  FcaCIj had density at white heat much diminished                                                                                                                    while

the formulae AloCl,;, &c., were in concordance with vapour-densities found

at the highest temperature ; HgCla was found again to be the molecular

weight corresponding to the vapour-density of mercuric chloride at the

highest temperatures, the compound thus showing evidence of not having

been  dissociated at these high                   temperatures                                                                                                                         and  SO2     had vapour-density

unaltered at 1200°.

     HCl was considerably decomposed at 1300° and higher temperatures,

the hydrogen difiFusing through the platinum, and the chlorine being
shown by the amount of iodine liberated from potassium iodide solution.

     CO,, heated in polished platinum, was only very slightly decomposed

at the highest temperature, about 1690° ; in presence of fragments of

porcelain Deville had found much dissociation at 1300°.

and of some volatile compounds of these and of otLer less volatile elements.

His object was to deduce from his results, by applying to them the atomic

theory as expounded by Dalton and the law of Ampere and Avogadro

as to the distx'ibution of the molecules of a gas or gasitied body, the mole-

cular weights of both the compounds and the elements. In this Dumas was

only partially successful, because with Dalton he made the tacit assumption

that in the case of elementary substances there was no distinction between

an atom and a molecule. Chemists before Dumas' time had taken no account

of the law of Avogadro and Ampere in their endeavours to determine the

true formula3 of compounds and the atomic or molecular weights to be

assigned to elements, with the exception of Gay-Lussac, who was guided

by some adumbration of this law in his investigations into the volume

relations of bodies composed of gaseous components.

In the investigation which Dumas records in this paper he not only

recognises this law, but takes it as the foundation of the reasoning he-,

applies to his experimental results ; thus inaugurating a method of

chemical research which was afterwards renewed by Gerhardt in 1843 and

carried by him to a more successful conclusion, for Gerhardt was not only

able to show how formulae for compounds and especially for very numerous

carbon- compounds were consistent with Avogadro's law, but to include

the molecules of volatile elements also under the self-same law. These

chemical consequences derived from this law are not anticipated by

Dalton's atomic theory, and without some such physical conception of the

constitution of matter in the gaseous state we could not have had any

reason to suppose that the weights of substances in this state in equal

volumes were in any relation to the chemical formulee. But the facts,

numerous as they were, which Gerhardt found to show this relation have

since the publication of his memoir up to the present time been increased

to a vast extent ; so that it is beyond question that Avogadro and Ampere

expressed, with reference to the number of molecules in a given volume,

in the case of bodies in the state of perfect gas, a law which is approxi-

mately true of vapours of bodies at temperatures far removed from the

point of liquefaction, and which not only physicists can use with safety

in explaining physical properties but chemists to find true chemical'

formulae.

There are, it is true, cases of apparent exception, but on examination

it is found that in these cases the body, of which we are trying to find the

formula by this law, has wholly or partly ceased to exist in the circum-

stances of the experiment, being rejjlaced by two or more other bodies

resulting from decomposition of the original. The applicability of

Avogadro's law which is thus shown, depends of course on the approximate

truth of Boyle's and Gay-Lussac's laws, which as approximations are thus

indirectly confirmed and V.                                                                                       Meyer  and  others  have confirmed  these

bromide, and iodide, indium chloride, antimonious oxide, cupric chloride,

and cadmium. Moreover, in many other cases where the results do not
seem in accordance with these laws at high temperatures we have signs

of a decomposition, while in other such cases the result has been shown

to be capable, without any straining of the facts, of simple explanation
by supposing a molecule to be split into molecules of half the mass and

represented by halving the formulae, e.g., in the case of Sn2Cl4 which ap-
                                                                                                                              -- ;:

pears to obey the above laws up to a certain temperature, to deviate
from them for a range of higher temperatures, and tu obey them for a
still higher range, all of which facts receive an obvious and natural ex-
planation on the supposition that Sn2Cl4 splits up gradually into two

molecules SnCl2 as the temperature rises.
     In face of all the above facts, which are of somewhat recent develop-

ment, and which result from the long-continued labours of V. Meyer,
Crafts and Meier, and others, it is difficult to hold the view expressed by
Berthelot,' that Boyle's (or Mariotte's) law, and Gay-Lussac's law have

only been proved for hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, with the implied in-
ference that iodine is probably merely one of very numerous exceptions, and
that therefore Avogadro's law does not hold good for the halogens, and in
the other cases which are apparent exceptions to the other two laws.

--Deville and Troost Vapour-densities determined by them in 1860                                                              Bearing

                           of their Results on the Behaviour of Iodine.

Dumas, in his paper already mentioned, recognised the importance of

determinations of vapour densities as aiding the solution of chemical pro-

blems, and particularly in helping to give the cori'ect formula to a com-
pound. Deville and Troost- used substantially the same method as

Damas, except that by using porcelain globes instead of glass globes

they were able to determine vapour-densities of bodies which have very
high boiling-points. The matter of chief importance is to have a fixed

temperature above the boiling-point of the substance in the flask at

which the flask and its contents can be kept before closing it when ifc

is full of the vapour at the constant temperature. They used for constant
temperatures the boiling-points of mei'cury, sulphur, cadmium, and zinc

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

It will be seen that even if these boiling-points are not so accurate as

could be wished, in each case the temperature at which the vapour-density

was determined was far above the boiling-point of the substance.

     The substances chosen for giving invariable temperatures of boiling-
point were all elements : these were probably selected, among other
reasons, because elements were not likely to show any alteration at high

temperatures, and, therefore, any serious deviation from Gay-Lussac's

law.

The vapour-density of iodine was used thi'ee times, viz., at tempera-

ture of boiling sulphur 440°, boiling cadmium ^ [860°], and boiling zinc
[1040°]. In the first and last cases it was used as the thermometric
substance, i.e. the expansion of the iodine (assumed as obeying Gay-
Lussac's law) was known by the amount left in the flask after the
experiment was over ; and as the vapour of iodine is heavy, iodine should
be an accurate thermometric substance, used in this way by weighing the

iodine left in the flask. Unfortunately it has since been found that iodine
does not obey Gay-Lussac's law above 590°, above this temperature its
rate of expansion increasing.

     But in Deville and Troost's experiments the (relative) vapour-density
of iodine is almost the same at [860°] as at 440°, viz., 87.^ This seems

inconsistent with what was said just now ; there may be some error here,
or it may be, as is likely from analogy, that the dissociation of iodine
molecules imagined by V. Meyer, and by Crafts and Meier, may be a slow

process requiring more time than was given in this experiment.
    However that may be, the use of iodine as a thermometric substance

for giving the boiling-point of zinc was not legitimate, and Deville and
Troost themselves have since found that^ the boiling-point of zinc was
over-estimated by 100°, the true boiling-point of zinc being in fact 940° ;
the more than normal expansion of iodine at 940° had given a result due
to a normal expansion at 1040°.

     The cubic expansion of the porcelain of which the flasks were made
was determined by Deville and Troost and found to amount to "009288
between 0° aaid the boiling-point of cadmium, Avhich was supposed to be
860° but is now known to be about 772°, as found by Carnelley and

Carleton Williams (' J.C.S.' 1878, xxxiii. 284.)

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Balfour

    Stewart {Secretary), Mr. J. Knox Laughton, Mr. G. J. Symons,

    Mr. R. H. Scott, and Mr. Johnstone Stonet, appointed for the
    purpose of co-operating with Mr. E. J. Lowe in his project of
     establishing a Meteorological Observatory near Chepstotv on a

    permanent and scientific basis.

In their last report this Committee, after expressing their opinion
that the establishment of a permanently endowed meteorological observa-
tory on a good site, such as that of Shire Newton, is a matter of un-

deniable scientific importance, instructed their Secretary to write as

follows to Mr. Lowe :
    ' The Committee request me to point out to you that the main feature

of your proposal, which interests the British Association and the scientific
public generally, is the prospect which it holds out of the establishment
of a permanent institution by means of which meteorological constants

could be determined, and any secular change which may take place

therein in the course of a long period of years be ascertained. It will be

for you and the local authorities to decide what a,mount of work of local
interest should be contemplated, and on this will the scale of the observa-

tory mainly depend. The Committee are therefore unable to say what

amount of capital would be required. They would point out four con-

ditions which they hold to be indispensable :

' 1. The area of ground appropriated should be sufficient to ensure

freedom from the effect of subsequent building in the neighbourhood.

   A' 2. sufficient endowment fund of at least 150Z. annually should be

created.

' 3. The control should be in tbe hands of a body which is in itself

permanent as far as can be foreseen.

'4. The land for the site shall be handed over absolutely to the above-

mentioned governing body.'

     This communication from the Committee has been submitted to the

consideration of Mr. Lowe and his friends, and a letter from Mr. Lowe

has been recently received by Dr. Stewart, of which the following are

extracts.

  --Mr. Lowe who offers to give an acre of land, his instruments, and

--meteorological books, and to work gratuitously at the observatory

writes as follows (July 21, 1886) :

    ' Yesterday sixteen scientific men from Bristol came over to look at the

proposed site of the observatory, and said that it seemed a pity that

nothing was being done. ... If any alteration in the scheme would

be desirable this could be done, as all that is required is an observatory

that would be useful to science. Tou have yourself seen the site, and if

you can suggest what would improve the proposal I have no doubt it

would be acted upon. . . . Newport would have had a meeting in
November, but the election came on and it was thought desirable to post-

--pone it. Then the High Sheinff died the second that had consented to
--call a meeting and you will recollect that I told you that Mr. Cart-

wright, another High Sheriff, had died.

     ' The Committee think that they see their way to getting two or three
thousand pounds if the scheme were started. Since you were with me I

have purchased nearly 150 acres of land in front of the observatory, and

Hnothing could come between it and the channel as near as  to 2

Amiles.   new road is to be made to the Severn Tunnel station, and I

hear that the telegraph or telephone is likely to be carried up this

road.

     ' If your Committee think well to recommend the observatory scheme,
action would be at once taken, and we have reason to believe that the
Bristol Docks would help us with lOOZ. a year. I should much like to

see such an observatory in working order whilst I live, but my time is

getting short.

     ' There is a growing interest round here about the observatory, and
constant inquiries are made as to the probabilities of success.'

    The Committee express their sympathy with Mr. Lowe and his-

friends under the unfortunate circumstances that have tended to retard

local action. The Committee see such evidence of local interest in the

undertaking that they desire to have an early opportunity of co-operat-
ing with the local committee. They therefore ask for their reappoint-

ment, and request that the unexpended sum of 251. and an additional sum

-- --of the same amount in all 50Z. be placed at their disposal for the

purpose.

DIFFERENTIAL GRAVITY METER COMMITTEE.                                                                              141

Report of the Committee, consisting of G-eneral J. T. Walker, Sir

   W. Thomson, Sir J. H. Lefroy, Greneral E. Strachey, Professor

    A. S. Herschel, Professor Gr. Chrystal, Professor C. Niven,

   Professor A. Schuster, o,nd Professor J. H. Poynting {Secretary),

   appointed for the purpose of inviting designs for a good
   Differential Gravity Meter in supersession of the, pendulum,

   whereby satisfactory results may be obtained at each station of
   observation in a feiu hours, instead of the many days over tvhich

   it is iiecessary to extend, the pendtolum observations.

The Committee have issued the following circular. They subsequently

learnt of the work of M. Mascart in this direction. An account of his

investigation is appended.

                        Copy of the Circular.

The Committee hereby invite designs for an instrument to fulfil the

above condition. It should aim to give some ' statical ' measure of

variation in the weight of a fixed mass in place of the present laborious

' dynamical ' method by means of the pendulum.

The principle of a statical differential gravity meter was very clearly

stated by Sir J. Herschel in his ' Outlines of Asti'onomy ' (§ 189 in

editions 1-4, § 234 in later editions). He suggested, in illustration of

the principle, a weight suspended by a spiral spring, the spring being

always stretched to the same length, whatever the variations of gravity,

by the addition or removal of small weights. There appear to have been

only three attempts to construct such an instrument, resulting in the

torsion Gravimeter of the late J. Allan Broun and the two bathometers

Aof the late Sir C. W. Siemens.    full account of Mr. Broun's instru-

ment, by Colonel Herschel, will be found in the ' Proceedings of the Royal

AnSociety ' (vol. xxxii. p. 507).  account is also given there of a proposal

for a similar instrument by M. Babinet, though the proposal does not

seem to have been carried out. In Mr. Broun's Torsion Gravimeter a

mass is supported by a  bifilar  suspension                                                   a     third  single  wire along the
                                                                                           ;

axis of suspension is also attached to the mass, and this third wire is

twisted till the mass is turned through 90°. If the weight increases the

amount of torsion of the single wire required to keep the weight at 90°

from its original position is increased. For details, see Colonel Herschel's

paper, which contains a careful criticism of the instrument.

Sir C. W. Siemens' Bathometers are shortly described by Colonel

Herschel {loc. cit. p. 515), but a full account of them will be found in

the ' Phil. Trans.' 1876. The first instrument was virtually a barometer

with the cistern at the bottom containing a considerable quantity of air

and closed. The temperature was kept at 0° C. Any variation in gravity

led to an alteration in the height of the mercury column requisite to

balance the pressure of the air. The alteration in height of the mercury

was magnified 300 times by the use of two other liquids, one over the

other, above the mercury. The junction of the middle liquid with the

mercury was in an enlargement of the tube, and its junction with the top

liquid, this junction being the one observed, was in a narrow part of the

tube. The top surface of the uppermost liquid was also in an enlar"-e-

ment of the tube. Above this was a vacuum

--142 REPORT 1886.

    The instrument did not give satisfactory results, and Sir C. W. Siemens

was led to devise another form in which the weight of a column of
mercury was supported by two spiral steel springs. If gravity increased

the weight increased and the springs were stretched. An increase in

their length was observed by a micrometer screw, the moment of contact
being given by an electric signal. This instrument gave much better
results than the first, but it would require much improvement before it

could be brought into use for differential measures of gravity.

    The Committee will be glad to receive suggestions from any who are

interested in the subject, and any design submitted to them will receive

careful attention.

     The following conditions should be satisfied by the instrument :

      It should be portable.
     It should be capable of use in ordinary buildings and under varying
conditions of temperature and pressure.
      Effects of change of temperature should be ascertainable, so that they

may be allowed for.
     The zero point should remain fixed if the temperature and gravity are

the same.

     It should not be affected by terrestrial magnetism.

      It should give variations of ^^0^,^00 in the value of gravity.

    Sir Wm. Thomson has favoured the Committee with the following

account of a gravimeter, designed by himself, for circulation :

Spring Gravimeter.

     The following instrument promises to fulfil all the conditions men-
tioned in the preceding circular. Its sensibility is amply up to the

specified degree. It is of necessity largely influenced by temperature,
and it is not certain that the allowance for temperature, or the means

which may be worked out for bringing the instrument always to one
temperature, may prove satisfactory. It is almost certain, although not

quite certain, that the constancy of the virtual zero of the spring will be
sufficient, after the instrument has been kept for several weeks or months
under the approximately constant stress under which it is to act in

regular use.

     The instrument consists of a thin flat plate of springy german silver of

the kind known as ' doctor,' used for scraping the coloiir off the copper

rollers in calico printing. The piece used was 75 centimetres long, and
Awas cut to a breadth of about 2 centimetres.
                                               brass weight of about

200 orammes was securely soldered to one end of it, and the spring was

bent like the spring of a hanging bell, to such a shape that when held

firmly by one end the spring stood out approximately in a straight line,

havino- the weight at the other end. If the spring had no weight the

curvature, when fi-ee from stress, must be in simple proportion to the

distance along the curve from the end at which the weight is attached,

in order that when held by one end it may be straightened by the weight

fixed at the other end.

     The weight is about 2 per cent, heavier than that which would keep

the spring straight when horizontal; and the fixed end of it is so held

that the spring stands not horizontal but inclined at a slope of about 1

in 5, vnth the weighted end above the level of the fixed end. In this
Aposition the equilibrium is very nearly unstable.
                                                    definite sighted

position has been chosen for the weight relatively to a mark rigidly

connected to the fixed end of the spring, fulfilling the condition that in

this position the eqnilibrinm is stable at all the temperatares for which it

has hitherto been tested, while the unstable position of equilibrium is only

a few millimetres above it for the highest temperature for which the

instrument has been tested, which is about 16° C.

The fixed end is rigidly attached to one end of a brass tube about

8 centimetres diameter, surrounding the spring and weight, and closed

by a glass plate at the upper end of the incline, through which the weight

is viewed. The tube is fixed to the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle

of sheet brass, of which one leg inclined to it at an angle of about one-

fifth radius is approximately horizontal, and is supported by a transverse

trunnion resting on fixed V's under the lower end of the tube and a micro-

meter screw under the short approximately vertical leg of the triangle.

The observation consists in finding the number of turns and parts of

a turn of the micrometer screw required to bring the instrument fronx

the position at which the bubble of the spirit-level is between its proper

marks to the position which equilibrates the spring-borne weight with a
mark upon it exactly in line with a chosen divisional line on a little scale

of 20 half- millimetres, fixed in the tube in the vertical plane perpendicular

to its length.

     The instrument is, as is to be expected, exceedingly sensitive to

changes of temperature. An elevation of temperature of 1° C. diminishes
the Young's modulus of the german silver so much that about a turn

and a half of the micrometer screw (lowering the upper end of the tube

at the rate of f millimetre per turn) produced the requisite change of
adjustment for the balanced position of the movable weight. About

1^ turn of the screw corresponds to a difference of ^-^^ in the force of

gravity, and the sensibility of the instrument is amply valid for :^^ of

this amount, that is to say, for ^ ,, q^q ,, q difference in the force of gravity.
Hence it is not want of sensibility in the instrument that can prevent it

measuring differences of gravity to ^ ^ ^^q ^ ,, ; but to obtain this degree of

minuteness it will be necessary to know the temperature of the spring to

^°within  C. I do not see that there can be any very great difficulty in

achieving the thermal adjustment by the aid of a water-jacket and a
delicate thermometer. To facilitate the requisite thermal adjustment I

propose, in a new instrument of which I shall immediately commence the

construction, to substitute for the brass tube a long double girder of

copper (because of the high thermal conductivity of copper), by which

sufficient uniformity of temperature along the spring, throughout the

mainly effective portion of its length, and up to near the sighted end,
shall be secured. The water-jacket will secure a slight enough variation

of temperature to allow the absolute temperature to be indicated by the
thermometer with, I believe, the required accuracy.

In ' Comptes Rendus,' xcv. (2, 1882), p. 126, is an account of a

differential gravity meter by M. Mascart.

as to coincide with the axis of the tube, and the level of the top of the

mercury can thus be read off by a microscope without parallax. The

height can be easily estimated with suitable illumination to '01 millimetre.

would correspond to a change of less than half a second per day in a

pendulum.

The empirical relation between temperature and level of the mercury

was determined by preliminary experiments at the College de France.

In the same volume of ' Comptes Rendus,' p. 631, M. Mascart gives an

account of observations which he made with this instrument at Paris,

Hamburg, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Drontheim, and Tromso, on the

occasion of a journey to the north. The Copenhagen results could not

be utilised through an accident.

The four northern stations gave results which compared with Paris

differed from the theoretical values by the following amounts :

of a similar instrument should its installation be contemplated.

                                                          ,

     Messrs. Elliott Bros, called the attention of the Secretary, during the
spring of the current year, to the fact that in some of the coils the
paraffin used for insulation acquii-ed in time a greenish tinge, which is
most marked round the interior of the case and round the places at which
the copper of the connecting rods comes in contact with the paraffin.
Careful examination shows this green tinge in almost all the coils, and

an analysis of the paraffin made by Mr. Robinson, of the Chemical Labo-

ratory, Cambridge, proved the colour to be due to a very slight trace of

copper. The insulation resistance of several of the standards was, there-
fore, tested by passing the current from 24 Leclanche cells through a high
resistance galvanometer, and the coil from the case through the paraffin
to the wire. This resistance for most of the coils tested was found to be
from eight thousand to ten thousand megohms. One coil in particular,
sent by Messrs. Elliott, in which the gi-een coloration was most marked,
had a resistance of 5000 megohms. Thus it is clear that the resistance
of the coils is not hitherto seriously affected by the presence of the copper
in the paraffin, but at the same time it becomes necessary to watch closely
for any changes which may occur, and to select very carefully the material

used. There appears to be great difficulty in getting rid of all the acid

employed in the manufacture of the paraffin.

     The only coil among those tested which showed an insulation resist-
ance, so low as to be serious, was the one known in the Reports as Flat.

When the galvanometer of 1700 ohms resistance was shunted with 4 ohms

a deflection of 80 divisions on the scale was obtained. The same deflec-

tion was obtained when the resistance in circuit was a megohm and the

shunt was about 20 ohms. Thus the insulation resistance of Flat was
only about i megohm, or 200,000 ohms.

     Two coils of special interest have recently been sent to be tested.

One from Pi^of. Himstedt, of Freiburg, will connect his determination of
the ohm with those made in Cambridge ; while the second is a coil of
10 B.A. units from the Johns Hopkins University, which has been com-
pared with the coils used in the determination of the ohm there. The
results of the observations on these coils are, however, not yet com-

pletely worked out.
     The Committee wish to express their sense of the great desirability

of establishing a National Standardising Laboratory for Electrical In-
struments on a permanent basis, and their willingness to co-operate in

the endeavour to secure the same.

     The Committee have had under consideration the question of the
means to be taken to secure the general adoption of the Resolutions of the

Paris Congress.

     The Committee have received by the kindness of the French Govern-
ment a specimen of the platinum iridium wire, of which it is proposed
that the French National Standards of resistance should be constructed.
They hope shortly to make a aeries of measurements of its specific resist-

ance and temperature coefficient.
      In conclusion they would ask to be reappointed, with the addition of

the name of Mr. J. T. Bottomley and a grant of 501.

Association are given. For the one-ohm coils the temperatures range

from 11° to 18°, while the coils of higher resistance were examined only

at tenaperatures near 17°. It was necessary in all cases to extend the

range of temperatures in order to determine the temperature coefficient.

^that of 100   would appear to show that it has now reached its per-

manent state.

Messrs. Elliott Bros, possess a standard |^ 63, made at the same time

as the above two coils which in August 1884 had a resistance of

                    1-00027 legal ohms at 13-8°,

while in April 1886 it was found to be -99928 at 166° and

                                                                    ·99992 at 18-6°.

From this it follows that its value at 18-8° would be '99998, indicating

a fall of -00029 in a year and eight months.

This coil showed marked traces of the green coloration referred to

in the Report, but its insulation resistance was tested and found to be
^8000 megohms. Both the coils
                                       100 a^id 101 show slight traces of the

green colour ; their insulation, however, is remarkably high. It would

seem, then, that it is very necessary to avoid the use of newly made coils

in important researches, and to keep a careful check on any secular
Wechanges by means of repeated comparison.
                                              hope, when the permanence

^of 101 has been certainly established, to remove the paraffin and see

if there is any change in the coil visible to the eye which could account

for this fall in resistance.

The two ten-ohm coils '^ 102, 103 have also been compared with the

one-ohm in the manner described in the reports, and the values are given
in the tables below. These coils are stated by Messrs. Elliott Bros, to be
made of ' the same wire of platinum silver -015 of an inch diameter and

3"52 metres long.'

ON TIDAL OBSERVATIONS IN CANADA.  151

(Sif John Macdonald), at which other membei-s of the Cabinet, including
the Minister of Marine, were present. The memorial of the Committee
was very fully discussed and favourably received. The Minister of
Marine, after the interview, asked for further information on practical
details. This, with the aid of the data obtained from the corresponding
Committee in England, was supplied to him.

     The official answer was received in June, and stated that, ' while the
Government is fully sensible of the importance of establishing stations for
continuous tidal observations in Canadian waters, it is not proposed at
present, owing to the large expense in carrying out surveys and exploi a-
tions, to undertake the additional expense which would be involved in

establishing the stations referred to.'

     The surveys and explorations here alluded to are those in Hudson's
Bay and on the Great Lakes, and your Committee were semi-officially
informed that, until these are more nearly completed, it is considered un-

advisable to incur the expense necessary to accomplish the tidal observa-

tions. The Committee were told, however, that 'the Government is fully
alive to their importance, and much indebted to the Association for having
brought the subject to their attention, and for the valuable practical
hints given as to method and cost.' ' In the near future it maybe able
to carry out a work so necessary and useful to the commercial interests of

the country.'

     Under these encouraging circumstances it is thought advisable to re-
commend the reappointment of the Committee.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. James N. Shoolbred

   {^Secretary) and Sir William Thomson, appointed fo7' the Reduc-
   tion and Tabulation of Tidal Observations in the English
   Channel, made ivith the Dover Tide-gauge, and for connecting
   them ivith Observations made on the French Coast.

                                                     [Plate VI.]

Tour Committee (having, through the courtesy of the Board of Trade,

been placed in possession of the records of the self-registering tide-
gange at Dover for the four years 1880-3, and also having been pre-

sented by the Minister of Public Works of Belgium with copies of the

curves of the self-registering gauge at Ostend) stated in their RejJort last
year, that they had completed the reduction and comparison of the times
and heights of high water and of low water during these four years at
both places.

    In order to obtain a common datum-plane for the reduction of the

different levels, advantage has been taken of the international datum,

which had been established by the British Association Committee ' On

the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain,' and which had been made use of
by the British Association Committee ' On the Stationary Tides in the

English Channel,' in the reduction of the simultaneous observations taken
in 1878.

     This datum is 20 feet below that of the ordnance of Great Britain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Dover and at Calais) 5'50 metres below the Frencli ' zei'O du nivellement '

(Bourdaloue).
      Since tlie meeting of last year the Committee, considering that these

four years' observations would, in their entirety, form too large a mass
for publication, decided upon specially preparing a more limited portion

of these observations.

     After much consideration, as the records of the year 1883 appeared
on the "whole to be the most reliable and complete, selections were made
of a fortnight before and after the winter, and also at the summer solstice,

and of a similar period at the vernal and at the autumnal equinox in that
year ; those times appearing to offer most points of intei'est.

     The high water and low water observations during these four periods
are appended to this Report, as also a continuous diagram of the two sets

of observations during one of the periods (the vernal equinox).

     It has been repeatedly felt by the Committee that there are many
points of interest which present themselves in the four-year period em-

braced by the entire records which are beyond the scope of the present
Committee, and which would require a complete and exhaustive examina-
tion of those records to fully disclose them.

     Your Committee, therefore, before closing their labours, would suggest,
that, if the Committee ' On the Harmonic Analysis of Tidal Observations'

considered the investigation of the tides of the English Channel to be
within the scope of their inquiiy, the present Committee would, with the
consent of the respective authorities, be glad to place at the disposal of

the Committee ' On Harmonic Analysis ' the records of the Dover and

of the Ostend tide-gauges ; as also any further information in their

possession.

      In the earlier stages of the work of the present Committee it was
hoped that some of the records of the self- registering tide gauges on the
French coast would have been included in the comparison of the various
tidal observations in the English Channel. It was found, however, that
the difficulty to obtain records continuously throughout the four-year
period selected was very considerable. With the more limited periods of
four separate months in one year the difficulty is very materially reduced.

      It is still possible, that a comparative record of at least one of these

shorter periods from a point on the Fi-ench coast may yet arrive so as to

 be presented with the other observations accompanying this Report.
      In conclusion the Committee request, that the thanks of the British

Association be conveyed to the President of the Board of Trade, and to

the Minister of Public Works of Belgium for their courtesy in placing at
the disposal of the Committee the records of the tide-gauges at Dover

and at Ostend respectively. Also to the several other authorities and
private individuals, for the kind assistance they have afforded to the Com-
mittee during the course of their investigations.

       ON WAVE-LENGTH TABLES OF THE SPECTRA OF THE ELEMENTS. 167

 [The Report of the Committee on Electrolysis will be found at p. 308.]

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir H. E. Eoscoe,

   Mr. LocKYER, Professors Dewar, Liveing, Schuster, W. N.
   Hartley, and Wolcott Gibbs, Captain Abney, and Dr. Marshall
   Watts (^Secretary), appointed for the purpose of preparing a new

    series of Wave-length Tables of the Spectra of the Elements.

The Committee report that satisfactory progress has bee a made with the
tabulation of the emission-spectra of the elements and compounds. The

volumes of Reports for 1884 and 1885 contain the spectra of the elements,
complete, and of the compounds up to manganese-oxide ; and the re-
maining portion of the emission-spectra of the compounds, together with
the more accurately measured absorption-spectra of the elements and
compounds, are printed in the volume for the present year. Under these
circumstances the Committee request reappointment.

     The results confirm in all respects those obtained in the previous pre-
liminary experiments. They are as follows :

    (a) When temperature is constant and concentration (n) varying,

^H^then  increases rapidly with NaCl, more slowly with KCl; diminishes
n

slowly with NaNOs, and very rapidly with KNOg, the order being

NaCl, KCl, NaNOs, KlNOa. The figures show a clear agreement with

those of Tammann (Wiedemann 'Ann.' xxiv), obtained by the barometric

method. This is entirely at variance with Wiillner's statement (Pogg.

--^' Ann.' ex.) that ^  is  constant  for all  salts                        a statement not borne
                                                                         ;

         P

out by his figures, discordant as they are.

(/3) When n is constant and temperature varying, then the value of

P~P^^ i,e., the restraining efiect of each salt molecule, is a diminishing

  np

quantity in the case of NaCl, practically constant with KCl, slowly in-

creasing with NaNOs, and rapidly increasing with KNO3, the order
being the same but reversed. This also is confirmed by Tammann, and
agrees with the results of Legrand ('Ann. Chim. et Phys.' 1835).

     (·y) When, too, the temperature and concentration increase, the salts
form the same series : decrease of restraining efiect with NaCl, less so
with KCl, no change with NaNOs, and a marked increase with KNO3.

Connected with the above are :

     (^) The order is the same when the solubility as a function of
the temperature is considered. NaCl has its solubility only slightly

affected by rise of temperature, KCl more so, NaNOs still more, and
KNO3 greatly so.

   --(e) The value of ^ ^, where n^l, is very nearly the same for all

four salts at the same temperatures.  KCl =-4-400

     (^) The heat of solution for     KN03= -8-500

                       NaCl =-1-180

                     NaN03= -5-200

     Again the same series.
     The behaviour of these four salts can be satisfactorily explained on
the lines of the theory of solution laid down in a paper on the nature of

solution ('Phil. Mag.' 1883); but for the details reference must be
made to the memoir.

                                II. Refractive Indices of Salt Solutions.

     The work of nearly all previous experimenters on this branch of
the subject of solution is unavailable for any systematic examination of
the point, inasmuch as but few salts have been examined, and only a
few solutions of each ; while even in these cases the results require re-
calculation, as the solutions examined were of percentage composition,
and the conversion of these into terms of even molecules of salt per 100

H2O is a laborious process, requiring a large amount of interpolation,

for which the data are generally insuQicient.
     Recently, however, a paper by Ostwald has come into our hands

(' Volum. u. Optisch-Chem. Studien,' Dorpat, 1878), which contains the
necessary data for a partial examination of the subject. Ostwald's ex-
                                     ----

periments were conducted with solutions containijig one equivalent in
grammes of the base or acid in one litre of the solution . Consequently
the. salt solutions obtained on neutralisation contain one equivalent in
grammes of the salt in the two litres. These solutions, though not
strictly comparable, are still nearly so, and are of the approximate

strength, MR. IIOH^O.

     The results' obtained by Ostwald are as follows :

    (a) When a solution of a base (potash or soda) is neutralised by the

requisite amount of the solution of an acid (fourteen organic and inorganic
acids), the difference between the sum of the refractive indices of the
two solutions before mixing and twice the refractive index of the result-
ing salt solution is a value almost identical for both bases, no matter
what may be the acid. There is thus complete parallelism between the
change of refractive index and of molecular volume on neutralisation.

     (/3) The conclusion is tliat the alteration in the physical constants,
brought about by combination, has a constant value for each constituent
which enters into the combination, and is therefore independent of the

other constituents with which the first may combine.
     Thus there is little room for doubt that in other cases also alteration

in molecular volume will be accompanied by parallel changes in the refrac-
tion equivalent. Unfortunately, Ostwald's results are not of a form to
permit their conversion into refraction equivalents, or it would be pos-
sible to show, even more clearly, the close connection between these

physical constants.

III. Saturation of Salt Solutions.^

It has long been known that a salt is able to drive another out of

solution in very many cases, partially or completely, while in other

cases the solubility of one or both salts is largely increased.

    When the two salts are capable of forming well-defined double salts,

then either salt added to a saturated solution of the other completely

expels it from solution. On the other hand, when the two salts are iso-

morpJwus, and are thus able to form mixed crystals, then the expulsion
from solution is onlj partial (Rudorff. Wiedem. ' Annalen,' xxv. 626).

This may be explained as follows :

Double salts do not  exist as  such  in  solution                                       the saturated solution
                                                                                     ;

of a double salt is therefore not necessarily saturated for either of its

constituents, but may be able to dissolve more of one or other of the

single salts. As the amount, however, of this salt increases there

arrives a point at which the solution has become so rich in this salt (B)

that any one molecule of the other salt (A) may be regarded as being in
contact with a molecule of B ; aggregation or combination to form the

double salt (AB) is then possible, and crystallisation proceeds jjari passu

Awith the solution of B, and results finally in the complete expulsion of
Afrom the solution in cases where the attraction between and B exceeds
Athe cohesion of either or B. While, on the other hand, if this is not

the case the expulsion is only partial. This explanation is strongly

supported by the stability and definite character of the well-defined
double salts, which are totally expelled from solution, and by the insta-

bility of those salts which are only partially expelled, and also by the

fact that the saturated solutions of pairs of salts which do not crystallise
together are unaffected by excess of either salt.

                                 IV. Eorpansion of Salt Solutions.

     The results described in the previous Report have been completely
examined, and will soon be pubhshed. The following may be added to

the conclusions already arrived at :

     The effect of heat on the volume of a solution of a salt depends on

the solubility of the salt as a function of the temperature. If the solu-

bility be little affected by temperature then the volume curve approaches
more nearly to a straight line than when the solubility is largely de-
pendent on temperature.

     In the former case the effect of heat is simpler than in the latter. In
the one the solution is practically of the same strength throughout. In
the other the rise of temperature is attended not only by expansion, biit
also by what is practically dilution of the solution. Thus it is at present
impossible to trace out a further connection between solubility and rate
of expansion of a salt in solution.

                                   V. Water of Crystallisation.

    An examination of the evidence derivable from the results of thermo-

chemical investigations, and also a comparison of the molecular volumes
of dissolved salts, lead to the conclusion that no part of the water in a
solution of a hydrated salt can be said to be in a different relation to the
salt from that of the remainder of the water. In other words, water of

--crystallisation cannot be recognised in solution either by thermal or

volume changes it is indistinguishable from the rest of the water. The
argument based on colour changes of solutions of C0CI2, &c., does not
affect the above, for it is not contended that the salt is anhydrous in the
Bame sense as it is when dried at 150° C.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors Ramsay,

   TiLDEN, Maeshall, and W. L. Goodwin (Secretary), appointed

   for the purpose of investigating certain Physical Constants of
   Solution, especially the Expansion of Saline Solutions.

Graham, in a series of interesting experiments, has shown that saline

solutions absorb water- vapour from a saturated atmosphere (' Edin. Journ.

of Science,' xvi. 1828, pp. 326-335 ; also Schweigger, ' Journ.' liii. 1828,

pp. 249-264). This process he called inva'poration. His experiments

were made by enclosing, in a tin canister containing water, glass basins

in which were equal weights of (generally) saturated solutions. After a

few days the canister was opened, the dishes weighed, and the gain of

water by invaporation thus determined. The relative rates of invaporation

thus became approximately known. But these rates estimated in this

way are influenced by the rate of diffusion of water- vapour in air, and by

the rates of diffusion of the salts in water. The latter especially must be
Ataken into account in interpreting Graham's results.
                                                       salt with strong

 attraction for water, but low rate of diffusion, might show less invapora-
 tion than one with a weaker attraction for water but a higher rate of

 diffusion. Thus, potassic chloride diffuses faster than sodic chloride, but
 the latter has the greater attraction for water vapour. If solutions of
 these two salts were confined in a space containing water, the sodic chlo-
 ride solution would at first attract water more rapidly, but the consequent
 dilution of the surface layer would not be counterbalanced by diffusion so
 rapidly as in the case of potassic chloride ; so that the rates of invapora-

tion might become equal, or that of potassic chloride even greater. Some
experiments made by us have given indications of these phenomena.

      If the rates of invaporation, not complicated by diffusion, could be
accurately measured, a comparison of such measurements would be
 valuable, by giving indications of the formation of hydrates in solution.
They would also be of value in considering the ' Correlation of Physical
Properties of Solution with Concentration,' in the manner indicated by
D. Mendeleeff (' Ber. Deut. Ch. Ges.' xix. 370-389). But the subject can

be investigated in a different way and with promise of more fruitful
results. When two salts are enclosed in the same space with a certain

quantity of water, the salts tend to keep the atmosphere dry by con-
densing the water- vapour. This goes on until all the water is evaporated
except that small portion which remains in the condition of vapour. The
question at once presents itself, in what proportion will the two salts
divide the water between them ? The proportion will be influenced,
probably, by the relative masses of the salts and the water, and by the
temperature, as well as by the relative attractions of the salts for water.
If the salts are in molecular proportion, they might be expected to divide

the water between them much in the same way as equivalents of caustic

soda and potash with a simple equivalent of sulphuric acid in solution.
That is, if the attraction of salts for the water which dissolves them is of
the same nature as that between acids and bases, the partition would be

in proportions representing the relative attractions of the salts for water.

It was to test the correctness of this reasoning that the following experi-
ments were made.

     The salts were carefully dried, and weighed out in small test-tubes
(5'5 cm. long and 1 cm. diam.). The quantities used were in the ratio of

the molecular weights. Thus, in the first experiment (I.) the masses of
the salts were two-hundredths of the gram-molecules, and the quantity of

water eight-hundredths of the gram-molecule. As a rule, the water was
divided between the two salts, because by so doing we thought to hasten

the completion of the experiment. Experience, however, has decided us to
abandon this method in favour of enclosing the water along with the salts,

the three in separate small tubes, so that the process of invaporation may

be watched from the beginning. The salts and water were sealed in a
large glass tube (about 10 cm. long and 4 cm. in diameter) before the

blowpipe. When the small tube containing the water appeared to be

dry, the enclosing tube was opened, the small tubes with their contents
weighed, and then resealed. Invaporation was very slow, owing to the
small surface exposed by the liquids in the narrow tubes. Shallow
vessels would have been better, but the hermetical enclosing of these pre-
sented such difficulties that the narrow tubes were used in preference.
Heating to 100° C. and cooling gradually was also tried as a means to
hasten invaporation. This was found to have the desired effect up to a
certain point, beyond which the water began to condense on the enclosing

tube. The results of the experiments are here put in tabular form. In
the first column the formula of the substances in the small test-tubes are
given ; in the second, the masses of the substances in grams ; in the third
the number of days between the first sealing and the first opening of the
enclosing tube ; in the fourth, the quantities of water adhering to the
salts at the time of first opening ; and following are pairs of columns
giving similar data for the second, third, and fourth times of opening.
The quantities of salts and of water are also given in molecules, 100
molecules of water being taken as the basis of calculation. The ' period *
in each case is the time elapsed from the beginning of the experiment.

of each of tlie salts. The sodic chloride has nearly 93 per cent, of the

water. It is possible that in course of time all the water may be

attracted by the sodium salt ; in which case we should conclude that the

force in operation is different from chemical affinity.

     Experiment IV. was made to ascertain the effect of increasing the

Telative quantity of sodic chloride. The effect is to hasten the invapora-

tion of water by this salt. After 144 days it has over 99 per cent, of the

water. Now, it is known that even a saturated solution of sodic chloride

gives off water- vapour to a dry atmosphere, so that in this final condition

-of experiment IV. the potassic chloride is in the presence of water-vapour.
If the force of invaporation (which is probably intimately connected with
the force of solution) were of the nature of chemism, it would cause com-
bination of the potassic chloride with the water, and the condition of

·equilibrium would be one in which the relative quantities of water held
by the two salts would be a measure of their affinities for water. The

discussion of this point will, however, be better postponed until our ex-

periments have been further extended.

     In experiments V., VI., VII., sodic chloride is pitted against the

highly deliquescent lithic chloride. In V., with the same number of

molecules as in I., the lithic chloride takes all but about one-third per

cent, of the water; VI. and VII. show the effect of increasing the relative

quantity of water. (Owing to the rapid deliquescence of the lithic

chloride, the water is sometimes in slight excess of the theoretical

quantity.) VI. shows that when the relative quantity of water is
doubled, the lithic chloride still takes nearly all after 42 days, and quite

all after 173 days. In this case 12*5 molecules of the salt have in-

vaporated 100 molecules of water. When the relative quantity of water

is again doubled, as in VII., an unexpected result is obtained. As in V.

and VI., the greater part of the water was given to the lithic chloride

before enclosure. After 177 days, we find that the sodic chloride is gain-

ing water, and this continues until in 129 days it has gained about 6 per

cent, of the whole quantity. The condition of equilibrium is not yet
reached, but there is clearly a limit to the quantity of water which the

lithic chloride can hold against the attraction of the sodic chloride.

There is a wide field of research opening up in the direction indicated

Weby these few experiments.  shall extend the investigations to other

salts, particularly chlorides, with a view to testing more fully the effect
of increasing the relative quantities of water and of one of the salts ; and

shall also attempt to determine the influence, if any, of temperature.

With large proportions of water, experiments conducted at the tempera-

tures at which cryohydrates are formed may yield interesting results.

 aud to preserve tliem for long periods without change, in order that
 the results of series of experiments made at intervals of several days or of
 weeks shall not be subject to unknown errors. In dealing with oxygen^
 the presence of nitrogen must especially be guarded against, for it com--
 biues more freely with oxygen (when the latter gas is present in excess)

 under the influence of the electric discharge than is commonly known to

 be the case.

      The mercury gasholder invented by Bunsen, which has been

 described in ' Watts' Dictionary ' and elsewhere, is hardly suitable for

Acollecting gases in the rather large quantities that will be required.

 similar but much larger gasholder, in which the mercury was replaced

 by sulphuric acid, has been tried. But, apart from the risk of air gaining
 admittance through the sulphuric acid, in which it is to some extent

soluble, we find that even thoroughly washed oxygen, prepared from

 chlorate of potassium, carries with it a sufficient quantity of suspended
matter to result in the presence of slight traces of chlorine tetroxide in
the gas after the gasholder has been refilled several times. After the

failure of this method of storing oxygen, an attempt was made to prepare
 it by electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid almost saturated with chromic

anhydride. When the superficial area of the negative electrode em-

ployed greatly exceeded that of the positive electrode, pure oxygen was

obtained in this way. When the evolution of oxygen was conveniently^

rapid, however, some bubbles of hydrogen escaped the oxidising action
of the chromic acid and made their appearance. Finally, after the failure
of an attempt to store pure oxygen by compressing it in iron bottles, the
apparatus next described was constructed for producing the gas in smaller

quantities as required.

    AIn the diagram, is a cylinder having a capacity of one litre. It can

be filled with mercury from a reservoir, not shown, through an india-
rubber tube O, the entrance of bubbles of air carried by the mercury being

Aprevented by the air-trap B. E is a flask connected to by the tube

J H. In E is placed the material from which oxygen is to be produced.
G contains phosphorus pentoxide * to remove moisture as far as possible
from the gas before it is delivered through P into the receiver in which

Git is to be collected. Beyond is one of Mr. Cetti's patent vacuum taps.

As this will not prevent the passage of air in the direction a to b, however,,

it is trapped at C. This trap can be filled with mercury to any desired

Rlevel from a reservoii-, as shown at and S. The only joints not made

before the blowpipe are those shown at J, H, and F. These are all
protected with mercury in the now familiar manner, the india-rubber
connections being well lubricated and firmly bound with iron wire.

     The materials from which oxygen is to be prepared having been

Aplaced in E, and everything being in order, is filled with mercury, t^ is

closed, t- and fi are opened, and the appai-atus is exhausted through P.

Oxygen is then generated in E until the whole apparatus, including A,

is filled. This process of exhausting and refilling is repeated at intervals
of a few hours two or three times ; and after the third operation a

specimen may be collected and examined. Such specimens have been

found to be very fairly satisfactory ; two samples of oxygen which had been

Aconfined in for several weeks contained respectively 99'97 and 99"9&

will resist the passage of air sufficiently to permit this to be done.

    If a delivery tube be attached to P, all air may be driven from it by

flushing it with mercury before proceeding to deliver the oxygen in the
usual mancer. Thus waste of pure gas is avoided.

to the stock of oxygen already in A. When A, partly empty, is to be
Dreplenished, t^ is closed, t'^ opened, and heat is applied to E, being filled

with mercury to the level S, through which the gas is permitted to

escape. When E is thoroughly heated and a steady evolution of gas

has set in, the oxygen is delivered into A. Thus if the replenishment of

A be not too long delayed, no loss of time results from accidents to E,

which can at any time be replaced and exhausted, whilst the oxygen

Aremaining in is still available for use, if the taps have been properly

ground and are thoroughly lubricated. Of course the trap D, like C,
must be closed by filling it with mercury at all times when escape of

gas from E is not desired.
     When potassium chlorate is used as the source of oxygen, breakages, E,

are frequent. Silver oxide is much better, but it is troublesome to obtain

it perfectly free from carbon dioxide. This has led us to employ a

Wetions.  prepare the mixture by thoroughly mixing the recrystallised

salts, maintaining the product in a state of fusion for some little while in

an open dish, and subsequently powdering the solid produced on cooling.

The melting-point of the product is considerably lower than that of

either chlorate of potassium or chlorate of sodium ; and it gives off its

oxygen to about the same extent as chlorate of potassium ; that is to say,

about one-third of it is easily expelled by a moderate heat.

In conclusion, we are glad to be able to report that we have also con-

structed most of the rest of the apparatus that will be required in the

Weinvestigation that is before us.   hope, therefore, to make considerable

progress before the next meeting of the Association.

--Note. October 10, 1886. Since this report was read we have suc-

ceeded in connecting all the parts of the oxygen generator and holder

before the blowpipe by a method described by one of us.' The only

permanent mercury joint which remains is that at F, which is now

Wespecially protected against entrance of air.  may, therefore, expect

to approach still nearer to the attainment of absolutely pure gases for our

experiments.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors Tilden and

   Armstrong (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of investi-
   gating Isomeric Naphthalene Derivatives.

The study of isomeric naphthalene derivatives acquires importance from

a variety of considerations, notably, from the very close relationship of

naphthalene to benzene, which finds expression in the use of a simple

hexagon to represent the latter hydrocarbon, the first mentioned being

symbolised by a double hexagon formed of two benzene hexagons joined

so that one side is common to both.

In the case of benzene there are but three possible isomeric di-deriva-

tives, according to the received theory of the constitution of this hydro-

carbon ; the formation of these di-derivatives is governed by certain

very simple ' laws,' the first of which may conveniently be termed the

^ara-law, the second the meta-\a,w : i.e., mono-derivatives containing a

OHhydrocarbon radicle, one of the halogens, NH2, or   invariably yield as

chief product a para-di-derivative together with the isomeric ortho-di-

derivative, the meta-di-derivative being formed, if at all, to but a small

extent; whereas mono-derivatives containing NO2, SO3H, or COOH

yield as chief product the me<a-di-derivative, the para- and ortho-deriva-

tives being formed in relatively small amount.

    Instead of three, naphthalene may give rise to ten isomeric Ji-

derivatives ; it might therefore be expected that the laws of substitution

for naphthalene would be proportionally less simple than for benzene

thus far, however, this has not been found to be the case, and many of

the di-derivatives are to be prepared only by indirect methods. The para-

law obtains equally in the case of naphthalene, being applicable to mono-

derivatives analogous to those which in the benzene series obey the para-

law ; but an interesting modification of the meta-law, exemplified by the
behaviour of nitronaphthalene to bromine, nitric acid, and sulphuric
acid, is to be noted : nitrobenzene under such circumstances would yield

chiefly the meta-derivative, but in the case of nitronaphthalene the

--attack becomes shifted to the other nucleus, an a -a -derivative being

formed as represented by the formulae :

NO,,        NO,                       NOo

      NO.,       SO,H

      It would appear from our knowledge of the naphthalene derivatives

 generally that, as a rule, the a-hydrogen atoms (see figure) are those
 which become displaced, and that the /5-atoms are aff'ected only under

--somewhat exceptional conditions as in the formation of /3-sulphonic

acids at high temperatures in presence of an excess of sulphuric acid

and when an amidogen or hydroxyl group is present. Hence the beha-

--viour of nitronaphthalene above referred to the absence of similarity in

--the behaviour of the corresponding nitro-derivatives of naphthalene and

benzene is not improbably due to the existence in the case of naphthalene

of a higher law, which it may be permitted to term the ' alpha-law.'
     As naphthalene-/3-sulphonic acid is the only /3-derivative obtainable

·directly from naphthalene, it appeared to be specially important to study

the behaviour of the sulphonic derivatives in order to throw light on the

formation of the /3-mou(isulphonic acid ; and it was to be expected that

their investigation would furnish results of value in determining the laws

of substitution in the naphthalene series : moreover the ease with which
the sulphonic radicle may be removed by hydrolysis renders the sulphonic

 derivatives especially suitable subjects of study.'

       It will suffice to indicate briefly the character of the results hitherto

·obtained, reserving a full account for one of the chemical journals.

     The action of sulphuric acid in excess on naphthalene at a tempera-
ture of 160°-180° has been studied by Ebert and Merz, who isolated

--two distinct acids an a- and a ji-disuljph.onic acid ; Armstrong and

Graham (' Chem. Soc. Trans.' 1881, p. 133 ; ' Berichte,' 1882, p. 204) on re-

examining the product obtained evidence of the presence of other disul-
phonic acids, but after numerous trials the attempt to separate these was
for the time abandoned, and attention directed to the preparation of disul-

phonic acids by other methods less likely to give rise to secondary changes,
such as readily occur on heating in presence of sulphuric acid. The result
has been to establish the existence of two acids isomeric with the a- and
/3-acid of Ebert and Merz.

   --y-Naphthalenedisulplionic Acid. This appears to be the sole pro-

duct of the action of chlorosulphonic acid, CISO3H, on naphthalene in

=accordance with the equation : CioHg-f 2SO3HCI C,oB[5(S03H)2

 -f- 2HC1. On distilling its chloride (m. p. 184°) with phosphorus penta-
chloride, y-dichloronaphthalene is produced : therefore it may be con-

cluded that y-naphthalenedisulphonic acid is an a-n-derivative of the
same constitution as the nitronaphthalene derivatives formulated above.
218 REPORT-- 1886.

--Naphthalene-? -fi-disulphonic Acid. This acid is prepared by acting on

naphfchalene-/3-mono3ulphonic acid with chlorosnlphonic acid, and is cer-

tainly the chief product, but it remains to ascertain whether an isomer is

not produced simultaneously. It is at once converted by the action of

bromine into a dibromo-ruonosulphonic acid ; this behaviour renders it
more than probable that the sulphonic radicle introduced by the agency

of the SO3HCI assumes an a- position.

The two acids prepared by Bbert and Merz by the action of sulphuric

acid at a high temperature (160°-180°) are in all probability /3-/3-deriva-

tives ; they are both isomeric with the acids obtained by sulphonating-

naphthalene-a- and /3-7>io«osulphonic acids by means of SO3HCI : and

this difference being established between the action of sulphuric acid

and that of chlorosulphonic acid, it appeared desirable to ascertain the

behaviour with SO3HCI of the naphthalene derivatives which had pre-

viously been converted into sulphonic acids in the ordinary manner. The

derivatives taken were a-nitro-, a-bromo-, a-chloro-, and /3-chloro-naph-

thalene : these have all been found to yield the same products when

sulphonated by means of SO3HCI as on treatment with sulphuric acid.

It is especially noteworthy, however, that from both a-bromo- and

fi-chloro-naphthalene an acid has been obtained in small quantity isomeric

with the ^ara-sulphonic acid previously known, and which forms the

chief product                                                                           this secondary product is probably also  an  a-o -derivative
                                                                                     ;

like the primary product, but of the same series as the nitro-sulphonic

acid formulated above. Two isomeric sulphonic acids also are obtained

from /3-chloronaphthalene. One, which is the chief product when
SO3ECI is used, has been shown by Arnell to correspond to 0-dichloro-

naphthalene, while the other corresponds to t-dichloronaphthalene, and

therefore to the /3-disnlphonic acid of Bbert and Merz, and to Schaefer's

betanaphtholsulphonic acid. Probably 0-dichloronaphthalene is the

ortho- or 1-2 modification, and it may almost be regarded as established

that £-dichloronaphthalene is a /3^-/33'-derivative ; so that, while «- and
^-chloronaphthalene both behave in the manner to be expected from the

analogy subsisting between benzene and naphthalene, evidence is afforded

by the production of the a'-a'^'-derivative from the one and of the iP-jo^'-
derivative from the other of the existence in the naphthalene molecule, in

addition to the ' para-plane ' of benzene, of two ' planes of symmetry,' as.

it were, in which an inflaence is exercised.

The study of the action of bromine on aqueous solutions of the naph'-

thalene-sulphonic acids has also furnished results of interest. It has long

been known that when naphthalene-a-sulphonic acid is treated with

bromine the sulphonic group is displaced, dibromonaphthalenes being

formed, whereas the /J-sulpbonic acid is converted into a dibromonaph-

thalene- sulphonic acid, the SO3H group retaining its place. It now

appears that this behaviour of the two acids is fairly typical. Thus the-

--two disulpbonic acids of Ebert and Merz which are doubtless both /3-/3-

--derivatives yield isomeric dibromonaphthaquinonemowosulphonates on

--treatment with bromine in excess ^only one of the sulphonic radicles,

viz., that which is contained in the Cg groap which is oxidised, being

displaced. The isomeric dibromomonosulphonic acids obtained by

treating (a) naphthalene /3-monosulphonic acid and (h) the ?-/3-disul-

phonic acid above described with bromine are finally converted by the

action of bromine into the same tetrabromonaphthaquinone, the sulpho-

nic radicle being displaced, although in the /3-position, in consequence
               ON ISOMERIC NAPHTHALENE DERIVATIVES.      219'

of the oxidation to quinone of the Cg group in which it is located. The

-- --y-disnlphonic acid which is doubtless an a-a-derivative readily parts

with both its sulphonic radicles, yielding as final products dibromonaphtha-

Aquinone and what appears to be a hexabromonaphthalene.  further

illustration of the stability of a /3-sulphonic radicle is afforded by the

behaviour of (Schaefer's) betanaphtholsulphonic acid with bromine, the

end product being a bromohydroxyquinones«?p/iO?i.aie.

     The results thus briefly recorded have been obtained with the

assistance of Messrs. F. W. Streatfield, S. Williamson, and W. P.

Wynne, B.Sc.

It is anticipated that by the time of the next meeting of the Asso-

ciation the investigation of isomeric naphthalene derivatives will have

been carried sufficiently far to render possible a fairly complete statement

of the laws of substitution in the naphthalene series in the shape of a

final report.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor T. McK. Hughes,.
     Dr. 11. Hicks, and Messrs. H. Woodward, E. B. Luxmoore,.
     P. P. Pennant, mid Edwin Morgan, appointed for the purpose
    of exploring the Caves of North Wales. Drawn up by Dr. H.

      Hicks, Secretary.

The explorations conducted by the Committee have been confined to the
caverns of Ffynnon Benno and Cae Gwyn, in the Vale of Clwyd. These
caverns had been explored in preceding years by Dr. H. Hicks and Mr.

E. B. Luxmoore, some of the results being given in a paper communicated
to the Geological Section of the Association in 1885, but more fully in a
paper in the ' Quart. Jour. Geolog. Soc.,' Feb. 1886.

    Among the remains discovered in these two caverns up to the com-

mencement of the work this year there were over eighty jaws belonging to
various animals, and more than 1,300 loose teeth, including about 400'
rhinoceros, 15 mammoth, 180 hyaena, and 500 horse teeth. Other bones
and fragments of bones occurred also in very great abundance. Several
flint implements, including flakes, scrapers, and lance-heads, were found
in association with the bones. The most important evidence, however,,
obtained in the previous researches was that bearing on the physical
changes to which the area must have been subjected since the caverns
were occupied by the animals. During the excavations it became clear
that the bones had been greatly disturbed by water action, that the sta-
lagmite floor, in parts more than a foot in thickness, and massive stalac-
tites had also been broken and thrown about in all positions, and that
these had been covered afterwards by clays and sand coutainiug foreign
pebbles. This seemed to prove that the caverns, now 400 feet above ord-
nance datum, must have been submerged subsequently to their occupation
by the animals and by man. One of the principal objects, therefore,
which the Committee had in view this year was to critically examine
those portions of the caverns not previously explored, so as to endeavour

to arrive at the true cause of the peculiar conditions observed. Work
was commenced at the end of May and carried on during the whole of

June and parts of July and August.

    When tlie explorations were suspended last year it was supposed that

we had just reached a chamber of considerable size, but after a few days'
work this year it was found that what appeared to be a chamber was a
gradual widening of the cavern towards a covered entrance. The posi-
tion of this entrance greatly surprised us, as hitherto we had believed
that we were gradually getting further into the limestone hill. The rise

in the field at this point, however, proved to be composed of a considerable

thickness of glacial deposits heaped up against a limestone cliff. As the

materials covering the bone-earth within and at the entrance were chiefly

sands and gravels, it was found necessary to suspend operations in that
direction and to ask the landlord (E. Morgan, Esq.) for permission to
open a shaft directly over this entrance from the field above. As this

necessitated the removal of a considerable surface of land and caused
some damage to the field the Committee feel that their special thanks are

due to Mr. Morgan for his kindness in so readily acceding to their appli-
cation. This shaft, as at first opened, was about nine feet across at the
surface and over five feet at the bottom. It was subsequently widened
at the bottom in consequence of some falls, and the lower part, excepting
at one point, had to be carefully faced with timber. The upper part is now
much widened and sloped. The shaft was about twenty feet in depth,
and the deposits as shown in fig. 1 were made out in it. These were care-
fully measured by Mr. C. E. De Ranee, F.G.S., Mr. Luxmoore, and the
writer during the prosecution of the work. Below the soil, for about
eight feet, a tolerable stiff boulder clay, containing many ice-sci'atched

there were about seven feet of gravel and sand, with here and there bands-
of red clay, having also many ice-scratched boulders. The next deposit
met with was a laminated brown clay, and under this was found the bone-
earth, a brown, sandy clay with small pebbles and with angular fragments

of bone, were also found at the same place, and at other points in the
shaft teeth of rhinoceros and a fragment of a mammoth's tooth. One
rhinoceros tooth was found at the extreme point examined, about six feet
beyond and directly in front of the entrance. It seems clear that the
contents of the cavern must have been washed out by marine action
during the great submergence in mid-glacial time, and that they were
afterwards covered by marine sands and by an upper-boulder clay, iden-

tical in character with that found at many points in the Vale of Clwyd

and in other places on the North Wales coast. Figs. 2 and 3 ex-
plain the order of the deposits as found within the cavern. Fig. 3

was taken at a distance of about sixteen feet from the entrance at the
shaft, and fig. 2 just within that entrance. The order in that por-
tion of the cavern examined this year accorded in the main with that
found during the previous researches, but within the entrance there was
a greater thickness of sand, less of the laminated clay, and more bone-
earth than in the other parts of the cavern. The bone-earth seems to
diminish in thickness rather rapidly outwards under the glacial deposits,
but it was found as far out as the excavations have been made. Here
the bone-earth rests directly on the limestone floor, with no local gravel

between, as in the cavern.

     It would be interesting to know how far the cave earth extends under
the glacial deposits, but this could only be ascertained by making a deep

cutting through the terrace of glacial deposits, which extends for a con-
siderable distance in a westerly direction. The glacial deposits here are
undoubtedly in an entirely undisturbed condition, and are full of smooth

and well-scratched boulders, many of them being of considerable size.
Among the boulders found are granites, gneiss, quartzites, flint, felsites,

diorites, volcanic ash, Silurian rocks, and limestone. Silurian rocks are

most abundant. It is clear that we have liere rocks from northern sources,
along with those from the Welsh hills, and the manner in which the lime-

stone at the entrance to the cavern in the shaft is smoothed from the
north would indicate that to be the main direction of the flow. The
marine sands and gravels which rest immediately on the bone-earth are
probably of the age of the Moel Tryfaen and other high-level sands, and

the overlying clay with large boulders and intercalated sands maybe con-
sidered of the age of the so-called upper-boulder clay of the area. The

latter must evidently have been deposited by coast-ice. Whether the

caverns were occupied in pre- or only in inter-glacial times it is difficult
to decide, but it is certain that they were frequented by pleistocene

.animals and by man before the characteristic glacial deposits of this area

were accumulated. The local gravel found in the caverns, underlying the
bone-earth, must have been washed in by streams at an earlier period,
probably before the excavation of the rocky floor of the valley to its
present depth. From the glacial period up to the present time excavation
has taken place only in the glacial deposits, which must have filled the
valley up to a level considerably above the entrances to the caverns. The
characteristic red boulder clay with erratic blocks from northern sources is
found in this area to a height of about 500 feet, and sands and gravels in
the mountains to the S.E. to an elevation of about 1,400 feet. The natural
conclusion therefore is that the caverns were occupied by an early pleisto-

cene fauna and by man anterior to the great submergence indicated by the

high-level marine sands, and therefore also before the deposition of the
so-called great upper-boulder clay of this area. As there is no evidence

against such a view it may even be legitimately assumed that the ossi-

ferous remains and the flint implements are of an earlier date than any

glacial deposits found in this area.

Ffynnon Beuno Cave.

This cavern, which yielded the greatest number of bones in the

previous researches, has now been cleared out in all those parts where

Athe deposits appeared to have been undisturbed by man.    considerable

addition to the number of bones and teeth has been made this year, but

DO new forms have to be added to those already mentioned.

Fourteenth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors J.

   Prestr'ich, W. Boyd Dawkins, T. McK. Hughes, and T. G-.
   BoNNEY, Dr. H. W. Crosskey (Secretary), and Messrs. C. E. De
   Range, H. G-. Fordham, J, E. Lee, D. Mackintosh, W. Pengelly,
   J. Plant, and R. H. Tiddeman, appointed for the purpose of

    recording the position, height above the sea, lithological cha-

   racters, size, and origin of the Erratic Blocks of England, Wales,
   and Ireland, reporting other matters of interest connected with
   the same, and taking measures for their preservation.

The attention of the Committee has been called by Professor Hughes
to boulders near Kendal and Settle, which are perched npon pedestals of
limestone, and are striated in the direction of the main iceflow of the

district, whereas the surface of the surrounding block bears no traces of

glaciation.

     These boulders appear to have been transported to their present
position, and placed npon the bare striated rock under exceptional local
conditions, and the pedestals appear to be portions of the surrounding
rock protected from denuding agents by the overlying boulder.

     The Committee hope to be able to secure the preservation of these

boulders.

     Mr. Plant reports a remarkable assemblage of blocks in the drift in
the valley of the Soar, near Leicester. Excavations to the depth of 30

feet have been made in various parts of the river valley, and after passing

through the alluvium the boulder clay has been reached. Thousands of
erratics have been found. Half of the erratics were from the Charnwood

district, and of the remainder a great many were from the Permian sand-
stones and Carboniferous rocks of the Ashby coalfield, with blocks of

--mountain limestone from Staunton, Harold, and Breedon a distance of

fifteen to eighteen miles north-west. The I'est are from the east side of
the Pennine chain, forty to fifty miles distant north-east.

    On a ridge near the Victoria Road, south of Leicester, upwards of 200

erratics have been uncovered. Millstone grit, mountain limestone, and

lower oolite blocks, more or less striated, were found mixed with Cham-
wood syenites. The height of the ridge is 260 feet above the sea, and

110 feet above the present valley of the Soar.
--224
                           EEPORT 1886.

In the drift at Clarendon Park, south-east of Leicester (310 feet)^

many hundreds of boulders have been exposed during recent excavations.

Some of the millstone grit blocks must have travelled forty or fifty miles.

Lumps of coal were also found which must have travelled seventeen

miles from the north-west.

    Dr. Crosskey and Mr. Fred W. Martin record a group of boulders found

on the road between Shiffnal and Tong. This group consists of a fine

collection of Lake rocks and Criffel granites. They evidently travelled

Atogether to their present position.     catalogue of these boulders will be

given in the next Report.

The Committee call especial attention to the grouping of the erratics

found in different districts, and also to the evidence presented that the

Chamwood district was the centre of local ice action.

On the Glacial Phenomena of the Midland District. By Dr. Ckosskey.

    The object of the paper is to indicate some of the problems raised by
the glacial phenomena of the Midland district, and point out tbe typical

sections by which they ai-e illustrated.
     It is necessary to avoid the confusion caused by the vague use of the

term ' boulder clay.' Seven or eight different beds have, in fact, been
designated by the term ' boulder clay ' ; and it has become absolutely
necessary to separate the deposits from each other and record their distinct

characteristics.

The first question is. What are the lowest deposits of glacial age in

the Midlands ? What is found at the base of the masses of clay, sand, and

gravel scattered over the district ? Is there any deposit of the age of the

lower boulder clay or Till of Scotland ? The lowest of the beds known in

the Midlands may be seen at California, near Harborne. It consists of a

thick clay filled with angular and striated erratics of Welsh origin, com-

pactly pressed together and intermixed with fragments of rocks from the

locality, and is about 480 feet above the sea. This boulder clay is fol-

lowed by a series of sands and gravels, which are covered by a consider-

able mass of tenacious ' india-rubber ' clay with erratics scattered

somewhat sparsely through it ; and this upper clay is capped by a second

series of sands and gravels, more or less intermixed with clay.

The lower boulder clay is more intensely glacial in character and more

analogous to the Scotch Till than any other yet described in the district.

Whatever its origin, it belongs to the period of extreme ice action. Of

another type of boulder clay an example may be seen at Wolverhampton.

AThis boulder clay contains a mixture of erratics.     large number of its

erratics are from the Lakes and some are fi'om Scotland, while flints from

the east also occur. In the ordinary Scotch Till, when the trend of the

valleys radiating from the central eminences is followed, the course over

which the erratics travelled can be traced. But the Wolverhampton

boulder clay marks the meeting-place of erratics from various quarters.

An example of a third series of beds, possibly belonging to the same age,

may be seen in a cutting at Soho, near Birmingham, where clays and

sands, containing erratics, are strongly contorted. While the material of

these beds is probably lower glacial, the contortions must have been sub-

sequent to its deposition, and indicate the work of another age. How

far this series of lower beds may be attributed to the action of land ice

or of floating ice is an open question.
                                                                ----

ON THE ERKATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 225

The second question is, Are there any Midland glacial beds referable

to the period of glacial subsidence ? Two series of deposits and of

--erratics also have to be taken into account those representing the period

of subsidence and those representing the period of re-elevation. During

the gradual subsidence of the ice-covered land, erratics would be floated

off as its various points became successively immersed, and deposits would

also be formed at the sea-bottom. These middle glacial clays, sands, and

gravels occur at various points. Fossils have been found near Welling-

ton, Shropshire, Astarte borealis being among them. In beds at Lilies-

hall, Salop (463 feet), three arctic species occur. The upper boulder

clay (worked for bricks through the district) contains erratics, which

appear cleai-ly to have fallen into it, and altogether differs from the lower

bed. It is a mass accumulated during subsidence.

    The third question is. What signs are there of ice action during the

re-elevation of the land ? During the process of re-elevation the marine

clays and sands would be washed and re-sorted by currents, and the sea

would be covered by icebergs floating away from our present mountains,

which would then be islands in a glacial sea. The Midlands now consti-

tute a table- land. This table-land would at this period be the shallow part

of the sea against which icebergs would be stranded. At Icknield Street,

Birmingham, the rock has been smashed and a large collection of Welsh

erratics flung against it. One of the most marked characteristics of this

period would be the distribution of fragments from the present highlands

of the Midlands. The present highlands of the Midlands would then be

low-lying islands, which would be covered with ice. By the breaking

away of the ice-foot around them blocks would be distributed over the

Bea-bottom in their immediate neighbourhoods. Rowley Hill blocks are

found eight or nine miles off. Boulders torn from Charnwood are abun-

dantly spread over many acres for many miles, and must have been carried

by local ice. Fragments from the Malvern Hills have been scattered

through the plains around.

Erratics from the mountains of Wales, the Lakes, and Scotland also

must have been brought by the icebergs travelling from those centres

as the mountains became higher and higher. The work done during

re-elevation must be distinguished from that done during subsidence.

The surface erratic blocks, so remarkably developed in the Midlands,

cannot be roughly explained away in connection with any one portion of

the epoch, and present complicated problems. Some erratics now upon

the surface may have been originally imbedded in clays and sands, which

have been washed away, and have really belonged to the ancient boulder

clay. Erratics were dropped by icebergs during the submergence of the

land when there was a succession of ever- varying island boundaries.

Erratics were also dropped during re-elevation when there was an ever-

increasing moui tainous area from which they could be derived.

     Facts have to be noted in connection with the following points :

   --(i.) The origin of the erratics. Some were derived from a distance

i.e., from W. Scotland, the Lakes, and Wales. Others were of local origin

and of local range, as from Charnwood, Rowley, and Malvern. Others
mark the pushing in of the debris derived from chalky boulder clay.

   --(ii.) The heights of erratics above the sea. Erratics are found in the

Midlands on heights extending from comparatively low levels to 900 feet.
They could not therefore have been deposited in their present positions

at one and the same time. They must indicate a succession of events.

 226 REPORT-- 1886.

       (iii.) The position of definiie groups of erratics in relation to each other.
 For example, around Birmingliam and Bromsgrove the erratics are
 chiefly "Welsh ; but a vast collectioB of Scotch and Lake erratics lies right
 across the path the Welsh erratics must have taken.

   --(iv.) The distribution of erratics in relation to the physical geography

of the district. On the table-land north of Wolverhampton, Lake and

Scotch rocks are intermixed, the Scotch being abundant. Journeying

westward the intermixture becomes more complete. The stream of
Welsh erratics crosses the northern stream ; then the Welsh erratics be-
come more and more abundant, only a few northern stragglers being
found, until at Clent and Bromsgrove not a single erratic of granite has
yet been found among thousands of Welsh origin.

   --Taking a line of country in another direction between Wolverhamp-
--ton and Stafford cretaceous and Jurassic debris appears. The same

debris may be noted pushing itself around Coventry.

   --(v.) The distribution of erratics in relation to the physical geography

of England and Wales. The various Midland glacial deposits cannot be
understood apart from a careful examination of their relation to the
various levels of the plains, highlands, and mountains of the whole of the

surrounding country.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. H. Bauerman, Mr.

   F. W. EuDLER, Mr. J. J. H. Teall, and Dr. Johnston-Lavis, for
   the Investigation of the Volcanic Phenomena of Vesuvius and
   its neighbourhood. Drawn tip by H. J. Johnston-Lavis, M.D.,

    F.G.S. (Secretary).

During the last twelve months Vesuvius has shown slight variation from
the state of activity which it has exhibited during the past few years.
Lava has from time to time found fresh openings around the higher parts
of the crreat cone, and has flowed from them one after another, so that
the intervals of time during which no fluid rock was issuing were very
short. This regularity of action was, however, broken on June 28, when,
a lower outlet being formed on the eastern side of the great cone, the
consequent depression of the lava level in the main chimney resulted in
the crumbling in of the cone of eruption, which before this date bad
attained very considerable dimensions. During the whole month of July
the ash-forming stage prevailed, so that the usual continuous vapour and
lava-cake ejections were replaced by intermittent puffs of ash and sand-
laden vapour and accompanied by the ejection of stones. The craterial
cavity, which is double or bifurcated, which has been excavated within

the cone of eruption, is of very considerable size, being about 60x80
metres in diameter. The lava that issued during July, on two occasions

entirely ci'ossed the Val d'Inferno, and following one of the wooded
glens or ravines on the property of the Prince of Ottajano destroyed
a considerable number of trees. These different changes will be made
apparent by the photographs taken by the reporter and exhibited at

the meeting.
     In a paper read before the Royal Society the writer has given compara-

tive curves of the activity of Vesuvius, the barometric pressure, and the

  rainfall, together with the phases of the moon, deduced from observations
 extending over two years. The method of registering the different
 degrees of activity ' is that described in the report of this Committee last
 j-ear. The results seem to indicate a distinct relationship between
  barometric pressure and the violence of the explosions, or, in other

  words, the ebullition of the lava. On the contrary, the rise and fall of

  lava level within the chimney in relation to tidal action set up within

 the magma is doubtful, though some coincidences are remarkable. The

  short time during which observations have been carried on, and the

 facility with which any true rise and fall of lava may be masked by other

  causes, necessitates the study of the subject for some years longer.
  Observations during the past fourteen months go to confirm the conclu-

  sions arrived at in the paper above mentioned.

      The fourth sheet of the geological map of Monte Somma and

 Vesuvius has been completed, and is exhibited at the meeting. Although

 -- --small a good portion being sea much patience and time were necessary,

 owing to the area being thickly inhabited and the ground broken up by
  numerous small gardens, &c., enclosed within high walls. The geology
 of the region mapped in this sheet is slightly more difficult to work out

  than that included in the third sheet (exhibited at the last meeting),

 and is much more intricate in detail. Sheet 5 is in considerable part

 mapped, and the reporter had hoped to have completed it for exhibition
 at the present meeting beside Sheet 4, but he was prevented by a
 number of family troubles, which forcibly diverted his attention during
 the spring and early summer. The reporter regrets to announce that
 the ' Giornale del Vesuvio,' containing a diary of all the observations
 made during the last four years, and which should have appeared eight
 months ago, is not yet published. This delay, however, is not the fault
 of the author. Proofs of nine of the illustrations in phototype are

 exhibited at the meeting.

      The present year is remarkable for the chances it afi'ords for
 studying the subterranean structure of the Campi Phlegrei and the
 volcanic region around Naples. The great main drain, which is to convey
 the sewage of Naples to the Gulf of Gaeta, will traverse the region west
 of Naples on a line running nearly east and west. Before, however,,
oonstructing this sewer a series of five borings have been made to test
 the ground to be cut through. Observations on the water level, tem-
 perature, and presence of volcanic gases were made. Although these
 borings in themselves have brought no remarkable fact to light, they
will, combined with the deep artesian well at Lago Fusaro, form
important documents for the study of the structure of such a complicated

region.

      Five other borings on or near the renowned Starza or foreshore of

Pozzuoli, on the works of Sir W. Armstrong, Mitchell, & Co., are in-

teresting as being within a few hundred yards of the celebrated so-called
Temple of Serapis. Details of these, two of which are on the beach and
the other three at varying distances out to sea, will be published together

with others being made. For the present, however, it may be said that

these borings fully confirm the opinions generally held as to the oscilla-
tions of the ground in this district.

228 REPOET-- 1886.

     The new Cumana Railway, which is to connect Naples with Baia and

Fusaro, in the first part of its course traverses a tunnel of about a mile
and a half long, which is cut in the body of the escarpment which consti-
tutes the rocky amphitheatre backing the west end of Naples. Until the
present, this was supposed to be composed of a moderately uniform mass

of pelagonatised basic marine tuff. Under the middle of the Corse-
Vitt. Emanuele and the Via Tasso the edge of a trachyte flow was
encountered and traversed for a distance of over 70 metres. The rock
the reporter has not yet examined microscopically, but it very much
resembles a simple non-quartziferous, and more probably a sodalite
trachyte. This line of railway will traverse a number of tunnels and
cuttings in the Campi Phlegrei, and will have to traverse the hot hill
which backs Baia, and will no doubt present various uncommon engi-
neering diflBculties, besides giving some useful information bearing on

terrestrial physics.

      Lastly, a deep well at present being bored at Ponticelli, on the out-
skirts of Naples towards Vesuvius, has already been carried to a depth
of over a hundred inetres, and during the latter half of this a series of
leucitic lava streams were traversed, showing the great distance to which

the old flows from Monte Somma reached, and also, that either great
depression of land has taken place, or that Monte Somma once formed a

volcanic island. As these different works progress they are and will be

kept under watch, and all that is interesting will be recorded.
      The reporter has partly prepared the first instalment of a study of

the ejected blocks of Monte Somma. He has left this subject dormant

 for two reasons : first, the want of further chemical apparatus for the

 execution of many analyses required ; and, secondly, it was considered

 necessary to visit the ancient volcanic region of the Fassathal, in the

 Tyrol, to study some points that could not be worked at in an area
 covered by thick deposits from recent volcanoes. The striking analogy
 between the products of volcanic action and the contact metamorphism
 in the Southern Tyrol and at Vesuvius is so remarkable that many
 interesting facts will come out of the study of these two regions in
 relation to each other. The reporter, having had the opportunity this
 summer of visiting the Tyrol, hopes this winter to be able to study the
 ejected blocks of Monte Somma, which, from the absence of serpentini-
 sation and other secondary changes, will throw much light on the origin
 and mutual relations of many varieties of igneous and metamorphic rocks
 and the genesis of numerous minerals.

      The reporter has treated during the past year various questions
 bearing on Vesuvius and its neighbourhood in papers before the Royal
 Societies of London and Dublin, the Royal Microscopical Society, the
 Geologists' Association, and the Accademia Oronzio Costa, besides various
 articles in ' Nature ' and other periodicals. The reporter's ' Monograph
 of the Earthquakes of Ischia,' after many vicissitudes, was published at
 the end of 1885.

Since the publication of the Third Report on Palaeozoic Phyllopoda

('Brit. Assoc. Report' for 1885) vee have examined many addi-

tional specimens in the Museums of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Uni-

versities, and in the Braidwood Museum belonging to Dr. J. R. S. Hunter,

of Braidwood, near Glasgow. Mr. James Thomson, F.G.S., has given

us a quantity of nodules, containing remains of Ceratiocaris, from the

Lesniahago district                                                                                       and other friends  have  lent us  several interesting
                                                                                                       ;

specimens.

We have also again critically examined the fossils enumerated, under

' Ceratiocaris,' in the ' Third Report,' and, having had numerous finished

drawings carefully made for illustration of a forthcoming monograph for

the Palseontographical Society, we have been able to compare them more

perfectly and with more precise results.

Thus we find that

     1. Ceratiocaris leptodactylus (M'Coy), see ' Third Rep.' pp. 11-14, as

known by its caudal appendages (Cambr. Mus. a/923, a/924, and a few

others), is distinct from G. Murchisoni, M'Coy, both as to size and

proportions. "We have traced two rows of pits (bases of prickles) on

«/924, as exposed. Some similar caudal appendages, M.P.G. \^, occur
in the Lower Wenlock rock of Helm Knot, Dent, Yorkshire.

2. G. Murchisoni (Agass.), founded on some specimens figured in

  Sil.  Syst.' and ' Siluria,'                                                                                but unfortunately lost (' Third Rep.'  p.  11,     &c.),

is represented by several analogous fossils, such as Oxford Mus. B and C                                                                                         ;

a fragment lying in the same slab with |f may belong to it. The cara-

paces formerly assigned to G. leptodactylus and C. Murchisoni (' Third

Rep.' pp. 12, 15) are now regarded as belonging to distinct species.

     3. The caudal appendages of G. Murchisoni have a slight curvature
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

there are others much like them, but straight, and associated with a

iarge ultimate segment, much broader than that in M.P.G. |f. (For

instance, Oxford Mus. F; M.P.G. Xi; Ludlow Mus. T.) One of these

(X ^) has been labelled C. gigas by Mr. Salter ; and therefore we adopt

that name.

4. The specimens from the Wenlock beds of Dudley and Kirkby

Lonsdale, described and figured in the ' Geol. Mag.', 1866, p. 204, pi. 10,

figs. 8 and 9, as belonging to C. MurcMsoni ('Third Rep.' p. 12), are

too thick and. strong for that, species, and the Dudley example (fig. 8)
Wehas difierent proportions.
                              propose to distinguish them as C. valida.

5.  Some abdominal  segments  (Oxford Mus.  E ; Ludlow  Mus.  L
                                                                          ;.

B.M. 39403; M.P.G. §f and |f ; 'Third Rep.' p. 20, &c.), narrow in

proportion to those in one other specimen marked f|, and referred to-

CC. MurcMsoni, and very much narrower and smaller than in gigas, we

separate as a new species, to be called C. attemiata. They have straight
styles and stylets, much shorter than in either of the foregoing.

    6. Two small specimens of crushed telsons (one in Mr. Cooking's

Xcollection, and the other M.P.G. ^L, both from the Ludlow series),

probably smaller than C. MurcMsoni, have a fluted or channelled sculp-

ture on their upper part, instead of either wrinkles or leaf-pattern ; hence-

they may be regarded as belonging to a distinct form, for which the

name canaliculata will be convenient.

    7. One fine large carapace (M.P.G. Xi) and others smaller and less

definite in some respects (M.P.G. X4-; X^; X^; Ludlow Mus. A;

KOxford Mus. & J), and associated with segments and appendages, we-

regard as distinctive of a new species, though hitherto referred to

C. leptodactylus (' Third Rep.' pp. 12, 15). The test appears to have

been of an unusually solid consistency.

These carapaces in some instances have been much modified by

pressure, but we trace a close similarity throughout the series, allowing

for probable differences of age. The shape approximates to that of

Dr. James Hall's species G. acuminata and F. Schmidt's G. Noetlingi

('Third Rep.' p. 30). There are marked differences, however, and we

intend to designate this form G. Halliana, in honour of our old friend^

who began working at these Phyllocarida as early as 1852.

   A perfect specimen of G. acuminata, Hall, has been lately described

and figured by Dr. Julius Pohlman in the ' Bulletin of the Buffalo

Society of Natural Sciences,' vol. v. No. 1, 1886, pp. 28, 29, pi. 3, fig. 2.

Its caudal appendages are much like those of G. papilio and G. siygia, the

style being relatively short, and the stylets broad and blade-like. The

Xappendages in M.P.G. X^^, ^, and Ludlow Mus. A are different from

these, being thinner, tapering slowly, and pitted in at least one row, as

exposed.

    8. G. Pardoeana, La Touche. Two carapaces with segments and
parts of appendages from Ludlow (Ludlow Mus. B and D ; ' Third

Rep.' p. 12) diff'er from any other form. One of them (B), with a
wrong caudal appendage attached to it, in the Ludlow Museum, has been

labelled ' G. Pardoensis,' and as such is referred to in J. D. La Tonche's-

We' Guidebook to the Geology of Shropshire.'  retain tliis name

(altering the termination, as it refers to a person, and not a place) for the

two carapaces here referred to. One of them (B) is of special interest

as having its rostrum still in place.

    9. The fine large specimen of G. ludensis, H. W. (' Third Report,'
p. 16), has been again carefully studied, and we find reason to believe

that the caudal appendage which appears longest in the fossil was not
ON THE FOSSIL PHYLLOPODA OF THK PALEOZOIC EOCKS. 231

really the longest, or the true telson, but was one of the ' laterals ' or

ptylets. Hence the whole animal was probably much longer than our

former estimate made it.

     10. C. robusta, Salter (' Third Report,' p. 24), being based merely on

some small caudal appendages (Cambridge Museum a/925 and a/926)

Wewithout carapaces, is troublesome and unsatisfactory to deal with.

find some equivalent styles and broad blade-like stylets, like long scalene

triangles, in G.                                    papilio,   stygia,  acuminata, &c.                                                                      but  none  of these                             seem
                                                                                                                                                         ;

small enough for the several little sets of trifid appendages, more or less

Cperfect, which we have met with.                                            robusta takes in some of these but                                                                                             ;

Oxford Mas. T is relatively broad, and might be termed lata; B.M.

58878, from                                         Muirkirk,  has very narrow members                                                                      {anyusta)                                       and one set
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

in the Owens College is so neat, symmetrical, and small that it might be

called minuta.

11. The specimens Ludlow Mns. S. and M.P.G. X-ji^^ jjave each a

long style and a strong stylet attached to a broken ultimate segment,

and were regarded as var. longa in the ' Third Report,' p. 25. Although

not showing the lattice-pattern so often seen on the segments of G. papUio

and G. stygia, they may well belong to one of those species, and the or-
nament may have flaked off from the ultimate segment. The study of

C. papilio and stygia (' Third Report,' pp. 16-20) we have not yet ex-

hausted by any means. We know, however, that the abdominal segments

were delicately sculptured with leaf-like or lattice-pattern ornament, the

points of the triangles pointing upwards, or rather backwards, towards

the carapace, and one limb of the triangle, where free, running downwards

and outwards in the other direction. These oblique lines are often visible

when the triangles have disappeared from wear or decomposition. Among

Amany others the segments M.P.G. X^Li; B.M. 41900: Oxford Mus.
Hand exhibit fine examples of this leaf-like ornament ; and it is visible in

several more complete individuals in those collections. In the Braidwood

and Glasgow Museums numerous specimens show it well. See also

'Third Report,' p. 31.

   A12. small and very delicate specimen, B.M. 59648, has a thin sub-

ovate carapace, with excessively fine parallel longitudinal stri®, and shows

14 or 15 segments, some within and five outside the carapace, ending with

a neat trifid set of appendages. This differs from any other form

we know                                             and probably some small  loose bodies,                                                                  of   numerous segments,
                                                 ;

occurring in the Lesmahago shales (' Third Report,' p. 20) may be of the
same species. Its looseness of structure would suggest the name laxa.

     13. Of G. Salteriana, noticed as a new species in the ' Third Report,*
p. 23, we have not yet seen any additional specimens.

    14. The specimens which we referred to in the ' Third Report,' pp. 23
and 24, as C. cassia, Salter, are separable into two forms. G. cassia proper

is recognised on an interesting slab, of which one counterpart is in the

Ludlow Museum (E and F) and the other in the Museum of Practical

Geology ac Jerniyn Street, London (X|). The other somewhat similar,

but larger and otherwise different, specimens are not unlike in the

characters of the carapace, but they have more abdominal segments
--exposed and proportionally longer caudal appendages M.P.G. X^^J

be conveniently named G. cassioides.

     In all the specimens of both kinds the carapace has been apparently
thin and tough, so as to allow of their being crumpled very much. This
                                                                                                                                                                         ;

condition and the presence of harder parts of their internal organs beneaj;h

give rise to various tubercular irregularities of the surface, in some cases
simulating ocular tubercules. There are, however, no real eye- spots.

There may have been irregularities of the surface, due to the attachment

of the muscles of the jaws within the body.

    15. An ovate carapace, represented by a mere film, and five abdominal

segments, with a neat trifid tail, all flattened but very distinct, have no

close ally among the known forms. The segments are delicately striate,

--with oblique lines on each side, suggesting the name compta, which we

propose for this specimen Ludlow Museum, B.
     To G. inornata, M'Coy (' Third Report,' pp. 20, 21), we have nothing

to add, except that some large specimens (so named, Cambridge Mus.,
b/35) have a greater proportional depth (height) at the ventral border
than smaller individuals, and yet have the same general outline and pos-
terior slope, as well as the longitudinal lineate ornament. The presence

of this sculpturing is not in accordance with the trivial name. These

large specimens may belong to G. shjgia.
    In the Cambridge Museum is a specimen {hj'iQ) of two abdominal

segments, with a style and a stylet in good preservation, being convex and
not injured by pressure. The penultimate segment is smooth, but shows

faint traces of oblique lines ; the ultimate is quite smooth and cylindrical

the telson (style) is attached by an apparently rounded joint ; and the

two uropods much resemble some of those referred to G. robusta. This

specimen is from Benson Knot,                                                                  and is labelled  G.  inornata                                   but  the  evi-
                                                                                                                                                            ;

dence of its specific relationship is supported only by its having been

found in the same rock, and by its size suiting the large form of G. inor-

nata ? (b 135). It belongs possibly to G. stygia.

   17. From the list for G. inornata., given in the ' Third Report,* we

have to remove one of the specimens found at Benson Knot, and marked

' 44342                              in  the  British                          Museum,         being decidedly different in outline
                                  '

(more ovate), though similarly marked with longitudinal striae. It might

well be named C. Buthvenia^ia, in memory of the old geological collector

who laboured for very many years in the Kendal district for Professor

Sedgwick and others.

    18. G. oretonensis and truncata, H.W. ('Third Report,' pp. 21, 22),

though near to G. inornata in shape, hold their distinct places as species.

     19. Of 0. solenoides and C. gohiiformis (' Third Report,' p. 22) there
is nothing new to be stated.

   20. As intimated in the ' Third Report,' pp. 27, 28, the presence of

the ocular tubercle has an important signification, showing that the

animal must have had an organ equivalent to the eye sufficiently de-

veloped to affect the external covering, whether it was adapted for clear

vision or not. It may be a family distinction; at all events, the oculate

carapaces have to be removed from Geratiocaris, and we propose that

M'Coy's G. elliptica be referred to a new genus under the name

Fjmmelezoe}

     JE. elliptica, M'Coy, is described in the ' Third Report,' p. 27, as
represented by the type, Cambridge Mus. h/15 ; but Ludlow Mus. G., and

XM.P.G. -^ and §f differ from it considerably. The first of these is

shorter and broader (higher), nearly semicircular in outline, with an acute

any of the foregoing, somewhat boat- shaped, between the last and elliptica

in shape, but not identical with either ; and it is rather coarsely striate
longitudinally. To this form we propose to give the name E. Mac-

coyiana, in honour of the first describer of any member of this genus.

    21. At page 26 of the ' Third Report,' we described Salter's Geratio-
caris ? ensis, and now we are still more confirmed in the opinion that it

belonged to a distinct genus. Its large size, its curvature, and the

serration on both the upper and the lower edge, and the profuse spination

(as shown by pits) on the latter distinguish it from other telsons ; and
more particularly its lozenge-shaped sectional area, of an unequal rhombic

form, blunter at the outer (upper) and convex edge than on the other, the

ridge along the sides not being quite on the medial line, but neai'er the

Weouter than the inner edge.           propose the name Xiphocaris ' for this

rare genus.

M. Barrande's Ceratiocaris primula ('Third Report,' p. 32^ has a style

(or stylet ?) with lozenge- or diamond-shaped section ; but this uropod,
though curved, is of different dimensions, and is pitted all over.

    22. Physocaris vesica, Salter (' Third Report,' p. 28), we consider as

having had its abdominal segments shifted from below upwards, and

turned  over  on  their  axis,  after  death                             and  therefore  as  having been
                                                                      ;

23. Of G. ? lata, insperata, and perornata we have no further evidence

at present.

      24 Ceratiocaris ? longicauda, D. Sharpe (' Third Report,' p. 29), a
foreign (Portuguese) form within our reach, has been studied in the

Geological Society's Museum, Burlington House, and shows some inter-

esting features. Its scientific name was given under the supposition that

the fossil was a Dithyrocaris, with a longer abdomen than usual ; but its
cylindrical ultimate segment, its somewhat bayonet- shaped style, and

blade-like stylets clearly remove it from that genus, as intimated in our

former notice. It is probably distinct also from Ceratiocaris ; it has some

analogy with the Devonian Elymocaris ; but at present we cannot fix its

generic place.

     25. In the ' Sitzungsb. K. bohm. Gea. Wiss.' 1885, M. Ottamar
Novak, Keeper of the Barrande Collection at Prague, has described a
new Phyllocaridal genus from the etage F, f 2, in Bohemia, as Ptycho-

caris, with two species Ft. simplex and Pt. parvula, characterised by a

strong and obliquely longitudinal ridge or sharp fold on each valve, and

by an anterior group of three small nodules, an ocular tubercle behind

them, and some larger but less distinct swellings further back, but still
in the antero-dorsal region. M. Novak supplies also a Table of the

vertical distribution of the Phyllocarida in Bohemia.

     In the Annales XIII. Soc. Geol. du Nord, 3^6 Livr. April 1886, p.
146, M. E. Canu gives a resume of the results of M. O. Novak's re-

:searches in the Phyllocarida, with some woodcuts of Aristozoe regina,

Bactropus hngipes, and Ceratiocaris dehilis (see ' Third Report,' pp.
S2-34), and of Pfyclwcaris simplex (see above).

sion in Ontario County and New Toik, where the Phyllopods which he

previously described (see ' Second Report,' 1884, pp. 80-86, and ' Third
Report,' p. 3) have occurred with or without Goniatites.

Tour Committee have not been able to include in the present report

information which would be of considerable value in drawing up a final
report on the result of their thirteen years' labour. They therefore
consider they will best carry out the instructions given them in 1874 by

continuing their investigations for at least a year.
     It had been hoped by the Committee that the details of the sections

passed through, and the character and quantity of several important

wells and borings now in progress in the Midland counties, might have

--been laid before this meeting, but they are still incomplete.
     Northamptonshire. At Kingsthorpe, 2\ miles north-east of North-
ampton, a trial for coal was made in 1830, against the advice of Dr.-
William Smith, F.R.S., and Mr. Richai-dson, of the British Museum.
This shaft was described by Dr. Buckland, and later by the late Mr. S.
Sharp (' Geol. Mag.,' vol. viii.). It passed through 120 feet of Oolites,.
760 feet of Lias, and 60 feet of sandstone, 12 feet of marls, and 1 5 feet of

conglomerates, referred at the time by Dr. Smith to the New Red series.

The Middle Lias (or marlstone) appears to have produced 36,000 gallons

per hour at a depth of 210 feet from the surface, and the New Red a like

quantity of brackish water from a depth of 880 feet. The work was

stopped at 967 feet, after costing 30,000Z.

     In 1846 the London and North-Western Railway bored for water iu'
Northampton, and, on reaching 650 feet, tapped a salt-water spring, con--
taining chloride of sodium, carbonate of soda, sulphates of magnesia and
lime, the spring occurring in a 4-feet bed of magnesian limestone, lying,

under 50 feet of variegated sandstone and marls.

     In 1879 a boring was made by the water company at Kettering Eoad,

one mile north-east of Northampton, to a depth of 851 feet. In this-
boring the Lias rested on an eroded surface of crystalline conglomerates
and sandstone, 67^ feet in thickness, which are somewhat doubtful in
age, no fossils having been discovered, but overlie 45 feet of carboniferous
dolomitic limestone with fossils, which is believed to have yielded the
200,000 gallons of saline water met with in this boring, containing 1,200'
grains of mineral salts per gallon.

     The second trial of the Northampton Waterworks Company was
at Gayton, two miles north-west of Blisworth Station, and five south-
west of Northampton. The details are given by Mr. H. J. Eunson
 (Range of the Palseozoic Rocks beneath Northampton, ' Q. J. G. S.,.''
236                         EEPOBT 1886.

vol. xl. part III. p. 485). The Lias, White Lias, and Rhsetic continued
to 617 feet from the surface, the latter resting on a slightly eroded series
of marl, followed bj variegated sandstone 60 feet in thickness, which are
referred to the Trias. At 676^ feet occurred carboniferous sandstone
with fossils, which, with the underlying marls and limestones are regarded

as a local littoral deposit, lying on the true carboniferous limestone
occurring at 699 feet. The beds beneath are very remarkable, but do
not affect the present inquiry. The total depth reached was 994 feet.

As in the other boring, the water was saline, containing 1,500 grains of

mineral salts to the gallon, the quantity being only 100,000 gallons per

day. The water stood 20 feet higher than at Kettering Road, giving a

gradient (I") of 3J feet per mile to the north-east.
      In the boring lately carried out for Mr. J. Fleming (of Newcastle-on-

Tyne), at Orton, five miles west of Kettering, and twelve miles to the
N.E. of Northampton, the Triassic beds were absent, and the beds of
doubtful age were 24 feet, the underlying carboniferous beds were absent,
and a quartz-felzite 74 feet thick still persisted when the boring was
abandoned at 789 feet.

     These are readily seen in the sketch map of area under the Act with

five large districts, each having the smaller pound-boundaries marked in

different colours.

     It was soon found that Bilston and Tipton were so far one that when
Tipton was pumped Bilston water flowed down and nearly swamped
Tipton, so that some of the largest pumps in the kingdom have been put
down on the lower side of the boundary between those districts, and the
most difficult operation in mining successfully carried out, of driving under

the Bilston water and tapping it.
     To each pumping station the water flows, but the district which it

will drain depends on the ' faults' and workings.

    A few examples may be of interest, especially as compared with the

behaviour of the water in the more homogeneous strata under the inves-

tigation of the Committee, and will be given in the next report.

                               Bij Mr. E. B. Marten.

     Although the records are, I believe, closed, I send you particulars of

four springs yielding extremely good water and sufficient for supplying
the village of Pedmore, just upon the borders of tbe great western
boundary fault of the coalfield as it passes away south under the Clent

Hills and Hagley.

    Wychbury Camp Hill, like Clent, Walton, Woodbury, and other hills

of Permian formation, is capped by the Breccia described by Professor
Jukes which receives the rainfall and holds it like a sponge on the some-
what denser rock below, springs showing themselves all around 500 feet
above sea-level at the base of the Breccia at Pedmore and Hagley, and

forming the heads of rivulets.

     Within the last few weeks the water has been analysed by Dr. Bostock

--Hill and found to be very good as follows : Parts per 100,000 : total

solid  impurity,               20'0 ; organic  ammonia,     0-002                         free  ammonia,  0001
                                                                                       ;

                            ;

hardness, 15'00.

    On the west side of the fault the New Red sandstones abut against

the Permian, and being far more porous                                                    ^

the rainfall sinks away, so that at Hagley

the few wells are 70 feet deep, and at

Pedmore there are no deep wells, and the

few that are shallow easily get contami- Si'ourhridae

the New Red sandstone is about 250 feet

above the sea, the river Stour being the

lowest outlet about one mile below the

Wollaston Pumping Station, described by

me on page 7, 1882 (Eighth Report), is

about 200 feet above sea-level.

      In excavating for a small reservoir,
about three years ago, one side slipped
in, the whole coming off like half a peg-
top, point downwards, leaving a smooth,
polished, ' slickenside ' surface, so that

we were evidently exactly on the great

western boundary fault.

Second Re'port of the Committee, consisting of Mr. W. T Blanford,
      Professor J. W. Judd, and Messrs. W. Carruthers, H. Wood-

       ward, and^. S. G-ardner (Secretaoy), appointed for the purpose
      of reporting on the Fossil Plants of the Tertiary and Secondary

      Beds of the United Kingdom.

                              [Plate VII.]

Our attention has been devoted exclusively this year to the fossil flower-

ing or phanerogamoas plants.

The results of our researches point to the conclusion that while that

section known as Gymnospermous, to which the Conifers belong, is of

the highest antiquity, being almost coeval with the first definite remains

of plants in the PaljBozoic age, there are no Angiospermous plants in

British rocks of greater antiquity than the Secondary period, if we except
the problematic plant known as Spirangium. Even down to so late as

the Lias we have been unable to ascertain that any indisputable Angio-

sperm has been discovered within our area, for we are led to the conclu-

sion that the supposed Monocotyledons from the Rha3tics, near Bristol,

hitherto referred to the family of Pond-weeds under the name Najadita,

are really cryptogamic plants of the moss tribe, closely allied to the river

   moss Fontinalis.  This group had not previously been found fossil, and, so

.

far as it goes, would indicate rather a temperate climate. It is important

to notice that these conclusions are shared by such high authorities on

fossil plants as Prof. Williamson, Mr. Carruthers, and all botanists who

have examined them, as well as by Mr. Brodie, the possessor of the spe-

cimens. The Lilia, Bensonia, and other supposed Monocotyledons of

similar age are very imperfectly preserved, and doubtless referable to

Cycads, a family which then abounded.

"We have examined a large number of specimens of the anomalous

Jurassic plant described by Carruthers as Williamsoma. It is well known

that Prof. Williamson, in whose possession or charge a number of the

finest specimens remain, has devoted a considerable amount of attention

to them, without, however, feeling justified in coming to any very definite

conclusion as to their true position in the vegetable world. De Saporta,

on the other hand, has found more perfectly preserved specimens in

France, and has no hesitation whatever in referring them to the group of
Pandanacece. Though there are still many difficulties in the way, our

own examination of the specimens in London, Manchester, Cambridge,

and elsewhere tends to confirm Saporta's view so far as that there

do appear to be vestiges, in some cases at least, of lignitic structure

which may represent the areolse or carpels. These rather minute cavities

and the lignitic matter surrounding them fall away on exposure to the

air, and only traces of them are visible. Should Saporta's contention

be upheld, Williamsonia will be by far the most perfectly known of the

secondary Angiosperms, since all the organs of fructification and even of

foliation are more or less known.

    A still more definite Monocotyledon is the Podocarya, from the Inferior

Oolite, originally figured by Buckland, and redescribed by Carruthers.

Its resemblance to the fruit of Williamsonia, as interpreted by Sapoi'ta,

is extremely striking, and on suggesting this to that author, he replied

that he was in the act of preparing an important work on the very subject.

The same work is to include an illustration of the most recent member of

the group, obtained from the Grey Chalk of Dover, and which we thought

advisable to communicate to him.

Next in point of age, among English Monocotyledons, to the Podo-

carya is the Kaidacarpxmi, from the Great Oolite, also described by Car-

Weruthers, and by him referred to the Pandanece.  have been able to

ascertain that a second species, hitherto supposed to be of Cretaceous age

Afrom the Potton Sands, is a derived fossil, and undoubtedly Jurassic.

third species was originally figured, without any reference in the letter-

press as to its age or locality, by Lindley and Hutton as Strohilites Buck-

landi, in their ' Fossil Flora,' vol. ii. pi. 129, published between 1833-35,

from a drawing made by Miss E. Bennett for Dr. Buckland. In the

first edition of Morris's ' Catalogue,' 1843, it is set down as from ' Gr. S.
Wilts,' which cannot mean either Lower or Upper Greensand, the abbre-

viations for which are * L. G. S.' and ' U. G. S.,' but which certainly

looks like a misprint for ' Gr. O.,' the sign for Grea.t Oolite. In the second

edition of Morris, 18-54, the locality is corrected to ' U. G. S. Wiltshire,'

but it appears likely that the correction may have been made without

ascertaining the facts de novo, for the only entry occurring in Miss Ben-

nett's 'Catalogue of the Organic Remains of Wiltshire,' published in
ON THE FOSSIL PLAKTS OF THE TERTIARY AND SECONDARY BEDS. 243

1831, that could possibly refer to this fossil, is a ' Cycadeoidea ? ' from

Athe Portland Beds, which occurs under the heading ' Woods ' on p. 9.

of fossil plants, where it seemed probable the specimen might be found,

Wehas been unsuccessful, and its present whereabouts is still unknown.

think it, however, far more likely to prove a Jurassic than a Cretaceous

fossil if found, and the genus should not be included in lists of plants of

the latter age.

     The oldest Monocotyledons thus appear to be referable to the Panda-

neae, a group of plants distributed in widely distant and remote oceanic

islands, and whose fruits are still met with at sea in drifts of vegetable

matter.

     Next to these in antiquity are two very monocotyledonous-looking

fragments from the Jurassic of Torkshire, which have been fully described

in the ' Geological Magazine ' for May and August. The one is apparently

an unopened palm-like spathe, and the other a jointed cane-like stem.

Mr. Brodie possesses an undoubtedly monocotyledonous leaf fragment

from the Purbeck of Swindon.

     The Aro'idece have long been supposed to be a group of very high

antiquity, but there are good reasons for believing that the supposed

remains of aroideous plants from beneath the Tertiaries are, without

exception, referable to other groups, and actually there are no known

traces of them earlier than the Middle Eocene, when they become by no

means uncommon.

     In a similar manner the fruits once supposed to represent palms in the

Palaeozoic and Mesozoic rocks have been gradually removed or suppressed,

and, unless the fragments of palm-like wood in the gault at Folkestone are

taken into account, there are no traces of palms in any of our Secondary

strata. They, however, appear as low down in our Eocene as the
Woolwich series.

    We are not yet able to speak with certainty regarding the supposed

liliaceous or Dracce7ia-\ike stems from the Wealden, so frequently men-
tioned by Mantell, and now in the British Museum, since they have not

yet  been  thoroughly examined                                                                                                    but  it  is  very  probable  that  they  are
                                                                                                                               ;

liliaceous, and, if so, of the highest interest. The Wealden has so far

yielded no other trace of any more highly organised plants than ferns
and Gymnosperms, and this, when we remember that Monocotyledons

were undoubtedly in existence, is a fact that should be of great signifi-

cance to speculative geologists. The sediments must represent the deposits

of tlie drainage system of a large area, for they are of vast extent and

thickness, varied in character, and abounding in remains of trunks and

stems, fruits and foliage of plants. In them, therefore, if anywhere, we

might reasonably expect to find at least the traces of reed and rush, but
the swamps seem to have been tenanted only by Equisetum and ferns,
and the forests mainly by Cycads and Conifers.

     The same absence of Angiosperms, so far as British rocks are concerned,

is continuous throughout the Neocomian and Gault, and it is only in the
White Chalk that we meet with any indications of them, and these only

take the form of a more than suspicious impression of a net- veined leaf,

in the Jermyn Street Maseum, and of some structureless bodies which
were apparently some kind of fruit.

    When, however, we turn to the gymnospermous section of Phanero-
gams the records are very different. To refer here to the earlier Secondary

                                                                                                                                                                     e2

Coniferfe and Cycadece would be quite beyond our province, and it is only
those of the Cretaceous, as the last discoverable ancestors in our area of
the Eocene flora, that are of immediate interest. These belong, excluding-
Cycads, chiefly to the newest section of the Coniferfe, the Pine family.
"We are able to make the following contribution to our knowledge of

these :

     Pinites Andrcei, Coemans. ' Flore fossile du Terrain Cretace du

Hainault,' 1866, p. 13, pi. v. fig. 1. Gault, Folkestone, fig. 1.

     This specimen measures 5 centimetres in length and nearly 3c. in
breadth, though something should be perhaps deducted for the compres-

sion undergone. When perfect it was probably composed of 50 to 60

imbricated leathery scales, about half that number being visible on the
exposed face. The substance of the scale seems to have been consider-
able, though the edges are thin ; they are smooth even without striae, and
with the upper margin round to obtusely pointed. They are apparently

variable in size.

     The cone is of the same general type as P. Andrcei, Coem., from the
Gault of La Louviere, Hainault, though somewhat shorter, more oval,
and with thinner and rounder scales. The form and general consistence
of the scales, as well as their size, the number composing each whorl,,
and their disposition are, however, so similar that we think it better, in

the case of so imperfect a specimen, to unite it rather than claim specific
rank on account of distinctions that might largely disappear with more
perfect specimens. If the assimilation is correct the apex of the cone, as

well as the base, would have been somewhat pointed. The cones are
very abundant at La Louviere, more than 100 specimens having been
collected ; and they are stated to have been frequently curved and highly
resinous. The specimen from Folkestone was found by us, being Tiniqu&
from that locality, and is now in the British Museum.

     Pinites Valdensis, sp. nov. figs. 4 and 5. Wealden, Brook Point, Isle
of Wight.

     This fragment shows the presence in the Wealden flora of a Pine of the
section Strobus with a cone composed of scales as numerous and thin as
in any recent species. The cone was long, cylindrical, and tapering, the-
scales very numerous, permanent, imbricated, leathery, pointed, and
lightly thickened at the apex, with entire margin, striated, and slightly
keeled. It somewhat resembles P. Dunkeri, Carr., also of the Wealden,.
but is probably a distinct species. The specimen, fig. 5, is from the
Tork Museum, and 4, in which all the scales are mutilated, from the
Woodwardian Museum. Both these, with several others, are frona the
Wealden of Brook, so that it appears to be by no means rare there. It
is associated with Cycadostrohus elegans, Carr., ^ a representation of which
is given for comparison in fig. 8.

     Pinites CaiTuthersi, sp. nov. Fig. 6. Wealden, Brook Point, Isle of

Wight.
     The fi-agment figured represents another long cylindrical cone with

very numerous persistent leathery imbricated scales. It tapers like the

one last described towards the base, the scales being much thicker, though

thin at the edge, smooth, without keel, and with entire rounded margins.
It resembles the Gault species P. Andrcei in texture, but there were at

least twice as many scales in each whorl, and these are much more

imbricated. It also is quite distinct from P. Dunheri, Carr.

      It resembles Cedrus Lennieri, ' Sap. Veg. foss. de la Craie inferieure des

Environs du Havre,' Mem. de la Soc. Oeol. de Normandie, 1877, but is not
apparently tbe same species.

     Pinites cylindroides, sp. nov. Lower Greensand, Potton. Figs. 2 and 2a.
     This is an almost perfectly cylindrical specimen, being veiy sligbtly

thickened towards the base, 7 centimetres in length and 22 millim. in diame-
ter, composed of about 96 scales, arranged in 12 rows from left to right, and
8 rows from right to left, the arrangement thus being -j^. The scales are
short and at right angles to the axis, with a smooth flat half-moon-shaped

apophysis or scale-head, now gaping, but evidently imbricated before the
seeds were shed. The scales become very small towards the base. The
summit is abraded, exposing the end of a somewhat slender axis, fig. 2a.

Certain grooved lines on the sandy matrix between the scales show that
the cone was furnished with foliaceous bracts, and the marks of a boring
insect are visible. The specimen, which is quite distinct from any other
fossil or recent cone, is singularly elongated and cylindrical, scarcely
tapering at all from the base upward. It is fortunately in excellent con-
dition, certainly not derived from any older bed, like so many of the
Potton fossils, and is well cared for in the Woodwardian Museum.

     Pinites Pottoniensis, sp. nov. Pig. 3. Lower Greensand, Potton.
     The fragment figured, though much mutilated, fortunately shows the
characteristically winged seeds of Pitius in the most perfect manner,
entirely removing any lingering doubt as to the occurrence of represen-
tatives of true Pinus as low down as the Neocomian. The scales were set
at an acute angle with slightly thickened recurved apophyses, the form of
which cannot clearly be made out, though they appear to have been
narrow, keeled, and mucronate. It nearly resembles a type very common
in the Eocene, and is of great interest in many ways. It also is in the
Woodwardian Museum, and was obtained from the same formation.
     The specimen, fig. 7, evidently represents a third species from the
Wealden of Brook, with scales very closely resembling a common Barton
and Bracklesham type, but its fragmentary condition scarcely renders it
advisable to attach any specific name to it.
     The accompanying list comprises all the British Cretaceous Coniferae
previously known, up to the present date, though there ig no doubt that

many new and undescribed forms must exist in collections.

other hand the fruits of an Ahius, like that from Swale Cliff, abound.

There is no large variety among the leaves, the majority being large

and simple, but with highly serrate margins, and the species will not be

found to exceed 12 or 14 in number, including Plataniis, which is rare.

Though we have continued to collect the Reading, we have been unable

80 far to determine any new species. The assemblage of fmits at Sheppey

on the other hand becomes of increasing interest, and has proved unex-

pectedly rich in Palms, many of them apparently identical with existing

species which are now found growing in the remotest regions.

Besides the large variety of Nipas, which are still met with in enor-

mons abundance among the seed-vessels of the New Guinea drift, we have

seeds indistinguishable from Verschaffeltia splendida, endemic to the

Seychelles, from Sahal Blackhurniana of the Bermudas, from a Desmoncus,

an Areca, a Monodora, and probably of many, certainly of some other

Palms. When we consider that probably many of the kinds of Palm

fruits would sink at once, we realise how great an assemblage of this

magnificent family is indicated by the Sheppey drift.

The difiiculties we fear of determining anything but a fraction of the

Sheppey fruits must prove insurmountable. Their outer coats are for the

most part destroyed, and some part of their inner structure, nearly always

quite different in form from that which is external, is revealed. Botanists

have been able to determine but few of the drifted fruits brought home

by the Challenger, though these are more perfect and of living species be-

longing to definite and known floras.

The Bournemouth cliffs continue to furnish fresh forms, though the

Weleaf-beds are becoming more and more difficult of access.       have

especially enriched the series of Smilacece, and a complete account of them

has been presented to the Linnean Society. The series now obtained falls

little short of a hundred specimens, and is by far the richest of fossil

Smilaceae, perhaps of any family, ever brought together. Such a material

has enabled us to reduce the number of distinct species to no more than

five, most of which are represented by foliage in all stages of development,

from the largest leaves measuring several inches, down to quite minute

leaves from near the extreme growing points. The necessity for such ex-

tensive series when dealing with fossil leaves may not at once be apparent,

but the President of the Linnean Society expressed the opinion at the

meeting that out of less material not five but five-and-twenty species

might have been made.

The leaves of Smilacete are highly characteristic, and can be de-

termined with a large degree of certainty ; but it is quite improbable that

such will be the case with very many of the families of Dicotyledons.

There is indeed little hope that more than a very few can be determined with

anything like the precision required for botanical purposes, unless we can

call in aid the fruits or some other organs. Thus if we may base a con-

clusion upon the large number of the characteristic bracts, which envelope

the seed in a section of Flemingia that are met with in the Bournemouth

flora, the leaves of that genus should be far from -uncommon, and they

should also be found in the Swiss Oligocene, yet no species of Flemingia

has ever been recorded from the Tertiaries. The leaves, however, may

perhaps be sought for among the species oi Poptdus and Carpinus.

Fortunately fruits and even flowers are comparatively abundant at

Bournemouth, and we consequently anticipate little difficulty in determin-

ing leaves belonging to such easily distinguishable fruits as Alnus, Tilia,

Acer, Carpinus, the Leguminosce, and many otliers, bat the residnam with

are thus brought to the question, whether any value beyond that of mere

landmarks, or aids to the correlation of rocks, can be attached to the de-

terminations of fossil dicotyledonous leaves arrived at when fruits are absent.
Nearly every Tertiary and even many Cretaceous floras are said to comprise
Quercus, Fagus, and Corylus, to select these as typical examples. Now,
we very much doubt whether the fruits of these genera have been met
with in any strata older than the Upper Miocene, we might almost say
the Pliocene ; whilst in the latter the fruits of at least two of them are
very far from uncommon. Fossil hazel-nuts are well known to abound in
forest beds such as the one at Brook, in the Isle of Wight, and at Carrick-
fergus. It does appear to us that it would have been wiser and more

consistent, when arriving at these determinations, to have taken the
absence of fruits into account, when these were such as would naturally

have been preserved. The large proportion of fossil dicotyledonous
leaves that have been referred without any hesitation to living genera

must strike everyone, in comparison with the relatively few associated

--fruits that have been determined otherwise than as Carpolithes a name

which is a confession of failure. It will thus be seen that in our opinion

the fossil Dicotyledons of our own Eocene must be dealt with in a

manner difierent from that pursued by the majority of foreign writers on

kindred subjects, and that a revision of much of their work is urgently

needed.

     To resume our immediate subject, we have nothing new to record of
the Bracklesham flora except that Mr. Elwes, in excavating in the New

Forest, met with Nipadites in some abundance, and a specimen he still
has proves the species to be the same as that from Bracklesham Bay, and

entirely different from that which forms a conspicuous zone in the marine

series of the Bournemouth group.

    At Barton, on the other hand, we have been able to procure nearly a

dozen pine-cones, hitherto a great desideratum, from the Highcliff" beds,

which go far to prove that there is only one variety there, indistinguish-
able from the Pinus Dixoni of Bracklesham. Along with these we have
branches of apparently the Bournemouth Araucaria, and an important

and entirely new fruit, fortunately represented by many specimens, which

permit us to examine the details of their structure. These consist of twigs
on which are seated in some profusion clusters of numerous sessile woody
pericarps with deeply laciniate margin, giving the fruit when closed the

appearance of a large burr. These enclose a nut or seed, rather smaller,
but otherwise resembling that of a cucumber. There has not yet been

time to make the researches necessary to come to a conclusion regarding

it, and Mr. Carruthers and other botanists who have seen the specimens

Aare unable oS'hand to pronounce upon its aflBnities.  rather large fossil

plant from the same locality has recently been lent us by the Council of

 the Hartley Institute, and altogether the plants from this horizon, hitherto

. very meagrely represented, bid fair to take an important position. On

the other hand, the Hordwell end of the same section, though twice

visited since our last report, has furnished nothing new.

   We have fortunately met with a few veiy distinctly marked leaves

from the Middle Headon of Headon Hill, preserved in the York Museum,

which with those previously obtained from the Lower Headon of Hord-
                                                                                .

well, help to bridge over one of the few gaps in our really surprisingly

complete succession of Eocene floras.

   We have continued to investigate the great series of plant remains so

assiduously collected by Mr. A' Court Smith, and with this object have

visited Gurnet Bay, as well as receiving several packages of fossils from

that place. While lamenting that they are of so fragmentary a nature, we

cannot overlook their importance as almost the last representatives of the

great series of floras which maintained themselves in our area throughout

the Eocene time. As an illustration of their value we may instance the fact

that while anything like true grasses seem to be wholly wanting in the pre-

vious floras, there are many more or less definite indications of them in
Wethis.
         have reason to hope that renewed working in the still younger

beds of Hempstead may lead to further discoveries, for, besides the better

known plants described by Heer, pine-cones and a fine aroideous fruit

have been obtained from them.

     ON THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL STATION AT GE ANTON, SCOTLAND. 251

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor McKendeick, Pro-
     fessor Strutheks, Professor Young, Professor McIntosh, Professor

     Alleyne Nicholson, Professor Cossar Ewaet, and Mr. John
     Murray (Secretai'y), appointed for the purpose of promoting th&
     establishment of a Marine Biological iStation at Granton,.

      Scotland.

The Committee report that the sum of 751. placed at their disposal has been-
used to aid in defraying the expenses of carrying on the work of the Scottish
Marine Station at Granton. Two reports on the work of the institution

during the past year are given below ; they have been sent in to the Secre-

tary by Mr. J. T. Cunningham, the Superintendent, who has charge ol
the zoological investigations ; and Dr. Hugh Robert Mill, who is respon-
sible for the physical work :

     The Biological work of the Station falls into three principal divisions ;
(1) Embryology and Morphology, (2) Faunology, (3) the accommodation-
of students and investigators.

     (1) Eiforts to elucidate some facts bearing on the reproduction and
development of Myxine formed the principal part of the work under this
head during the autumn and winter. In the summer the aquarium had
been arranged, and a large tank was specially devoted to the purpose oF
keeping specimens of the animal in confinement. After careful attention
to the matter it was found that the creatures refused entirely to feed
whUe in captivity ; they lived several months, but no signs of reproduc-
tive activity appeared, with one exception noted below. It was then
determined to continue the examination of large numbers of specimens
every month in the year in order to find if the ova were shed at any
limited season. As almost nothing accurate was known on the whole

subject, the first problem was to obtain ripe males and females. In No-

vember the testis in its immature condition was recognised, and it was sub-
sequently found that with few exceptions all very immature specimens
were hermaphrodite, containing immature testicular tissue at the posterior
end of the generative organ. Microscopic examination of the largest ova
obtained showed that the well-known polar threads belonged to the vitel-
line membrane, and were developed in tubular depressions of the follicular
epithelium. In December, January, February, and March females were
obtained which had just discharged their ova, the collapsed capsules, still
quite large, being present in the ovary. At the end of January two females
were obtained in which the polar threads were so far developed as to form
projections at the ends of the enclosing follicle. One specimen with egg»

in this condition was taken from the aquarium. No perfectly ripe ova

were ever obtained. In February moving spermatozoa were discovered
in hermaphrodite specimens, but the total quantity of milt present waa-
quite insignificant. The greater number of the specimens examined were
obtained from fishermen's lines baited for haddock ; some were taken by
baited traps. In March dredging was carried on off St. Abb's Head, with
a view to obtain deposited fertilised eggs of Myxine, but none were found.
It has thus been shown that Myxine deposits its eggs in the months of
December to March, and that the females are taken on the hook imme-
diately after the eggs have been shed. But no method has been dis-

covered of obtaining adults in the ripe condition, or of obtaining the fer-

tilised oTa and embryos. The research and its results are described in a

paper in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,' and more

fully in a paper which will appear in the next number of the ' Quarterly

Journal of Microscopical Science.'

At the beginning of the present year the systematic examination of the

ova of all species of fish which could be obtained was commenced. The

pelagic ova of the cod, haddock, whiting, and gurnard had been examined

in the previous spring, and those of a large number of additional species

have now been figured and described at successive sta,ges of development.

The results of this work are now being published in full by the Royal

Society of Edinburgh, and wiU appear as a memoir in the Society's

' Transactions.'

(2) The Faunological investigations have been carried on as time per-

mitted since the opening of the Station, and have, since June last, been

Areceiving particular attention.    report on the Chjetopoda, in the pre-

paration of which Mr. G. A. Ramage is giving his assistance, will appear

in the coming autumn ; a report on the Sponges is being prepared by

Mr. J. Arthur Thomson ; and miscellaneous notes on other classes will be

incorporated with these special reports.

      ON THE MAEINE BIOLOGICAL STATION AT GRANTON, SCOTLAND. 253

     Physical marine research has from the commencement formed one of the
distinctive features of the Scottish Marine Station. During last year
work has been carried on in this direction by Dr. H. R. Mill and ]\Ir. J.
T. Morrison ; other gentlemen have occasionally made nse of the facilities

of the Station.

     Regular meteorological observations are continued twice daily, and in-

clude the temperature at surface and bottom of the water. An elaborate
set of experiments with Mr. John Aitkin's new forms of thermometer

screen were completed last year by Mr. H. N. Dickson. Experiments
witb various anemometers are still in progress.

     Atmospheric dust is being collected on several islands in the Firth of
Forth by means of large funnels and carboys, which are periodically
emptied and the contents forwarded to Mr. Murray for examina-

tion.

     Monthly trips along the Firth of Forth for the observation of tempera-
ture and salinity have taken place regularly from river to sea prelimi-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

nary results have been communicated to the Royal Society of Edin-
burgh from time to time, and a cotnplete discussion of salinity is nearly
ready for publication. It shows remarkable relationships between salinity

and configuration, which have suggested new definitions of the words

river, estuary, andfirth. Special attention has been devoted to the relation
of salinity and temperature to tide in the estuary of the Forth. Besides the
observations of the scientific staff of the Station, thermometer readings are
taken by volunteer observers at different parts of the Forth river-system
and in the adjacent parts of the North Sea.

     The Medusa has made regular trips on the Clyde since April last at
intervals of two months. Temperature and salinity observations are made
in all parts of the estuary and firth from Dumbarton to the North Channel,
and in all the connected lochs. These trips have yielded results of great
interest and novelty. They are communicated in several papers to various

sections of the present meeting.

  --The temperature of two deep fresh- water lakes Locli Lomond and
--Loch Katrine has been observed at all depths once a month since Novem-

ber 1885, in continuation of Mr. J. Y. Buchanan's work.
     Daily temperature observations have been established on a number of

rivers and at several points on some. The Station has charge of obser-
vations on the Thurso, in the north of Scotland, the Forth and Teith, and
the Tweed ; and it has also been the means of inducing independent ob-
servers to undertake similar work on the Tummel (a tributary of the
Tay), the Tay, and the Derwent, in Cumberland. These are all salmon
rivers, and the observers being interested in fishing have already suc-
ceeded in showing some connection between temperature and the move-
ments of salmon.

     In consequence of experience gained in physical marine investigations

--the apparatus used for the purpose has been progressively modified and

improved the Scottish thermometer- frame and water-bottle may be

pointed to as special instances.

     The Station has, since September 1885, been able to advise and assist
several public bodies in starting observations of temperature and salinity,
the National Fish Culture Association of England, the Dundee Harbour
Trust, and the Fishery Board for Scotland being amongst the number.
Thermometers have been lent to several naturalists for nse on short

scientific voyages.

The collection of all existing records of sea and river temperature

round the coast of Scotland is proceeding, and promises when completed

to be of great value in showing the different sea- climates of the east and

     The Committee beg to recommend that a grant of lOOZ. be made for

Tthe maintenance of the Station during the ensuing year.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Ray Lankestek,
     Mr. P. L. ScLATER, Professor M. Fostek, Mr. A. Sedgwick,
     Professor A. M. Marshall, Professor A. C. Haddon, Professor
     Moselet, and Mr. Percy Sladen {Secretary), appointed for the

      furpose of arranging for the occupation of a Table at the

      Zoological Station at Naples.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           .

Tour Committee regret to report that, in consequence of the insufficient

grant voted for their use at the Aberdeen meeting of the British Associa-
tion, they have been placed, during the past year, in a very difficult and
undesirable position. Indeed, if they had not been met in the most
generous spirit by Professor Dohrn, the Committee would have been
unable to carry out the purpose for which they have been appointed
·during a number of successive years.

     The following are the facts of the case. Tables in the Zoological
Station at Naples are let to foreign Governments and scientific bodies for
·periods of not less than one year, and at a fixed annual rental, which has
for some time been established at lOOZ. The table previously at the dis-
posal of the Committee had been hired on these terms. At the Aberdeen
meeting of the Association, held last year, the sum of only SOL was
entrusted to your Committee, and they were consequently unable to hire
a table in the usual way. Several informal communications passed
between the Committee and Professor Dohrn, and culminated in the two
letters subjoined, which your Committee submit for the consideration of

±he Council.

                                                   ' Ewell, Surrey : November 28, 1885.

   --' Dear Sir, I am directed, as Secretary of the Committee for arrang-

ing for the occupation of a table at the Zoological Station at Naples,
to acquaint you with the fact that the Committee have been entrusted

only with 50Z. this year by the British Association, which they much

regret.

     ' They are aware that it is impossible that you should depart from the
principle of the Institution which you have founded, and that you would
compromise its interests by letting a table for less than a year, or for less
than the regularly established sum of IQOl. They therefore propose to
present the sum of bOl. to the Direction of the Zoological Station of Naples

without any stipulation ; but I am instructed to add that they hope,

should a naturalist approved by the Committee desire to visit Naples
            ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.  255

during tlie year, that you will be able to receive him as a guesb for such
period as may be convenient to your arrangements.

    ' In the meantime the Committee desire me to assure you that they

will use their best efforts to obtain next year the usual grant, which will
enable them to lease a table at the Naples Station in the usual way. They
further beg you to be assured that the project of the Marine Biological
Association for erecting a laboratory at Plymouth has not been the cause
of the insufficient grant made by the British Association at Aberdeen,
since no grant was applied for or assigned to the Plymouth enterprise

this year.

  --' Dear Sib, In acknowledging the receipt of your communication,

dated November 28, on behalf of the Committee for arranging for the

occupation of a table at the Zoological Station at Naples, I find it difficult
not to begin with the expression of the sincerest gratitude both for the

grant of 50^. and for the tenor of the communication which informs me

of the condition under which the grant is tendered to me. I cannot but
consent at once to the propositions the Committee makes therein ; and I

shall be doubly pleased if you should have to announce to me at the
earliest possible date the arrival at Naples of a naturalist whom the Com-
mittee desires to see installed at the table, and who will be sure to receive

the full share of the advantages which the Zoological Station, its staff,

and myself may be able to give him for his scientific work.
     ' It is a great satisfaction to me to be assured by the Committee that

they will use their influence to continue the table in the usual way.

Indeed, as you say, it is essential for the existence of the Zoological
Station that the regulations hitherto observed should be maintained. The
system of letting tables to different Governments or scientific bodies has
been introduced as the best possible means to guarantee the existence of
an institution which it would have been difficult to create in any other

way on so large a scale.
     ' It seems to me beyond doubt that in creating and continuously

strengthening one great central institution, a greater good to science

is secured than by promiscuously attempting to establish smaller labora-

tories on different points of the European coast, without carefully weighing
whether such laboratories offer any special advantage, and can be carried
to a state of really efficient working order. If available funds existed,

-- --every university nay, every zoologist might establish a seaside labora-

tory for his own private use, and thus pursue with all possible advantage

bis favourite lines of research. But, as it is, such funds are not ready,

and nobody, I dare to say without presumption, can judge better about the

difficulties of making them forthcoming than the writer of these lines.

The Zoological Station of Naples represents up to this date a capital of

20,000Z., and has to provide for a yearly budget of 6,0001. to 7,000Z.

The efforts it has cost to secure these sums have been considerable. I may

 be permitted to state that it took seven or eight years of persevering

effort to add the recently acquired 4,0001. for the creation of the new
                                     --

256 KEPOET-- 1886.

physiological laboratory now in course of construction, and I look forward
to considerable eiFort being needed to secure adequate annual sums for
working it. It would take more than double the amount of money to

create the same facilities for physiological research at any other seaside

place, and a much greater annual outlay to carry it to the perfection
which may be readily attained by the establishment of this new physio-

logical laboratory as part of the already extensive Naples Zoological

Station.

     ' In stating that the proposed Marine Laboratory at Plymouth did not
cause the diminution of the grant for the Naples Station, the Committee

seems to place itself on the same principle which I am advocating, viz.,
that whatever may be the advantages of a greater number of local zoo-

logical stations, they can hardly supersede the importance of having
access to the greatest and most effective establishment of the kind ; and
by giving that access to British naturalists also secure the welfare and
ever-increasing efficiency of this central biological institution, which to
conduct to its highest level will always remain the chief duty of

                                                  ' Tours sincerely,
                                                        ' Prof. Dr. Anton Dohrn.

    ' W. Percy Sladen, Esq.,

                        * Secretary to the Committee of the British Association'

     Your Committee beg to direct the attention of the Council to the
liberal manner in which Professor Dohrn has assisted them by generously

placing at their disposal the resources of the station as unreservedly as if

a table had been hired in the usual way and the customary contribution
had been paid.

     Your Committee trust that the Council will not again leave them with
a sum insufficient for the hire of the Naples table, and desire to state that
they would not be able again to propose such terms to Professor Dohrn
as they have done this year.

     The Committee would suggest that all sums granted by the Association
for the prosecution of marine biology should be assigned in the first in-
stance to the present Committee, and voted in one sum. And they would
propose now a grant of 200Z., of which lOOZ. should be appropriated for
the hire of a table in the Zoological Station at Naples, and lOOZ. for the

--Plymouth laboratory of the Marine Biological Association.
      The General Collections. The extensive series of marine organisms
collected by officers of the Italian navy, mentioned in the last Report,
have been placed in the hands of specialists for investigation. The
distribution of the collections was undertaken by a Committee appointed

by the R. Accademia dei Lincei of Rome, by whom the material has

been confided to about sixty naturalists in Belgium, Denmark, Germany,
England, Holland, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Russia, and Switzerland.
Very few specimens now remain undistributed. The Committee placed
no restrictions of any kind upon the use of the material, requesting only

--the return of specimens not needed for investigation.
     The Publications of the Station. The progress of the various woi-ks
undertaken by the station is here summarised :

oflBcers of the station have courteously furnished lists (1) of the natu-

ralists who have occupied tables since the last Report, (2) of the works
published during 1885 by naturalists who have worked at the Zoological

Station, (3) ot the specimens sent out by the station during the past
year. These details, which will be found at the end of this Report,

are the strongest evidence of the activity and efiiciency of the institu-

tion.

   --The British Association Table. During the past year Dr. Robert

Scharff", who had been nominated by your Committee, has been kindly
allowed by Professor Dohrn to occupy a table for a period of nearly six

months (December to May), in accordance with the generous undertaking

contained in his letter already quoted. Dr. Scharff has been engaged in
several important investigations, the results of which he hopes to publish
during the coming winter. His report on the occupation of the table is
appended.

I. Report on the Occupation of the Table, by Dr. Robert Scharff.

I commenced my studies at the Zoological Station by taking up the

small group of the ChlorhaBmidse. Several species of this group of

marine Annelids are pretty abundant in the bay, such as Siphonostoma

diplochcetum and Stylarioides vionilifer. I examined a number of them

anatomically, but before I had quite concluded my researches my attention

was drawn by Professor Dohrn to a more interesting field of study,

namely, the gills of Elasmobranch fishes.

Since the publication of the series of articles on the origin of Verte-

brates by Professor Dohrn, anything regarding the development and

structure of the gills of fishes has been received with much greater inter-

est by scientists than formerly. Several organs having now quite a dif-

ferent function are stated by Dohrn to have been merely gill-clefts in the

ancestral vertebrate. Thus the mouth was primitively a pair of gill- clefts
which have coalesced and come to open in front. The organ of smell is

also supposed to represent a gill-cleft. "With regard to the mouth, strong

additional support is given to Dohrn's theory by Beard's researches on

the ' Branchial Sense-organs in Ichthyopsida.' On the other hand, Blaue's

as well as Beard's discoveries do not lend any support to the view of the
nose having been a gill-cleft.

----

258 REPORT-- 1886.

      I merely mentioned these facts, without going into further details, in
order to show the importance of having an exact knowledge of the histo-
logical structure of the gills in order to be able to compare it with that
of the other organs mentioned.

     In the investigation I carried on at Naples during several months the
gills of the following Elasmobranch fishes were examined, both fresh and

preserved :

--Scyllium catulus.           --Torpedo ocellata.
                   canicula.               marmorata.
                              Squafina angelus.
Trygon vtolaceus.
                              --Musfehis Icevis.
--Raja asterias.                                 vulgaris.
            clavata.

The general structure and anatomy of the gills are of course well known,

and have been the subject of several important papers.

The gills of sharks and rays are easily distinguished from the corre-

sponding organs of Ganoids and Teleosteans. While the rows of bran-

chial leaflets, which are placed upon the branchial arches in the latter
two groups project freely into a common cavity covered by the operculum,

in the Elasmobranchii they are distributed in separate branchial sacs.

Every one of these sacs also has its own opening to the exterior. As in

Teleosteans, the branchial leaflets are provided with secondary folds at

their sides, in which the true branchial capillaries are to be found, and

thus form the principal respiratory surface.

The whole branchial leaflet has the form of the blade of a knife. The

base is taken up by the artery, the free margin by the vein. The trian-

gular shape of the cross-section is somewhat interfered with by the above-

mentioned lateral folds, wliich are placed upon the sides at right angles.
They appear as semicircular flaps. The gills, as well as the gill-clefts,

contain a large number of mucous cells in their outer cellular layers. As

far as I have been able to make out, there are no special cells having a

sensory function.  In adult gills there are no ciliated cells                                                                                                                                                                            in the fully
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

grown embryo of Mustelus, however, the cells covering the lateral flaps

of the branchial leaflets were ciliated. At the margin of the gill-cleft I

also observed ciliated cells.

    One of my principal objects in studying the gills of Elasmobranch

fishes was to find out the nature of the nerve-endings. I regret that,

although I tried a large number of different methods, and much time was

spent over it, I was not successful. For general purposes, however, I can
recommend the following method of staining with chloride of gold, which

did me more good service in tracing nerves than Ranvier's or any of the

other methods :

     ' Place the small object in a watch-glass-full of ^ per cent, chloride of
gold, and add one drop of hydrochloric acid. Leave this in the dark for

about half an hour ; then, after washing out with water, put the object in a

mixture of one part formic acid to four parts water, and expose to light

until a violet colour appears.'

   A more detailed account of the innervation, as well as the structure of

the mucous and other cells composing the cellular layers of the gill-cleft

and the branchial leaflets, will be published during the course of next

winter. I can only give this very short resume at present, having to

complete many of my observations by a series of sections which I purpose

making shortly.

264 REPORT-- 1886.

Report of the ConiTnittee, consisting of Mr. John Cokdeaux (Secre-
     tary), Professor A. Newton, Mr. J. A. Harvie-Brow'N, Mr.

     William Eagle Clarke, Mr. R. M. Harrington, and Mr. A.

     G. More, appointed for the purpose of obtaining {with
     the consent of the Master and Brethren of the Trinity House
     and the Commissioners of Northern and Irish Lights) observa-
     tions on the Migration of Birds at Lighthouses and Lightvessels,
    and of reporting on the same.

The General Report of the Committee, of which this is an abstract, is

comprised in a pamphlet of 173 pages,' and includes observations taken at

lighthouses and lightvessels, as well as at several land stations, on the

coasts of Great Britain and Ireland and the outlying islands.

     The best thanks of the Committee are due to their numerous ob-
servers for their assistance. Much good work has been rendered by

those amongst them who have taken the trouble to forward a leg and

wing of such specimens as have been killed against the lanterns, and

which they have themselves not been able to identify. This has already

led to the determination of several rare birds, which otherwise would

have escaped notice. It is evident that unless the birds can be correctly

named the value of this inquiry is materially diminished, and ornitho-
logists may justly refuse to accept the accuracy of the statements. It is

intended, in order to facilitate the sending of wings, to supply the light-

keepers with large linen-lined envelopes, ready stamped, and enclosing

labels for dates and other particulars.

The best thanks of the Committee are also tendered to Mr. H. Gatke

for the increased interest he has given to their report by forwarding a daily

record of the migration of birds as observed at Heligoland between

January 1 and December 31, with the concurrent meteorological conditions

under which the various phenomena occurred.

Altogether 187 stations were supplied with printed schedules for

registering the observations, and returns have been sent in from 125.

About 267 separate schedules have been sent in to your reporters. The

general results, as far as the special object of the inquiry, have been very

satisfactory, and much information has also been accumulated respecting

the breeding habits of seafowl on the outlying islands and skerries on

the Scotch and Irish coasts, and altogether a great mass of facts and

valuable data obtained which cannot fail to be of value to future in-

quirers.

   A special point of interest in the report is the large arrival, with a

north-east wind, of Pied Flycatchers in the first week in May 1885,

observed at Spurn Point, Flamborough Head, the Isle of May, and

Pentland Skerries. At Flamborough Head the Flycatchers were accom-

panied by male Redstarts in large numbers, both species swarming for

two or three days. The immigration at this period was not exclusively

confined to these two species. Mr. Agnew, writing from the Isle of May,

--at the entrance of the Firth of Forth, says, under date of May 3rd ' An

extraordinary rush  of  migrants to-day                                                                          have never seen anything like it
                                                                                                              ;

increasing in numbers, but wind shifted this morning to E. for S.B.'

    A noteworthy incident also of the vernal migration was the great

Tush of Wbeatears observed at the Bahama Bank vessel off the Isle of
Man, and at Langness on the night of April 13, when many perished and

were captured. On the same night Wheatears were killed at the Coning-
beg and Rathlin Island lighthouses, on the Irish coast On the I2th and

13th the rush was very heavy at stations on the west coast of Scotland,

^o coi-respouding movement was observed on the east coast of Great

Britain on the same night; but at Hanois L. H., Guernsey, on the 10th of
May, at night at the north light, and on the Lincolnshire coast and Farn
Islands on the 10th and 11th. These entries are sufficient to show the

immense area covered by the migration of this species at or about the

same period. On the east coast of England the first Wheatears were

observed at the Farn Islands on February 22,

The autumnal migration is first indicated at Heligoland on July 6,

and was continued with slight intermissions up to the end of the year.

A similar movement affected the whole of the east coast of Great Britain

during the same period, but was apparently less constant and persistent

than at Heligoland.

It has been remarked in previous reports that the migration of a

species extends over many weeks, and in some cases is extended for

months. Yet it is observable that, at least on the east coast of England,
year by year, the bulk or main body of the birds come in two enormous
and almost continuous rushes during the second and third weeks in

October and the corresponding weeks in November.

In the autumn of 1885 it is again observable that the chief general

movements which usually characterise the southward autumnal passage

were two in number, and affected the stations over the whole coast line
both east and west of Great Britain. The first of these commenced

about the 11th ot October, and was continued to the 20th. The second

from the 8th to the 12th of November. It is worthy of notice that these

two chief movements of the autumn were ushered in by and were con-

current with anti-cyclonic conditions, preceded by and ceasing with

cyclonic depressions, affectii\g, more or less, the whole of the British

isles. From this it appears not unlikely that birds await the approach

of favourable meteorological conditions, of which perhaps their more acute

senses give them timely warning to migrate in mass. Whatever may be the

cause which impels these enormous rushes, often continuous for days, it

is one which operates over an immense area at one and the same time.

The October rush reached its maximum ou the 16th, at which date

almost all the stations report extraordinary numbers of various species

on the wing. As one out of many we quote from the journal of Mr.

James Jack, principal of the Bell Rock lighthouse : ' Birds began to
arrive at 7.30 p.m., striking lightly and flying off again ; numbers went

on increasing till midnight, when it seemed that a vast flock had arrived,

as they now swarmed in the rays of light, and, striking hard, fell dead on

balcony or rebounded into the sea. At 3 a.m. another flock seemed to

have arrived, as the numbers now increased in density ; at the same

time all kinds crowded on to the lantern windows, trying to force their

way to the light. The noise they made shrieking and battering the

windows baffles description. The birds were now apparently in thou-

sands                             nothing  ever  seen  here                                                                                                                 like  it  by us keepers.                                 Wherever there
                               ;

was a light visible in the building they tried to force their way to it.

The bedroom windows being open as usual for air all night, they got in

and put the lights out. All birds went off at 6 a.m., going W.S.W.

Redwings were most in number                                                                                                                                                Starlings next ;                                    Blackbirds, Fieldfares,
                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and Larks.' The rush in November chiefly tof>k place in the night ; at

the Bell Rock the movement ceased at midnight of the 12th, and at the

--Longstone Lighthouse, on the Farn Islands, a little earlier at 10.30 p.m.,

when the wind became strong from S.W.

  --From each succeeding year's statistics we have come to almost similar

conclusions regai-ding the lines of flight regular and periodically used

routes where the migratory hosts are focussed into solid streams. Three

salient lines on the east coast of Scotland are invariably shown, viz.,

(1) by the entrance of the Firth of Forth, and as far north as Bell Rock,

both  coming                      in       autumn      and  leaving                                                                                                                   in  spring                                (2)  by  the  Pentland
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

Firth and Pentland Skerries, likewise in spring and autumn; and (3)'

by the insular groups of Orkney and Shetland, which perhaps may be

looked upon as part of No. 2. On the other hand, three great areas of

coast line, including many favourably lighted stations, almost invariably,

save in occasionally protracted easterly winds, and even then but rarely,

send in no returns, or schedules of the very scantiest description. These

areas are Berwickshire, the whole of the east coast south of the Moray

Firth, and Caithness and East Sutherland. Each and all of these areas

possess high and precipitous coast lines, if we except the minor estuaries

of the rivers Tay and Dee, and a small portion of the lower coast line of

Sutherland, which face towards the east.

    On the east coast of England these highways are less clearly demon,

strated. The Farn Islands, Flamborough Head, and the Spurn are well

established                       points of      arrival and departure                                                                                                                    but south of                               the Humber as
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

far as the South Foreland the stream appears continuous along the whole

coast line, and to no single locality can any certain and definite route

be assigned. It cannot be said that the southerly flow of autumn

migrants is equally distributed along the entire west coast of England.

On the contrary, the schedules afford unmistakable evidence that the

great majority of these migrants, st far as the English and "Welsh coasts

are concerned, are observed at stations south of Anglesey. But while

the north-west section of the coast is thus less favoured than the rest,,

such is not the case with the Isle of Man, which comes in for an important

share of the west coast migratory movement. The fact has already been

alluded to, that large masses of immigrants from Southern Europe pass

through the Pentland Firth, and, along with migrants from Faroe,

Iceland, and Greenland, pass down the west coast of Scotland, whence
many cross to Ireland, and it seems most probable that the remainder

leave Scotland at some point on the Wigtown coast, and pass by way of
the Isle of Man to the west coast of Wales, and thus avoid the English

shore of the Irish Sea. The schedules s-ent in from the coasts of Flint,.

Cheshire, Lancashire, and Cumberland show that in 1884-85 compara-

tively few migrants were observed, and that the great general movement

did not affect them in any general degree. These remarks do not apply

to migrants among the waders and ducks and geese, which, as a rule,

closely follow coast lines, and which are abundantly represented on the

Solway and coasts of Cumberland and Lancashire. There is a much

used bird route along the north coast of the Bristol Channel, and thence,
from the Pembroke coast, across to Wexford, passing the Tuskar Rock,

the best Irish station.

     The fact of a double migration or passage of birds, identical in species,
across the North Sea in the spring and autumn both towards the E. and
S.E. and to the W. and N.W., is again very clearly shown in the present
report. This phenomenon of a cross migration to and from the Continent,
proceeding at one and the same time, is regularly recorded on the whole

of the east coast of England, but is specially observable at those light-
vessels which are stationed in the south-east district ; at the same time, it

is invariably persistent and regular year by year.
     Our most interesting stations are those on small islands or rocks, or

lightvessels at a considerable distance from shore, and the regular occur-
rence of so many land birds, apparently of weak power of flight, around
these lanterns is a matter of surprise to those unacquainted with the

facts of migration. No clear indication of the migration of the Redbreast

has yet been shown on the Irish coast ; the records of its occurrences are
few and scattered. The Black Redstart was recorded at several stations
in the southern half of Ireland ; specimens were forwarded from Mine Head,

The Skelligs, and Rockabill. It is apparently a regular winter visitant to
The Skelligs and Tearaght, generally appeai-ing in October and Novem-
ber. The occurrences so far recorded by the Committee of the Black

Redstart on the east coast of Great Britain, in the autumn, range between

October 23 and November 3.
     In the spring of the present year Mr. G. Hunt, under date of March

20, reports an extraordinary flight of Rooks at Somerton, on the Norfolk

coast, which he observed from IU.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. He says : ' I observed

them flying just above the sand-hills, going due south, and as far as the
eye could see both before and behind there was nothing but Rooks. There
could never for one moment of the day be less than a thousand in sight
at one time ; they kept in a thin wavering line. The coast line here runs
due north and south.' Mr. J. H. Gurney reports : ' I saw the Rooks
and Grey Crows on the same day in much smaller numbers as were seen
at Somerton, which is fifteen miles further south. I again saw them on

the 2l3t, 22nd, 25th, 26th, and 29th, but none after this date ; with ns,

however. Grey Crows preponderated : the direction was to S.E. An

enormous migration of these and many others is recoi'ded from Heligoland,

also from Hanover between March 19 and 25.'
     In conclusion your Committee wish to thank H.R.H. the Master and

the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, the Commissioners of Northern

Lights, and the Commissioners of Irish Lights for their ready co-opera-
tion and assistance, through their intelligent oflicers and men, in this

inquiry.

     The Committee respectfully request their reappointment.

568 REPOHT-- 1886.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Cleland, Professor
    McKendeick, Professor Ewart, Professor Stirling, Professor Bower,

   Dr. Cleghorn, and Professor McIntosh (Secretary), appointed
   for the purpose of continuing the Researches on Food-Fishes
   and Invertebrates at the St. Andrews Marine Laboratory.

The Committee beg to report that the sum of 751., placed at their dis-

posal, has for the most part been expended in the purchase of instruments
and books permanently useful in the Laboratory, only a limited proportion
having been disbursed for skilled assistance.

      Since the meeting of the Association at Aberdeen last year several

structural improvements in the wooden hospital, now converted into the

Laboratory, have been completed, and others are being carried out by the
Fishery Board for Scotland. These changes will render the temporary

building much more suitable for work. A small yawl of about 21 feet in

length has also been added to the apparatus by the Fishery Board. The
desiderata now are an increase in the number of good microscopes and
other expensive instruments, and an addition to the nucleus of books
which workers require always at hand. In this respect the Laboratory
has been much indebted to the Earl of Dalhousie, who forwarded a com-
plete set of Fishery Blue Books, and to the Trustees of the British
Museum, who sent their publications relating to marine zoology.
Collections of papers have also been forwarded by many observers,

amongst whom Professor Flower, the late Dr. Gwyn JeflTreys, and Pro-

fessor Alexander Agassiz are conspicuous. Most of the Continental and
American workers in marine zoology and cognate subjects, as well as
those of our own country, are indeed represented.

     The first work of the year was the examination of a fine male Tunny,
9 feet in length, caught in a beam-trawl net near the mouth of the Forth,
and the skeleton of which is now being prepared for the University
Museum. Various interesting anatomical features came under notice, and
its perfect condition enabled a more correct figure of its external appear-
ance to be made (vide ' Ann. Nat. Hist.' April and May 1866 and ' Fourth
Report of the Fishery Board for Scotland,' plate viii.) The examina-
tion of various food- and other fishes in their adult and young conditions
was systematically carried out, and notes on the following species will be

--found in the ' Annals of Natural History,' and the ' Report of the Fishery

Board' : Weever (greater and lesser), shanny, sand-eel, halibut, salmon,
common trout, herring, sprat, conger, ballan-wasse, shagreen-ray, piked
dog-fish, and porbeagle-shark. Special attention was also given to the
' Mode of Capture of Food-Fishes by Liners,' ' Injuries to Baited Hooks
and to Fishes on the Lines,' ' Shrimp-Trawling in the Thames,' ' Sprat-
Fishing,' and to the ' Eggs and Young of Food- and other Fishes,'
' Diseases of Fishes,' the ' Effect of Storms on the Marine Fauna,' and
 ' Remarks on Invertebrates, including Forms used as Bait.'

     The active work in connection with the development of fishes for the
season may be dated from the middle of January, when one of the local
 trawlers captured a large mass of the ova of one of the food-fishes, viz.,
the catfish (Anarrhichas lupus, L.). The embryos in these eggs (which
are the size of the salmon's) were well advanced, so that with the excep-

tion of a few unimpregnated ova observed during the trawling experi-
ment^ of 1884, the earlier stages have yet to be examined. The large size
of the embryos of the catfish permitted a satisfactory comparison to be
instituted between them and the salmon, which had formerly been under
examination, and the results, with drawings of both forms, are nearly
completed, and will be communicated to one of the Societies during the

winter.

     The first pelagic ova, viz., those of the haddock, made their appearance
during the very cold weather in the beginning of February, and the exa.

--mination of these, together with those of the cod and common flounder

both of which were unusually late enabled Mr. E. E. Prince and the
Secretary to extend considerably the observations of last year. Moreover,.
for the first time, the ova of the ling (Molva vulgaris) were examined,
and the development followed to a fairly advanced stage. These were
procured by a long-line fisherman of Cellardyke (who with others
was supplied with suitable earthenware jars' and encouraged by a visit
to the Laboratory), fertilised about 100 miles ofiF the Island of May, and
safely brought, after a considerable land-journey, to St. Andrews. The
fertilised ova of the plaice and lemon-dab were similarly brought by
Captain Burn, late of the Hussars, from the Moray Frith ; for the Labora-

tory had then no boat suited for procuring a supply nearer home. No

fish, however, has been moi'e useful to the workers this season than the-
gurnard {Trigla gurnardus), the spawning period of which seems to have
been somewhat later than usual. The first ova were procured about the
middle of May, and the embryos of the last hatching (middle of August)

still swarm in the vessels. Further observations were also made on the
ova and young of the lumpsucker, Montagu's sucker, shanny, stickleback,
sand-eel, Coitus, &c. Amongst others the nearly ripe ovum of Ainmodytes

tdbianus has been examined. It is colourless, translucent, and has a
beautifully reticulated capsule. Mr. Prince is of opinion that, as sug-
gested in the ' Report of H.M. Trawling Commission,' it resembles a

pelagic e^g.

     Moreover, the information necessary for filling up the gaps between
the very early stages of the young food-fishes near the surface and their
appearance off" the shore as shoals of young forms more or less easily

recognisable specifically has been considerably increased. Much of this

knowledge has been obtained by the aid of a huge tow-net of coarse

-- --gauze upwards of twenty feet in length attached to a triangle of wood,

ten feet each way, sunk by a heavy weight and kept steadily at the
required depth in fathoms by a galvanised iron float, such as is used for
the ends of herring-nets. Since the completion of the net, however,
the services of the Fishery Board tender Garland have only once been
available, and the yawl has been at our disposal only a few weeks. In
these brief opportunities, however, the young of various fishes have been
obtained at stages hitherto unknown, and some rare invertebrates and a
remarkable Medusa have been captured. Enough, in short, has been seen
to indicate the value of this apparatus, and of certain modifications of the
ordinary beam-trawl for work on the bottom.

    The hatching and rearing of the embryos of the common food-fishes
have been attended with much greater success than last year or the

previous one, and a large series of microscopic preparations (chiefly sections

with the Caldwell and rocking microtomes) has been made chiefly by

Mr. E. E. Prince, embracing the entire development of the food-fishes

from the early ovnm to a late larval stage. The study of these prepara-

tions is now being proceeded  with                          but in traversing a field so extensive
                                                         ;

as the embryology of these important Teleosteans a great expenditure of

time and labour is required. It is hoped, however, that the results wiU

be completed during the winter.'

Since the beginning of June Dr. Scharff" has been occupied with

the investigation of the iutra-ovarian egg of a number of Teleosteans.

Among the ovaries examined were those of Trigla gumardv^, Gadus

virens and G. luscus, Gadus inerlaiigus, AnarrMchas lupus, Conger vulgaris,

Blennius pholis, Lophius piscatorius, and Sabno salar. The researches were

made on fresh ovaries and on spirit-specimens. Most of those reserved

for section-cutting were previously treated either with picrosulphuric or

weak chromic acid. Special attention was paid to the structural changes

in the growing nucleus. The origin of the follicular layer surrounding

the egg, as well as the origin and development of the yolk, will be dealt

with in a paper to be published shortly.

Considerable advancement has been made iu the study of the develop-

ment of the common mussel by Mr. John Wilson. Some of the very early

larvae are described in the Report of last year, along with an account of

the artificial methods employed. This year embryos were developed

for forty days in vessels suitable for microscopic manipulation. Normal

growth continued during the first fourteen days. At the end of this
period the largest embryos had shell-valves '128 mm. in length. They are

transparent and almost semicircular, the dorsal (hinge-) line being nearly

straight. The powerful velum could be wholly withdrawn within the

valves. The alimentary system was conspicuously developed. In the

beginning of June great numbers of young mussels were found swimming

actively on the very sui'face of the sea close to the shore, and measuring

·134 mm. They difi'ered from the most advanced of those artificially

reared only in their beiog more robust, the stage reached being the same

in both. At various periods somewhat later in the season many older,

though still microscopic, mussels were captured with the tow-net in St.

Andrews Bay from the shore seaward for four miles. Besides the careful

study of their development, Mr. Wilson has also been engaged with the

histology of the mussel (especially that of the generative organs) at various

stages, up to the adult condition.

The Committee beg to recommend a renewal of the grant (lOOZ.) for

the ensuing year.

DEPTH OF PERMANENTLT FROZEN SOIL IN THE POLAR REaiONS. 271

Report of the Committee, consisting of General J. T. Walker,

   Greneral Sir J. H. Lefroy, Professor Sir W. Thomson, Mr. Alex.
   BucHAN, INIr. J. Y. Buchanan, Mr. John Murray, Dr. J. Eae, Mr.
   H. W. Bates (Secretary), Captain W. J. Dawson, Dr. A. Selwyn,
   and Mr. C. Carpmael, appointed to organise a Systematic In-

   vestigation of the Depth of the Periinanently Frozen Soil in the

   Polar Regions, its Geographical Limits and Relation to the

    present Pole of greatest cold.

The inquiry referred to the Committee necessitated reference to residents

in many distant regions, and time must elapse before any large harvest

of observations can be hoped for ; nevertheless, the Committee are in a

position to quote several valuable communications, especially one from Mr.

Andrew Flett, adding materially to what was previously known on the sub-

ject of the extension of permanently frozen soil, or ground ice, in America.

It will be convenient to arrange the data now available in their order

of latitude.

W.--1. Lat. 71° 18' ISr., long. 156° 24'  At the wintering station of the

United States expedition of 1881-2, under Lieutenant P. H. Ray, United

States America, that officer found the temperature of the soil 12° F. at

28 feet from the surface, and the same at 38 feet.

W.--2. Lat. 68° N., long. 135°  At Fort Macpherson, on Peel River,
--Mr. Andrew Flett, who passed 12 years there, reports : ' The greatest

depth of thawed-out earth I came across round that post was 3^ feet,
October 10, 1865. The greatest depth of frozen ground was 52 feet 3
inches, September 27, 1867, near the mouth of Peel River. The bank

had fallen in ; at the bottom the perpendicular cliff, which I tried with a

Aboat pole, was frozen as hard as a rock.           black sandy soil. The

surface w^as not above two feet thawed out. The cliff was measured

with the tracking line.' This account leaves it doubtful whether the

frost may not have entered the soil from the face of the cliff. On the

other hand it is evident that it extended to a greater depth from the

surface than was measured.

  --3. Lat. 67° N., long. 142° W. on the Youcon.-- The same gentleman

writes: 'I spent 12 years on the Pelly or Youcon River, on the west
side of the Rocky Mountains. Round old Fort Youcon ground ice is

found at 6 feet ; this I have seen in the river banks in September where
they had caved in ; but no particular notice has been taken as far as I

know by anyone, unless it be Chief Factor Robert Campbell, now residing

in Merchiston, Strathclair, P.O., Manitoba.'

W.--4. Lat. 65° N., long. 120°  On the Mackenzie River, about ten
--miles above the mouth of Bear River. The same gentleman writes :

' I have seen many landslips on the Mackenzie, which more frequently

takes place in rainy weather ; July, August, and sometimes September
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

but I never examined them particularly excepting one, which we came

near being buried by in camp. This was about August 15, 1876. By a

pole, I found the bottom of the slide frozen hard, a grey clay and gravel

mixed, from where the earth broke off was not over 6 feet. The surface soil
sandy. Some way back from the river bank the country is muskeg more
or less, and by removing the moss by hand we came to hard frozen ground

in August.' The sentence printed in italic is somewhat ambiguous. It

extended is therefore unknown.

W.--5. Lat. 64° 20' N., long. 124° 15'                                 On Mackenzie Hirer.--The

face of a cliff from which a recent, land-slide had occurred was measured

by the present reporter in June 1844. The soil was frozen to a depth

of 45 feet from the surface (see 'Magnetic Survey,' p. 161).

W.--6. Lat. 62° 39' N., long. 115° 44'                                 At Fort Rae, on Great Slave
--Lake. Captain Dawson, B.A., observed the temperature of the soil

monthly at his station of circumpolar observation, 1882-3. The follow-

ing table contains his results :

places, the ground is either covered with thick moss or shaded by brush-
wood, and its surface temperature in the hottest day is not likely to ex-

ceed 70° F., whereas earth exposed to the rays of the sun may easily
reach a temperatui-e of 120° F.' Fort Rae is situated on a long arm or

inlet of Great Slave, having a depth of 10 or 12 feet of water.

     7. Lat. 62°, long. 129° 40'.--Jakutsk, Siberia.--The great depth of
permanently frozen soil in this part of the valley of the Lena has long
been well known ; but the following extract translated from a recent
paper by Doctor Alex. Woeikof, of St. Petersburg, entitled ' Klima von
Ost-Siberien,' contains information on the influence of local conditions
which will make it of value to observers, and we therefore reproduce it.

     ' The further north,' he remarks, ' the longer is the duration of cold
in valleys in comparison with that on higher ground. The effect extends
to a part of autumn and spring, and is observable in the mean tempera-

ture of the year.'

     The following observations of earth temperatures are a proof :

warmer than in the valleys of the Forest-zone. Probably because the

stronger currents of the air do not permit the cold stratum to remain so

long stagnant.

   N7a. Lat. 01° 53' 30" , long. 6° 46' 30" E. Faleide, Nordfjord, in

--Norway. The following memorandum, supplied by a recent tourist in

Norway as the result of numerous inquiries on the Nordfjord in about
lat. 61° 53', shows, as we should expect, a remarkable difference in the
penetration of frost in a high European latitude. ' The ground at Faleide

(on the Nordfjord) is frozen from one to two and a half feet deep about

the Fjord in winter, but this depends upon how soon the snow falls.

Higher up the mountains the ground is scarcely frozen at all, owing to

the snow falling sooner, and, in fact, if the snow falls very early lower

down it is scarcely frozen to any depth.'

     8. Lat. 61° 51', long. 125° 25', Fort Simpson, on Mackenzie's River.

The summer's heat was found in October 1837 to have thawed the soil to
a depth of 11 feet, below which was 6 feet of ground ice (Richardson),
making the depth of descent of the frost 17 feet. The result is anomalous
at other posts in the same region the summer thaw is much more super-
ficial. Thus, it will be observed above that in the month of October, at

Fort Rae, the soil was at a nearly nniform temperature, but slightly

above the freezing point, from the depth of 1 foot to 4 feet. Franklin
found a summer thaw of only 22 inches at Great Bear Lake, and the

writer was informed that it was only 14 inches at Fort Norman (lat.

64° 41'). Fort Simpson is situated on an island of deep alluvial soil,

bearing timber of large size, and possessing an exceptional climate.

    9. Lat. 57°, long. 92° 26', York Factory, Hudson's Bay.-- Sir J.

Richardson has stated that the soil was found frozen to a depth of

19 feet 10 inches in October 1835, the surface being thawed to a depth of

2 feet 4 inches.

no frozen soil was found in sinking a pit to a depth of 25 feet in 1837,

and that the earth was only fi-ozen to a depth of 3 feet in the winter of

1841. Both records are anomalous, and call for verification.
     11. Lat. 53° 40', long. 113° 35'. At Prince Albert, on the Saskatche-

that a settler in the neighboui'hood came to frozen ground at a deptb of

17 feet, but did not learn whether they passed through the frozen strata,
or, if such was the case, what was the thickness of it. The same gentle-
man, writing from Lesser Slave Lake (lat. 55° 33'), remarks that he has

never come across any indication of perpetual ice during the twenty-two

years he has passed in the North-west Territory.

says : ' Hundreds of wells have been sunk in this settlement ; one I had
sunk myself, beginning of July 1881, 27 feet deep ; saw no frozen earth.
As far as I have noticed on this prairie land, when there is a good fall of

snow when the winter sets in, the frost does not penetrate so deep as

when there is no snow till late, and in some years very light snow. I had

a pit opened on the 9th inst. (April) ; the surface was thawed 3 inches ; we

digging a well last summer (1885), found the frost at a depth of 19 and

·20 feet, and continuing for a depth of 80 inches. In this case, therefore,

the total depth to which frost descended was about 22 feet. Mr. J.

Tarbolton, of Yorkton, in communicating the last observation, remarks :

* The depth to which frost penetrates during the winter varies, I find,

with the character of the winter itself, and with the nature of the locality.

I made observations in an open unprotected spot, where there was little or

DO snow, and found frost to the depth of 5 feet 9 inches. This occurred last

July, and the frost was then about 2 feet deep (i.e., had descended to

my7 feet 9 inches). But in the bluflfs near  house I dug a cellar, at the

same time, going down between 8 and 9 feet, encountering no frost at all.

' This year, however, when digging another well in April, in almost

the same place, I encountered frost at 2 feet, and the ground continued

solid until I had gone down from 4| to 5 feet from the surface. From
this, and from the information I obtained from others, I am safe in saying

that the frost penetrates here to an average of 5 feet, except when we

have had a great depth of snow in the beginning of winter, in which case

it does not penetrate nearly so far. The bluffs referred to are groves of

poplar from 3 to 6 inches in diameter, on the edge of an open plain.'

     Mr. Charles Carpmael, Director of the Meteorological Service of

Oanada, to whom most of the above reports were addressed, remarks :

We* can easily imagine that at a depth of 17 feet at Prince Albert, there

might be no frost at all in winter, but owing to the slow travelling down-

ward of the wave of cold, it might have I'eached a depth of 1 7 feet in the

early summer.

' It is easily seen that the annual mean temperature of the air might

be considerably below the freezing point without the occurrence of per-

manently frozen soil, for in winter the soil is often covered deep in snow,

so that the temperature of the soil might be but little below 32°, although

the temperature of the air were 30° or 40° F. below zero. Again, the

heat which had entered the soil in summer would only be removed by

slow conduction, whereas the Summer heat would not only travel down-

wards by conduction, but be carried into the soil by percolation of the

warm water through the surface.'

Report of the Committee, consisting of Greneral J. T. Walkeb, General
      Sir J. H. Lefeot, Professor Sir William Thomson, Mr. Francis
      Galton, Mr. Alex. Buchan, Mr. J. Y. Buchanan, Dr. John

     Murray, Mr. H. W. Bates, aucZMr. E. G. Ravenstein {Secretary),

      appointed for the pui^ose of taking into consideration the

     Combination of the Ordnance and Admiralty Surveys, and the

    Production of a Bathy-hypsographical Map of the British

        Isles.

1. The Committee consider that the production of a plain outline map of

the British Isles and surrounding seas, on a scale of 1 : 200000 (about
three miles to the inch) would be desirable.

     Rivers, and such other physical features as can be shown in outline, to

be marked distinctly. No hill-shading to be introduced. Roads, railways,

towns, &c., to be indicated faintly, and merely for the purpose of identi-
fying localities. Principal heights and depths above and below the datum
level of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain to be inserted.

     Contours to be drawn at intervals of 200 feet, with subsidiary contours
where they are necessary, to give expression to the features of the

ground.
      Incidental features, such as cliflPs, &c., to be marked.

     The map to be tinted according to height.

    A2. grant of 25Z. to be applied for in order that a specimen sheet of

the map may be prepared.

     3. The Clyde Trustees to be approached, with a view to their under-

taking the preparation of a similar map of the Clyde estuary on a suitably

larger scale.

      Other harbour boards to be similarly approached.
     4. The Committee anticipate that, being provided with maps of this
character as specimens of what is required to supply a national want,

the Association may be in a better position than at present to move the
Government to undertake the preparation of a similar map of the whole

of the United Kingdom, based mainly upon the extensive data already
available in the archives of the Ordnance Survey and the Admiralty.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir Joseph D. Hooker, Sir
     George Nares, Mr. John Murray, General J. T. Walker,

     Admiral Sir Leopold McClintock, Mr. Clements Markham, and
     Admiral Sir Erasmus Ommanney {Secretary), appointed for the
     purpose of draiving attention to the desirability of further

      research in the Antarctic Regions.

YouE Committee, after having given full consideration to the great

importance of effecting a further exploration of the Antarctic Polar Sea,
desire, in the first place, to.express their opinion that it would be most

essential, before approaching H.M. Government with the view of urging
the expediency of equipping such a naval expedition as would be
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                .

required for the carrying out an exploration of such magnitude, interest,
and importance, that the requirements for its success and a plan of
operations should be most carefully considered, and the results embodied
in a written form for the approval of the Council of the Association and
for the information of the Government.

     Furthermore, in order to obtain the co-operation which the matter

requires from eminent men in science, your Committee feel it necessary
for their body to be enlarged by the addition of influential members of the

Association, and of other bodies representing the various branches of

science interested in the investigation of this comparatively unknown

region, and especially of the Royal Geographical Society.
     Tour Committee have to point out that our knowledge of the South

Polar region is chiefly confined to the grand discoveries efi'ected by that
celebrated expedition under the command of Captain Sir James C. Ross,
conducted between the years 1839 and 1843 with sailing ships. Since
that period the facilities for efiiecting a more complete research have been
greatly augmented by the application of steam propulsion to vessels
better adapted for ice navigation. This has been proved by continuous
experience in the Arctic seas during the late half-century.

     For the above reasons your Committee deem it desirable to defer
making their report, with a view to giving more definition to the objects
sought to be obtained and to the best means of obtaining them, as also to
expand this Committee, in order to elicit to the fullest extent the opinions
and to secure support from those conversant with the various branches
of science which are to be investigated during an exploration which,
from its very important and serious nature, eminently merits the favour-
able consideration of this great and enterprising maritime nation.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. J. H. Gladstone,
     (Secretary), Professor Aemsteon«, Mr. William Shaen, Mr.
      Stephen Bourne, Miss Ltdia Becker, Sir John Lubbock, Bart,

     Dr. H. W. Crosskey, Sir Richard Temple, Bart., Sir Henry E.
     EoscoE, Mr. James Heywood, and Professor N. Story Maskelyne,

      appointed foi' the purpose of continuing the inquiries relating
      to the teaching of Science in Elementally Schools.

No steps in advance have been taken by any Government Department

towards the more adequate provision foi- science teaching in elementary
 schools during the past year. There have been four diSerent Yice-
 presidents of the Committee of Council on Education during the last
twelve months ; and Sir Lyon Playfair only came into ofiice after the
 code for the year had been settled.

      The annual return of the Education Department for England and
 Wales issued this year, which deals with the period from September 1,
 1884, to August 31, 1885, shows that the present regulations tell un-
 favourably on the prospects of science.

      The following statistics for the last three years show that, while the
 Preferential class subject ' English ' is taken in an increasing number of
 departments year by year, geography shows an actual falling-ofi", and
 elementary science seems even to be losing the little footing it had
                --

ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.  279

Needlework shows a steady increase, as it is an obligatory subject in
girls' schools, and it is more advantageous in a financial point of view to
take it up as a class subject rather than under Article '109 (c), in which

case it necessarily displaces geography or science :

Class Subjects
                                                                              ----

280 REPORT 1886.

     It is evident that while the number of scholars in the higher
standards has considerably increased, the number examined in specific

(scientific) subjects has considerably decreased ; and this decrease has
occurred in every subject except mechanics. Algebra and chemistry
show rather larger numbers than last year, though not in proportion to

the increase of scholars.

     The comparative decrease in the attention paid to these scientific
sabjects will be evident from the percentages of children examined :

                                               In 1882-3                29-0 per cent.

but it must be borne in mind that in many schools the children take two

subjects, in which case they count accordingly.

Increased though still very inadequate attention seems to be paid in

the training colleges to the preparation of the students in the science

subjects                                       the number of individual students who have qualified for teach-

ing one or more sciences has risen from 2,205 in 1884 to 2,407 in 1885,

and it is satisfactory to note that the increase has been mainly in

passes in the first class. The number of papers worked in the several

subjects in the two years under review has been as follows :

 rmising boys shonld receive some elementary manual instruction before

 "the close of their school career.

       ' That your memorialists have established a technical class for boys

 who have passed through a course of lessons under the Board's science

  demonstrator, and are thus specially prepared for this kind of instruction.
       ' That the department has informed the Board the code does not

  recognise such experimental instruction in -workshops, and that the two
 hours per week devoted to such instruction cannot be reckoned as an
  attendance for the purpose of Article 12.

       ' That twenty boys attending the People's College Higher Grade
 Board School have been under instruction one half-day per week since
 October last at the Nottingham University College Technical Workshops,
 and that the experimental scheme of the Board has worked satisfactorily.

       ' That, in the opinion of the Board, the scheme might usefully be
 extended to the ordinary Board schools, which are also visited by the
 Board's science demonstrator. In answer to recent inquiries, ninety-six
 boys are reported as willing to pay a quarterly fee of 2s. 6d. for instruc-
 tion at the technical workshops dui-ing one half-day per week, whilst
 sixty-six boys are desirous of attending but are unable to pay the fee.

      ' That, inasmuch as technical education, including the use of wood and
 iron tools, is of as much importance to senior boys as needlewook and
 practical cookery are to girls, your memorialists respectfully urge the

 department to sanction elementary technical instruction as part of the
 recognised school course, and to allow payments for boys thus taught,

--either by inclusion of the subject as another specific Schedule IV. and

--Article 109 (g) or by making a grant similar to that now given for

--instruction in cookery Article 109 (h).

      ' Tour memorialists would beg your careful consideration of the con-
 firmatory evidence of the recent Royal Commissioners on Technical
 Education, who state in their second report (vol. i.) that they are
 satisfied that such manual work " is very beneficial as a part of the pre-
liminary education of boys in this country who are to be subsequently
engaged in industrial pursuits" (p. 524). "Your commissioners see no
reason why, since grants are made on needleA\-ork in girls' schools, they
should not be made on manual work in boys' schools " (p. 524), and recom-
mend " that proficiency in the use of tools for working in wood and iron

be paid for as a specific subject " (p. 537).'

      This memorial has been supported by the School Boards for London,
Birmingham, Gateshead, Huddersfield, Bristol, Swansea, Salford, Derby,
Norwich, and Ipswich.

     The same difficulty has been met with by the London Board in

regard- to its experiment in the use of tools, referred to in our last report,

though it appears to have given much satisfaction to the boys, their

parents, and the Board : it formed the subject of a question by Sir

Bemhard Samuelson in the House of Commons, and he has stated his

intention of bringing the matter forward again in some more definite

form.

     The earlier age at which children pass their standards in elementary
subjects is bringing to the front the question of those who, having passed
Standard VII., are willing to remain at school and take up higher
subjects. Under present arrangements no grant can be earned from the
Education Department for such children, and, although larger grants can
be earned from the Science and Art Department, it is a matter of doubt
282 KEPOKT-- 1886.

whethex' School Boards can legally expend in teaching such children any

sum beyond that of the fees and grants received. In the case of large

classes the income from these sources might be sufficient, but iu the

majority of  cases  this  cannot  be  secured                                             and  it  becomes a  matter  for
                                                                                       ;

consideration whether distinct sanction should not be given by the legis-

lature to incurring the necessary expenses for this purpose.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sidgwick, Professor

    FoxwELL, the Rev. W. Cunningham, and Professor Munro {Secre-

     tary), on the Regulation of Wages by means of Sliding Scales.

With the object of obtaining definite information on the working of

sliding scales, your Committee issued a circular to associations of
mine-owners and miners in different parts of the country asking for

detailed answers on certain aspects of sliding scales. Owing to various

causes, as yet only a few replies have been received. These replies are,
however, very valuable, as they clearly show that each scale has special
characteristics of its own, and that no comparison can be instituted be-
tween the various scales without taking into account the exact circum-
stances under which each scale was framed. For instance, in some

districts special allowances in the way of a free house and coal are made
to miners, whilst in other districts no such allowances are made. The
replies received by your Committee tend to show that in the last-men-
tioned districts the non-allowance of a free house and coal was taken
into account when the standard rates of wages were fixed, and thus an
apparent inequality in two scales is definitely explained.

    1. The original standards seem all to have been fixed on a common prin-

ciple, viz., to take the price of coal then realised, and the wages then paid,
as representing a fair and equitable division of the produce between the
mine-owner and the miner, and as giving as high a wage as the industry

could then afford. Some districts adopted the price of all coal sold,

other districts the price of all coal raised, as the standard price. All
the coal that is raised from a mine is not necessarily sold, as out of every
100 tons raised, about twenty tons are not available for the market, part

being refuse, part being consumed by the engines that work the mine,

and in some cases part going to the miners. No attempt was made to

reduce wages to a level, the wages payable at every mine being taken as
the standard wage. The real economic difficulty in framing the scale
began when it had to be determined what proportion of a rise or fall in

price should go to the men and what to the mine-owners. Both parties

contemplated a rise rather than a fall in prices, and the changed condi-
tions of the coal and iron industry have exposed the scales to some oppo-
sition, but their wise revision from time to time has maintained their
influence with both masters and men.

     2. (a) Free house and firing are usually given in addition to the
wages mentioned in the scales, and in Cumberland, where there are no
such allowances, compensation is given by the scale itself in the form of
higher rates.

    Apart from this, local considerations may add to or diminish the

standard wages. For instance, if the working of the mine becomes more
                                            --

ON THE REGULATION OF WAGES BY MEANS OF SLIDING SCALES. 283>

difficult an addition to the ordinary wages is usually conceded. The con-

cession of such addition may be given by the mine-owner himself, but

frequently it comes before the Committee or Board of Arbitration charged

with the carrying out of the scale, and to whom all disputes are referred.

(h) The miner bears the expenses of lamps, powder, and tools, such

as picks, shafts, sharping gear, &c. In South Wales this represents a

cost of from od. to Is. per week. In Cumberland it is estimated by the

miners as averaging 2^cl. per day, or taking 58^ working days for the

quarter, 125. 2^d. per quarter. The actual deduction from wages per ton

in respect of the above expenses at one colliery in Cumberland was, in

1875, as follows :--                                  d.

   .....March quarter                           069 per ton.
   .....June quarter
                                                0'90  ,,
    ....September quarter
    ....December quarter                        0'48  ,,

                                                0"48  ,,

In Cumberland the hewers voluntarily contribute one penny per week

towards the expenses of carrying on the sliding scale, such as the cost of
taking out the quarterly returns. The cost per ton to the hewers in this

respect for the year 1885 was as follows :

March quarter .     .. ..                             d.

                   ... ... ... ...              O'll per ton.

June quarter  ,                                 O'll ,,

September quarter                               0*10  ,,

December quarter                                0-09 ,,

     3. The difficulties in the way of basing a scale not merely on the

selling price, but on variable elements in the cost of production are

universally admitted ; but there is little doubt that when one trade
depends on another, variations in the cost of the raw material would
require to be taken into account in fixing wages. The coal trade has

escaped the difficulty owing to the royalties being fixed for a considerable
period of time. But were a sliding scale adopted in other trades it might
not be successful, unless the price of raw material were one of the
elements on which the division of the produce was made to depend.

--Further information on this important point is very desirable.
     4. Boyalfies. The principle of the sHding scale does not seem to have
been applied to royalties to any great extent, though in some mines the

landlord receives a certain proportion of the price as his royalty.

     The royalty paid varies from 4c7. to Is. per ton, averaging about 8d.
per ton. Hewers' wages vary from 7d. to 3s. per ton, though it must be
remembered that there are many classes of men other than hewers
employed about a mine.

     Inasmuch as several gentlemen have promised further valuable
information on the working of sliding scales, it is desirable that the
Committee be reappointed, and it is suggested that in view of the meeting
in Manchester next year their inquiries might be extended to the wagea

lists in the cotton industry.

Me'port of the Committee, consisting of Mr. H. W. Barlow, Sir F.

    J. Bramwell, Professor J. Thomson, Captain D. G-alton, INIr. B.

   Baker, Professor W. C. Unwin, Professor A. B. W. Kennedy, Mr.
    C. Barlow, Mr. A. T. Atchison (Secretary), and Professor H. S.
    Hele Shaw, for obtaining information ivith reference to the
    Endurance of Metals imder repeated and varying stresses, and
    the proper tvorking stresses on Raihvay Bridges and other

    structures subject to varying loads.

The Committee have to report that certain special experiments have

been undertaken by Sir J. Fowler and Mr. Benjamin Baker.
      As, however, these are not yet complete, and the most recent inves-

tigations into the question of the endurance of metals now being carried
on under the authority of the German Government have not yet

reached such a stage that results can be communicated, the Committee

request that they may be reappointed.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Garson, Mr. Pengelly,

     Mr. F. W. EuDLER, and Mr. G. W. Bloxam {Secretary), for

      investigating the Prehistoric Race in the Greek Islands.

The Committee beg to report that during the winter they have obtained
the services of Mr. Theodore Bent, a gentleman who has devoted much
time and attention to the study and investigation of Greek antiquities.
Mr. Bent and his wife spent several months in the Grecian Archipelago
last winter and spring, and during the time conducted researches for the
Committee at places which they visited. The Committee have much
satisfaction in expressing their indebtedness to Mr. and Mrs. Bent for
the valuable assistance they have rendered under somewhat difficult
circumstances. The work they have been able to do has been carried on

with the aid of the grant placed at the disposal of the Committee at the
Aberdeen Meeting of the Association, but this has been supplemented
by Mr. Bent himself, so that more work has been undertaken than would
have been possible with the grant alone. The result of excavations
in graves on Amorgos, Antiparos, Anaphi, and Astypaltea were similar to
those about which Mr. Bent read a paper at the last meeting of the
Association, consisting of numerous small marble figures, marble vases,
earthenware vases, and obsidian knives of the prehistoric period ; in
addition to these, a considerable number of skulls and bones were laid
aside to be sent with them, the value of the finds far exceeding the

outlay, judging by the price given by the British Museum for the things
brought home before by Mr. Bent. In addition to this some slight
excavations were made at the Temple of Apollo a.t Anaphi, and some few

trifling objects of the nellenic period were found.
     The Committee ask for reappointment with a renewal of the grant.

     Dr. Gr. M. Dawson, General Sir J. H. Lefroy, Dr. Daniel

    Wilson, Mr. E. Gr. Haliburton, and Mr. GtEOrge W. Bloxam

     (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of investigating and
    publishing reports on the physical characters, languages, and
    industrial and social condition of the North-western Tribes of
     the Dominion of Canada.

The Committee beg to report that during the past year an extensive

correspondence Las been carried on with representatives of the Hudson

Bay Company, missionaries, and others who are in constant contact with

the Indians, and that a large amount of material is gradually being

Acollected.  series of questions is in course of being drawn up, and it is

hoped that these will bring in much valuable information during the

winter. Mr. Horatio Hale has, unfortunately, been prevented from

making his promised visit to the Indian tribes duz-ing the past year, but

the Committee hope that next spring Mr. Hale will be able to carry out

his intention of visiting the North-West, and they have to acknowledge

their indebtedness to Mr. Hale for much of the information already

collected.

     Mr. R. G. Haliburton has promised to place at the disposal of the
Committee the replies of Canadian Indian agents, through the Indian

Department, to circulars sent to them by him in 1870 and 1871, and also
a statement of the Chief Factor of the Hudson Bay Company at Queen

Charlotte Island respecting the customs, beliefs, &c., of the Indians there.

     The Committee ask for reappointment.

or individual members of these willing to assist in the inquiries of any

of these three Committees could obtain full particulars on application to

                                                                        Feom Section D.

A letter was read from the Secretary of this Section transmitting a

recommendation that the subject of the preservation of the native plants

of this country should be brought under the notice of the Local Societies,

and deputing Professor W. Hillhouse to bring this subject before the

Delegates present at the Conference.

In accordance with the foregoing recommendation. Professor Hillhouse

gave numerous instances of the extermination of rare plants from certain

localities by dealers, to whom their habitat had become known. He stated

that, having been empowered by the Sectional Committee to represent

their views on this subject, he submitted the following protest:

   We' view with regret and indignation the more or less complete

extirpation of many of our rarest or most interesting native plants.

Recognising that this is a subject in which Local Societies of naturalists

will take great interest, and can exercise especial influence, we urge

upon the Delegates of Corresponding Societies the importance of extending

to plants a little of that protection which is already accorded by Legislature

to animals and prehistoric monuments, and of steadily discouraging and,

where possible, of preventing any undue removal of such plants from

their  natural  habitats                                                and  we  trust  that                             they  will  bring  these  views
                                                                     ;

under the notice of their respective Societies.'

                                      From Section H.

     The following recommendation from the Committee of this Section

--was read by the Secretary of the Conference :
     Racial Characters Committee.- -^ That Mr. Francis Galton, Dr. Beddoe,
Mr. Brabrook, Professor Cunningham, Professor Flower, Mr. J. Park

Harrison, Professor A. MacAlister, Dr. Muirhead, Mr. F. W. Rudler,

Professor Thane, and Dr. Garson (Secretary) be reappointed a Committee
 288 REPOKT-- 1886.

for the purpose of defining the Racial Characters of the Inhabitants of

the British Isles.'

     Dr. Garson, who attended the Conference on behalf of tlie Section,

explained the objects of this Committee, and invited the co-operation of

the Local Societies. He stated that particulars respecting the work of

this Committee would be obtained on application to himself at the Royal
College of Surgeons, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, W.C.

      It was then arranged : (1) That those gentlemen (or, if more con-
venient, the Chairman or the Secretary of the Committees they severally
represent) should communicate with each of the Delegates as soon as the
details of their proposed investigations had been matured. (2) That each
Delegate should thereupon do his best to interest the members of his
Society, and, if thought desirable, the Society itself, in the subject of
investigation, and should send to his correspondent the names and
addresses of such persons in his neighbourhood as might be likely to
render willing and effectual help, so as to put him at once in direct
communication with them.

     The Committee now beg to report that at their last meeting, held on

June 9, 49 applications from Local Societies for enrolment as Correspond-
ing Societies were considered, and of these 36 are recommended for
election. Twelve of last year's Corresponding Societies have not yet

applied for re-election, but, as this omission may have arisen from an

imperfect understanding of the rules, the Committee have communicated
with the Secretaries of these Societies in order to receive their explana-
tion. The list of selected Societies and the catalogue of their papers on
local subjects published since the last Report is appended.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors Armstrono and

    Lodge (/Secreto-ies), Sir Wii/LiAJi Thomson, Lord Ratleigh, Pro-
   fessors Schuster, Poynting, J. J. Thomson, Fitzgerald, Ceum
    Brown, Ramsay, Frankland, Tilden, Hartley, McLeod, Carey

   Foster, Roberts-Austen, Rucker, Reinold, and S. P. Thompson,
   Captain Abney, Drs. Gladstone, Hopkinson, and Fleming, and
   Messrs. W. N. Shaw, H. B. Dixon, J. T. Bottomley, W. Crookes,
   Shelford Bidwell, and 3. Larmor, appointed for the purpose of

  --considering the subject of Electrolysis in its Physical and Che-

    unical hearings. Edited by Oliver Lodge,

The members of the Committee have communicated with each other
by correspondence, and have individually undertaken the investigation of
various points more or less closely bearing on the subject, some of which
were specified by the present editor at the conclusion of a paper on
Electrolysis, printed in the annual volume for last year. (See page 765.)

     The sum of 20/. gi-auted to the Committee has been expended, partly
in providing chemicals and simple appliances for experiments, and partly
in printing and circulating various interim communications, to wit, letters
among the members and letters received from foreign philosophers.

     The work of the Committee is gi-eatly facilitated by being thus able
freely to communicate on matters of interest ; and, inasmuch as it is-
thought desirable to continue this practice, and also to experiment on
material of special purity, a somewhat larger grant is asked for this year.
Some of the woi'k undertaken by the members is only recently begun,
and not yet reported on, but that concerning which an account has been
communicated to the Committee is here appended, together with a few
abstracts and translations of foreign memoirs, which it seemed desirable to
bring together in an accessible form. (For Table of Contents, see p. 412.)

Sir William Thomson communicates to the Committee Mr. Thomas Gray's paper
' On the Electrolysis of Silver and of Copper, and the application of Electrolysis to
the Standardising; of Electric Current and Potential Meters,' as published in the
' Philosophical Magazine ' for November 1886 ; and remarks that it treats of ques-
tions referred to in the rest of the Report, especially to those raised by Mr. Shaw

in Table IV. on p. 325.

Professor Armstrong's paper ' On Electrolytic Conduction in relation to Molecular

Composition, Valency, and the Nature of Chemical Change : being an attempt to-
apply a theory of " llesidual Affinity," ' is published in the ' Proceedings of the
lloyal Society,' No. 243, 1886.

Professor McLeod's paper ' On the Electrolysis of Aqueous Solutions of Sulphuric

Acid, with special reference to the forms of oxygen obtained,' is to be found in
the ' Journal of the Chemical Society' for August 1886, vol. xlix.

Professor J. J. Thomson and Mr. Newall have been working at Cambridge on con-
duction through very bad conductors, such as olive oil, bisulphide of carbon, paraffin
oil, &c. They find that for electromotive forces up to 100 volts these conductors
obey Ohm's law. This result, they say, is interesting, since Quincke has lately proved
       --

       OIS ELECTROLYSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 309

that for very much greater forces tbese substances do not obey Ohm's law : the

departure from it being very marked. They also find that the conductivity is

Aimproved by raising the temperature.  full account of these experiments is to

be communicated to the Royal Society shortly.

On Continuity of Electric Conduction. By Dr. John Hopkinson, F.B.S.

Jn my experiments on residual charge I touched upon the second question in

Dr. Lodge's programme ('Is Ohm's law obeyed by very bad conductors?')/ and

pointed out that Ohm's law could be regarded as a limiting case of a more general

law of superposition. In the case of mechanical after-effects the law of super-

position does not hold even approximately. The fourth question (' Is there any

relation between optical opacity and electrolytic conductivity ? ') appears to me

to be very intimately associated with the fact that bodies which, if they conducted,

would be electrolysed do not follow Maxwell's law, whereas some other insulators

Mydo. own present impression is that an electrical displacement in glass may,

although continuous, be roughly divided into four successive stages. 1st. A. yield-

     Maxwell's laws are that /x" = K, and that transparent bodies must insulate.

They are true for mineral oils and solid paraffin ; not true for glass, Iceland spar,

Kand organic oils. Consider, for instance, light flint glass : is 67 for disturbances

whose period is longer than 10"^ second, and for these disturbances it behaves as

an insulator. It ought, therefore, for such waves to be transparent, and to have an
index 2-6. But, for disturbances of period about 10"'* second, its index, reckoned

for very long waves by extrapolation formula, comes out about 1 -5. Is there any

way of accounting for this discrepancy ? Yes perhaps by the known fact that on

waves between these two periods glass exercises a strong selective absorption, and

that this is usually accompanied by anomalous dispersion ; which at once renders

all empirical reasoning towards the state of things for very long waves, from the

observed condition for very short waves, utterly futile and misleading. Perhaps,

therefore. Maxwell's law is after all obeyed by these substances for long waves and

tliose electrolytes -wluch transmit radiation with the greatest facility, as evidenced

hy the effect produced upon a thermopile, are also the worst conductors of electri-

city. I may say at once that this was undoubtedly not the fact, and the relation

which was supposed to he possible does not exist.

Considerable time and care were bestowed upon the experiments, and every

precaution was taken with the view of ensuring accuracy. The thermopile used

was a dehcate one, containing 54 bismuth-antimony pairs ; it was enclosed in a

flannel-covered box, fitted with a pane of glass l-.Tmm. thick opposite the face of

the pile. Tbe galvanometer was an astatic reflecting instrument of ·645 ohm

resistance made by Elliott. The source of radiation was a small paraffin lamp,
having a glass chimney about 2 mm. thick.

The parallel glass sides of the cells, used to contain the hquids, were 13 mm.

Aapart, and 1'9 mm. in thickness.  screen, with a small aperture, which could be

instantly opened or closed by a sliding shutter, was interposed between the cell in.

use and the lamp. The various solutions were in every case exposed to radiation

for a period of 30 seconds, and each observation was checked and standardised by

the aid of a certain cell containing water. It is hardly necessary to describe the

arrangements and method of observation in greater detail.

   A few of the results, which, for the most part, need no comment, are given in

--the following table :

    The observations with sulphuric acid are the most instructive. It is well known

that the electrical conductivity of sulphuric acid at firist increases with the concentra-

tion, reaching a maximum when the strength of the solution is about 30 per cent.,
and afterwards rapidly diminishing. That there is no corresponding minimum

diathermancy appears clearly enough from the above table, which seems to furnish
a conclusive answer in the negative to the question proposed.

     The diathermancy of a solution of zinc sulphate was almost independent of its
streng-th, being nearly the same for a 5 per cent, as for a saturated solution. It
was quite unaftected by the passage through the solution of a strong battery

current.

   --Deae Sie, I have been much interested in your electrolysis memoir, and since

it seems intended to open a discussion, I beg to be allowed to express my views on

a few important questions there touched on, especially concerning wandering of

ions.

    As I have shown, and a little later also Bouty, one must regard all positive ions,

in extremely dilute solutions, as possessing nearly equal velocities ; and in the same

way also all negative elements as having an equally great velocity among themselves.

It is very probable that these two velocities are also equal to each other for those
salts which, by reason of excessive dilution, already approximate closely to the
ideal condition ; that is to say, the best conducting salts like KCl, NH^Cl, &c.,.
whose ions have nearly equal velocities.

     One could best represent the ions to oneself as spheres of about equal size-
(though of unequal weight) which are urged through a resisting medium with the
same force, and which very soon attain their terminal velocity. But if the motion

parture from equal velocities will arise. This departure is, nevertheless, so small

that it cannot be regarded as accurately established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 are  j_ ammed,  ^toget^.her,

conductivity of the given concentration. Thus arise double ' molecules, treble
molecules, and so forth. The electrolysis of a double molecule l^J^ occurs either
according to the scheme I + U., or according to the scheme I^J + J ; though indeed
the former occurs much the more often,

     To take an example : if all the molecules in a solution are double molecules,
then, according to the first alternative (if one assumes all ions to travel at thesame
pace, which is nearly correct), analysis will show that I remams quite still (i.e. it.
wanders equally in opposite dh'ections), and the whole motion is performed by J.^
According to the second alternative, one is led direct to the opposite result it

conditions can be represented. This is, I believe, the true cause of the so-called

--Dear Sir, ITianks for note and British Association circulars. Since you speak

of communicating something of my views to the Committee, I will/to avoid

mymymisunderstanding, just try in a few lines to explain
                                                            position. In            small

notice on the conductivity of gelatinous solutions, I am led to the view that internal

friction (viscosity) e.xerts no influence on conductivity. By experiments on the
conductivity of mixtures, with which I am now working, it appears, however, that

gelatinous solutions (and probably other pseudo-solutions) form an exception; since

for other (actual) solutions a very close relation exists between conductivity and

limpidity. It seems as if, when one adds to water a liquid, or in general any

foreign body (with the exception of all the best conducting salts), the limpidity of

the solution becomes less than that of pure water, no matter whether tlie limpidity

of the added body be less or greater thaji the water. It appears as though the

friction experienced by a molecule travelling through a liquid greatly depends on

the heterogeneity of the liquid. One could propel a water molecule more easily

through pure water than through water with which some other substance had been

Hmixed. But a water molecule consists of the ions and OH, and what is valid

for the wliole molecule must be valid also for a part of it. If this is correct, the

advance of an ion through a liquid whose molecules have this ion as a constituent

must be opposed by a smaller resistance (friction) than if the molecules of the

liquid had not, or only partly had, this ion as a constituent. This .serves as a sort

H OHof explanation of the greater velocity of the ions and              in aqueous solutions

in comparison with the velocity of other ions. I regard it as certain that the ions
H OHand
         travel quicker than other ions, which go at a pace pretty nearly equal

(not quite equal) among themselves. But the influence of heteroEreneity on the

internal friction and also on conductivity appears to diminish with increasing

temperature. So it is very possible, and indeed probable, that at some temperature,

higher than any hitherto employed in such observations, the ideal case might be

--reached when all ions should go at the same rate which would mean that at that

temperature all electrolytes, in extremely dilute solutions, should conduct equally

well just as           a  gas's obedience to  Boyle's  law  approaches  exactitude  at  low
                    ;

pressures and high temperatures.

This will probably be the tendency of the results of my not yet concluded

investigation on this interesting subject. It is impossible for me to give you the

experimental proof for the view above expressed, though I should have had much

pleasure in doing so. I should be obliged by your sending me the results and
report of the Committee, and on my side I will willingly, if you regard this as not

wholly without value, communicate to the Committee the results of my experiments
now being carried on.

Professor Ostwald is sending you some of his papers.

                 On the Accuracy of Ohm's Law in Electrolytes.
        By Professor G. F. Fitzgerald, F.B.S., and Mr. Teouton.

     Some preliminary experiments were begun in the spring of this year, and have
been carried on from time to time since, with a view to determining how far Ohm's
law may be relied on in the case of electrolytes.

     Though as j-et no very high limits of accuracy in the experiments have been
attained, owing to causes which will be later on explained, still it is hoped
that from the experience already gained most of the difficulties have been got over,
and that soon results of a much greater degree of accuracy wiU be arrived at.
        ON ELECTROLYSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 313

     The method adopted is that described in the British Association Report for
·Glasgow, 1876, which Professor Chrjstal, in connection with Clerk Maxwell, em-
ployed in the case of metal conductors, namely, that of a Wheatstone's bridge, two of
the arms of which are of about equal section and resistance, while the remaining
two, though of equal resistance, are of very diflerent sections. If Ohm's law be not
true, the point of balance of the bridge varies with the amount of current passing
through it. Balance haAing been obtained, the battery-power is altered, and if
balance still subsists, the deviation from Ohm's law, if there be any, is such as
cannot be detected with apparatus of the sensitivene.ss employed.

     The great difiiculty in experimenting in this way is that the change in the
current alters the temperature of the two arms of unequal section very differently,
and proportionately also their resistances. While the thick conductor alters little
in temperature, the thin one alters considerably. Thus the point of balance is
changed, even though Ohm's law be true. To avoid this eflect it is necessary,

having balanced with the large current, to immediately pass the smaller current

before the temperature can sensibly alter. As this requirement is practically im-

possible to satisfactorily fulfil, the method employed is a rapid alternation of a
large and small current. If Ohm's law be not true, a balance in this case can only
be apparent, and on reversing the direction of one of them, the two currents which

before neutralised each other's action now conspire to deflect the galvanometer.
The mode of experimenting is to find balance with a large and a small battery

alternately in circuit, and rapidly enough for the temperature during the smaller
current to be sensibly the same as while the larger one is acting, then to change
the direction of one of the currents and to again balance. The distance is observed
between the two points of balancing, but if the bridge still balances it is assumed
for the pui-poses of calculation that tlie distance is what the galvanometer employed

only just detects. From this, fi-om the two currents the section and resistance of
the tiiin conductor, h is calculated, where e = rc{\ - he"), as is explained in the above-

mentioned Report.
      The liquid, chosen for experimenting with, was a solution of copper sulphate in

-water. The equal arms consisted of two glass tubes bent at right angles at each

Aend, and B, arranged syphon-like, and contained the solution. They dipped

                          ^-^^f^2|3:

into a long narrow trough, as shown in the diagram. The arm of large section C,

Da tube 119 cm. long and 2-38 cm. in internal diameter, reached from the bowl
Ainto which the tube also dipped, to the bowl E. The small arm was a hole

·05.5 cm. in diameter, drilled in the side of the beaker F, '063 cm. in thickness, into

which the tube B dipped.

      The battery poles consisted of copper plates, one in the beaker, the other in the

bowl D. The contact breaker was a T piece worked by an electromagnet and cell
314 EEPOKT-- 1886.

K, as shown in the diagram. One of the batteries contained ten Grove cells, the

other five, and both could be thrown in circuit in either direction by means of the

Mreversing keys and N. By proper adjustment of the mercury cups P and Q one

of the batteries went in circuit, just as the dipper on the other side, coming out of

the mercury, threw the second battery out of circuit. By meaas of the galvano-

Hmeters and I it could be seen, during the course of an experiment, whether the

contacts were working properly or not.

One of the copper wires leading to the galvanometer dipped into the bowl E,

the other into the trough, and could be moved up and down it in order to obtain

balance, the distance moved being read off a scale along the trough. There was

always more or less of a permanent current through the galvanometer, even though

the poles were both of copper ; this especially, as it was liable to sudden changes in

amount, caused by moving the trough pole or by accidental shaking, necessitated

the employment of the galvanometer in a comparatively insensitive condition.

Various devices were tried with a view of avoiding this current, such as electro-

plating the poles, using chemically pure copper sulphate, or employing for poles

either end of a broken wire, so as to have, if possible, metallically like poles ; these

were found to give an indication of current even in distilled water.

The resistance of the smaller arm was about 800 ohms, but owing to its small-

Aness varied greatly with the current through the change of temperature.  good

deal of trouble was experienced through the resistance of the smaller arm at

times, being less when the current passed in one direction than when it passed in

the other. This occurred so often that imtil its cause was understood, and steps

thus could be taken to prevent it, there was little hope of completing the experi-

ments. After various attempts it was discovered to be due to the density of the

solution on the outside of the beaker in the Ixiwl being slightly different from

that inside, so that the density in the hole, and consequently its resistance, depended

on the direction of the current, the electric transfusion of the liquid always changing

direction with the current.

   A number of experiments were made of a more or less satisfactory nature ; in

all no difference in the position of balance was found on reversing one of the

batteries. Taking the difference then to be what the galvanometer would just

detect, h is calculated to be less than 10"*. This is, of course, very large. The

limit Professor Chrystal reached in his experiments with metal conductors was less

than 10-i2_

With a view to reaching a higher limit a smaller hole was next tried. It was

·017 cm. in diameter, di'illed in a plate of glass '022 cm. thick. Its resistance was

about 2700 ohms, so that a longer tube had to be used for the large arm. The

balance was always found to be very different when one of the batteries was

changed indirection. However, this was probably entirely due to the difference in

temperatm-e during the small and large currents, for /( calculated from this was

not even as small as in the first experiments ; also the difference between the

balance points varied with the speed of the contact breaker. Unfortunately the

contact breaker, which was adjustable in its rate of vibration, had reached its

limit of speed, so that a completely new arrangement has now to be employed.

                    By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, B.Sc.

     This is a preliminary note on a research begun with the view of elucidating
the question whether the conduction exhibited by various mineral ores and metallic
oxides and sulphides possessing quasi-metallic conductivity is or is not accompanied
by electrolysis. The substance selected, mag-netite or magnetic iron ore, is a
thoroughly good conductor, as is evidenced by the simple fact that if a piece of it
be interposed in the circuit of an ordinary electric bell the bell can be rung
through it.

     The sample selected was a fine homogeneous piece of ore from Arkansas, and
was reduced by the lapidary's wheel to parallelopipedal bar. Its total length waa -
5"53 centimetres, its breadth 1-52 centimetre, and its thickness 1'27 centimetre.

     The bar was placed between electrodes of platinum foil, which were clamped
against its end-faces by means of screws ; it was then placed in a bath of paraffin
oil, enabling it to be heated to any desired temperature up to 135° C.

     To test for electrolytic polarisation a current of about 1 ampere was passed
through it from three nitric acid cells for some minutes. On stopping the current
there appeared a slight polarisation, not, however, exceeding 00005 volt, and there-
fore of an order indicating a thermo-electric rather than an electro-chemical

origin.

     The specific resistance was then measured by observing the fall of potential
between two marked points, 3'22 centimetres apart, upon the bar, and comparing
this with the fall of potential between the two ends of a .standard resistance coil,
intercalated in the same circuit. The resistance was found to diminish very
remarkably as the temperature was raised. Observations were made at intervals
of from twenty to forty minutes apart, with the following result :

the conductivity of the mixture 1"972. Many such experiments were arranged,

and all showed the superiority of the second view. All the experiments discussed

Wein this paper also prove the soundness of this view.                                                                                                                                                  shall consequently adopt

this second view in what follows.

  --3. Fundamental fonnula. If two electrolytes (in dilute aqueous solution) are

mmixed in the proportion of : n, and if the conductivity of the one solution be a,

and that of the other h, then the conductivity of the mixture will be '"" "*" if the

                                                                       m+n

solutions suffer no change in the mixing. This formula is the mathematical ex-

pression of the idea that the conductivity depends solely upon the number of

electrolytic (active) molecules per unit volume, and ou the friction of the ions

in the solvent. This friction undergoes no appreciable change iu very dilute

solutions.

   --When4. Consequences of the interchange of xoater in the mixture of solutions.

hydrochloric acid solution is diluted, the number of electrolytic molecules increases

but very little :' for the sake of simplicity we may assume that the number does

not increase at all. When, however, a solution of «cef^c acid is diluted, the number

of electrolytic molecules is considerably increased {e.tj., by dilution to twice the

Whenvolume, from a standard solution, the increase is in tlie ratio of 1-51 : 1).

therefore solutions of hydrochloric acid and acetic acid are mixed, the conductivity

will be greater than the above formula shows, if water is transferred from the

hydrochloric acid to the acetic acid solution, and vice versa. In general when

solutions of a stronger and a weaker acid are mixed, and the weaker acid takes

water from the stronger, the conductivity will be greater than that given by the

formula ; and conversely if the stronger acid takes the water of solution from the
Aweaker.
          formula for this phenomenon is easily deduced; it shows that if the

above consideration is valid the conductivities of the original solutions must not be

very widely different; it likewise shows that the greatest deviations from the

formula occur when the solutions are mixed iu equal quantities.

   --5. Isohydric solutions. If a given solution of an acid be mixed in equal volumes

with solutions of another (stronger) acid of different degrees of concentration it is

found that the above formula is applicable for a certain degree of concentration.

For greater concentration negative deviations will be found, and on the other hand

for  less concentration positive deviations                                                                                                                                                      according to the explanation  given
                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

above, that solution of the second stronger acid, which possesses the particular

degree of concentration, is of such a nature that it neither takes away water from

the first solution nor gives any up to it when the two are mixed. On this ground

I call two such solutions of diiierent acids relatively isohydric. I have defined the

concentrations of the solutions by their conductivities.

     The experimental method for the determination of the conductivity of isohydric

solutions will be most easily explained by means of an example.

      This proved to be the case. Phosphoric acid (223-7) and hydrochloric acid
(167-4) were mixed iu the ratios 3:1,2:2, and 1:3; oxalic acid (4-947) and acetic

more concentrated than normal ones have not been investigated.

     Further considerations, which cannot here be given, show that if the con-

ductivity of a mixture of acids is calculated on the assumption that solutions of
equal conductivity are isohydric, the probable error amounts to 1 p.c. : being
rather greater if the strengths of the acids are very different, and less if they are

--nearly equal.
     0. Supplementary remarhs. The different bases have also been examined in a

perfectly similar manner. The results obtained are strictly analogous, including

the equality of the conductivities of isohydric solutions. But the carbonic acid

of the air had produced a disturbing effect to such an extent that the numbers

are too uncertain for publication. I have also found that acetic acid (^1*166) is

isohydric with ammonium acetate (0'469). The ratio of the conductivities of the
two (2'48o : 1 ) is nearly the same as the ratio of the maximum values of the con-

ductivities of acids and salts (2-83 : 1 according to Kohlrausch). This seems to

point to the conclusion that an electrolytic or active molecule of an acid, in

water, at ordinary temperature conducts 2-83 times as well as an electrolytic

molecule of a salt ; and not that in extreme dilution the acids are any more loosely

combined (' disagregirt ') than the salts. This arises probably from a smaller fric-
H OHtion of the ion of the acid (probably also of the
                                                         of the bases) with respect

to the water, in which it also occurs as an ion, than occurs with the other ions.

This difference might disappear at higher temperatures.

From the hypothesis that the different electrolytes divide the water between

them, there arise relations which promise to explain some very curious phenomena.

If for example a weak acid or base and a neutral salt are dissolved in water,

isohydric solutions will be formed in which tlie weak acid or base will get extremely

little water. In consequence, its molecular conductivity, and accordingly the

number of active molecules, will be very considerably diminished. I anticipated

this on other grounds in my paper of 1884,' and endeavoured in that way to

explain that the weak acids prove to be much weaker on mixing with bases than

they are for the same concentration when no other bodies ai-e in the same solution.

Tlie same hypothesis may also explain the great depreciation of strength of weak

acids when neutral salts are present, as calculated from the rapidity of reactions,-
and of the weaker bases in saponification reactions. I am still engaged upon the

solution of similar questions.

·On the Verification of Faraday's Laiv of Electrolysis with reference to Silver

                        and Copper. By W. N. Shaw, M.A.

Since the time of Faraday his law of electrolysis has not been subjected to any

Tery extensive experimental investigations. A. summary of the results obtained is

o-iven in the article on Electrolysis in the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica.' The most

accurate verification appears to have been conducted by Soret, who attributes to the

law an accuracy of 0-2 per cent, for copper and silver. Buff" used different currents

and found the law verified by experiment to about 1 per cent., but the general im-

pression has been that the law was only true to a somewhat rough approximation.

A practical acquaintance with the behaviour of an electrolytic cell of copper

sulphate shows that it is not necessnry to attribute the defect from the theoretical

value of the chemical equivalent obtained in that way to the failure of Faraday's
law. In depositing copper upon a copper plate it may often be observ-ed that small

but brilliant red crystals are formed on the deposit. These crystals under the

microscope are very beautiful ; they may probably be regarded as a suboxide of
Acopper formed by the action of the copper on the solution.
                                                             purple coloration

is, moreover, often formed on the cathode, and this is possibly due to the presence of

the same compound of copper. This secondary action produces, of course, a differ-

ence in the weight of the deposit formed, and the true amount of electricity which

has passed cannot be inferred either from the weight of the copper with the compound

or from the weight of copper remaining when the crystals have been removed.

     Further, it is well known that a copper plate when immersed in a solution of
copper sulphate, without any current, pives rise to some chemical action which
causes the copper plate to alter iu weight. The alteration may he in the direc-
tion either of increase or of decrease of the weight, the effect depending upon the

state of the plate and the state of the solution.
      In considering the increase in weight of a copper cathode in an electrolytic cell

we cannot without definite experimental reasons neglect to consider the possibility

of both these actions occm-ring together, and, moreover, the passage of the current

may produce complicated results which cannot be inferred from the action of the
solution in the cell under other conditions. Dr. Gore has made very numerous

experiments upon this subject, without, however, arriving at any very satisfactory

result.

     Tn view of the importance of the subject, a very large number of experiments

have been made at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge under my direction

during the past two years. They may be divided into two groups. (A). Experi-
ments to ascertain whether two copper cells give the same amount of deposit for

the same current; and (B). Experiments to determine whether a copper cell can
be arranged so that, on comparison with a silver cell, within sufficiently wide
limits of current it will give a value of the chemical equivalent of copper agree-
ing with that obtained by chemical methods.

                             A. Experiments on Copper Cells only.

      These experiments consisted in arranging pairs of copper cells with various
electrodes, as copper plates, copper wires, copper cylinders having wire connections,
platinum wires, in order to ascertain whether the disturbing actions were limited
to the surface. The results were very irregular and disappointing. Errors
amounting frequently to more than 1 per cent, occurred without any assignable

cause.

     The same is all that can be said about experiments with different solutions of
sulphate, including solutions from which air had been expelled by boiling, the experi-
ments being then conducted under the receiver of an air-pump. Endeavours to
allow for the differences of the cathode weighings, by supplementary experiments
on the effect of the solution upon plates not connected with the electrodes, have
likewise proved fruitless. The enumeration of these experiments would serve no

practical pui-pose, as they lead to no generalisation ; I shall therefore pass over them.

       B. Experiments on the Comparison of Silver and Copper Cells.

      One of the most disagreeable features of the experiments refeiTed to in the
preceding section was that when two cells were compared, and^ a difference in the
increase of weight of the cathodes was obtained, it was impossible to say whether
 either or both of the two cells was at fault, and it was therefore decided to employ
 a silver cell as a standard. Lord Rayleigh was at the time engaged on his experi-
 ments upon absolute value of the electro-chemical equivalent of silver, and had
 not yet arrived at a result. Experiments were therefore made to obtain a silver
 cell that might be fairly regarded as a standard. The only difficulty in the way
 was that the deposit of silver from pure nitrate is crystalline and very rough. The
 deposit was taken upon a platinum crucible, and it was feared that error might
 arise, either from mechanical loss of the silver during the operation of drying, or
 from the retention by the deposit of water, or salt in solution. Attempts were
 therefore made to use as electrolyte (1) a solution of chloride of silver in hypo-

 sulphite of silver, (2) a solution of nitrate of silver containing glycerine, (3) a
 solution of nitrate of silver containing acetate of silver. The deposits obtained with

 all these are much closer and harder, but the hyposulphite solution is very unstable,
 and a current beyond a certain density precipitates a black sulphide which destroyss
 the experiment. The other solutions were also discarded after consultation with
 Lord Rayleigh, who had then shown that a 15 per cent, solution of pure nitrate

 gave a perfectly satisfactory silver cell if proper precautions were taken with the
                         --

drying, whereas the solutions containing organic salts were liable to serious
error, probably in consequence of the inclusion of the solution in the pores of the

deposit.

     It was originally intended to use only those experiments from which the loss of
the anode was obtained equal to the gain of the cathode. It was found, however,
that the possibility of weighing tlie loss of tlie anode was simply fortuitous, the action
of the solution upon the silver always producing a sort of honeycomb formation,
and ultimately leaving smaller particles which fell off in washing. This was the
case even when a silver crucible was used as the anode. It was therefore decided
to use the gain of the cathode only. The form of silver cell adopted is that of
Poggendorft"s voltameter in which a platinum crucible standing on a copper plate

His the cathode and a silver rod the anode. The crucibles were about inch in

diameter and 2 inches high, and the silver rod forming the anode was about half
an inch in diameter.

     The method of drying the deposit was to wash in distilled water by filling up
the crucible several times and allowing it to stand for some time, then after
thoroughly rin.sing, to wash it out with alcohol and di'y in a hot air-bath at about

260° C.

    As the crucibles were very different in size from those used by Lord Rayleigh
some experiments were made to determine their behaviour.

     The following are the results :

would make the observations fairly comparalile. This may fairly be applied, since

the disturbing causes I have mentioned depend upon the current-density.

     In order to put this to the test, I have assumed in the first place that the

action upon the deposit may be represented by an expression of the same form as

would be required to represent the action of the solvent upon a wire immersed in

the solution without any current. This we may take to be, for the comparatively

short times of the experiments, a case of solution going on at a constant rate,

and proportional to the area exposed. Thus if d be the actual loss of copper in an
experiment "when the area exposed is A, and the time t, we shall take

                                              8 = kM,

and shall investigate whether a constant value of k can be taken to bring the observa-

tions into agreement.  It is easily seen that this is equivalent to  S  =  k'  where  e

is the total amount of copper deposited during the experiment, and d the current-
density ; and where k is also constant, but numerically different from k. In words

we may express this by saying that the fractional correction is inversely pro-

portional to the current-density.

     It is difficult to settle what value to assume for k'. If k' he a true constant,
its value can of course be calculated from any pair of observed results ; but the
magnitude of possible experimental errors, in comparison with that of the quantity
under consideration, makes it highly improbable that the results would be at all
concordant. It will at any rate be well, in order to avoid a possible error in the
weighing of the silver, to use observations belonging to the same experiment for
determining the value of k'. I have determined the values of k' for several pairs
of observations, taken somewhat at random, with the follo^wing results :

value of the chemical equivalent of copper can be assigned with greater accuracy than

appears at present to be practicable. AVe may, however, notice that the value 3-4086

is that which would be obtained with comparatively very small current-densities,

and occupies a place in the middle of a continuous series, and there seems to be no

reason in the electrolytic behaviour of the cells for accepting that value as indicat-

Weing a limiting result.  may therefore fairly approach tlie question the other

way, and, using the observations to calculate the chemical equivalent of copper by

Faraday's law, consider the results which follow. If we assume, as we seem fairly

entitled to do, that the differences of the weights for different current-densities are

due to the solution of the deposited copper, it follows (assuming Faraday's law)

that we must get a nearer approximation to the true amount of copper equi\alent

to the amount of silver deposited the greater the current-density. The value would

be affected by the correction discussed above ; but it has been already stated that it

is unsafe to apply the correction, or, at any rate, to assign to the value that of k'

assigned above. But the consideration of that correction serves us to this extent,

viz., to show that for current-densities above -02 its value must be very small in-

deed, reaching, as a matter of fact, with the value of k = -00002, to less than one

milligramme per gramme. But in determining by Faraday's law as accurately as

possible the chemical equivalent of copper from that of silver, the correction cannot

be disregarded without sufficient reasons. Some reasons for that course have been

given, but in order to test further whether or not the correction should be applied

I have plotted the observations on sectional paper, taking as ordinates the ratios of

copper to silver, and as abscissae the reciprocals of current-densities. If the cor-

rection should be applied throughout, the grouping of the observations should show

a straight line inclined to the axis of current-densities. I have adopted this

method of combining the observations belonging to different experiments for this

purpose, in preference to the arithmetical one of taking means, because the latter

is liable to be seriously affected by a set of observations, each one of which is far
from the mean in the same direction, but which does not extend throughout the

whole range. In the estimation by eye of a mean result of plotted observations

allowance can be made for the effect such observations produce, wliereas they may

give a false appearance of general law to a set of arithmetical means.

    The observations included in the Table II. when plotted do not give any in-
dication of the divergence of the mean ordinates from a straight line parallel to the

axis of reciprocals of current-densities until the current-density is less than -02,
and the straight line passing through the ' centre of gravity ' of the group of ob-

servations for highest current-densities, and inclined to the axis with the angle
given by the value k' = -000025, would leave all the rest of the observations except

three on one side of it : but a very fair result is obtained if the value of k' be some-
what reduced, and the line be drawn at the corresponding less inclination through

the point corresponding to the ' centre of gravity ' of observations about the current-

density -02. If we must take a straight line inclined to the axis as representing

the results, the one which must be selected has an inclination to the axis of about
one-half that given by k' = -000025, and even that leaves on one side of it nearly
the whole group of observations whose current-densities have reciprocals between
60 and 30. Further, the values of the ratios obtained from the observations for

current-densities above -02 are remarkably close, except in two instances; in one
the ratio is very high, with a high current-density, and differs widely from other

obsei-vations at about the same current-density ; the other is very low, and belongs
to an experiment which gives a series of very low values ; this has been rejected
because the wire which gave it was marked in the note-book as ' discoloured,' i.e.

oxidised, at the time of weighing.

  In order, therefore,  to obtain the  value  of the  chemical  equivalent  by

_

this method, I have taken all the values obtained for current-densities greater

than -025 ampere per square centimetre. They are included in the following

table :

On the application of Alternating Currents to the Determination of the
    Conductivity of Electrolytes. By T. C. Fitzpatkick, Scholar of Christ's

     College, Camiridge. (Communicated hy "W. N. Shaw.)

     The work described in this paper was undertaken with the view of testing the-
method of the alternate current as appUed to the measurement of tlie resistance-
and conductivity of electrolytes.

     This method was first employed by Kohlrausch and Nippoldt in 1869, and an
account of their work and their justification of the method is found in Poggendorff's
' Annalen,' cxxxvi. They found that above a certain rate of alternation of the^

current the electrolytic cell could be replaced by a metallic resistance, and that the

value of this replaced resistance did not alter on increasing the rate of alternation.

    Two things they considered were necessary for the complete removal of the

polarisation effects :

    A(ft) sufficient rate of alternation.

     (b) Electrodes of considerable area ; small platinised platinum electrodes wer&
afterwards found to answer perfectly well.

     The alternate current was produced by a sine inductor, and as indicator they
employed a dynamometer.

In the October number of the ' Annalen ' for last year there is a long paper on

Kohlrausch's most recent work                                                                                                                                                the method  is  the                                           same  as  that employed  in  the
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

earlier worJi, only the dynamometer is replaced by a telephone as indicator.

   A modification of this method was used by Ewing and Macgregor. They em-

ployed the Wheatstone bridge arrangement, the current being alternated by a
rocker. They do not, however, appear to have obtained any satisfactory results.^

    More recently Macgregor has replaced the rocker by a double commutator. By

one half of the commutator the alternate current has been produced and by the

other the current of the galvanometer circuit has been redirected, so that through

the galvanometer there is a direct but intermittent current. It is a method similar

to this latter that I have employed.

    My commutator, which was very carefully made by the Camln-idge Scientific

Instrument Company, consists of a drum, on the two faces of which are eight

sectors of brass   separated by strips                                                                                                                                       of ebonite                                                    the alternate sectors are    con-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

nected with two brass rings on the spindle of the commutator. The only difference

between the two faces of the drum is that on the one side the sectors are smaller,

and the ebonite pieces bigger. This is to permit of the galvanometer circuit being

broken before the battery circuit, and made after it.
     The two rings on the one side of the commutator are connected by brushes

with the poles of the battery, and two brushes carry off' alternate currents from the
face of the drum to the two points on the Wheatstone bridge. The brushes are

kept firmly pressed in contact by springs.
     The two points in the bridge for the galvanometer are connected with two

be judged. Of course this plan is open to the self-induction objection to which

galvanometer is a Thomson reflecting galvanometer, only the light mirror has

been replaced by a piece of mirror-glass, which is loaded ^\Tith several lead discs,

and to the back'is fixed a small magnet. The magnet has thus a considerable time
of swing, and was found to answer much better than the usual light needle. The

resistance of the galvanometer was about 268'8 ohms.

    Two different cells were employed to hold the electrolyte. The first was similar

to that of Kohlrausch--a strong glass beaker, in which the electrodes were kept in

--fixed relative positions by two small glass plates a thermometer was inserted be-

tween the two plates to register the temperature.

Kohlrausch, to determiue the resistance-capacity of his cell, measured its re-

sistance when filled with pure mercury ; ' but he does not mention his having taken

any precautions as to the difficulty of getting a good contact between his platinum

plates and the mercury. Recent observers have stated that there remains a film
of air between the platinum and the mercury, and that to get good contact the
cell should be fiUed under greatly reduced pressure ; and even then I have found

tliat the resistance may vary. I have therefore not employed mercury to deter-

mymine the resistance capacity of  cell, but a standard solution of copper sulphate,,

the absolute values of which I determined by means of my other cell.

This consists of a glass tube of considerable cross-section which fits into two

glass end-pieces; the tube has been ground so as to enter about an inch into

the end -pieces. This apparatus was made for me by Messrs. Powell, of Whitefriara
Glass Works, and possesses the advantage of being entirely of glass, without any

corks, &c. And the electrodes were firmly pressed against the ends of the tube,,

and so the resistance of a given column of the solution determined.
     For electrodes, in the first instance, copper plates were platinised. For a long

time no satisfactory method of platinising could be found ; that which gave the

best results was the electrolysis of a solution of platinum chloride and nitric acid :

the deposit thus obtained was fairly adhesive.

It was finally found best to obtain some platinum electrodes, and for this

purpose two platinum shoes were made by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey, into
which fitted thick copper plates ; thus a strong electrode of small resistance was

obtained without the expense of thick platinum plates ; these plates were slightly

platinised as a))ove described.

     In the earlv experiments with this method no satisfactory results could be

obtained. When the electrolytic cell was introduced into the fourth arm of the

Wheatstone bridge, sometimes the galvanometer would not give any steady
deflection, and it was impossible to get a balance. This was similar to Mac-
gregor's experience ; he states that by introducing another cell into one of the

other arms of the bridge he readily obtained a steady deiiection. In my own

case this did not in the slightest diminish the effect ; even with a metallic resist-

ance in the fourth arm of the bridge the same value could not be obtained as when

the commutator was not working.
     Under these circumstances it became necessary to thoroughly investigate the

action of the commutator. At first the commutator had been lubricated with a

small quantity of oil ; this was found to be partly the cause of the effects observed,^

and it was consequently thoroughly cleaned from all oil.
     It was also found that the commutator did not run perfectly steadily ; the com-

mutator and its stand were therefore firmly fixed in position with wooden props,
and driven by a water-engine, which was supplied with water from a tank at the

top of the building, and thus a constant and steady speed was obtained.
     Finally, as above described, the light needle of the galvanometer was replaced

by one with a longer time of swing.

     ' m>te hy Professor Kohlrausch, in a letter to the Editor.--' This is an error. I filled
the cell with zinc-sulphate solution, whose resistance had been measured in the form

of a cylindrical column.'

     With these alterations it was found that the galvanometer gave a steady
deflection, and the method appeared to be satisfactory.

     This residt having been obtained, the apparatus was tested for induction effects.
For this purpose a metallic resistance was introduced into the fourth arm of tlie
bridge, and its value determined when the commutator was not working ; the value
obtained was

                                R = 19-91 legal ohms.

With the commutator working at varying rates of speed, the value remained

the same, and was not altered by changing the battery power from that of

2 Ijeclanche cells to a tray of 10 Daniells. This seemed satisfactorily to show

that there was no induction effect, though the sensitiveness of the galvanometer

was diminished.

The diminution in the sensitiveness of the galvanometer when the commutator

was working may be seen from the following series of observations.

The above metallic resistance being in the fourth arm of the bridge, a balance

was obtained when the value of the resistance of the third arm was 1991, the value

of the other two arms being 1000 and 10 respectively.

    Hence the sensitiveness of the galvanometer is decreased by about f when the com-

mutator is working, though the rate of driving did not appear to afl'ect the sensitive-

ness. The apparatus was then tested for polarisation efl'ects. For this purpose the

two wires leading from the commutator to the battery circuit were connected with

the galvanometer and an electrolytic cell with platinum plates containing copper

sulphate                                     the  commutator was started and the circuit  completed, the                               battery  con-
                                          ;

sisting of 2 Leclanche cells ; the commutator was allowed to run for two hours and

a half, the rate of alternation being about 120 per                                 second                                    at  the end of this" time

the circuit was broken, and the platinum plates washed, treated with ho.t nitric

acid, and ammonia added after neutralisation with ammonia carbonate. There

was not, however, a trace of blue coloration ; it was therefore clear that no
copper had been deposited on either plate, and that there was no cumulative

polarisation effect.

This test was again repeated, the platinum plates being replaced by platinum

wires, and the Leclanche cells by a tray of lO Daniells ; the commutator was
allowed to work for over three hours at the same rate of 120 alternations per
second. At the end of this time the wires were treated similarly to the plates,

but with the same result. This latter was a more severe test, and would tend to

show that the method may be expected to be free from all polarisation effects, and

to give satisfactory results.

So far therefore this method seems perfectly satisfactory, and with the arrange-

ments as above described I have not found it in the least necessary to have a

second cell in the bridge, as did Macgregor.

I find that the steadiness of the galvanometer depends

(1) On the commutator being perfectly clean.
(2) On the commutator being driven at a steady speed, though permanent

alteration in the rate of speed does not affect it.

     Having thoroughly tested the method for polarisation and induction, I pro-
ceeded to examine into the question of contact resistance, a subject which has been
            ----                                     --

ON ELECTKOLTSIS IN ITS PHTt>ICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. . 331

raised lately by Dr. Gore, several papers on the subject being published in the

' Philosophical Mag'azine ' for this year.

     It seemed that if there was such an eft'ect as contact resistance it was impos-
sible to obtain the absolute values for the conductivities and resistances of different
solutions, and that before proceeding to the measurement of these quantities it

was necessary to test for contact resistance.

myFor this purpose I filled one of  cells with copper sulphate solution, and

determined its resistance value with diderent pairs of electrodes.

These were

      (rt) Platinum plates (slightly platinised).
      (b) Platinised copper electrodes.
     (c) Amalgamated copper electrodes, or copper electrodes with freshly deposited

copper surface.

     I found that the amalgamated copper electrodes left in a solution of copper
sulphate became coated with a film of copper, mercury apparently going into
solution ; this of course was only to be expected from the chemical ideas of mass

action.

     The values obtained were

(«) Platinum electrodes, 469-2 at ]6'9°.
(6) Platinised copper, 469 at 17°.
(c) Copper electrodes, 471 '95 at 16-7°.

     These same copper electrodes gave after standing in air or copper sulphate

solution a value much bigger than that of the platinum plates.
     Another pair of copper plates, which had been prepared some days, gave the

values with a different copper sulphate solution of

(1) Copper plates,  R - 477 at 17-6°.

(2) Platinum plates. Pi = 465 at 17-4°.

R(3) Platinised copper, = 465 at 17-4°.

     It appears therefore that the platinum and platinised copper plates give iden-
tical values, and it would appear that the value given by copper electrodes with a
fresh metallic surface is almost the same ; but that, due to oxidation in air or in

the solution, the surface is changed, and as a consequence the resistance value much

increased.

     This would tend to show that with clean metallic surfaces, and the same solu-
tion, the resistance value is the same, and that there is no contact resistance, or at
least that it is the same in aU three cases. To further examine this question I
determined to experiment with a solution of zinc sulphate with

(1) Platinum plates.
(2) Amalgamated zinc electrodes.

mTwo zinc plates were freshly amalgamated, and left over night standing         a

solution of zinc sulphate, and when introduced into the cell they gave a value

                    RX4 = ib5li2Z aitl6-4°.

The platinum electrodes gave the value

                              R = 280 at:16-5°.

After again standing in the zinc sulphate solution the value for zinc plates was

                              R = 318at 16 5°.

     These same electrodes were then washed with dilute sulphuric acid, to dissolve
off the film of zinc or oxide, and after careful washing were introduced into the

cell ; the value now came down to

                                 R = 286 at 16-5°.

     In this case too it would appear that with a pure metallic surface the resistance
value would be the same, whatever the electrodes used.
332 REPORT-- 1886.

     Such being the case, it becomes very necessary, in the determination of the

conductivity of electrolytes, to take account of the character of the electrodes,

and at the same time the above observation would point to the fact that with

pure metallic surfaces the effect of contact resistance is constant, if it occurs at all.

     Again to fiu-ther test this point, the absolute value of a certain copper sulphate
solution was determined by employing two distinct cells.

     (1) Cell A, the tube of this cell had a length of 31*4 cm., its mean section

being 10-66 square cm.

     The copper sulphate solution placed in this cell gave a resistance value of
.504-5 legal ohms at 18-1°.

     (2) Cell B, the tube of this cell had a length of 24-16 cm. and a mean section

of 13-21 square centimetres.

     The copper sulphate solution placed in this cell gave the value 306-9 legal
ohms at 18°.

     The same platinum electrodes were used in both cases.
     The values obtained for the resistance of a cubic centimetre of the copper sul-
phate solution differed by about 2 per cent.

   AThe values being, with cell

BWith cell  11 = 171-2 legal ohms.
            11 = 167-8 legal ohms.

     These results woidd again tend to show that there is no effect due to contact

resistance.

     Another point, which seemed of importance, was the action of the solvent in the
conductivity of electrolytes ; and, with the view of experimenting on this subject,
solutions were prepared containing the same salt, whilst the solvents were different.

     In the first place equal quantities of copper sulphate were dissolved in distilled
water and in glycerine, the resistance of the two solvents having been previously
determined.

     (1) The resistance of 500 cm. of water introduced into the cell gave a resist-

Rance of = 12,780 legal ohms ; in this water was dissolved 6-625 gms. of hydrated
Rcopper sulphate ; the resistance value was now = 8-87 legal ohms at 17-2°.

     (2) The glycerine, which was not pure, gave the value

                              R= 181,000 legal ohms.

In this was dissolved 6*625 gms. of hydrated copper sulphate, and the resulting
value was

                                R = 27,850 at 16-8°,

From these results the conductivity of a solution would appear to a large extent,
and in fact mainly, to depend on the solvent employed. The comparison of solu-
tions of copper sulphate in water and glycerine was not, however, continued, as

there appears to be some slight chemical action whereby a very small quantity of
copper oxide is precipitated ; and hence it was thought that this would not be
allowed perhaps to be a case of solution similar to that of the copper sulphate iu

water.

     The case, however, of solutions of calcium chloride in water and absolute
alcohol appeared to be iu every way comparable, as a definite crystalline compound
of calciimi chloride and alcohol exists similar to the hydrated crystalline chloride.
For this purpose equal quantities (i of a gramme-equivalent) of pure anhydrous
calcium chloride were dissolved in 500 ccm. of water, and also in 500 cc. of
absolute alcohol (sp. gr. -795), the resistance of the alcohol and also of the water
having been previously determined. Then by dilution solutions were prepared of
250 cc, containing ^^, i, ^, &c., of a gramme-equivalent of the salt in 500 cc. of

the solvent.

    Two series of values were thus obtained for solutions of different dilutions in
both alcohol and water, wherein we can compare the action of the two solvents.'

' In each case 250 ccm. of solution was introduced into the cell.

increases, to a limiting' value ; the temperature coefficient beiuj; the same, within

narrow limits, for all neutral salts.
     In his previous investigations Kohlrausch had determined the specific conduc-

tivities of solutions of varying strength, from saturation dov,ii to a few per cents.,
and from observations thus obtained had deduced the conductivity in more dilute
solutions by extrapolation. In the present memoir he verifies and corrects the
results thus obtained by the employment of solutions whose strengths vary from
1-0 to O-OOOOl gramme-equivalents per litre. (The strength thus estimated is

termed the ' molecular content.')
     In measuring the resistances a Wheatstone bridge is used, with alternating

cuiTents and a telephone as indicator (the paper deals at some length with the
advantages and difficidties of this method) ; the specific conductivities are expressed
in terms of that of mercury, and calculated for a uniform temperature of 18° C.

In working up the results the conception of 'specific molecular conductivity' is

employed, this being defined as the ratio kjm of the specific conductivity k of the

solution to the molecular content m. As the specific molecular conductivities are

all very small, Kohlrausch tabulates the values of 10** . ki'm, instead of kjin simplj'.
The values of this ratio are exhibited graphically, by plotting in a curve, with 7nh as

abscissa, this quantity being chosen because it expresses ' the reciprocal of the mean
distance, or, in other words, the mean relative pruximity of the molecules ' i.e., the

magnitude on which the specific molecular conductivity is most directly dependent.

The material thus obtained is amply sufficient to verify the three statements

above mentioned, the very important law of independent migration in particular
i"eceiving a full confirmation. In addition a large number of interesting relations

disclosed themselves, which may be summarised as follows:

1. If the solution be sufficiently dilute the specific molecular conductivity A-/;«

is, for all neutral salts, independent of the strength of the solution, or each mole-

cule conducts the current independently of every other. In other words, the

specific molecular conductivity has a limiting value. These limiting values are not

the same for aU salts, or even for those of  the same base or  acid                    their  magnitude
                                                                                    ;

depends on the nature of both ions.

2. The velocity with which the ions move past each other in extremely dilute

solution, under an electromotive force of 1 volt per linear millimetre, is determined

in millimetres per second by multiplying the specific molecular conductivity of the
electrolyte by 11000^ (or Kohlrausch's tabulated numbers by 0-00011). The

numbers thus obtamed for the various salts examined all he between 0'14 and

O'lO mmjsec.

     3. The specific molecvdar conductivity of a salt in dilute solution being propor-
tional to the sum of the velocities of the separated ions, the values of these absolute

velocities may, as Kohlrausch had shown previously, be determined from the ex-
periments in the following way :

   KLet i«i and ?;j be the absolute velocities of and CI, !/, and v.^ those of Na and

Br ; then the

Specific molecular conductivity, kjm, of KCl = (u^ + r,)/11000

                                                ,, NaCl=(M,, + Vi)/11000

                                          ,, KBr = (w>«..)/11000

                  ,, ,, ,, NaBr = (M2-n'.,)/11000

and so on ; hence the conductivities of KCl, NaCl, KBr, and NaBr, contain all that
is necessary for determining the absolute velocities of K, Na, CI, and Br; since the
ratios ujv^, u.^jv.., &c., are known from Hittorf 's migration experiments.

    4. As the strength of the solution increases, the specific molecular conductivity
slowly diminishes. For salts with monovalent ions it may be approximately re-

presented by the formula

                          Akjm = - B>«J

and since m-- = the relative mean distance ?· of the molecules,

                                   Akjtn = -- B/r,

     ' [This appears to be necessary in order to reduce measures in terms of mercury

--to absolute measure. E. F. J. L.]
             ----

or ' the specific molecular conductivity is equal to a constant diminished by a
quantity inversely proportional to the mean distance of the molecules.'

     0. The rate of diminution of klm with increasing concentration is greater the

--higher the valency of the ions. This is ascribed to two possible causes (a) a

change in the constitution of the polyvalent ion, in virtue of which it approximates

in behaviour to a monovalent ion, as the dilution inci'eases                                                                                                                                                                                                                         (6) the possibility that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

the cuiTent may be in part conveyed by the water of the solution.

6. The specific conductivity of a salt appears to be unaffected by its possessing,

or being destitute of, water of crystallisation.

     The above conclusions refer only to neutral salts ; acids and alkalies (including
alkaline carbonates) behave in a different manner. The chief facts collected by the

author regarding these substances are

1. The specific molecidar conductivity of acids and alkalies is small if the dilution

be very great, increases with the strength of the solution up to a certain maximum,

and from this point diminishes as the concentration increases. The small initial

value of k\m he considers (following Arrhenius and Ostwald) to be a secondary

-- --phenomenon probably due to impurities in the water and accordingly he neglects
this part of the curve, and obtains the limiting value of the specific molecular con-

ductivity by producing the second part backwards through the maximum to the

line of ordiiiates. lie thus obtains as the maximum limiting velocity of the ions

mm0*4 Isec, under an electromotive force of 1 volt per linear millimetre.
KOH NaOH2. The alkalies
                and      have specific molecular conductivities dififering

by a small constant amount, as also have their carbonates.

3. The monobasic mineral acids have the same specific molecular conductivity.

Phosphoric acid gives a not very different value if, instead of the equivalent ^HjPO^,

we employ the whole molecule H3PO4.

4. Acetic acid and ammonia in dilute solution exhibit a conductivity nearly

proportional to m-. In strong solution they conduct very badly.

      5. Sulphuric acid is anomalous, showing, after an initial specific molecular con-
ductivity like that of the monobasic mineral acids, a rapid decrease to an inferior

value, about §rds of this. From former investigations by the author it is known

that the conductivity of sulphuric acid during increasing concentration exhibits

three maxima and two minima. The first minimum corresponds to the hydrate
HjSO^.HjO, and the second to concentrated H.^SO^. One of the maxima occurs

between this point and SO3. This behaviour points to a chemical change in the

structure of the molecule, depending on the concentration.

     With regard to the problem of electrolytic conduction in general, Kohlrausch

lays down the axiom that no electrolyte in a pure state is a good conductor, but

only becomes such on admixture with other bodies, this admixture being necessary

in order to set up the dissociation which Clausius looks upon as the cause of migra-
tion of the ions. In this connection the question is discussed as to whether the

water of a solution conducts part of the current. This our author considers proved
for dilute solutions of several sulphates by an old experiment of Faraday, which he
has confirmed. Perhaps such a circumstance would explain various anomalies.

     Kohlrausch discusses Bouty's ' law of equivalents,' which states that ' the

electric conductivity of dilute salt-solutions of equivalent strengths is the same for

different substances.' Bouty distinguishes between ' normal ' salts, which obey the
law, and abnormal salts, which do not ; and defines an abnormal salt as one ' whose
constituent ions in dilute solution travel with different velocities.' But Kohl-
rausch shows that some salts which would come under this definition obey Bouty's
law, while some of the salts which disagree with it can be shown to be ' normal,'

from observations on their migration-constants. He also objects to the law on

the ground of its inherent improbabihty, and alleges further that Bouty's method

of calculation in comparing his own results with those of the author is eiToneous.
    Among minor points of interest brought out by the iuvestigation are the

following :

     1. The low conducting power of nearly pure water, the smallest value obtained
being 0-25x10-10.

     2. The phenomenon of absorption by the electrodes. The conductivity of a
       ON ELECTROLYSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEAHINGS. 337

very dilute solution of HCl was fouud to slowly diminish, owing to tlie withdrawal

of "the acid from the solution. That this is due to the electrodes was shown by an
increase in the resistance on sinking them in the fluid, the higher conductivity being
restored by stirring. The phenomenon is 'not exhibited by solutions of neutral salts.

     3. The specific molecular conductiyity of a strong base or acid is diminished by
gradual neutralisation, reaches a strongly defined minimum when neutralisation is
complete, and thence increases. Phosphoric acid seemed to show several such points
of discontiniuty ; acetic acid gives a curve of graduaUy changing curvature, the
neutralisation point being apparently somewhat indefinite.

     4. The behaviour of the tree-formed deposits on cathode, out of very weak solu-
tions. The threads are less than -001 centim. thick ; they repel one another, while the
current is passing, like a head of hair on an electrical machine, and with high E.M.F.'s

they are continually in motion.

   To this brief abstract of an important memoir it may he convenient to append a

                ON ELECTKOLTSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 339

The following 7-emarhs m-e taken from a criticism of the above abstracted memoir of
  Professor Kohlrausch, published by M. E. Boutt in the 'Journal de Physique,'

  for September 1886. (Translated by Mr. Love.)

     'The object of M. Kohlrausch is to control the results of the experiments of

Messrs. Lenz, Ostwald, and Vincenti, and my experiments of 1884, and to throw

light on points left in dispute. To this end he works by the methods which he
had previously pointed out, but with excessive dilutions, attaining to O'OOOOl gramme
equivalents per litre. These liquids conduct scarcely better than distilled water,

and a thousand tiraes worse than the water supplied to the town of Wiirzburtr.

Experiments of this kind raise a multitude of theoretical and practical difficulties

which M. Kohlrausch points out in all good faith, if he has not always given them

a decisive solution.

     ' In the first place come the difficulties due to the employment of alternatino-
currents and the telephone. . . . Possibly graver difficulties arise from the
employment of distilled water ; and these will always present themselves, what-
ever method be employed, if the dilution be pushed to extreme limits. In the first
place, it is very difficult to procure distilled water of constant composition. M.
Kohlrausch used rain-water distdled in a tin retort with a silver condenser, and
stored in large glass flasks. The conductivity of this water ranged from 1-1 to
1-5 X 10-'" (the conductivity of mercury being taken as unity), and was diminished
rather than increased after keeping in the flasks.

'Let us admit this conductivity as accurately known. If a trace of saline

matter be added to the water its conductivity increases. M. Kohlrausch supposes

that the conductivity of the salt and that of the water simply add                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and as this rule
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

if applied to neutral salts assigns to them a molecular conductivity sensibly con-

stant in very dilute solution he supposes it to be sufficiently justified by experiment.

M. Kohlrausch admits, however, that the greater part of the conductivity attri-

--buted to the distilled water really belongs to foreign matter^neutral salts, acids,
or bases        with which it is contaminated                                                                                                                  if some   saline  particles  be added to this
                                                                                                                                                            ;

--water we then have to deal with a mixture of which we Imow only a single element

that which has been added the nature and proportion of the other elements remain-

ing unknown ; it is possible that the conductivity we wish to measure may be

modified by the presence of this unknown element "in a manner altogether arbitrary,

and which may vary from one salt to another. . . .

' M. Kohlrausch does not admit the division of neutral salts into "normal" and

" abnormal," which I established on the basis of the inequality of the numbers

relating to the transport of the ions. If we consider only anhydrous normal salts,

the limiting values assigned by M. Kohlrausch are as follows :

in dilute solution, a statement which M. Kohlrausch refuses to accept.

     ' 4. ' With hicreasinrf concentration the molecular conductivity always diminishes^

and to a very unequal deg-ree for different salts. In order to e.x:hibit this yariatiou
conveniently to the eye, M. Kolilrausch constructed curves, taking as abscissEe the
values of m^, and as ordinates the molecular conductivities. These different curves
present markedly diff'erent courses, hut I observe that they all approach more or less-

to a common ordinate for to =0.' This peculiarity is especially well marked in the

case of the normal salts if Ave reject the portion of the curve, often a little inflected,

beyond to = 0'006; i.e., if we produce as near as can be judged {de sentiment) the

sensibly rectilinear portion which precedes this.

Aexpressing that this conductivity differs from a constant value by a term inversely-

Myproportional to the mean distance of the molecules of the salt.  latest

researches ^ have led me to an analogous result.

     'The limiting value of the conductivity of sulphuric, hydrochloric, and nitric
acids is sensibly three times that of neutral normal salts, as I had previously pointed
out. Sulphuric acid, moreover, exhibits peculiarities which would alone require a

monograph.
     ' Coming to the interpretation of the capital fact of the increase in the mole-

cular conductivity of all salts in dilute solutions, M. Kohlrausch thinks that it

must ' be attributed to a special conductivity acquired by the water xvhen it contains
other substances in solution, but which is too small to be evident in strong solutions.
Very small quantities of foreign matter may communicate to the water that state
of dissociation which Olausius looks upon as the origin of the migration of the

ions under the influence of electric forces, aiid hence a considerable portion of the
current might be diverted throuyh the mass of the water, which would itself then
share in the electrolysis. This hypothesis, to which M. Kohlrausch declines to

give greater precision, may be interpreted as a denial of the very principle which

he applies to the calculation of molecular conductivity, as in order to obtain this he
had already subtracted from the gross conductivity that part which belongs to the
distilled water, more or less impure, and therefore already possessing the special con-
ductivity with 7vhich he deals ; unless this be capable of changing with the nature-
and proportion of the salt in solution, which implies the formation of hydrates, and

that the conductivity of a solution is not equal to the sum of the separate conduc-
tivities of the salt and the solvent, the calculated numbers on which the discussion

hinges would in that case lose all definite meaning.'

criticism : compare the curves for KNO3, iBaNO^, NaNOj.-- E. F. J. L.]

extremely dilute solutions the more complete dissociation tends to assimilate such

ON ELECTROLYSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 341

Professor Kohlrausch has favoured the Committee with the folloiuing letter

                                 (in English) addressed to the Editor.

                                               Wurzhurg, January 6, 1887.

My dear Coll eagtje,--You have had the kindness to send me a proof of part

of the Eeport on Electrolysis before finally going to press, and I must take advan-

tage of your friendly permission to express my own views on the subject.

Since I consider it of great importance not to be misjudged in the reports of so

prominent a body as the British Association, I caimot avoid making a personal

remark. M. Bouty writes that the aim of my last published memoir was ' to
control the results of the experunents of Messrs. Lenz, Ostwald, Vincentini and my

(Bouty's) experiments of 1884.' ' M. Bouty is mistaken, certainly with all good

myintention, as to the course of  research. I already in 1874 carried on a series

of experiments with diluted solutions. Allow me to give, as a proof of the perfect

independence of my research, a series of observations on sulphuric acid, made on

January 30, 1875.

The molecular conductivity ''/,,, of the sulphuric acid increases very rapidly by
gDreater dilution, and very nearly reaches that of nitric acid. Extreme dilution
causes again a decrease. This is the chief part of that research ; it was published

nine years later by Ostwald and then by me.

      I discontinued these observations at that time, partly for the very reason that

they gave such new results. The initial increase of ''/p for sulphuric acid, and the
final decrease, made me suspicious ; besides, the observations at that time were

connected with difficulties, inasmuch as I could not so easily measure great

resistances ; also I could not obtain very pure water. At best the new object

demanded a thorough research, which would draw me too far from my chief object.

If one is working in an entirely new field he ought not to spend too much time on

particulars.^

     That dilute solutions are of very great interest has been emphasised in the fu-st

memou- by Grotrian and myself (1874), and later often enough in my publications.

Indeed I limited myself then to combining those relations equally from the results

mywhich alone at that time were at     disposal, i.e. solutions of moderate dilution.

     ^ In order to protect myself against the reproach of a too one-sided investigation,
I would further remark that I early informed myself concerning mixtures of salts as
well as acids in aqueous solutions, also concerning salts in alcoholic solutions, and

finally, concerning mixtures of water and alcohol, many years before. After the

publication of detailed researches of other authors I ceased to continue these inves-
                                                                               '

That this was no final solution of the problem I knew at once, and said so. And as

soon as I had concluded with the stronger solutions at a time when of all other

observations only those of Lenz were at hand, I recommenced with strongly dilute

solutions. The specific diihculties of these expe-riments, the striving after accuracy and

mydesiring to give absolute values, retarded the conclusion. But all   doubts, e.g.,

as to whether sulphuric acid in great dilution did not conduct exactly like the

monobasic mineral acids, were perfectly removed before auy publication on the

subject.

     These remarks are only caused by the wish that a research to which I have

given years may not be regarded finally as a mere repetition of someone else's work.

Sly repulsion against publishing observations which I considered were open to im-

provement, was tlie cause of other investigators' earlier publications, they thereby
gaining in many things the publisher's priority. On the other hand I can consider

my research as of a greater experimental precision, and that you expressly recog-

nise this for the later publication perfectly satisfies me.

   M. Bouty reiterates his objections to my method of measuring resistances with

alternating currents.' The empiric ground of this objection has been referred by

me, and by you also, to an erroneous formula which M. Bouty used. The

difficulties which Messrs. Bouty and Foussereau yet find will surely be overcome if

these gentlemen will go through the same experiments which I ' at some length

mydescribed in  last treatise.  M. Bouty "s regret, that the water for solutions

could not be obtained absolutely pure, must, of course, remain ; but the same diffi-

culty occurs in all observations of others addressed to the same object, and in most

of them to a much higher degree than in mine. If the water which / used for

solutions does not suffice for the explanation of the phenomena of dilute solutions,

then this explanation is so tar entirely unknown. I am also in this case obliged to
you that you have emphasised my carefulness in this direction. M. Bouty says :

' Let us admit this conductivity as accurately known.' I measured the conductivity

of the water every time shortly before the series of observations ; those observations
in which the characteristics of the solvent came into account at all were then

made within a quai-ter of an hour. The telephonic method of measurement is so

specially valuable on account of its very rapidity. That the conductivity of the

solvent water must be subtracted from the conductivity of the solution, I have (for

neutral salts) shown as proba))!}' ^ery nearly correct. At present also I do not

know how an observer could do otherwise. Finally, even an inaccuracy from this

mycause could only affect the most dilute of  solutions noticeably ; considering

the degree of dilution with which the other memoirs have to do, I cannot at all

allow a possible inaccuracy proceeding from water in my observations.

Of course 31. Bouty is correct in considering the use of quite pure (non-con-

ducting) water as necessarj^, in order to explain with perfectly conclusive proof

the relations obtaining in extreme dilutions. To consider his 'law of eqidvalents '

thus far as an a.viom cannot be denied him. Experience, however, in all observa-

tions (his own among them) disagrees with it, and I cannot see the necessity nor

the probability of this axiom. It is indeed remarkable that the great differences of

conductivity of strong solutions in the case of all salts reduce to about 30 per

cent. Grotrian and I twelve years ago found this law, which is true for salts of

monovalent acids even in moderate dilution, for the chlorides of the light metals.

Lenz proved the same thing in a more general form, making use of more extreme

dilutions. It is to the credit of Bouty that he set aside the yet remaining excep-

tions. It would certainly be heartily welcomed by every physicist if finally the
equality of all molecular conductivities in extreme dilution should be proved. With

Arrhenius one could then place this law alongside of the Boyle-Maniotte's law. I

myself, since I first introduced the conception of the ' molecular conductivity,'

would have an especial motive in agreeing to such a striking meaning of this
conception. At times, however (as you yourself mention) the law, at common

temperatures, does not agree with known facts.

   --Eight years ago I announced the following relation : ' The better a substance

conducts, the slower usually does its conductivity increase with temperature
in other words : ' the differences of conductivity of different substances usually
diminish at hi<?her temperatures.' 1 Tlie supposition expressed by Arrbenius, that
at high temperatures dilute solutions conduct equally well, does not lie beyond the
bounds of possibility, but is at present only a hypothesis.

     For common temperatures the law which I derived from Hittorf 's numbers for
migration of ions in connection with my observations in conducti\ity, which were
independent of this migi-ation, appears to me to contain a simple and natural
hypothesis which has proved true for substances with monobasic acids. One must be

blind to explain as an accident the systematic ordering of things under this view.

     Now, just a remark concerning some things by Arrhenius, who through the

introduction and consequent treatment of the conception of 'activity 'in connection
with Clausius's theory, has given us so important a point of view that his meaning
must be carefully considered ; especially do I regard as a decided advance the light
which has been thrown by his and Ostwald's memoirs upon a hitherto theoretically
 dark group of bodies, viz., the bodies called by me, ' conductors of the lower order.'

       1 should, however, raise several objections to Arrhenius's radical meaning, that
 the theory which accepts a connection between internal friction and electrical con-
 ductivity ought to be rejected.'^ It appears to be a postulate a priori that besides
 activity some kind of friction must necessarily be accepted ; through the work of

 Wiedemann and others, it has long been known that usually a lesser conductivity-
 is connected with a greater internal friction. One cannot deny the nearly quanti-

 tative connection between the influence of temperature upon the so-called ' fluidity,'
 and upon conductivity, as shown by Grotrian. The proof which I gave,^ that the
 supposition of a mechanical and electrolytic frictional resistance of about equal
 amount, allows the finding of an absolute size of molecules, which approaches the

 sizes found, by other methods, by Maxwell, Sir W. Thomson, van der AVaals and
 others, seems to me of no little interest. In fact, the surprising phenomena in gela-

 tinous substances * and ' solid ' electrolytes must be supplemented by an accurate
 definition of the idea 'internal friction ' before one can come to the conclusion that

 electrical resistance and internal friction are totally distinct.

      Since, however, M. Arrhenius tells me that he intends to explain his remarks

 for himself,^ I shall not enter into detail.

      But I must draw your attention to something else. The supposition which
 Arrhenius makes in reference to the dissociation of solutions of MgSO^ and related
 substances,^ is really one special case of the possibility, expressed by me, that water,
  in extreme dilutions, can take part in the conduction. I have expressly left it an
 open question whether such a co-operation should consist in the formation of a hy-

  drate. The hypothesis of Arrhenius is such a possible case. Should this be true,

 the possibility would thereby be strengthened that the rapid rise of the molecular
 conductivity of many salts, in extreme dilution, may be referred to a sort of second-

 ary cause ; MgS04 in solution conducts so much worse than H3SO4, and possibly also
 than MgOjH.j, that a dissociation of the salt into these substances, even when only
 a small quantity of the decomposed substance is found, may cause the conductivity

  to increase considerably.

       M. Bouty's fear ' that by this means ' the calculated numbers on which the

  discussion hinges would in that case lose all definite meaning,' is a little strained.

 To my idea such an influence of the water, if it exists, comes only noticeably

  into consideration in extremely dilute solutions, and in this case perhaps also only

  in a limited group of compounds.

      I conclude this letter assuring you of my real satisfaction that you, my dear
 Mycolleague, have given the impulse to collect the newer results on electrolysis.

 wander far from matters of fact, knowing myself to be not sufficiently weE

Contribution to our Knowledge of the Action of Fliddity on the Gonductivity

    of Electrolytes {Behaviour of Jelly). By Svante Arehenius. Trans-

     lated from 'Kongl. Vetenskaps-A kademiens Fordhandlingar,' 1885,

    No. 6, Stockholm, hy Professor W. Ramsay.

From numerous researches of physicists ' it has been held as proved that resistance

to the passage of an electric current undergoes the same variations as the internal

friction, i.e. that both increase or decrease simultaneously. This view is based

on a considerable number of data regarding the conductivity of salts in aqueous

solution. To obtain further knowledge on the subject it was necessary to test the

action of solvents other than water. This has been done by C. Stephan,^ who in-

vestigated the behaviour of alcoholic solutions, and found only an analogy between

electric resistance and internal  friction, but not complete proportionality                                                                                                                                                           and this
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

has been confirmed by other observers.^ That proportionality exists, except in

some exceptional eases considered by Stephau,^ cannot be held. Unfortunately

Stephan has only investigated alcohoHc solutions containing from to 70 per cent, of

alcohol, i.e. those of which the internal friction is greater than that of water. Had

he investigated solutions richer in alcohol, he woidd doubtless have found that au

alcoholic solution of a salt has less conductivity than the corresponding more

aqueous solution, in spite of the former having less internal friction than the latter.

This has been clearly proved by Hittorf 's work,* and has been completely con-

firmed by Lenz's ^ investigations, although Lenz's work was not directed to that

point. 1 subsequently found on conversing with Professor Ostwald, of Riga, that

he, like myself, disbelieved in any connection between internal friction and resist-

ance, and he proposed that I should undertake the investigation of which au

account follows. From a paper by II. de Vries ' it follows further that the rate of

diflusion of a solution of salt is nearly independent of internal friction ; a result

which Graham's experiments had already indicated. Lastly, Long's ^ work shows

that the rate of difi'usion of an aqueous solution of a salt is nearly proportional to

its conductivity, whence it follows with high probability that the resistance must be

nearly independent of internal friction under similar conditions. And should this

prove to be true, the whole of our knowledge of the process of electrolysis would
be much simplified.

The method of investigation was that proposed by Kohlrausch and Nippoldt.^

The resistance-vessels were of the same form as those I previously used. The

platinised platinum terminals were l<3-5 mm. apart, the diameter of each was

2-j'6 mm., and through each passed a glass tube 9 mm. in diameter. The solutions

investigated were solutions of sodium chloride, zinc sulphate, and copper acetate, in

cial gelatine.

     The proportions taken were : (a) 20 cc. of the salt solution diluted to 25 cc.
with water (b) 20 cc. of solution, in which 1*06 gram gelatine was dissolved,

                                                       ;

diluted to 25 cc. The gelatine solutions were tolerably fluid at 30°, at 25° very-
thick and syrupy, at 24° the traces of fluidity were extremely small, and at 23-5°

the whole had jellied.

     The internal friction was determined by Sprung's ' method for the gelatine solu-
·tion containing 4'2 per cent, of gelatine, and was found to be, at 30'6° C, 2'271
at 27"7° 0., 2-889, the internal friction of water at 0° being- taken as unity. At
24° the internal friction was infinitely great, i.e., the solution had gelatinised and
blocked the capillary tube. At corresponding temperatures the internal friction of
water is, at 30-5°, 0-4476 ; at 27-7°, 0-4547 ; and at 24°, 0-5171. The internal fric-
tion of the weak salt solutions employed can have difiered but very little from these

numbers.

The distilled water showed a resistance of 60,000 ohms, while the gelatine solu-

tion averaged 300 ohms. It was therefore considered unnecessary to introduce a

Nowcorrection for the conductivity of the distilled water present.  as it is known

that all organic substances which do not possess well-marked acid, basic, or salt-

dike properties have extremely small conductivity, it may be concluded that gelatine

also, if free from salts, should manifest great resistance, and the high conductivity of

the gelatine is evidently due to the salts which it contains.

     Here it is evident that the conductlTity alters only uniformly -with temperature,
for had this been other-vvise great variations in the neighbourhood of 24° should
have been noticeable, for the internal Iriction increases about that temperature from
a moderate value to an infinitely great one. But no sign of such a sudden variation

     Those for gelatine solutions are generally some-what higher than for the
corresponding aqueous solutions, but the difierence is unimportant. If it be
assumed that the coefficients of temperature for internal friction and conductivity
are the same with aqueous solutions, it cannot be so with gelatine solutions, because
for these the temperature-coefficient of internal friction must be infinity, while the
conductivity-coefficient never exceeds 03. If the conductivity of pure aqueous
solutions at 17-8°, which are very mobile, be compared with that of gelatine solu-
tions of 4-2 per cent, containing the same amount of salts, which are solid at 24°,

might be expected tliat in extremely dilute solutions they should coincide. I have        ^
shown ' that such a relation does not hold either for aqueous or alcoholic solutions.

Bouty - who found complete correspondence between these two quantities, was
misled by a coincidence in calculating his results, as Kohbausch has shown.'

     As all known cases can therefore be explained without assuming a connection

between internal friction and conductivity, this theory, which serves only to com-
plicate matters, must be abandoned.

    As a final proof of the justice of the above conclusion I made a cell like an

ordinary Daniell, but introduced gelatine into the solutions of zinc sulphate and
copper sulphate. The resistance was 1-5 ohm, while that of a similar Daniell's cell
was 1"3 ohm. But the resistance of the cell containing gelatine gradually increased
after four days, owing to bubbles being deposited in the gelatine near the zinc and

the copper,^

   Sur la Polarisation des Electrodes et sur la Conductibilite des Liqiiides.
                   Par M. E. Booty.''' Abstract by Oliver Lodge.

     The author first describes Lippmann's method of measuring the resistance of
electrolytes, viz. by tapping olf and measuring the fall of potential between two points
of the liquid contained in a cylindrical tube, and comparing this with the fall in a

known length of wire included in the same battery circuit as the liquid. He

proceeds to use it also for determining the polarisation of either electrode, by
measuring the potential difference between one of the main electrodes supplying
current to the liquid and one of the tapping electrodes ; using the obvious relation

                                            e=rC +p

in order to find _p, the polarisation.
     AVith platinum electrodes and acidulated water he thus reckons that with a

current of average intensity about 8 x 10"* amperes per square centimetre, the
polarisation of the electrode rises as follows :
ON ELECTROLYSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 349

constant for the same current when prolonged. But at an intensity 8-6 a new
phenomenon is produced : polarisation increases with time, first ver}' slowly, then
more and more rapidly, going from -04 to '65 volt ; at the same time one notices

that the metallic and brilliant deposit of pure copper which one had hitherto
obtained is displaced by a ruddy and non-adhesive deposit. In proportion as it is
produced the polarisation increases, and the deposit overspreads the electrode with

increasing rapidity.

     ' Finally, augmenting the current still more, the deposit passes gradually from
red to black, while polarisation increases in a continuous manner, and for a sufficient
current-intensity the deposit acquires anew a certain adherence. It is then dark-
gTey, very rich in zinc, and recalls by its aspect deposits of zinc obtained from-
impure commercial sulphate of zinc.

     ' As for the conductmti/ of the liquid it reniaiivi constant all the time, in spite of

the variety of electrolytic actions, to which a study of polarisation and aspect of
deposit bear witness. . . . The same kind of thing happens with other propor-
tions of CuSO^ and ZnSO,. . . .

     ' One may remark further that the specific resistance of the liquid passes through

a minimufti for a certain composition of the mixture ; it is then inferior to the
resistance of even a saturated solution of one of the two salts, and a fortiori to that

of the same salt diluted down to the strength in which it occui-s in the liquor. So

the molecules of tioo mixed salts take part in the transport of electricity, even when
only one of the two metals is deposited on the cathode.^

      All the variations of polarisation in the above case are then simply and naturally
explained by the fact of exhaustion, in the liquid near cathode, of the salt of the
metal being deposited, except in so far as diffusion replenishes it. With strong

currents it is therefore plainly necessary for zinc to be deposited as well as copper,
and it is equally obvious that this zinc will tend to clear itself off again by local action.

     The author then goes on to observe that very similar complications occur even
when only one salt is intended to be present. Thus pure CuSO^ almost always
contains a trace of acid, and accordingly, in its solution, hydrogen plays much the
same part as zinc has done in the above described experiment. For feeble in-
tensities copper alone is deposited, but for stronger currents the deposit is red and
contains some oxide [?]. Hydrogenised copper forms with copper, in fact, local
couples in which copper is the attacked element. Evolution of heat by local
action has been proved by the use of thermometer electrodes.

     Even if OuSO^ contained no acid to start with, it would soon get some by

electrolysis ; > for the solution of anode is never exactly equal to deposit on cathode.

     In all these cases one may notice that electrolytic reactions which go on for the

most feeble currents absorb ahoays less heat than those lohich occur with stronger
currents. This extension to mixtures of the beautiful law announced by Berthelot
for the case of electrolysis of a single salt is confirmed by a study of particular
cases. For instance, the following table sums up the author's observations on a

imixture of {^ by volume of a solution of Na.^SO^, and of a solution of CuSO^,

both pure and saturated when cold. The polarisation of anode is so small as to be

negligible; the polarisation of cathode is given for various intensities of current
 in ten-thousandths of an ampere per square centimetre.

     The bro^vll deposit of oxide appears as soon as tlie polarisation exceeds '28 volt
the polarisation increases first very rapidly, then slowly, and its limit is very nearly
the number (]'428 volt) which corresponds to the decomposition of Na.jSO^ be-
tween copper electrodes. (It is slightly sophisticated by the extra resistance of gas
bubbles then given off.) To sum up : first is decomposed OuSO^, which theoretically
consumes no energy (the electrodes being copper), then comes in the decomposition
of acid water (-28 volt), finally that of sulphate of soda (1-424).

    As for the conductivity of the mixture it i-emains perfectly invariable in spite of

the variability of the electrolytic reactions.
     M. Bouty then quotes a saying of Wiedemann, that from a mixture of any of

the following metals, Zn, Cd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, any metal which follows in the list
is deposited to the exclusion of any which precedes. This is manifestly in accord
with the above law, for the metals are in order of thermal equivalents. But the fact

is only true for feeble currents. With strong currents a mixed deposit is obtained.
     To sum up : liquids have, like metals, ordy one tnode of conductiny electricity.

Also they have, like metals, only one contact E.M.F. icith an electrode of invariable
composition. But the result of electrolysis being to modify both electrode and

--liquid round it, their contact E.M.F. alters in a variable manner whence polarisa-

                   Par M. E. Bouty.' Abstract bij Oliver Lodge.

     ' The electric conductivity of salts dissolved in water varies with concentration
in a manner extremely complex and differing for different salts. One possesses
neither o-eneral law nor empirical formula, of however limited an application. One

conceives a priori that this conductivity depends on the chemical nature of the
salt on the hydrates it can form, and on their stability; experience establishes
also that it is'not without relation to some physical properties of the solution, in
particular its viscosity. Bat the separation of these circumstances has not yet been

made. There seemed to me room first to simplify the problem by considering Only

solutions of identical physical properties. I have therefore chosen solutions so
dilute that their density and viscosity are the same as pure water ; their conductivity
is yet relatively enormous, and can be measured easily by an electrometric method
derived from that of M. Lippmann.'

     In this method as now applied the tapping electrodes are zinc in sulphate of zinc,

communication being established between the experimental fluid and the sulphate
of zinc bv a pair of capillary openings in the experimental tube. The difference of
potential between these tapping electrodes is either measured by a Lippmann electro-

meter and compared against another difference taken at the ends of a known wire in
the same circuit, chosen so as to be as nearly equal in resistance to the liquid as
possible ; or, what is plainly better, it is compensated by an auxiliaiy wire, and the

electrometer brought to zero.
     The author quotes Kohlrausch's views as expressed in his paper in Wiedemann's

^ Annalen,' vi. pp. 1, 51, 145, 210 ; but he objects to them as founded too much on ex-

trapolation, the conclusions being stated for extremely dilute solutions, while those

experimented with contained ^th of their weight of salt. 'So, although my results

present a general agreement with those of ]M. Kohlrausch within the limits in which
he has himself worked, I find myself led for their interpretation to conclusions
absolutely different from that of the learned German professor.'

    ' When one takes a solution of a neutral salt, already pretty dilute, and doubles

the quantity of water it contains, the specific resistance is in general far from being
doubled, as one would a priori expect ; it is multiplied by a coefficient X, smaller
than 2, which increases progressively with dilution and tends towards the limit 2,
but only for excessive dilution. Here, for example, arejsome numbers furnished by

salts, &c. ; third, neutral salta which remain abnormal even in very dilute solution
and consider only the salts I have called nonnaV

     The class of bodies most favourable to ]M. Kohlrausch's results are those relating
to anhydrous and nearly ' normal ' salts. Here are his numbers for the following ions.

The numbers for Am, K, Cy, 01, Br, I, and NOj differ very little from a mean value 50.

But for Ag, SO4, CIO3, the atomic conductivity is 40, and for CO3 it is 36.

    ' To compare these numbers with my own, this is what I have done. Consider,

for example, K^SO^ ; its molecular resistance according to Kohlrausch is

                                 2 1 __88_

That of KCl, which I have used as a standard, is

The ratio of these is               1 1 97

                                        i-ni4.i

I have measured this   same  ratio  at  different  concentrations,  y~,viz. '--, ^\^,  -^^-^

and find numbers which, divided by the ratio of equivalents, give respectively

                             1-288 1-144 1-074 1-011.

These evidently tend towards the limit 1, and not to the number 1-1114 proposed
by M. Kohlrausch.'

     Similarly with K3CO3 and AgNO,.
     ' For sulphate of silver compared with ECl, Kohlrausch's table would give 1*21
which I find by experiment -981.
    ' These divergencies are not enormous, but they get much bigger if one proceeds
to study normal h3'drated salts whose conductivity varies so rapidly with dilution.
     ' Kohlrausch's numbers for the following metals are very different from 50 :

                                            Ca 26
                                         Ba 29

    * When two coefficients are given, the former belongs to ordinary salts, the other

to sulphates, which otherwise M. Kohlrausch cannot get to obey his law.'
     Comparing these with KCl in the manner already explained, M. Bouty gets the

ioUowing table, in which Kohlrausch's numbers are also inserted for comparison.

altogether avoided by Kohlrausch for the case of the magnesium salts above.

    ' To sum up : Molecular conductivities tend visibly to equality for hydrated as

well as for anhydrous salts, and the disagreement of my results with those of

Kohlrausch finds itself explained in the most satisfactory manner.'

    ' The law which I have just announced may be extended to a variety of salts.
It suffices to know the manner in which the salt is electrolysed, and what quantity

of salt is equivalent to KCl, for the application of Faraday's law.'
     The author then gives figures for various salts, classifying them thus:

           «. Salts with several equivalents of acid.
          b. Double salts decomposed by water (including alums).
          c. Simple salts decomposed by vrater (tin salts and FeXH^^).
           d. Stable double normal salts (K^FeCy^, &c.)
           e. Double abnormal salts.
          f. Phosphates and arseniates.
            g. Bicarbonates.
            h. Mercuric salts.
          i. Tartar emetic and a couple of cobalt compounds.

    He finds that HgClo, IIgBr,,, and HgCy,, are unique ; they are insulators. Water

containing 5 grammes of one of these substances to the litre conducts very little
better than pure water : 200 times less than what the 4/m law would give. Sal
alembroth, however, conducts.

                                         VII. Organic Substances.

     Organic salts differ in no essential character from salts of which the acid and
base are mineral. If the electrolysis is normal the law of equivalents rigorously
applies, otherwise it does not, just as with mineral salts.

     Bodies like alcohol, glycerine, glucose, urea, &c. are very bad conductors, and
it is difficult to make sure that the feeble conductivity they show (when com-
mercially pure) is not due to the presence of traces of salts.

                                             VIII. Conductivity of very dilute Acids and Bases.

The author has been led to the following conclusions :

^ Acids and bases which dissolve in xvatei- without combinim/ with if furnish

insulating solutions                                                                                      on the other hand, when these substances co7nbine with water in a
                                                                                                       ;

manner more or less complete they conduct in the same way as salts.

' But a given acid or a given base often forms with water several different com-

binations. These combinations are usually unstable in presence of excess of water

they are dissociated more or less by elevation of temperature and bj' dilution. It

is only in a manner altogether exceptional that a monoba.«ic acid can exist in

dilute solutions in the monohydrated state, and without mixture with superior

hydrates                                     its mode                                                     of electrolysis and  its conductivity will vary  in  a corresponding
                                          ;

manner. It is therefore not legitimate to liken acids and bases in aqueous solution

to neutral salts                                                                         the law of equivalents cannot be directly applied to them.'
                                                                                      ;

Then follows a twelve-page discussion of results, to establish these laws ; from

this I make a few extracts only.

The case of sulphuric acid is interesting, since it can crystallise with either one,

two, or four, molecules of water, and it undergoes maximum contraction when

combined with six atoms. It is known also to possess a maximum conductivity

' One does not see how to explain a variation of this kind except by a change

in the nature of the electrolyte {i.e., of the dissolved hydrate).'

    By making the hypothesis, which Bourgoin made, that the hydrate really

decomposed by the current was S,,Og, 6H,p, M. Bouty considers that the anomaly

of electrolysis as expressed by Hittorfs values of «, and also that of conduc-
tivity, is explained. These are Hittorf 's values of n for dilute sulphuric acid.

'S = -5574  1-4383  5-415   23358                    97-16     161-4

                                -177

Hydrochloric acid is in much the same condition as sulphuric acid : it conducts as
if its molecule contained three equivalents of basic hydrogen. One does not know

such a hydrate, but there is probably a mixture of hydrates present.
     Oxalic and picric acids are the best conducting organic acids. Other acids con-

--d-uct hardly at all when strong, and dilution has an enormous effect upon them

probably because they combine with water forming compounds analogous to salts.

  -- UIX. Injluence of Temperature. To study this, the tubes of fig. 1 are turned

upside do svn and immersed in a bath. The result is that for normal neutral salts

the conductivity is a linear function of temperature.

where h is the same constant for all the salts, and equal to about -0.337. This
agrees with Kohlrausch also.

     It is noteworthy that Poiseuille gives the quantity of water which flows
through a capillary tube, under a given pressure, as proportional to

                                             1 + -03365!! + -00021 i!^

      It is impossible not to be struck with the identity of the principal coefficient
in this formula, with h in the conductivity formula ; showing that resistance is of

the nature of a friction, as Wiedemann surmised.
     For abnormal salts the coefficient 6 is a little greater, and a parabolic formula is

required at higher temperatures. So, although these salts conduct worse than

normal ones to begin with, they improve faster when heated, and accordingly their

abnormality decreases with rise of temperature.
     For acids and bases the temperature-coefficient is rather less, being only -0119

for sulphuric acid, and -024 for liydrochloric. Probably warming breaks up some
good-conducting hydrate, and so spoils conductivity almost as fast as it otherwise

improves it.

     ' To sum up : I believe I have established that the electrolysis of neutral salts
is a simple phenomenon, and that there is only one elementary law of conductivity
in harmony with the law of electro-chemical equivalents. Apparent exceptions
only reveal to us the complexity of certain solutions which are not directly com-
parable vpith those of KCl or K^SO^.'

       On ihe Employment of Alternating Currents for Measuring Liquid

                 Resistances. By MM. Bouty and Foussereau.^

     The authors criticise the employment of alternating currents employed by Kohl-
rausch and many others in the hope of diminishing the effect of polarisation. They

point out that self-induction in the resistance-box is fatal to silence in the telephone

[naturally], and only succeed in getting good results when they replace wire in their
bridge by liquid resistances, describing for this purpose a liquid rheostat. Even
thus, however, they hardly get concordant results when they try to apply the method
to extremely weak solutions.

ON ELECTROLYSIS IN ITS PHTSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 357

On Mechanical and Thermal Effects accompanying Electrolysis. By
                M. BouTT. Brief Abstract by Oliver Lodge.

   A series of short memoirs have been published by M. Bouty in the ' Journal de

Physique ' on a branch of the subject not very immediately connected with that

which at present concerns us. I had occasion to refer to part of them in a commu-

nication on the seat of E.M.F. in the voltaic pUe. (See ' B.A. Report,' 1884, pp. 492

and 513-518, or ' Phil. Mag.' vol. xix. 1885, pp. 189 and 343 to 350.)

     The references to them are as follows:
     1. On some mechanical and thermal effects accompanying electrolysis (' Journ. de

Phys.' 1879, t. viii. pp. 289 and 341).
     2. Thermo-electric and electro-thermic phenomena at contact of metal and liquid

(1880, t. ix. p. 306).

    3. On the contraction of galvanic deposits, and its relation loith the Peltier pheno-

menon (1881, t. X.)
     In the first of these papers, metals are deposited on silvered thermometer

bulbs and the mechanical compression caused by the different deposits studied

Wertheim's results in elasticity being applied to them.

The effect of heat on such metallised thermometers is also discussed.

Metallised thermometers are then used as electrodes to examine the changes of

temperature which occur while various ions are being liberated. During the elec-

trolysis of CUSO4 or ZnSO^ the anode is slightly warmed, the cathode slightly

cooled ; inverting the current cools the new cathode distinctly. Electrolysiog dilute
H.,S04 with platinum coated thermometers, the anode is quite warm, the cathode

scarcely at all. Tbis is the permanent eflect. Inverting the current cools the old

anode,  sometimes \ degree below the  temperature of  the  surrounding liquid.                                                                                          The
                                                                                                                                                                     _

effect can be repeated seven or eight times, although with decreasing intensity, if

one takes care to stir the liquid between the inversions.

Replacing H.,S04 by HCl, the permanent effect is very small, but both poles

heat strongly at 'each inversion. With PtCl4 one observes at each inversion a

coolmg of the old anode and a heating of the old cathode. In every ease examined,

anode is hotter than cathode in the permanent state.

In the second paper, metal-liquid junctions are warmed and cooled alternately

so as to give thermo-electric currents, the E.M.F. of several circuits being mea-

sured. An attempt is then made to measure absolutely the coefficient of the

Peltier effect at these junctions when a current passes ; a method suggested by Max-

well (' El. Electricity^' p. 146) being used. The result is that the author believes
the effects to be purely physical, without known relation to the heats of combination

or the latent heats of solution, but connected exactly with the thermo-electric forces

of couples corresponding. The thermo-electric laws of Sir W. Thonison are believed

to apply without modification. Chemical effects are regarded as disturbances pro-

ducing parasitic heats.
      In the third paper, the author reconsiders the contraction of galvanic deposits ui

the light of the Peltier effect, and comes to the simple and satisfactory conclusion
that the two phenomena are immediately connected. Each envelope being deposited
at a rather higher temperature than it is able afterwards to maintain, a state of com-

pression naturally results. This view he sustains by experiment.

date of its appearance (1883), the publication last October in Wiedemann's/Annalen
                                                                :

of a masterly memoir by Prof. F. Kohlrauscli on the same subject throws it into

the shade                                        for there can  he  no                                                             doubt  that  while  the  ground covered  by both is
                                              ;

similar, the Kohlrausch memoir is greatly superior, both in the experiments made

and in the discussion upon them.'

  A brief abstract of this portion of Dr. Arrhenius's paper is all, therefore, that is now

necessary ; and if my criticisms on parts of it appear in any case caustic, I must

express my regret to the author for the adverse opinion, and trust that my appre-

ciation of a great deal in the second part will compensate for it to some extent.

It sometimes seems as if the author allowed himself occasionally to indulge in an

exploded type of reasoning, wherein, by manipulation of imaginary data, a confu-

sion is produced, out of which emerge several laws more or less in agreement

with experience, which are thenceforth labelled and referred to as theoretical

deductions It may be, however, that the italicised and numbered statements

throughout the paper are not intended for strict statements of deduced law, but

are merely summaries of more or less probable truth. In that case it is their form

only which is misleading, and one would judge them by a different standard. I

proceed to give an account of the contents.

§§ 1-8 are devoted to an account of the experimental method employed, and

to a justification of it.

The method consists in the use of a differential galvanometer, one of whose

branches consists of ordinary wire, while the other contains a current alternator

in the shape of a wheel turned by hand, with alternate bars on its periphery rubbed

by two springs (Edlund's ' depolariser '). The alternating current from this in-

strument is led to a switch, which is able at pleasure to throw into circuit either

the experimental tube of liquid or a wire resistance box.

   A battery is arranged so that its current divides fairly equally between the two

branches of the galvanometer ; and one portion of the current, after being rendered

alternating by the above arrangement, is diverted by the switch either to the

electrolyte or to the adjustable resistance-box. The resistances of the liquid

and of the box are considered equal when the deflexion of the galvanometer is in-

dependent of the position of the switch.

I must confess to surprise that this can be a satisfactory mode of measuring

resistance : self-induction and electro-chemical capacity being so mixed up in it,^

and the so-called depolariser being a very unsatisfactory instrument. Apparently,

however, results fairly comparable with each other can be obtained.

  --§ 9. Calculation from the Experimental Data. First, the conductivity of the

original water used as solvent is subtracted fi-om that of the solution, and the re-

sult claimed to be the conductivity of the salt alone. For this ride, as an empirical

process justified ^ posterioi-i, there may be something (not much) to be said. But

as a corollary from a ' law ' subsequently proved in this paper (§ 15, law 2) it
is unreliable. Probably not much liarm is done by using this rule in the special

cases considered ; at anj^ rate, Kohlrausch does the same thing : but it is well to
notice that the rule k = k^ + k.-,, for the conductivity of a mixture, if stated as a

general and a priori law, assumes two things :

1st. That the law of divided circuit must hold whenever two conductors

                                                 are intermingled                                                                  which  is untrue.^
                                                                                                                                ;

     ' Dr. Ai-rhenius in his letter, page 38.5, naturally and justifiably objects to this
statement as dogmatic. The reason it is here put so briefly is tliat the point was

referred to in my last year's paper, see Aberdeen Eeport, top of page 728. Observe,

I only object to the assumption that the law of divided circuit must be true : it mai/

be true in some cases, but a possibility cannot be made the basis of a deduced law.
In order that the combined resistance of two solutions when mixed may be the semi-
harmonic mean of their separate resistances when alone, the following conditions
are necessary and suflScient

            (1) The solutions must not affect each other's conductivity in any way ; the
                       fact of mixture must not increase dissociation or change viscosity,

                              for instance.

2nd. That the conductivity of water itself remains unaffected by the pre-

            sence of  a foreign body                                                           which is improbable.'
                                                                                            ;

--AEffect of Dilution.  great part of the paper is taken up with the effect on

conductivity which dilution with an equal quantity of water causes to solutions of

various salts. This mode of expression is a roundabout substitute for a straight-

forward expression by cui-ve or formula for the relation between conductivity and

concentration such as Kohlrausch attempts to give. However, as Dr. Arrhenius

evidently prefers this mode of expression, I translate his introduction of it (page 25

of his memoir).

A' Table    shows that when a saline solution is diluted in a certain ratio

[1 : 6"08, for instance] its conductivity diminishes in a certain other ratio [not in

general a very different one]. To render these numbers comparable among them-

selves in the different series a recalculation has been made, in which all dilutions

are reduced to the ratio 1 : 2.

' This calculation is made in the following manner. If 1 : m is the proportion

between the dilutions of two solutions of the same salt examined consecutively {i.e.,

if one of the solutions is u times as dilute as the other), the proportion between

the resistances in the two cases is, say, 1 : ii (the value of n being taken from the

table) ; that is to say, one of the solutions has a conductivity n times less than

that of the other.

' If now 1 : .r is the proportion between the resistances of two solutions when

the dilutions are in the proportion 1 : 2, the following relation will hold good. If

the dilution is 1 : 2^, the ratio of resistances (if the process is effected in a vmi-

form manner) ought to be 1 : .rP. In consequence we have 1 : 2p = 1 : u, and
\ : x^ -- \ : n, which enables x to be calculated by the following formula :

                     log log .r = log log n -- log log u + log log 2.

     ' The values of x calculated from this formida, which, according to what has
just been said, signifies the proportion in which the conductivity of one salt-

(2) The current must divide itself accurately between the two constituents,
          so that whatever starts to go by one substance must keep to that all

                 the way, and not go partly through one, partly through the other.

If these two conditions are not satisfied, the law can only be true in any particular
case by some semi-accidental sort of compensation. True there is much to be said
for the fulfilment of the second condition in many cases of electrolysis, perhaps in

all ; but it cannot be regarded as axiomatic ; and it is certainly not true of inter-

mingled conductors in general, which is all I say in the text. The point may be

illustrated thus. Take a square sheet of tinfoil, send a current through it between

copper strips on its opposite edges, and measure its resistance. Now make an

arbitrary cixt across the sheet from one of these edges to the other. The current
will divide between the two portions, and the resistance of each portion can be

measured. The resistance of the nncvt sheet will not in general be equal to the semi-
harmonie mean of the two portions; in other words, the law of divided circuit need

not apply.

It may apply, but only for the special case of a cut along a stream-line. The

statement, therefore, that the law of divided circuit mvst hold whenever two con-

--ductors are intermingled is untrue Q.E.D.
    As to the question whether the law does hold for any mixed electrolytes we have

the experiments of Hittorf and of Buff on the conductivity of mixtures with the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

result, I believe, that whereas all the mixed substances take part in conveying the
current, no simple relation holds between the conductivity of the mixture and their

separate conductivities except in the case of some haloid salts. For them the law of

divided circuits does seem to hold.

To diminish the risk of misunderstanding, I may be permitted to point out that

the remark made in the text is not a criticism of Dr. Arrhenius or of anybodj\ It

relates to a general proposition or matter of fact, and is intended as a memorandum

of a circumstance which it is very easy to see when pointed out, and rather easy to

forget in practice when considering a special case                                                                                                                                                                                                                             cf .

solution dimiuishes when it is diluted with water to double its volume, are laid
down in table B. This quantity we name the exponent of dilution.'

  B --is a long table wherein, after all, .r does not turn out a constant though it

is roughly so, several values of x being given for each substance according to its
degree of dilution. The values of x for all the substances range from 17 to 2-3,

and their average value would seem to be about 1-95.

The above introduction to the formula for calculating x loses all meaning

unless X is intended to be constant ; but, in so far as .r is intended to be constant,

the' gist of the introduction may be paraphrased thus :

The first approximation to the relation between k and vi (conductivity and

concentration) is that made by Kohh-ausch, viz., that the two are proportional.'

This is roughly true for very dilute salt (not acid) solutions, but it breaks down in

a manner shown by Kohlrausch's experimental curves for more concentrated ones,

so that he suggests the formula

                                                                           A --kltn =     A.in\

as a closer, though still rough, approximation. Arrhenius, however, prefers to

assume {i.e., practically, though unconsciously, does assume by his reasoning) that k

is nearly proportional to m', where r is an index to be determined by experiment.

This is fair enough as an hypothesis, and should have been set forth clearly, and

then negatived by the result of his experiments : or, as a clumsier and bulkier

proceeding, the value of ?· might be tabidated for every substance at various

strengths.                                           Instead, however,     of determining  r, Arrhenius  determines  2'            which
                                                                                                                                ;

he calls x, and tabulates. This number x, his exponent of dilution, he calculates

from the equation

                                                                 log^' ^ log mfm' ^ logw y^-.

                                                                 log 2 log ?n/OT' log u

I confess that it has cost me a good deal of trouble to disentangle the real

meaning of this said dilution-exponent, and of the ideas involved in it.'^

I ought here to say that in 1884 M. Bouty independently expresses his results

in terms of this same number, which he calls the ratio X ; showing that it has some

experimental convenience. Bouty, however, does give absolute concentrations,

and he really doubles the dilution each time. Arrhenius gives no absolute con-

centration                                           he dilutes  largely,  and  then  calculates  what woidd  have   happened
                                                 ;

if he had only doubled the dilution, by means of a formula which, after all,

is not reidly correct.' Perhaps the idea in not gi\-iug absolute concentrations is

that it is impossible accurately to tell them, unless absolutely pure water were

available to start with. But the difficulty of impure water tells just as much at

Aevery dilution, for it is a medley of things you are really adding.                                                 great part

of the merit of Kohlrausch's work is that he takes such immense pains over the

quality of his water.

Table B' contains similar numbers, calcidated from some experimental results

of Lenz for stronger solutions.

     The net result of these tables is that they help to confirm the later results of
Kohlrausch. For all salts other than hydrates the value of .r becomes practi-

cally equal to 2 as the solutions become very weak, i.e., r becomes unity ; and
this means simply that A/w for such solutions is approximately a constant.

      ' See § 4 of letter on p. 385.
     ^ In his letter on p. 386 below, § 4, Dr. Arrhenius denies that he had any theoretical

and most authors suppose that kjm is constant for extreme dilution ; ' nevertheless
he seems to make the statement with a certain reserve, for in another passage he
Bays, " This numher [gramme-molecules per cc] can, according to aU the experi-
ments, be put proportional to the conductivity of attenuated solutions, provided
extreme attenuation be excepted." Nevertheless it is not difficult to prove that such
a proportionality follows from the principles postulated in his -work : and that pre-

cisely for solutions of extreme attenuation.'

     Then follows a proof, based on Kohkausch's surmises and Hittorfs hypotheses,

(1) That kjm is necessarily constant
(2) That luhen tiuo or moi-e salts are dissolved, the conductivity of the whole is

          the sum of the separate conductivities ; and
(3) That the conductivity of a solution equals the sum of conductivities of

          salt and solvent.

    To all this it is necessary and sufficient to remark that the surmises of a philo-
sopher, which are to some extent upset by his own experimental results and

accordingly by him stated ' with a certain reserve,' afford a very insecure basis for

an elaborate proof, and for deductions therefrom.^

   --If it be once granted 1st, that the conductivity of the water in solution is,

under all circumstances, nil, or extremely small ; 2nd, that every atom of a .salt

these laws by begging the question.

abstract of them would repay perusal, inasmuch as the author allows himself
rather too freely the use of hypothesis concerning wholly unknown molecular
interactions.' Perhaps it wUl he fairer if I give the resume in full.

                         Resume.

' In the first six sections of the present work we have described a new method

of measuring the resistance of electrolytic conductors. In this method we made

use of rapidly alternating currents, produced by a depolariser constructed for the

Wepurpose by M. Edlund.  have tried to show the use of this method, and to

make clear the practical advantages which it possesses.
    ' In the next part we have treated the process of making the observations, and

of calculating the results. Then we have displayed the figures found for very

dilute solutions of forty-five different bodies. Finally, we have discussed pre-

liminarily the figures obtained, with regard to the exponent of dilution, the mole-

cular conductivity, and the temperature-coefficient.

    ' In Chapter III. we have, guided by the data of MM. Kohlrausch and Hittorf,

laid down the proposition of the proportionality between the conductivity and the

number of electrolytic molecules of a dUute solution, as well as two other propo-

sitions, according to which the figures of the preceding part were calculated

(1) (2) (3). Moreover, we have shown that if these propositions are not applic-

able, it is necessary to suppose that by dilution of electrolytic solutions

chemical reactions are set up, (41 (5). Proceeding from these different proposi-

tions, we have shown that all salts, properly so called, in solution are composed

Weof complex molecules, which are partly destroyed by dilution.  have also

indicated the mamier in which these complexes are formed.

    ' By aid of this conception the properties of salts at all dilutions have been

explained, as well as the properties of all electrolytes at considerable concentration.

' On the other hand, hydrates,^ and salts which partially transform themselves

Weinto hydrates, manifest other properties when much diluted.  have shown that

this singularity can be explained by the action of impurities which accompany the

water used to dissolve them.

    ' By some considerations as to the nature of galvanic resistance we have been

brought to the conclusions numbered (7) (8) and (9), of which the two latter com-
plete the first : these indicate the long-known relation between gah'anic resistance

and internal fiiction. The two propositions (8) and (9) are also in agreement
with published data.'

    Thus much is a meagre account of the first part of the complete memoir. I
now pass to the far more striking second part, and shall find it necessary to give a
much fuller, and in many places verbatim, rejjort.

    I am not able to judge as to how much is original and new, as I am but
slightly acquainted with the work of previous writers on similar subjects, nor am I
at all confident how far the hypotheses made by the author are perfectly legitimate.
So far as I am able to judge, however, and making allowance for possible inade-
quacy of data and somewhat hasty generalisation, the paper seems to me to be

a distinct step towai-ds a mathematical theory of chemistry.
     The title affixed to it is ' The Chemical Theory of Electrolytes,' but it is a

                 § 1. Ammonia considered as an electrolyte.

     Kohlrausch has shown that a solution of ammonia, as regards conductivity,
behaves differently fi'om all other bases. It is a much worse conductor than potash,

and its exponent of dilution is not much bigger than 1 [i.e., its conductivity, instead

of increasing anything like so fast as concentration, scarcely increases at all].

Kohh'ausch guesses that the cause of this is the prevalence of NH^ in solution
instead of NH^HO. Probably dilution increases the supply of NH^HO, and

therefore assists conduction almost as much as it for other reasons vfeakens it.
This would explain the peculiarly small exponent of dilution.

           (14) The conductivity of anunoniacal solution is caused by a small quantity

                  of NH^HO, ivhich is increased by dilution,

     [Surely it is rash to make definite statements like this on such a slender

basis of fact.] ^

      § 2. Case of acids ; activity.

     Acetic acid has the same properties as ammonia ; so has boracic acid. Tartaric
and oxalic have small exponents of dilution. Probably the behaviom* of these
acids, as well as of ammonia, is analogous to that of HCl, which only conducts
in presence of water. Sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, behav^e in the same way.
Hence

(15)  The aqueous solution of any hydrate ^ is composed of tivopaHs, besides the
       ivater, viz., an active (electrolytic^ part and an inactive (non-electrolytic^
       pai't. The three constituent parts of the solution form a system in
       chemical equilibrium, such that dilution increases the active and

        diminishes the inactive pwtion.

   How the inactive and active portions differ is not certain, perhaps only

physically perhaps the active part is a compound of hydi'ate and solvent.
                                                          ;
    To fix ideas we can introduce the notion of a coefficient of activity, defined

thus :

     The coefficient of activity of an electrolyte is a number expressing the ratio of
the nmnber of ions which are really in the electrolyte to the number of ions which
it would enclose if the electrolyte were totally transformed into simple electrolytic

molecules.

     [This ' coefficient of activity ' is evidently the same thing as what, in accordance
with dissociation ideas of electrolytic conduction, I called ^ the ' dissociation ratio,'
i.e., the relation betvs'een the number of atoms taking part in conduction to the

whole number present. It may turn out that this ratio is unity, but it is in any

case well to determine it ; and the idea of Arrhenius that it is upon this that

chemical activity and rapidity of interchange depends seems to me important.]

                                                           thereof.

     [The continual interchanges of atoms supposed to occur among the molecules on

this view of conduction are here regarded as circular electric currents. References
to the original statements of the hypothesis are given as follows : Williamson,

     [^E.<j., Faraday's laws. I omit this section because it is not much use deducing
laws like these from an hypothesis. The Williamson-C'lausius hypothesis is of
course in harmony with the fundamental laws of the subject, otherwise it would
have been pretty soon abandoned. Probably the object of the author is to show
how readily the known laws can be built up from one simple foundation.* One

statement deduced from tliis hypothesis is worth quoting (see also Wiedemann,

'Elek.', vol. ii. p.924).]

(20)     Every hotly which acts chemically by double decomposition on an electro-
           lyte is itself an electrolyte, as ivell as the products of the decomposition.
           Therefore tuater, alcohol, aldehydes, Sfc. ^-c, are electrolytes, and

           therefore conductors.

     [The a priori manner in which this statement is made is striking ; so is the

note immediately following.]

     ' On this subject people have disputed for some time. They often attribute

the feeble conduction observed in these bodies to traces of saline impurity.'

§ 5. Eelation between conductivity and chemical power of acids
                                         and bases.

(21) The molecular conductivity of the active part of an acid {in dilute
          solution) is constant, and independent of the nature of the acid.

For if the chemical formula of an acid is IIR, its molecular conductivity, accord-

ing to Kohlrausch, is h + r. Now the molecidar conductivity of dilute salts with

the same metal, MR, MR', &c., is the same ; hence r = r'- &c. And therefore it

follows that for acids also the molecular conductivity of HR, HR', &c., is the
Asame.
         corollary is

(22) The more a dilute add solution conducts, the greater is its active part.

Similar propositions may be stated for bases.

[The author then goes on to consider the idea of coefficients of activity more

particularly in the light of the Williamson-Clausius view, and he gives reasons for

supposing molecular conductivity and coefficient of activity to be closely related,

and indeed proportional, to one another. He then says, let thon be defined to he

Aequal.  list of molecular conductivities for acids, bases, and salts from the

results of Kohlrausch is supplied, and it is pointed out that the best conducting

acids are the strongest. Appeal is made to the results of Berthelot, Thomson, and

Ostwald in support of this.]

'Thus we believe we have proved that for acids and bases galvanic activity is

accompanied by chemical activity,' and probably non-electrolytes have no direct

·chemical action. Cf. Gore on the inactivity of anhydrous HCl.

                       § 6. Double decomposition.

[This section is the key to the whole, and I had best translate it in full.]

ABSuppose two electrolytes,   and CD, are dissolved in an inactive solvent.

Circular currents pass in the solution [i.e., Williamson-Clausius atomic interchanges

Aoccur], whereby the bodies D and B C are formed. If the coefficients of
A Aactivity of all four bodies B, C D, D, and B C were equal, they would all be

present in the same quantity, viz., half an equivalent of each, provided the original

substances were in equivalent proportions. And in any case an equilibrium would

establish itself, the rate of formation of each substance being equal to its rate of

Nowdestruction.  the coefficient of activity of a body indicates that fraction of the

body which at any one time participates in the circular currents \i.e., is ready for
A B m ABinterchange]. If then this coefficient for
                                            is a, and if equivalents of

Aamexist in solution,                                           B which at any
                 expresses the number of equivalents of

moment take part in the circular currents.

One could figure to oneself the process of double decomposition in the following

manner. The ions of active molecules rotate round one another. Then, consider-

A Aing the molecules B, the ion moves with a certain velocity in the neighbour-

Bhood of until it comes near another ion, B', after which it follows B'. The

A Bmolecule  exists until this happens.

  --As now, from the preceding, the conductivity of the active parts of all salts is

the same that is to say, according to M. Kohlrausch, the velocity with which the

--ions move relatively to each other is independent of the nature of the salt, and only

depends on the strength of the current it is natural enough to suppose that the
said velocity is the same for all salts, even when the strength of current is zero,

      If the hypotheses supposed in the foregoing are only approximately true, the

above deductions are no more so. The effect would be to multiply the numbers

mp q and n by different factors, so that the general aspect of the above-deduced

expressions will be only slightly modified. The same thing can be said for the
equations we deduce in the sequel. However, as in the actual state of science it is
impossible to judge of the validity of these hypotheses, and as they have a certain

degree of probability, and of all hypotheses are the simplest we can imagine, it is

my intention to prove that the deductions which it is possible to draw from what

--has just been said are compatible with experimental facts facts of which we thus

give a certain explanation. With the progress of science it is possible that one
may see the necessity of modifying these hypotheses ; the general reasonino-s will

persist nevertheless, as well as the conclusions drawn from them.

ABthe fact that an equilibrium occurs between the system of two conjugates,                and

ADCD, and the system of their two opposites,   and CB, which are conjugate to

each other. From that system is formed this system, and vice versa ; wherefore

equilibrium occurs, because the number of circular currents in which both systems

are engaged is the same in the two cases. This is precisely the signification of

equation (2). This equation immediately shows that,

into words thus :

                 for the formation of a given quantity of salt (dx) a quantity of base
                 (dn) so much the greater as the formation of salt has proceeded further.

     Moreover, equation (4) shows that if n is greater than 1, the denominator is

--not very great, hecause \ x differs sensibly from zero ; so -^ will have a sensible

positive value even for n>l, which means

           (27) If one adds a feeble base to a feeble acid, or vice versa, the formation of
                     salt continues sensibly, even after the number of equivalents of the body
                       added has surpassed that of the other body.

     The figures calculated for boracic acid and ammonia exhibit this property clearly.
Between the two examples cited are a crowd of transitions which are realised by
mixing a strong acid with a feeble base, or vice versa. Everything depends on the
magnitude of the factor adj^y, and on p, the amount of water present. The laws

--deduced above have been long known by chemists. They are fundamental, and

occur in most reactions that is to say, in all reactions of electrolytes.
      If in equation (5) the factor aS//3y is a small number, as is probably the case

for alcoholates,- the quantity of salt formed is almost zero. So if one mixes
alcohol with any base, it only forms a very little alcoholate. But, according to law
(23), final equilibrium only depends on relative quantities of the ions present, so if
one adds water to an alcoholate it is destroyed, and turns into alcohol and hydrates.
Here the roles are changed ; water is an acid stronger than alcohol, so it is necessary
that water shall displace most of the alcohol, as nitric acid displaces water from a

hydrate, and this is in full agreement with fact. What is common to every case is

the necessity of regarding water as an acid (or, if one likes it better, as a base),
which concurs with other acids (or bases) in the equilibria.

                                                                                                  /J )'

     As, according to equation (4), is always negative, one perceives that the

presence of salt (q) has always an opposing influence on its formation, just as
water has. However, the quantity of salt present in the reactions is generally
small enough for this influence not to be noticeable.

                   § 7. Important case of double decomposition.

    From the simplified formula indicated above by an 'A,' one can at once deduce
some important propositions. From (2A), -vaz.

                                                                                                                          abO--x)in-x) =.T«/3y

one finds, by a discussion like that preceding prop. 24, that if one mixes two bodies
AB ADand CD, the bodies
                                                                                                                          and CB will also form ; and that the more as aSj^y is

greater.

the other hand, the conductivity of an alcoholate is comparable to that of a hydrate.

These two formulae indicate that

(30) The amount of salt decomposed by moderate dilution is approximately
           proportional to the square root of the quantity of water used to dissolve

       it.

A(31)  salt is completely split up if the watei' used to dissolve it is infinite.

    What is here said about water is evidently applicable to every other dissolviug

electrolyte.

    On this subject (the decomposition of salts by water) one reads in the work of
M. Berthelot (p. 199), ' The process of decomposition by water of the salts of feeble

acids is not always the same. Sometimes it iocreases little by little, either inde-
finitely with each addition of water, or tending towards a certain limit

Sometimes, on the contrary, the decomposition of a neutral salt is accomplished
almost wholly by the first dose of water.'

     Thus, 1st. The salts of strong acids with strong bases are not decomposed.
According to prop. 30 they ought to be. At the same time the example of the

previous section shows that the salt NaNOg is only decomposed "ISpercent. by 100

equivalents of water. Such quantities cannot be observed by any thermic means
(at least, not by any that M. Berthelot employed). This is the reason for supposing
that these salts are not decomposed at all. ... On the other hand, the salts
of strong acids with feeble bases are notably decomposed by water. Ammoniacal
salts behave in this manner. In M. Berthelot's work there are a crowd of examples.

     2nd. Salts of feeble acids are notably decomposed. For example, ammonic
borate is decomposed 59'6 per cent, by 100 equivalents of water. Such quantities
are well marked by thermal actions. Nevertheless, from what we have just said,

the decomposition ought to be illimitable. The reason why M. Berthelot has in

certain cases only found a limited decomposition is probably because his thermal ex-
periments did not permit the employment of more than 1,000 equivalents of water,
and because the decomposition is at first proportional to the square root of the
quantity of water added (later still less) ; whence the first dose of water has an
eflect equal to that of the three following doses, &c.

     3rd. As for salts which are almost wholly decomposed by the first addition of
water, they are those for which ^y is less than ab (alcoholates, for example"*

--' n means the number of equivalents of added substance for instance, water

for each equivalent of original substance e.g., salt.

Concerning these salts we have already said enough. [Then follows a physiological

application of law 29, and a reply to some feeble ohjections to the Williamson-

Clausius hypothesis.]

     Tn general the case in which four electrolytes alone establish a chemical equui-
brium is rather rare. The most frequent case is that of six or nine electrolytes
acting on one another. However, it is not difficult to establish general equations
for a system of nv electrolytes, composed of v cations and n anions. Let them be

the following :

ii Ji , ii Jj . . .               Jnii Jn ; ij Ji > ^2 Ja · · · · · · i«                  ;· · ·

Further, let us call the quantity

the active mass of the electrolyte Ij J; .

Then, in the same manner as in § 6 above, we find a set of equations analogous to

(1) and (2), and they take this form :

                                t = V j=n

                                .= =1 ;      1

                                        2(.>i\> = 0, and S^V^'O = 0-

    These are n+v fresh equations, one more than is required, but one of them is

not independent.

     Thus we have all the equations necessary for the solution of the problem.
     The general equation of the system (A) is

or

    This equation contains the following proposition :

    (32)  When equilibrium i^ established among any numbei- of electrolytes, the

           product of the active masses of two conjugate electrolytes is equal to
            the product of the active masses of their tivo opposites, just as if no
            other electrolytes were present.

-- This extremely simple proposition contains the solution of the general problem
   if one mixes a number of electrolytes together in any proportion, what

reactions will occur? By a discussion similar to that preceding prop. 24, one

recognises easily that

    (33) Bodies possessing the smallest coefficients of activity are most likely to
               he formed at the expense of opposite bodies.

          § 9. Applications of the foregoing paragraph.

    In practice the case which most often presents itself is that of two electrolytes,

-whose four ions are different, put to react on each other in a slightly active solvent
We(most commonly water).
                          will consider some important special cases.

    Case 1. The two electrolytes are a very active acid, and the salt of a less

active acid. Let the initial quantities be n and 1. If no water were present, the

equation of equilibrium would be

          («-.r) (l-.r) aS = .r^/3y                                    2a

But, by reason of the presence of water, the salts, of which the quantities will

be --1 .V and .r, get into equilibrium with the water and their respective acids and
--bases. So minute quantities are decomposed by the water, and the quantities 1 x

-- --and .V will be a little diminished especially 1 .r, the salt of the less active acid.

Let us write these so reduced quantities

                                           Izfiand^

                                                      X ^·

Similarly the quantity of reacting acids n -- x and x will be a little increased,

especially the latter. Call the actual quantities

                                      X (n -- x) and px.

Calculation indicates that the greatest of the quantities x and Xy}/, and p, does not
differ appreciably from 1 unless afi is excessively great in comparison with j3y.

So, writing ^'>^lpx=T, we have proved that T£tl if 0y is comparable to aS. If,
on the other hand, a8ll3y is very big, r will differ from unity, but stiU t · adj^y will

be enormously great, and hence in the equation

                                        {n--x) (l--x) T = x^

                                                                                                /3y

it is still necessary to suppose x almost equal to n or to 1, whichever is least. The
role of the water consists in delaying the process a little, and can, from a broad

                                                                                                            BB2

point of view, te neglected. The same can be said of any other solvent of very-

Wesmall ' active mass.'  are, then, in a position to assert the following pro-

position :

(34) More active acids displace less active acids from solution of their

               salts.

     This is the proposition which, valid for bases also, is foimd in § 5 to agree so-
well with reality.

    [To avoid the appearance of verbal obviousness in this statement, we can

remember that by ' more active ' the author means ' having a higher molecular

conducti^'ity.']

     Case 2. Both electrolytes are salts very little decomposable by water. In this
case the water may of course be neglected, and q/3 nearly equals /3y ; so from
equation (2a) one perceives that x has a magnitude comparable to w -- a.- or 1--x.
Thus a sensible partition of the bases among the acids will be effected.

(35)        If txDO salts, of which the four ions are different, are dissolved in ivater
              {or any other solvent), the two other salts possible 2oill form to such
             degree that their amounts will he comparable to the amounts of the
              primitive salts, when the four salts are not notably decomposed by the

            solvent.

    This proposition, very often verified, expresses a general opinion accepted by

chemists. (<S'ee Berthelot.)

  --Case 3. If, on the other hand, one of the four possible salts say that with the
--coefficient /3 is to a high degree decomposable by the solvent (which is the case

if it be composed of a feeble acid and a feeble base), but none of the others,
an equilibrium will establish itself between this salt, its acid, its base, and the

solvent, in such a way that only a certain fraction, - , remains as a salt in the

                                                                                         P
system, of the quantity which would be found if the salt were not decomposed,
(2a) takes the form

                                     {n-x)(l-x)a8= - 8y.

                                                                                    P

So X will increase with p, that is to say

           (36) In solutions of tico salts, of which one is composed of strong acid
                   and feeble base, the other of feeble acid and strong base, the strong acid
                      unites by preference with the strong base, leaving the feeble base to the
                    feeble acid. This latter salt is naturally in great part decomposed by

                          the solvent.

     This proposition has been experimentally proved by M. Berthelot (p. 712).
     Case 4. If two feeble acids have the same base, M. Berthelot believes he has
proved that a sensible partition is effected. According to what has just been said,

this ought to be a special case of 1, so that if the acids are almost equally strong

a partition occurs ; if, on the other hand, one of them is much the stronger, it seizes
on a portion of base incomparably the larger. The work of M. Berthelot gives
examples of both cases. Thus a partition occurs between hydrocyanic and boracic
acids ; while the phenol of the phenate of potassium is displaced by boracic acid.

                                 § 10. Influence of acid salts.

     Salts called ' acid ' are in general completely decomposed by water in sufficient
quantity. According to M. Hittorf, acid phosphates are exceptions. Nevertheless,
we have proved that NaH,,POjj is partly decomposed by great dilution (see
Part I. § 19).

     The ions of acid salts are on the one hand a metal, and on the other the rest
of the molecule. If, then, one mixes sulphuric acid vpith, say, sulphate of soda,

a portion of NaHSO^ is formed. But NaHS04 behaves as any other salt, i.e.,.
                                -- ----

        ON ELECTROLYSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 373

its ?I is not an ion. So that the part of HjSO^ contained in NaHS04 has no

effect, i.e., is totally inactive. Thus equilibrating systems are set up which do not
agree with calculations based upon the coefficient of activity of H,S04 above given.

And an equivalent of an acid- salt-forming acid (such as sulphuric, oxalic, &c.)

cannot completely displace an equivalent of a more feeble acid from its salt, as
prop. 33 asserts. [References to Berthelot.]

     The calculation of the relative quantities of electrolytes contained in a system
where acid salts occur goes on in the manner indicated above. Only it is necessary
to observe that if the acid is r-basic, and if an acid salt is found in which a hydro-
gen atoms of the acid are replaced by a metal radical, it loses, for each equivalent of
acid salt formed, r/o- equivalents of acid. So equation (2) becomes

                          -_(1 ar) (w 1:^') ab\ ={,q + x){p + x) /3y,

                                                                        O"/

where n is the number of equivalents of acid added since the commencement,
and \, p, q are the corresponding quantities for base, water, and salt.

      If several salts (acid and neutral) form simidtaneously, the calculation will be
more complicated, as is seen most clearly by an example. Suppose one has at

the beginning n . H.^SO^ and 1 . KCl ; let there be formed x . K^SO^, y . KHSO^,
and some HCl ; the equation (2a) will take the form

                     {l-x-y) (w-.r~2y)aS = {x^ + y^') {x + i/)y,

where a, (3, /3', y, 8 are the coefficients of activity of KOI, ^K^SO^, KHSO^, HOI,
and IH0SO4 respectively.

     Between .r and y there is a i-elation which is also a function of the quantities
present in the equilibrium of free acids, neutral salt, and solvent, a relation of
which the form still remains to be determined by experimental methods.

        § 11. Equilibrium of heterogeneous systems.

[By ' heterogeneous,' Arrhenius means systems out of which one constituent

is separated from solution in either the solid or gaseous form, and so removed

from action to whatever extent it is insoluble. He quotes from Berthelot and

Williamson about the formation of precipitates by double decomposition, and

the continual postponement of equilibrium by the dropping out of one consti-

tuent.

He then considers a system of four bodies, IjJj, l^J^, l.Ji, IjJo, of which one
A(say the last) is but slightly soluble.
                                          constant quantity, e, of this remains in

jsolution, however much of it is formed or destroyed (time being allowed for pre-

cipitate to re-dissolve ad lib.).

Then, a, /3, y, 8 being the respective coefficients of activity, and .r the amount of

I] Jj, and of loJi, formed from an original one equivalent of IjJi and any amount

·of IjJj, the equation (2a) is

                                   a(l-x)cdl= x'^y-

So X has a magnitude depending on e, and if c happen to be zero, x vanishes.]

    We have thus given an analytic proof of the law of Berthelot,

        (37) If of four bodies, (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), one of them (2,2) has
                   such physical propeHies that it separates wholly or nearly so from
                    the system, this body (2,2) and its conjugate (i,l) are formed,
                    to the exclusion more or less entire of the opposite bodies, (1,2) and

                         (2,1).

If more than one substance is insoluble the equation may be, either
                                         =.r-/3-y cc'ab,

                                   c'x^y = c(l -x)ab.

§ 12. Consequence of the variation of the activity-coefficient iu
                                 homogeneous systems.

      [Since provisionally Arrlienius supposed the coefficient of activity to be
identical with molecular conductivity, he goes on to consider the effect of its
varying vrith pressure and temperature as conductivity does. Pressure-variation

--he considers nil, or unknown. Temperature-variation he considers linear, 1 + bt.

So he writes (2a)

           - -(1 .r) a (1 + b^t) (n .v) 8 (1 + b^t) = .r=/3 (1 + bj) y (1 + b^t),

but then says that the b are about equal for all salts and for all bases, and fairly
equal for all monobasic acids ; so the temperature terms cancel each other in pairs-
nearly ; and he states the laws.]

     (38)  Tfie equilibi-ium of a homogeneous system is independent of pressure.
     (39)  The relative quantities offour bodies, like tivo acids ' and two salts, or two

              bases and tivo salts, or four salts, in a system in equilibrium, only va7"y

               very slightly with temperature.

     The first is in accord with Bunsen and Berthelot ; the second with Ostwald,^

who has verified it between 20° and 100° for HCl, HNO, and two salts of these
acids with a single base. He has further shown that these two acids have the

same activity between these temperatures by letting them act on calcic oxalate.^

     M. Ostwald has also determined the relative coefficients of affinity of different

acids with regard to the same base.

  --He let two acids act simultaneously on a given base as, for example,.

KHO, MgO, &c. The acids employed were HCl, HNO3, and H.^SO^. The term

' relative coefficient of affinity ' expresses the ratio between the fractions of the

base which the two acids seize. If one mixes KNO3 with HCl, one equivalent of
each, there will be formed .t equivalent of KCl and x of HNO3, and there will
remain --(1 .f) equivalents of KNO3 and of HCl. The coefficients of activity

being /3, y, a, b, respectively, x is given by the equation

                                            {l-xfab = x^^y,

HNO3and so the relative coefficient of affinity of HCl :  i^

              «                    ^/i;/3:y>)

                 = i£s

     If instead of potassium one uses Bodium, y and 8 remain, but a and fi change,
Q, however, need not change unless a'j^' is different from a//3.

(If acid salts are formed, a modification is necessary.)

Molecular conductivities given above (§5) make one suspect that changing a base
KHOfrom
           to ZnO or MgO will diminish the value of Q for HNO, : H^SO^andfor

HCl : H,SO,.

For the rest : because the activity-coefficientsofHNOjandHClare about equal^

and the same for salts formed from these acids, their relative coefficient of aiEmity

ought to be nearly 1, whatever the base on which they are allowed to act.

Here are Ostwald's numbers :

ON ELECTEOLTSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 375

In a word, we believe experiment has verified the following- rule deduced from

the present theory :

HR(40) If an acid                                       acts on a salt MR', and if a and ^ are the activity-

                                     MR' MR,coefficients of the salts
                                                              and           the coefficients of relative affinity

                                     HRbetween the acids      and HR' vary almost proportionally to the

                                     square root of the quotient aj^.

    In § ] 3 of the first part we remarked that the molecular conductivities of diflerent
salts approach each other, in such a way that they would seem for extreme attenu-
ation to advance towards a common limit. It follows that the quotient a/j3

approaches more and more to unity, and that the different values of a//3 become equal.

    QThis is why the relative affinity beco7nes more and more constant as dilution

increases-- a, relation Ostwald thinks he has already perceived with dilutions less

extreme.

     The activity-coefBcients of acids and bases also approach equality as dilution

increases.

(41) Consequently the coefficients of relative affinity of acids _ approach more
          and tnore to unity as dilution increases.

M. Ostwald has also on this subject made some measurements which confirm

the justness of the above proposition. His researches on the magnitude of the

coefficient of relative affinity of HjSO^ indicate that at extreme dilutions this

HNO^coefficient
            is                    *  almost  equal  to  that  of HNO3,  at  least  it  rises  to  '9           (that  of
                                                                                                            '

bein^ 1), while at moderate dilutions it is '5 or less.

   QTo the invariability of for acids and bases M. Ostwald adds a fact of great

importance. The molecular conductivities of feeble acids and bases increase rapidly

with dilution, i.e., the value of d' in weak solution is much greater than that of

QS in                                    increases also, if we compare either of them with a strong acid
strong                               so
                               ;

or base, which is nearly unaffected by addition of water, for

                                             Q /^= A          for small dilution,

Hence                                                                        aS'

             (42)                           Q'=V for large dilution.

                                  The relative affinities offeeble acids and bases (compared with a strong
                                    acid or a strong base) increase considerably as dilution goes on increasing.

     This is the reason for not attributing to these ' coefficients of relative affinity,'

or ' avidities' as M. Thomsen calls them, a too great importance. By believing
them constant one may seem to incline strongly towards regarding them as funda-

mental niunbers. Besides, the determinations of them by different workers do Jiot

agree well with each other.

(43) As the activity coefficients of different acids change a little unequally

           with temperature, the relative affinity of two acids ought also to vary
           with temperature.

Thus the activity-coefficient of H.,SO^ increases more slowly than that of

monobasic acids (HCl or HNO3), whence it evidently residts that its affinity, relative

Weto either of these acids, diminishes as the temperature rises.                                  can give only a

rough calculation. The temperature-coefficient of conductivity for HCl or HNOj

exceeds by 4 per cent, that of H2SO4 at 20° G. ; so Q, which is proportional to square

root of conductivity, will vary by about 2 per cent, per degree at this temperature.

The temperature-coefficient for H^SO^ is still less at higher temperatures, so its

relative affinity ought to diminish faster at these temperatures. Experience agrees

with this as well as one can expect.

M. Ostwald has found the following figures for the relative affinity of HCl to

HjSO^:--
---- ^                                                              --

376 EEPORT-- 1886.

QOn the other hand, for HCl : HNO3, is almost constant, only varying from I'OO to

1-02 between 0° and 60°.

A great part of the cited observations (those on HjSOJ have been explained

Weby Ostwald as due to the formation of acid salts at moderate dilution.   do

Wenot wish to deny this as a vera causa.  have already, in § 10, shown that

Qthe coefficient of activity diminishes for this reason. So naturally diminishes

Qtoo. Nevertheless, it is difficult to explain thus the variation of with tempera-

ture. It seems much more reasonable to admit the explanation given above.

Finally, we will consider what ought to happen to a salt solution if its tempera-

ture rise. For this it is necessary to observe -that the temperature coefficient of

--a concentrated hydrate is much greater than that of a weak solution. Thus, accord-

ing to M. Kohlrausch

                                    ,,

As this rule is without known exception, it seems permissible to attribute to water,
which is also a hydrate, a coefficient much surpassing the coefficients of dilute
compounds (which latter coefficients are almost equal among themselves). Some

figures of Ayrton and Perry {Proc. Phys. 80c., II. 178 [1877]) tend to confirm this.
Similarly, the coefficient of a salt solution is sensibly greater than that of a hydi-ate.

Looking, then, at the equation of equilibrium of a saline solution

(,p + x)xab{l + b,t) (1 + b^t) = (1-xy ^y(l + bj) (1 + b^t),

we see that 6, and b^ are bigger than b.^ and b^, and therefore that the value of
l--.r obtained from it will increase with ^. --But 1 .r signifies the amount of salt

decomposed, so

(44) The quantity of salt decomposed in a solution is increased if the tempera-
            ture of the solution rises.

     This will be true also for other electrolytic solvents, according to the law of

Hittorf (see § 4). One may imagine that this important law can be otherwise
deduced from the idea of a dissociation of salt molecules. True, physics show
that at high temperatures the movements of molecules are more vigorous. But
this does not point out why water then attacks salts more strongly. One often

slurs over these difficulties by saying that heating (as well as dilution) brings to
the solution a foreign energy opposed to chemical action. But what then is the
import of chemical laws if they can be annulled by causes which never disappear

completely, and of which one does not know how to calculate the effect ?
     The above law is so generally adopted, and verified by a crowd of cases so

enormous, that it is not necessary to cite any of them.

§ 13. Consequences of the variation of the coeflBcient of activity
                    and of solubility in heterogeneous systems.

    The influence of the variation of the coefficient of activity is much greater for
heterogeneous systems in equilibrium than for homogeneous ones. The equation

(2a) has the form

                          (l-.r)a.eS = .r')3y,

quantity of its conjugate body, and x the dissolved quantity of its opposite. The

coefficients of activity are S, a, (3, and y, respectively.
      Let us first examine the influence of pressure.

    If the body whose mass is c is a solid, one may reckon that pressure affects

nothing, and so

       A(45) system heterogeneous xvith regard to a solid is independent of pressure

      This proposition is in full agreement with fact, according to the researches of

M. Bunsen (Liebig's Ann., T. 6.5, p. 81, 1848).

      If, on the other hand, the c body is a gas, c will be approximately proportional
to the pressure of the gas in question on the surface of the solvent. So if this pres-
sure is zero, x = 0. This case is realised if one lets the gas escape from the solvent
as fast as it is produced. If the pressure increases, c increases also. For this
reason the opposite bodies (whose masses are x ^ and x y) will increase, and the con-
jugate bodies will diminish. Such a phenomenon has been observed in a lot of cases.

     If, for instance, one of the opposite bodies is also a gas, as (for instance) when
HjS acts on an alkaline carbonate, one has the equation

                           =0---x) a ,cd c'3. Xy.

By giving to the pressure of IIoS a sensible value, and by separating the carbonic

acid which is liberated [e.g., by means of a continuous stream of HjS], one finally
-arrives at the result that c', and therefore --also 1 .r, are zero, i.e., that all the

carbonate will be transformed into sulphide. Vice versa, by leaving to c' a sensible

value, and decreasing c, one could displace the H,,S of an alkaline sulphide by CO.,.

      Nevertheless, in the majority of cases the mass of gas dissolved is small in

comparison with other matter dissolved. In this case x, that is the quantity of

 opposite bodies formed, will be insignificant, so that the influence of the gas on the

system is not notable. Thus, we cannot in general observe changes of equihbrium
produced by the presence of gas, unless the dissolved quantity of the opposite body

is very small. This case is realised if the body is either gaseous or but slightly
soluble, and it has been considered. But in the second case, one could perceive
the influence of the gas, for the products due to its presence would precipitate them-

selves and disappear from the system. The precipitations of metallic salts by H^S

is a well-known example.

    An influence, analogous to this of pressure, is exerted by temperature if the

body with regard to which the system is heterogeneous is solid. The solubility of
 solids increases with heating. So c and x increase, while 1--x, the quantity of
conjugate body, diminishes. This conclusion has been verified by numerous
experiments. One finds many in the works of M. Ostwald, who has studied the
phenomena accompanying the solution of some oxalates (CaCjO^^ or ZnOjO^) by an
acid. M. Ostwald expresses the said conclusion thus :

    (46) The effect of a rise of temperature on the quantities dissolved hy a
               given acid at constant dilution is always to increase them.

    Another way of increasing the dissolved quantity, c, of a slightly soluble body

is to increase the volume of the solution (i.e., to add solvent). In this case one

increases fi and y also, as well as a. At the same time solubility can be diminished
hy diminution of concentration, as we shall soon see. But in most cases these

disturbing influences cannot compensate the increase of c by augment of volume.

So

    An(47)  increase of solvent increases the body opposite to, and diminishes

    the body conjugate to, the solid 2vith regard to which the system is

    --heterogeneous (if the perturbing influences are not too great).

    Ostwald, J.fiirpract. Vhemie (1881), T. 23, p. 517, and T. 24, p. 486.

    [The author then goes on to consider these ' perturbing causes.' He quotes

examples where the solubility of one substance in water has been shown to be

increased by the addition of some other salt. He explains this phenomenon on
his theory, and holds that the theory of Guldberg and Waage is insufficient to

-account for it, and, moreover, that it is not in agreement with the numerical

results of Ostwald.]

                       § 14. Action between liquids and solids.

     [The author claims even for solids a certain electrolytic conductivity, and hence
a certain, though very small, coefficient of activity. It is thus necessary for
completeness to consider the action between liquids and insoluble solids. But

inasmuch as the activity of even a trace in solution is much greater, because spread

all through a liquid, than the action of a limited area of surface can be, he says the

latter may be safely neglected, and states the law]

           (48) If a system is heterogeneous with respect 1o a solid body, of tohich, never-
                      theless, a very small part is dissolved in the surrounding liquid, one
                       can neglect the reactions which occur at the surfaces of contact between
                     liquid and solid.

[In accordance with a previous section the velocity with which Ij Jj and I^ Jj

are formed (or with which Ij 3^ and I^ Ji are destroyed), i.e., the velocity of

the reaction, is

                  K py(g' /3 .  -- ma . n8).

The author applies this to etherifications, where the water, alcohol, and ether have

insignificant coefficients, the acid being the only active body. In this case the
velocity is proportional to ^y, and so simply to the activity of the acid used, being
quicker with nitric than with acetic]

                         § 16. Calculation of numerical examples.

     The coefficients of activity being not quite constant, according to the first part^

         § 19. Cases to which Berthollet's laws are not applicable.

     M. Berthelot cites some of these cases. They can be put under two general

heads. Either a feeble hydrate is unable to displace a stronger hydrate, although
one of the products of displacement is but slightly soluble, or a volatile acid

(HCl and HNO3) partially displaces another acid (H^SO^), although this acid is

not volatile.

     The first case is represented by the formula

                               <{l-xy'a8 = a;»/3y e«/3y,^

where the feeble hydrate and the salt of the strong hydrate are present in equiva-
lent quautities (originally 1), and where c is the soluble quantity of the sUghtly
soluble substance, x is the quantity of this substance formed, but as x is less than
c none is precipitated.

  --One may write the inequality, a foi-tiori,

                                         (l-c)2a5< c^iSy,

                                  l-c^VWy'

so if this inequality is satisfied there is no precipitate, a belongs to the feeble
hydrate, /3 to the strong, 5 to the salt of the latter, y to the salt of the former

(the slightly soluble substance). aS//3y is in general pretty small, so c may be

very small and yet no precipitation occur.

    As to the second case, no HCl escapes, and so the system is really homogeneous,

and a straightforward partition occurs.

   We believe we have proved that objections made to the theory of Berthollet

are avoided by the theory here presented.

                 § 20. Production of heat in chemical reactions.

    As we know, M. Thomsen considers that all bases, if they exist in the form of
dissolved hydrates, generate the same quantity of heat when dissolved in the same
quantity of an acid. This he calls 'saline thermo-neutrality.' On the other

--hand, all acids do not generate the same heat when united to a given base -a

circumstance which has appeared very odd to thermo-chemists. After what we
have just said, however, it appears to me possible to explain it. It is evident

that the thermo-chemical parity between two hydrates cannot obtain unless both
are in the active state. In the inactive state analogous compounds do not play
the role of hydrates (acids or bases), since they cannot unite to a hydrate of any
other nature (of contrary sign) and form water and salt. So instead of supposing,

as M. Thomsen does, that the hydrates are in a ' forme dissoute,' we suppose them

--to be in the active state. After that we put forth the following very natural

hypothesis :

      The chemical 2)vocess, hy reason of which a system of one equivalent of acid (active')
and one equivalent of base {also active), transforms itself into a neio system, consist-
ing of a salt (not complex) and ivater, is accompanied by the same heat-production
independent of the nature of the acid or base.

     The diiferent processes which go on during the neutralisation of an acid or a^

tase (both supposed partially inactive) are the following :

      1. Neutralisation of the active parts.
      2. Transformation of inactive parts into active ones.

     3. Neutralisation of these new active parts.

     4. Formation of molecular complexes of the salt produced.
      5. Possible solidification of the salt.

     Between these five processes it is the sum of the heats produced in 1 and 3
per equivalent of salt formed which ought to be constant, according to tlie above

hypothesis.

     The existence of the processes 2, 4, and 5 explains how it happens that the

actual heat-production can be different in different cases.
      [Omitting 5, and considering 4 as small, the author points out that No. 2 pro-

cess is of least importance for strong acids and bases, and accordingly that for

these the heat-production may really be nearly constant. But for weak acids and

bases a good deal of heat is consumed in the No. 2 process. For remember that
' strong ' means, in his view, ' having a high percentage of active molecules,' and
* weak ' means ' having very few active molecules.' Moreover, since a molecule's

 activity is allied vdth, or equivalent to, its dissociation, it is very natural that its
production should be a heat-consuming process. Slight residual differences he

explains by No. 4 process, considering sulphates and acetates as more complex

--than chlorides, nitrates, &c., and makes the following statement :

            (51) Increase of complexity is accompanied by production of heat.

          (52) Transformation from the inactive to the active state is accompanied by

                          absorption of heat.
           (53) During neutralisation a feeble acid or base generates in general less

                        heat on the whole than a strong one.

     Since now for salts it happens that the activity is smaller as the complexity i»

greater (see § 2), and the formation of molecular complexes is (by 50) followed by a
generation of heat, it is necessary that for salts also the transformation from
inactive to active state shall be accompanied by heat-absorption. But, by prop. 33,
 bodies endowed with the smallest activity have the greatest chance of being
formed. Thus it follows that

          (54) In chemical reactions among electrolytes those bodies are in general
                    formed in greatest quantity, the formation of which is accompanied by

                          the greatest heat-production.

    This is the ' principle of maximum work,' modified. It is valid in general,

not always.

     [Neglecting now the above process 4, the author points out that process 2 has
two parts, one concerned with the acid only, the other with the base only. Call

these 2a and 2b. Processes 1 and 3 he considers all along as giving a constant
thermal eflect ; and so he splits up the total heat-productiou H, by all the processes,
thus

                             H-^S = (Aj + A3) + A,a + Ajj,

--and states

       A B(55) The heat produced by the neutralisation of an acid by a base (less

                       heat of possible solidification) is equal to a constant, plus a term de-
                      pending on the nature of the acid only, plus another depending only on
                        the nature of the base.

Clausius and Williamson is that there exist circular continuous currents. In these

currents the active parts alone participate.

' The molecules participating in such currents are necessarily decomposed, accord-

ing to the scheme of double decomposition, and the result is that new electrolytes
are formed. On this basis we have built a chemical theory of electrolytes which,

deduced from very probable sources, possesses also a high degree of probability.

This theory leads to formulae applicable to chemical processes, formulae very con-

formable to those proposed by MM. Guldberg and Waage,* which have been

We·verified by a great number of experiments.                         have also pointed out that the

results of this theory agree very accurately with the opinions of Berthollet.

    ' As a provisional hypothesis we have supposed the coefRcient of activity equal

to the molecular conductivity. The figures calculated on this supposition, and the

Wereactions thus foreseen, agree very well with experimental facts.                                    have also

from this theory deduced a number of electro-chemical laws, among others the

laws of Faraday and Hittorf ; as well as, by aid of the hypothesis that every

electrolyte has a constant composition, we have proved the necessity for the exist-

nce of equivalent weights of every substance playing the part of an ion (law of

Eichter). From data on the variations of conductivity and of solubility we have
indicated the reason of a number of phenomena which are set up in equilibrating

systems, by dilution, by heating, and by addition of foreign bodies. Finally we

have, by aid of an hypothesis very probable in the present state of thermo-che-

mistry, deduced the principal propositions of therm o-chemistry (among others the

*' principle of maximum work ") propositions which, however, by reason of the
                                                                                                                                       ;

mode of their deduction, are not valid in every case, but only " in general." Also
we have indicated the nature of chemical energy, as analogous to that of latent

heat ; an indication with which specific heats, latent heats, and the phenomena of

dissociation, correspond.

' All these propositions, and all these laws, are taken from the most different de-

partments  of chemical  science                              but  as  the theory agrees so well  with  reality  in
                                                          ;

these diflferent points, it seems probable that it ought to do so also in intermediate

regions. Moreover, we have tried to prove that the differences between this theory

and that which, after the examination of M. Lothar Meyer, is now the most pro-

bable, relate to opinions of the authors of the said theory, which to a deeper exa-

mination show themselves unsustainable either from the theoretical or the

Weexperimental point of view.                                have thus approached the theory of Berthollet

more nearly than MM. Guldberg and Waage have done. And this circumstance

speaks, we believe, in favour of the above-developed theory. But,there are considera-

tions of greater importance. The theory of Guldberg and "Waage (still less any other

theory) cannot in its present state deduce more than a fraction of the propositions

and laws given above. The constants necessary for the prevision of reactions can,
according to the new theory, be approximately deduced from other constants
known in other branches of science. Some of the propositions given above, and

agreeing with fact, are contrary to the views of MM. Guldberg and Waage. The

difficulty inherent in every theory of electrolysis, and also in the hypothesis of

Clausius and Williamson in its primitive form, is totally removed by the new

theory. Since, moreover, the theory given above is built on a substantial foundation,
and is totally free from every hypothesis of an affinity different from physical forces,

it is not doubtful, we think, that it will be preferred to all chemical theories

hitherto published.

' True, one might object that this theory is only applicable to electrolytes, while

previous ones have embraced all substances.

     ' The probability of the correctness of the theory is increased to a high degree by
the fact that in deducing the formulae given above we ignored completely those of

MM. Guldberg and Waage, formula of whose existence we had no knowledge before

obtaining the work of M. Lothar Meyer (which only happened after the greatest part
of this memoir had already been written). Thus we have found these formulae without
any occasion to construct them in some preconceived manner, and guided solely by
the theory of Clausius and Williamson, and by the notion of an active and an inactive

state of electrolytes. [Author's note.]

    ' Against this we remark that chemical knowledge is mainly based on the re-

action of electrolytes, which seem in chemistry to play the same role as gases do in
the mechanical theory of heat. For the rest, the idea of an electrolyte has an
application much wider (according to the law of Hittorf ) than one is accustomed to

attribute to it. And reactions in general seem to manifest a considerable analogy

to those of electrolytes, so that one could perhaps in the future enlarge the theory
given for electrolytes, until it becomes, with some modification, applicable to all

substances.'

The criticism of the first part of Dr. Arrhenius' memoir given above being some-

what stringent, I thought it best to send a proof copy to the author in case h&

might wish to reply. He has favoured me with a letter touching on various

points, and in order to assist in the elucidation of them it seems most satisfactory

to print it here, numbering its paragraphs so as to make it easy to connect them

mywith the parts of  criticism to which they refer (see pp. 357-364).  It would seem

that I have been misled by the form in which the paper is written, especially by

the italicised and numbered statements with which it abounds, into criticising parts

of it from rather too elevated a stand-point, as if the statements were intended

for rigorous laws.                                                     0. L.

  Translation of a letter received from Dr. Arrhe7iius respecting the above Criticism.

  --' Dear Sik, Yesterday evening I received your friendly postcard and a copy of

your criticism on my work. For both I thank you, and at once proceed to give an

answer thereto as the subject requires.

    '1. To your remarks against my experimental method (" I must confess to

surprise, &c. . . . self-induction and electro-chemical capacity being so mixed

up in it ") I wish to observe that self-induction in the galvanometer coil has no

effect. Self-induction possibly occurs in the rheostat, as well as electrochemical

capacity in the liquid. Quite the same sources of error, however, occur ia
Kohlrausch's method also, to the same or even a higher degree ; and on considera-
tion you will hardly deny this.' The alternating currents used by him have just
about the same total intensity as mine, so polarisation is about the same in the two

    · This opens a large question, viz., how far it is advisable to depend on the use of

alternating currents as a device for avoiding polarisation difficulties. At first sight
it might seem as if the mere fact of alternation was a sufficient safeguard ; but when
the extreme rapidity of rise and decay of polarisation is remembered, confidence in
alternating currents is much diminished. In his early experiments Kohlrausch used
a sine inductor, and in his later researches carefully considered the effect of the
disturbing elements (see Jubelband, Poffff. Ann., page 290). With a simple harmonic
current of small period it is possible for self-induction and polarisation capacity to
neutralise each other's effect; and in any case it is comparatively easy to take
them into account. The equation to the current is

p is calculable from the following data : the decomposition products oi^^ milligramme

of water on two platinum plates, each one metre square, give an E.M.F. of one

DanieU ; consequently, knowing L, p, E, and measuring C* with a dynamometer, it is
possible to calculate the true value of R. Or, by arranging that the polarisation

pcoefficient  is equal to m^L, all disturbance vanishes, and the resistance can be

measured quite simply by a bridge method. Unless the question of electro-chemical

capacity be thus considered, and either eliminated by calculation or proved to be

negligible by experiment, the presumed advantage of alternating currents in deal-

ing with electrolytic resistance is illusory.                          O. L.

cases ; on the other hand, he had six times as many alternations of currents per

 second, so the self-induction of his rheostat must be greater than that of mine (§ 3).

On quite other grounds, Kohlrausch's method is preferable. I may also say that

 Kohlrausch used a galvanometer for measuring higher resistances.

      2.·' Secondly, concerning your remark on subtracting the conductivity of the

water in order to find that of the dissolved salt. This mode of calculation I use,

 not only because it corresponds with later established " laws," but also on true d

posterioi-i grounds (which indeed the reader of your critique cannot guess ; cf. Pt. I.

 § 9). It would, however, to my mind, be little logical not to show that the rule
corresponds also with the general laws, according to my apprehension of them. So

I cannot understand your objection to this paragraph. The law of divided circuit
is, so far as I know, really true when two electrolytes are mixed. According to

my hypothesis, the conductivity of a solution is equal to the sum of the number of

ions, each divided by the friction it experiences against the fluid. This view leads

necessarily to the law in question, and it is also a necessary consequence of the

Williamson-Clausius hypothesis. I regret I cannot enter fully into this here. I

have, moreover, applied this rule throughout my memoir on conductivity of mixed
solution with, so far as I see, complete success. You say quit« simply, " which is
untrue." I wish you would tell me of any weU-eatablished fact against it. I am of

opinion that there exists no basis for the opinion that the law of divided circuits

does not apply to dilute solutions.'

     ' 3. Thii'dly, " that the conductivity of water itself remains unaffected by the

presence of a foreign body ; which is improbable."

     ' It appears as if you meant that the conductivity which Kohlrausch and I have

myproved to exist in our distilled water is really the conductivity of water. That

experiments contradict this is indubitable, and Kohlrausch also attributes it to

traces of saline impurity. Reaction-velocities give a pretty safe judgment on this
subject. I have thus pretty clearly shown that there are salts which cause the

greatest part of this conductivity (Part I. § 11). The probable effect of the

foreign body is to take much of the water from the said salts (cf. my memoir on

conductivity of mixtures). The salts, however, change their molecular conductivity

very little with great dilution ; and so the apparent conductivity of water does
remain very nearly unaffected by the presence of a foreign body in very dilute solu-

tion. I could say much more on this if time permitted.

   m' 4. Fourth, " The first approximation to the relation between k and is that

made by Kohlrausch, viz., that the two are proportional. This is roughly true for

very dilute salt-solutions."

 1111* For example, copper acetate (see Part I. p. 40) has the following :

                                 276' 200' 1254' 6586'

                  m-=320, 512, 671, 740, times 10~'.

     ' Again, copper sulphate has, according to Kohlrausch (p. 196 of his last memoir),

the following :

                  m= -5 l -05 -01 -001 -0001 -00001;

       -  =  288  424            479     675  950 1062            1086.

       m

    ' You can find still better examples among mercury salts !

     * These numbers, according to Kohlrausch's formula, should be the same so
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

the correspondence between formula and fact seems to me not " roughly true," but

altogether futile. (The dilution-exponent is in every case much more constant
though I build nothing upon the fact.)

     ' That for extremest dilutions, under 15550, the molecular conductivity is fairly
constant, although even then probably not for mercury salts, I also have shown

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

since in these cases the dilution exponent rises to 2.

386 REPORT-- 1886.

' I set myself the problem to find out bow much tbe resistance actually increased

wben a dilute electrolyte had its volume doubled by addition of water. (If Kohl-

rausch's formula were true, it would be simply doubled.) Thus I started free from
hypothesis. The observed ratio of increase of the resistance I called " the dilution-

exponent." Since it changes very slowly with concentration, one need not ascertain

it by making every dilution from 1 to 2, but can quite well obtain a mean value of
it for a greater range (say 1 : 6-08) ; and the calculation ol" the mean number then

proceeds on purely arithmetic grounds without any special hypothesis. I hold

mystrongly, therefore, that  method of calculation is absolutely correct for mean

values ; and that I have always meant mean values is quite clear from page 34 et

seq. The number is by no means a constant. I speak continually of its variation,
and have tabulated the variations in Table B. I could not make its variability

clearer than I have done. I have taken conductivity as the fundamental quantity

instead of concentration, because one is always much safer in determining its abso-
lute value by ordinary means. You think it would have been better to tabulate r

instead of 2'' ; this is a matter of taste. The dilution-exponent is easy to define

physically ; r is not. Besides, one can more easily form a mental image of its

meaning. Not only Bouty, but Lenz also, and Ostwald, have discussed the change

of resistance on doubling dilution.
     ' 5. " Kohlrausch and most authors suppose that kirn is constant for extreme

dilution." This he does without reservation for solutions of no extraordinary weak-

ness, and he thence calculates klm for extremest dilution, whereby he several

times gets incorrect values (too small).* The hypothesis is, however, quite natural,

and I have always regarded this idea of Kohlrausch as most valuable ; and I

sought consequently to apply this idea, and to show how to explain apparent ex-

ceptions to it. I never sought to " label " the statements (1), (2) and (3) as laws
of nature, but say definitely : " The above conclusions are deduced from ideas which

are in full accord with all known facts, and consequently they have the same degree

of exactitude as those ideas accepted by all the world " (Part I. § 15). It is quite

certain that the conductivity of water is very feeble, and there is no reason for

denying that molecules may be independent of one another in very weak solutions,

since they collide so seldom. I have sought to explain why in practice the mole-

--cular conductivity is not constant even in utterly weak solutions. I have given

two explanations : 1st, that tbe water used contains traces of ammonium salts

(especially AmjCOg, not dissolved glass as you write ; a fact more lately proved by

Ostwald), which explains the decrease of molecular conductivity of hydrates ; and

2nd, that molecular complexes are formed ; a hypothesis which is introduced into so

many other subjects that one need feel no difficulty in employing it. (This view a

reader of your exposition will hardly attain.)

     ' 6. That the last work of Kohlrausch contains as you say incomparably better

experimental data (especially more accurate) is true enough. But without my

data I could not have formed a coherent picture of the whole. Besides, Kohlrausch's

work has in no way caused me to alter any theoretical views, but has fully con-

firmed me in them.

' It is the highest problem of the natural philosopher to link together facts

into a connected chain. I had expected a criticism from you to take this view. I

concluded that you were of this opinion from your essay on the seat of voltaic

E.M.F. yet you abandon it in your criticism of the first part of my memoir.
                                    ;
    ' As to the second part, I am very glad that you have everywhere appreciated

my views, and represented them in a more complete manner than I could have

hoped. Just a few notes.

' 7. With regard to your remark on (14), I may say, in explanation, that almost

NH^HOall chemists attribute the reactions of ammonia to a small portion of  in it,

which so soon as consumed is generated anew by equilibrium between H,,0 NH3 and

NH^HO, so that ammonia behaves chemically just as if it consisted of nothing but

NH4HO. In Thomsen's and Kohlrausch's experiments, on the other hand, the

properties of the chief quantity, which consists of NH3, play the greatest part.

soon abandoned if it had not con-esponded with the fundamental laws of Faraday,
Richter, &c. So far as I know, no one has hitherto raised the question ; besides
it is of very great importance to deduce various laws from a single point of view.

     ' 9. As to law (20), which is still very discussable, I have had no opportunity

of going off into digressions in the treatise, but refer to Hittorf and Bleekrode. I
treat the whole question as open, and share also the view that the conductivity of
these bodies has been proved to be mainly, though not exclusively, due to the
presence of saline impurities. One is only able at present to decide matters like

this on a chemical basis.

    Some time ago I thought of publishing the numbers given below, which may

have a certain amount of interest in elucidating the question as to the connection

between conductivity and internal resistance. In discussing the question with

Prof. Kohlrausch I have been confirmed in my hypothesis, and, in accordance as
much with his desire as with my own, I send the following communication.

    In the subjoined table the names of the solutions examined (all of normal

strength) are set forth in the first column ; in the second column the conductivity

(\) of these solutions (from Kohlrausch's last memoir) ; and in the third column
ihe viscosities (p) determined by myself. The fluids I investigated are identical
with the solutions employed by Kohlrausch in his conducti\dty determinations.

The numbers for the internal friction are given for 17'6° C, reduced to the

internal friction of distilled water at 17'6° as unit. I cannot here describe the

method of investigation, but may refer to the paper which I have communicated

to  Wiedemann's  ' Annalen.'                                                                                 The errors of observation probably do not amount to

but was calculated from that for a half normal solution on grounds wliich I cannot

here set forth ; it may be affected by a somewhat greater error than the other
numbers, though not so great as to make the succession irregular or to account for

the irregularity of the succession.

    As may be seen from these numbers, there appears to exist a certain relation

between the internal friction and the conductivity of normal solutions, so that

to a great extent the higher the conductivity the smaller is the internal friction.

A detailed carrying out of this law is, however, impossible, since marked excep-

tions occur. Of the seventeen salts examined five are exceptions, viz., KNO3,
NaNOg, K/;03, KO.H3OJ, and ]\IgSO^. The exceptional behaviour of NH^Cl as
compared with KCl may be only apparent. (It is not unlikely that when salts of
lower conductivity are examined the exceptions may become more numerous and

more strongly marked.)

for discussion of a difficult subject, I subscribe myself

                                                        New Haven : January 8, 1887.

  --Dear Sir, Please accept my thanks for the proof copy of your Report om

Electrolysis in its Physical and Chemical Bearings,which I received a few days ago
with the invitation, as I understand it, to comment thereon.

    I do not know that I have anything to say on the subjects more specifically

discussed in this report, but I hope I shall not do violence to the spirit of your

kind invitation or too much presume on your patience if I shall say a few words
on that part of the general subject which you discussed with great clearness in
your last report on pages 745, fi". (Aberdeen). To be more readily understood, I

shall use your notation and terminology, and consider the most simple casa

possible.

Suppose that two radicles unite in a galvanic cell during the passage of a unit

of electricity, and suppose that the same quantities of the radicles would give 6e

units of heat in uniting directly, that is, without production of current ; wiU the

union of the radicles in the galvanic cell give 36e units of electrical work ?

Certainly not, unless the radicles can produce the heat at an infinitely high

temperature, which is not, so far as we know, the usual case. Suppose the

highest temperature at which the heat can be produced is t", so that at this tem-

perature the union of the radicles with evolution of heat is a reversible process ;.

and let t' be the temperature of the cell, both temperatures being measured on the

absolute scale. Now 6e units of heat at the temperature t" are equivalent to

     /'  units  of heat at the  temperature  t', together with  J0e-tfl'_---t_' units  of  mecha-

6e--

t^

nical or electrical work. (I use the term equivalent strictly to denote reciprocal con-

vertibility, and not in the loose and often misleading sense in which we speak of

heat and work as equivalent when there is only a one-sided convertibility.)

Therefore the rendement of a perfect or reversible galvanic cell would be

^^~ --Z6e                                         units of (reversible) heat, for each
                units of electical work, with 6e

         t" t

unit of electricity which passes.

    You will observe that we have thus solved a very different problem from that

which finds its answer in the Joule-Helmholtz-Thomson equation with term for

reversible heat. That equation gives a relation between the E. M. F. and the

reversible heat and certain other quantities, so that if we set up the cell and
measure the reversible heat, we may determine the E. M. F. without direct

measurement, or vice versa. But the considerations just adduced enable us to

predict both the electro-motive force and the reversible heat without setting up
ON ELECTROLYSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 389

the cell at all. Only in the case that the reversible heat is zero does this dis-

tinction vanish, and not then unless we have some way of knowing a priori that

this is the case.

    From this point of view it will appear, I think, that the production of rever-

sible heat is by no means anything accidental, or superposed, or separable, but

that it belongs to the very essence of the operation.

     The thermochemical data on which such a prediction of E. M. F. and rever-

sible heat is based must be something more than the heat of union of the radicles.
They must give information on the more delicate question of the temperature at

--which that heat can be obtained. In the terminology of Clausius they must

relate to entropy as well as to energy a field of inquiry which has been far too

much neglected.
     Essentially the same view of the subject I have given in a form more general

and more analytical, and, I fear, less easily intelligible, in the closing pages of

a somewhat lengthy paper on the Equihbrium of Heterogeneous Substances

(' Conn. Acad. Trans.,' Vol. III., 1878), of which I send you the Second Part,

Mywhich contains the passage in question.  separate edition of the First Part has

long been exhausted. The question whether the ' reversible heat ' is a negligible

quantity is discussed somewhat at length on pp. 510-519. On page 50.3 is shown

the connection between the electromotive force of a cell and the difference in the

value of (what I call) the ]}ote7itial for one of the ions at the electrodes. The

definition of the potential for a material substance, in the sense in which I use the

term, wiU be found on page 443 of the synopsis from the ' Am. Jour. Sci.,' vol. xvi.,

which I enclose. I cannot say that the term has been adopted by physicists.

It has, however, received the unqualified commendation of Professor Maxwell

--(although not with reference to this particular application See his lecture on

ihe Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances, in the science conferences at South

Kensington, 1876) ; and I do not see how we can do very well without the idea in

certain kinds of investigations.

Hoping that the importance of the subject will excuse the length of this

letter, I remain

                                           Yours faithfully,

                                                              J. WiLLARD GiBBS.

--Note by the Editor. It is perhaps hardly wise to comment on the letter of

so great an authority without further consideration, but it naturally occurs to one to

ask provisionally whether he is not regarding a galvanic cell as too simply a heat

engine ? Surely if the union of certain elements can generate 0e units of heat when

heat-production is all that is allowed, they can, under favourable circumstances, do

JOe units of (say) electrical work instead, quite independently of any considerations

of entropy or of the temperature at which the heat might have been generated 1 In

other words, is Professor Gibbs not assuming that in a cell the union of elements

primarily produces heat, and secondarily propels a current, instead of (as may well be

the case) primarily generating a current, and secondarily producing heat when that

current is given nothing better to do 7 To this Professor Gibbs will doubtless reply :

JsTo, the highest temperature at which the heat could reversibly be produced, viz., the

temperature of complete dissociation of the compound formed, is of the essence of

the question, whatever be the mode of exciting the current. It is needless to point

out the extreme interest and importance of such a view.  O. L.

  On the Migration of Ions and an Experimental Determination
          of Absolute Ionic Velocity. By Dr. Oliver Lodge.

    What may be considered as the greatest step in advance since the

time of Faraday in the subject of electrolysis is due to Professor F.
Kohlrauscb. His idea of specific ionic velocity is obviously most im-

portant. The bases of it are liis own experiments on conductivity, and

those of Hittorf on ' migration ' or unequal concentration.

     Up to the present time the numbers given by KoUrauscb for the

absolute velocity of different ions in centimetres per second have been
deduced from theoretical grounds only, and the sole verification to v^hich

they have been subjected bas been by showing that from them the
observed conductivities and migration coefficients of a considerable
number of solutions can be calculated (see, for instance, page 337

above). In a paper published last year' I indicated reasons for doubting
the complete truth of the Koblrausch theory as it stood, i.e., for supposing
it deficient in generality, and also initially suggested an experimental
method suitable for examining the question, and for giving a direct
determination of the absolute velocity of various ions, in a form apparently
free from any hypothesis.

     The method consisted in passing a current through an electrolyte con-
tained in a uniform glass tube, and arranging some form of test substance
to detect the position to which the ions had at any instant attained in
their journey along the tube. The speed of any ion which lent itself to
this mode of chemical detection could thus obviously be measured,

provided disturbing causes could be excluded.

     The experiments I have made on this plan hitherto, though numerous,

--can hardly be regarded as more than preliminary a good many diffi-

culties, some expected, some unexpected, having turned up in the course
of the investigation, as usual. Nevertheless, a fair approach to a satis-
factory and accurate result has been in some of the later instances
obtained, and, besides the experience, some of the results themselves are
worth having.

    Let me first rapidly obtain the theoretical values of ionic velocity, in

a complete manner, in order to distinguish the parts of the theory which

are manifestly true from the parts which may require modification and

development.

     Consider a unit cube of electrolyte, containing ?i^ active molecules,
i.e., v? molecules actually engaged in conveying a current, and ignoring
any inert molecules such as those of the solvent have (perhaps without
reason) usually been supposed to be. Let q be the total charge of each
kind of electricity possessed by the constituent ions of each active mole-

Ucule, and let be the velocity with which the two oppositely charged

ions are being sheared past one another by the applied slope of potential
dv

--~. Then, if A: is the conductivity of the unit cube, we have the foUow-

ing couple of expressions for the intensity of current {i.e., quantity of
electricity conveyed per second through unit area normal to the flow) :

          ax

NWriting for the number of monad gramme-equivalents of the active

substance present in the unit cube, and jj for the E.C.E. of hydrogen (that

is, 1 ji] for the quantity of electricity corresponding to any monad gramme-

equivalent), it is plain that

     So, equating together the above two expressions for intensity of

current, we get

     So far the ground seems to me to be perfectly firm.
     "We now proceed to apply this to special cases. To do this we assume,

with Kohlrausch, first, that N=r?i, the quantity of salt in unit volume
of the solution ; second, that the ratios of the anion and cation velocities,

ujv, are known for a number of substances from Hittorf's classical
migration experiments. On these two assumptions a table of velocities
can be constructed. They vary, it is true, with kim, but this number is
fairly constant for very dilute solutions of many substances ; if it is not,

the concentration must be specified.
     The latest determinations of Kohlrausch ^ give the following numbers

     Radicles omitted from this table, like SO4, PO4, &c., are intractable

or anomalous.

     JN'ow in the above calculation what is there hypothetical ? Accepting
for the present the direct Hittorfian view of migration, the assumption

that N=7)i involves two hypotheses, viz. :
      (1) That the added salt alone is the active substance, the solvent

conducting none of the current.

     (2) That the whole of the added salt is equally active.

    On any dissociation view of electrolysis it could hardly be expected

that when two substances are mixed one should be wholly inert, the other
wholly active. It would seem much more probable, without evidence to
the contrary, that the two substances should dissociate each other in some
ratio or other, and that the conduction should be shared between them.

     If this be so, equations (1) and (2) still remain perfectly true, but it
is not so easy to determine N, the amount of active substance per cc. It

The value of ^ to be used here is the simple straightforward conductivity of

the whole solution. There is to be no subtracting of hypothetical water-

conductivity in order to get at an inaccessible salt- conductivity ; the dis-

tinction between known and unknown quantities is perfectly definite.
    By a complete quantitative electrolytic experiment, such as Hittorf

first made, and Wiedemann a^d others have followed up, the four quantities

obtain the values u^, v,, u^, v^, separately, unless the dissociation-ratios

up to its neck in a bath of water at constant temperature, as in fig. 10.

DiEECT Experimental Determination op Absolute Ionic Velocities.

     Let us pass now from this rather laborious method of determining
T^'jMi, N,v,, &c., to a simple and direct mode of experimenting on the

velocitiestti, ^1, &c., themselves. It is manifest that if one can determine for

any substance, Nu by one method of experiment, and u by another, its dis-

Nsociation-ratio fm, which must be a very important chemical constant,

is known instantly.
     One of the early forms of experiment for observing ii and v was

arranged thus :

    Two vessels, containing fairly strong sulphate of soda and baric

chloride, respectively, adjusted to equal density, were joined by a longish

tube full of dilute hydrochloric acid       p,,

of small specific gravity (fig. 2).     p^                        jpj

   A current from some twenty stor-

age batteries was then applied, and

the tube examined from time to time

for the first appearance of a precipi-

tate of baric sulphate.                 W^

    When everything went well the

precipitate appeared as a fine ring

inside the tube, which rapidly filled up into a beautifully sharp thin

disc or complete partition, and then grew in thickness, spreading out

slowly both ways till it formed a solid plug and rather obstructed the

current.

The locality of the disc and the time of its appearance after starting

the current were noted ; but I do not here record these first results, be-

-cause they were very variable, owing to disturbing causes.

One obvious disturbing cause is that of slight differences of level,

produced either by earth- war pings and local pressures, or by evaporation.
To diminish mechanical changes of level the two vessels were next

arranged side by side, and the tube was bent double so as to have its ends

close together and yet to afibrd a good length for observation.

The level of the vessels was accurately adjusted, and the tube intro-

·duced with as little disturbance as possible, various devices, such as super-

                                       happy device of connecting

                                       the two layers of paraffin

                                       by another and a much

                                       shorter and stouter siphon

                                       to equalise the levels and,

                                       if possible, to keep them

                                       equal, and yet not to tap off

                                       any of the current by this

                                       supernumerary but almost

infinitely resisting path (fig. 4)

   We now got much more consistent results, and for a long time thought

things were pretty satisfactory, so we proceeded to make numerous obser-

                                   length of the tubes, the number of

                                   volts applied, the strength of the

                                   owing to this that the results of these

                                   experiments are not very concordant.

levelling tube was used, we get the average i-esult that the ring forms 3'2

times as far from the BaClg end as from the NaaSO^ end (see p. 400).
     This may be recorded by saying that the Ba travels three times

the distance that the SO4 travels in the same time, or that Ba travels

three times as quickly as SO4 ; a result which, though simple a^d definite,
is probably incorrect. But it is possible to argue that what we are
measuring is not this simple ratio of speeds but a more complex ratio
depending on all the substances. Thus, consider the substances in action,

        ON ELECTROLYSIS IN ITS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BEARINGS. 395'

      I by no means press this probably accidental agreement ; and the true
meaning of any results obtained by such methods as I have described I

leave for the present open.

    On my cursorily mentioning these very preliminary results in a

circular to the committee on Electrolysis, Professor S. P, Thompson
suggested using a jelly, and we at once tried it. One cannot use any

 strong acid with gelatine, for it seems to spoil it, but acetic acid serves
and the siphon tube was accordingly filled with an acetic acid gelatine

jelly, which went stiff when cold. Agar-Agar jelly, suggested, I think,
by Prof. Clowes, can be used with stronger acids.

     The use of jelly makes the experiment much less troublesome, be-
cause there is now no difficulty in the manipulation, no special need for

adjustment of the solution densities, nor danger from changes of level.
     One objection to it is, that, supposing the ionic velocities were deter-

mined in jelly, they could not easily be compared with Kohlrausch's
numbers, which apply to weak aqueous solutions. There is of course no
difficulty in determining the conductivity of the jelly and the slope of
potential, as required in formula (1) ; but it is difficult to assign a value
to N. The hypothesis that the solvent does none of the conduction, even
though it be true for water, can hardly be pressed to include the case of a
jelly of unknown and complicated constitution; especially as we found
that the conductivity of plain jelly was actually considerably greater than

that of dilute acetic acid ^ (see p. 406).

   --The endosmose difficulty is not got over by the use of jelly in fact, it

may perhaps be accentuated; and another and unexpected difficulty pre-

sents itself. Gelatine swells under the action of the current and exudes
from the tube ; but always in one direction only, viz., against tbe current.

A cylinder of jelly an inch or two in length was ultimately protruded

from the anode end of the tube and cracks appeared in the substance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

of the jelly, of curious serpentine form, which underwent noteworthy
metamorphoses.

     The position of the precipitate in these jelly tubes was not far from
the middle of the tube, indicating that Ba and SO4 travelled at nearly
equal rates (see pp. 401 and 411).

                                    Second Series of Experiments.

     1 next proceeded to another form of the experiment, where a detecting
substance was placed in the tube so as to be able to follow the motion of
the ions along their journey, instead of only noting their time and place
of meeting.

     Various detectors were tried, but a simple and obvious one, able to
show both anion and cation, is sulphate of silver.

   A jelly tube containing, besides acetic acid, a solution of sulphate of

silver, was arranged to join two vessels, each full of baric chloride solution.

When the current passes, the barium travels with it and causes a preci-
pitate of BaS04, which may be watched creeping on from point to point

the CI at the same time travels against the current and causes a precipi-

tate of AgCl, which may be likewise watched. The poor solubility of
Ag2S04 is of no consequence, because it is only wanted to detect the ions,
not to absorb them and stop their motion ; hence, however soluble a

     ' In this Connection see Dr. Arrhenius' previous experiments on conductivity of

jelly as detailed above, p. 344.
596 REPORT--1886.

detector is used, the amount of it put into the tube ought to be almost
infinitesimal, or it will cause disturbance and prevent the full velocity of

the ion being observed.

     There is some slight difficulty with a solid precipitate, as detector,
when free liquid instead of jelly is employed : for its settling causes

--currents and convective disturbances especially in the vertical ends of

the tube. Fluid detectors, whose colour the ions change, are therefore
in some respects better.

     Roughly examining the results obtained by the methods just described,

one may say that they give the velocity of Ba through jelly, for a fall

of 1 volt per centimetre, as about -00012 centimetre per second ; the

velocity of Sr is about -00015. The speeds of CI, Br, and I are not very
different from each other, and about "00024. This rough statement is
merely to give a notion of the order of magnitude of the velocities
obtained, and by no means represents the full deduction from the tabulated
numbers.

Experiments on Speed of Hydrogen,

     To detect the motion of Hydrogen Mr. Robinson devised the following

--arrangement : We happened to have been using phenol-phthallein as a

detector of alkali in some other quite distinct experiment, and so it was a
handy substance. The jelly tube contains a little phenol-phthallein and
a trace of common salt, just made alkaline enough with soda to bring out
the colour. The solution in the anode vessel is H2SO4 ; in the cathode

vessel the same, or sometimes CUSO4. (For details see below, under
date August 17, p. 407.)

   HThe result is that SO4 travels one way, and Hj the other. As the

travels, it liberates HCl, and decolorises the solution. As the SO4 travels,
it also decolorises the solution by forming neutral Na2S04. The velocity

of hydrogen, for 40 volts applied to a 40-centimetre tube, came out from
the very first observation thus made

                                     ·0029

centimetre per second. Kohlrausch's theoretical number, deduced from
conductivity and migration data, is

                                     ·003.

Later experiments gave respectively '0026 and ^0024. SO4 seems to

-travel at about one-third this speed.

Another experiment was made with I^aHO in the cathode vessel, and

CUSO4 in the anode, and with NaOl and phenol-phthallein in the tube, as

HObefore, but colourless (p. 409) .  now travels against the current and pro-

duces colour as it goes. It seems to travel nearly as quickly as hydrogen.

The following abbreviated excerpts from Laboratory Note-hooks will sufficiently

                                      illustrate the results so far attained.

  --Specific Gravity Data. \1'7'6 grammes of crystallised baric chloride added to

88'27 grammes of water give a solution of sp. gr. 1'095, containing about 10 per
cent, of the salt itself. One-thirtieth of its bulk of water added reduces it to 1^093.
22-68 grammes of crystallised sodic sulphate added to 77'32 grammes of water give

a solution of specific gravity 1-093, likewise containing about 10 per cent, of the

salt itself. 19-98 grammes of hydrochloric acid added to 80-02 of water make
sp. gr. 1-098, and is a 25 per cent, solution. This also was reduced to 1-093.

                          Determination of the resistance of a jelly-Jilled tube.

  --July 1. One of the 40 centimetre tubes filled witli plain gelatine gave 67,720

ohms resistance. The same tube had the jelly melted out, the tube cleared and

filled with dilute acetic acid (centigramme molecule in 5cc.), and its resistance

was now 160,000.

     Another determination, by Mance's method, ga\'e for the acetic acid filled tube
142,000 ohms, at 21° C. ; for 'the jelly-filled tube at 19-5, 78,000 ohms ; and for the
same tube filled with dilute sulphuric acid (H^SO^ in 10 cc.) 730 ohms.

   This jelly tube was then left to stand all night with its feet in dilute acetic acid.

By the morning its resistance had increased, as the acid soaked up into it, to

84,000 ohms.

the cathode end of the tube there was a slight deposit. The temperature of the
bath was still 16-2°. It was afterwards found that the silver plate of the voltameter
had dissolved, and thereby broken contact.

of gelatine in 150 cc. of dilute acetic acid, of strengtli one centigramme molecule
in 5 cc.

     Another paii- of similar tubes were fiUed with jelly made with 40 gi-ammes of
gelatine dissolved in 150 cc. of four times weaker acetic acid, viz., a centigramme
molecule in 20 cc.

     58 volts were applied to the carbon electrodes of all four tubes. The anode and

cathode vessels contained BaClj and CuSO^ respectively.

     In the tubes with weak acid, BaSO^ began to form in 88| hours after starting the

current, and its position was 19-3 in one tube, and 19-2 in the other, from the BaCl,

end, and therefore 19-7 and 19-8 from the Na,,SO^ end.

     In the tubes with stronger acid the precipitate took some hours longer to form,
and its position was 19-2 in one tube, and 18-3 in the other, from the barium end.

The relative speed of travel of Ba in the two pairs of tubes was taken by making

simultaneous marks on each tube as the Ba proceeded ; and the ratio of these rates
was in the weak acid tube 1-21 times that in the stronger acid tube.

 Thus, although the absolute speed  is  less in the                                                                                                     stronger acetic acid jelly  (as is

_

quite right, because its conductivity is less ; see above), the ratio of the speeds of Ba

--and SO4 remains practically unity in both.
     August 27. To confii-m, the four tubes were started again in just the same

way, except that, while one pair contained jelly with O^HgO, centigramme mole-

cules in 5 cc. as before, the other pair contained jelly with C0H3O., centigramme

molecules in 40 cc. The distance travelled by Ba in the weak acid jelly tubes was

15 3 cm., and in the strong acid jelly tubes was 12-4 in the same time : feirivineb: a
ratio 1-20 as before.                                                                                                                                              '

     So far as it is wise to draw a moral from unfinished experiments it

may be said, that while there are some divergencies, yet they are in the

main confirmatory of the theory of Professor F. Kohlransch, especially in

the  case  of the velocity of hydrogen                                                                                                          and  I  think  it  may be regarded
                                                                                                                                             ;

as a noteworthy instance of scientific prediction if numbers calculated

theoretically from conductivity data be found to agree at all closely with

the results of direct experiment.

    In conclusion, I wish to record ray best thanks to my assistant, Mr.

Edward Robinson, for the care and assiduity he has bestowed upon these

experiments. As I have had occasion to remark in the course of the

paper, he has not only carried out my proposals with ingenuity and skill,

but he has in several cases modified details and devised fresh combinations.

                            I. The Gray-Milne Seismograph.

In 1883, partially at the expense of the British Association, Mr. James

White, of Glasgow, constructed a seismograph to be used in Japan. I am

pleased to say that for some time past this instrument has been in good
working order, and examples of the records which it has furnished are
given in the following table. The time records are expressed as Tokio
mean time. The particular wave at which time was noted can only be
seen by reference to the original diagrams. It is usually very near the
commencement of a disturbance. The period which is expressed in seconds
is the time taken to describe one of the principal vibrations (or shocks} in
a disturbance. The longest period, it will be observed, is three seconds.
The amplitude, which is expressed in millimeters, is half a semi-oscillation,
the vibration which is measured being the one from which the period was

recorded.

      It will be observed that the larger the amplitude the longer is the

period. I am writing more fully on the relationship of amplitude to period

in a special paper. With period and amplitude before us, on the assump-
tion of simple harmonic motion we may easily calculate the maximum
velocity of motion which represents the projecting power of an earth-
quake, and the maximum acceleration which measures the overturning and
shattering power of an earthquake. The direction which is given is that
of the most prominent vibration in the disturbance. One disturbance, it
will be noticed, had a duration of ten minutes. Without the aid of an

instrument this disturbance might have been felt for a period of perhaps
three minutes. It will be noticed that vertical motion has only been
recorded twice. The records given in the following table are in the
same form as the records published in the Japanese daily papers imme-
diately after the occurrence of an earthquake. The original publications
followed Palmiere's method, where a set of arbitrary degrees took the
 place of the present absolute measures.

future report. In the report written last year some reference was made

to the experiments in a pit. For a strong earthquake I showed that the

motion at the bottom of the pit (which is ten feet in depth) was very

much smaller than the motion on the surface. For very small earthquakes

this distinction is not so marked ; the only difference between the move-

ment below and that above is that the former has a longer period.

    Among the earthquakes which have occurred during the last few
months several have been felt as short sharp bumps. On these occasions
I have repeatedly noticed that a lamp hanging in the centre of my room

acquires a rapid vibratory vertical movement, and there has been no per-

ceptible swing. My impression with regard to these shocks, which are

usually very short, is that they have an origin immediately beneath Tokio,

The vertical motion of the disturbances we feel in Tokio is relatively to

the horizontal motion extremely small, seldom exceeding the fraction of a

millimeter. So far as I am aware, it has never exceeded two or three

millimeters, and the general rule is that vertical movement is but rarely

recorded.

    In addition to the short sudden vertical movements, we have had

others which have been characterised by their length and the slowness of

their pei'iod. Such a disturbance occurred a few days before I left Tokio.

At the time I was sitting at a table upstairs, when I fancied that I felt a

movement. On looking up I saw that my lamp was swinging back and

Aforth through a considerable arc.          disturbance of this kind would

hardly be recognised as an earthquake by a person who had not been in

the habit of recording such phenomena.

              III. The Earthquakes of 1885-1886.

myIn fourth report to the British Association I gave, in an epito-

mised form, the results obtained by the observation of 387 earthquakes

which had occurred between October 1881 and October 1883 in North

AJapan.       complete account of this work has now been published by the

Seismological Society as Vol. VII. Part II. of their Transactions, Similar

work, but extended to embrace the whole of the empire, has been under-

taken by the Meteorological Department of this country, and results of a

valuable nature have already been obtained. As this work is a continua-

tion of that which has already been brought to the notice of the British

Association, and as I have from time to time been consulted as to how it

should be carried out, a brief account of the more important results which

have been obtained may not be out of place. Professor K. Sekiya, who

now holds the chair of seismology in the Imperial University of Japan,

and who has had the immediate superintendence of these observations,

will give a translation and fuller account of this work to the Transactions

of the Seismological Society.

The observations were made with the assistance of bundles of post-

cards distributed with observers at 600 stations situated in various

parts of the empire. During the year 1885 records were received at the

Meteorological Department which formed the foundation for a series of

maps showing the areas shaken by 482 distinct disturbances.

On the average there were, therefore, 40 earthquakes per month, or

1"3 per day.

The distribution of these disturbances according to months and

seasons is shown in the following tables :

The earthquakes, however, do not originate at the volcanoes. They origi-
nate near the coast, where evidences of elevation are to be seen.

    On the opposite side of the island, where earthquakes are scarce, there

are said to be evidences of depression.

               The Volcanoes of Japan.

     During the last year I have spent considerable time in arranging for
publication the various notes which I have from time to time collected

during the last ten years, relating to the volcanoes of Japan.

    Many of these I have personally visited and ascended. In the account
which I am giving of these mountains, I am intercalating notes obtained

from friends, together with the more important portions of some thirty or
forty Japanese works specially describing volcanoes in this country.

     The chief results obtainable from this work are given in the follow-

ing notes

               1. Map of Volcanoes.

    Among the more important results which have been arrived at has

been the compilation of the accompanying map. For assistance other

than that mentioned in the preceding pages I have to thank Mr.

Tsunashiro Wada, Director of the Geological Survey, who has already

drawn up a map of the volcanoes in Japan ; Mr. N. Fukushi, Director

of  the  Survey Department  in  Yezo                           and  my  own  private  assistant, Mr.
                                                            ;

                                            KuRiLE Islands.

  --Note. There are therefore at least 23 well-formed volcanic mountains, and 16

mountains yet steaming in the Kurile Islands. Kurile is derived from the Russian
kooi-eet, to smoke. The Aino name for the Kuriles also means The Smokers.

    If we add to our list the ruins and basal wrecks of volcanic cones, this

number is considerably increased.
     The number of mountains which are easily recognisable as being of

volcanic origin as given in the map is 129.
    Of this number about 51 are still active, that is to say, are now giving

off steam. These active volcanoes are distributed as follows :

Northern Eegion {y^o^^,             '    'n}                   ^"^

Central and Southern Eegion .                  Total           24

     Out of the 129 volcanoes, 39 are symmetrically formed cones.
     The greatest proportion of regularly formed mountains and of

mountains yet giving off steam are in the Kuriles. From this it may be

argued that the mountains in the north are younger than those in the
middle and south.

                                  3. Number of Eruptions.

     Altogether in the preceding pages about 233 eruptions have been
recorded. The distribution of these in the different districts, and with
regard to time, is shown in the accompanying table. The greater num-
ber of records in the southern districts, as compared with the northern

districts, may be accounted for by the fact that Japanese civilisation
advanced from the south. In consequence of this, records were made of

various phenomena in the south, while the northern districts were un-
known and unexplored regions. The greater number of eruptions have
taken place in the months of February and April. Comparing the fre-
quency of eruptions in the different seasons, the volcanoes of Japan
appear to have followed the same law as the earthquakes ; a greater num-
ber of eruptions having taken place during the cold months. This
winter frequency may possibly be accounted for in the same manner that
Dr. Knott accounted for the winter frequency of earthquakes. During
the winter months the average barometric gradient across Japan is
steeper than in summer. This, coupled with the piling up of snow in

the northern regions, gives rise to long -continued stresses, in consequence
of which certain lines of weakness of the earth's crust are more prepared

to give way during the winter months than they are in summer.

   ON THE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.                                425

4. Position and Relative Age of Japanese Volcanoes.

The youngest of the Japanese volcanoes appear to be those which

·exist as or on small islands. On the islands in the Kuriles, in the

Oshima Group, and in the Satsuma Sea, many of the volcanoes are yet

young and vigorous. Further, many of these islands have been formed

during the historical period. The island-forming period in the Satsuma

Sea occurred about the year 1780.

Looked at generally, the volcanoes of Japan form a long chain running

Afrom the N.E. towards the S.W.                closer examination of the distribu-

tion of the volcanic vents shows that there are probably four lines.

1. The N.E. S.W. line running from Kamtschatka through the Kuriles

and Northern Tezo.

2. The curved line following the backbone of Honshiu and terminating

on the western side of the Yezo anticlinal.

3. The N.N.W. S.S.E. line of the Oshima Group. This line, coming

from the Ladrones, passes through Oshima and Fujisan pai-allel to and

near to the line of a supposed fault. Here it intersects the main line

running through Honshiu. Volcanic vents are here very numerous. As

the Honshiu line is intersected, while the Oshima line is the intersector,

it may be argued that the Oshima- Fujisan line of volcanoes are younger

than many of those on the Honshiu line.

4. The Satsuma line, coming from the Philippines through Sakurajima

and culminating in the famous Mount Aso, which is the nucleus of Kiushiu.

                     6. Lithological and Chemical Character of Lavas.

     Although I have made an extensive collection of the volcanic rocks of

this country, opportunity has not hitherto presented itself for their

examination. I can therefore only speak of them in general terms. They
are now, I believe, being carefully studied by the officers of the geological

survey of Japan. The rocks in my possession are chiefly andesites.

Those containing augite, like the rocks of Fujisan, as pointed out by
Mr. Wada, the director of the geological survey, closely approximate to

basalts. True basalt is, however, rare. Another common rock is horn-

blende andesite, some of which contains free quartz. Quartz trachytes
occur in the north of Japan. The following table, which is chiefly drawn

np from material kindly placed at my disposal by Mr. "Wada, shows the

percentages of silica, ferrous and ferric oxide contained in the rocks of
ten volcanoes

     One feature exhibited by the table is, that the rocks of Oshima, Fuji-
san, and Tonosawa are basic, while those like Chokaisan and Moriyoshi-
yama, belonging to the Honshiu line of volcanoes, are relatively acidic.
More extended observations of this description may show that different

lines of volcanoes have erupted different lavas, or that the lavas of different

constitution are of different ages.

6. Magnetic Character of Bocks.

Mr. E. Kinch, when speaking of the soils in the neighbourhood of

ATokyo, makes special reference to the magnetite they contain.  great

portion of this comes from the disintegration of volcanic rocks. Many of

the Japanese lavas have a distinct effect upon a compass needle. The

black lavas from the crater of Pujisan will deflect the needle of an ordi-

nary compass through 180 degrees. Many of the pieces of lava are not

only magnetic, but they are polar. Dr. E Naumann found a block of

augite-trachyte on the top of Moriyoshisan which would deflect the needle

of a compass through 155°.
     The most curious observation made by this investigator was that the

magnetic declination near to Ganju-san has during the last 80 j'ears

(when it was about 14.30 E.) decreased 19°, it now being about 5° W.
As we recede from this mountain the amount of change has been less.

Assuming this result to be correct, it would seem justifiable to look
towards Ganju-san as connected with these local changes. Some of the
volcanoes in the Kuriles are said to exert a marked influence upon the

compasses of ships. When a vessel is lying near certain mountains, as

for instance in Bear Bay, at the north end of Iturup, a distant mountain
has a very different bearing to that which is indicated by the same com-
pass when the vessel is a short distance outside Bear Bay.

    In both cases the ship may be lying in the same direction, and the

direction of observation is practically along the same line.

    This leads me to repeat a suggestion that 1 have several times made

during the last few years, namely, that a magnetic observatory be' esta-

blished on or near one of the more active volcanoes of this country.

Many of these volcanoes, like that of Oshima (Vries Island), lie in the
track of so many vessels that to determine whether local and rapid

changes in magnetic declination are taking place in these localities appears

to be a legitimate investigation. Changes in volcanic activity are pro-
bably accompanied by local changes in the magnetic effects produced by

subterranean volcanic magmas. These changes may be due to alterations

in position, alterations in chemical constitution, and changes due to the

acquisition or loss of heat. If such is the case, the records of a magnetic

observatory would lead us to a knowledge of changes taking place beneath

the ground. When we remember that volcanoes like Oshima (Vries

Island) lie in the track of so many vessels where it seems probable that
there may be local and rapid changes in magnetic variation taking place,

it seems that the suggested investigations have a practical as well as

scientific aspect. An investigation of earth-currents at and near volca-

noes might be added to the magnetic investigations.

                                            7. Intensity of Eruptions.

     Judging from the accounts of eruptions which have been given in the
preceding pages, it would appear that the intensity of volcanic action iu
ON THE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.  427

Japan has been as great as in any other portions of the world. One period,
of unusual activity was between the years 1780 and 1800, a time when
there was great activity exhibited in other portions of the world. It was
during this period that a portion of Mount Unsen was destroyed and from
27,000 to 53,000 persons perished; that many islands were formed in the
Satsuma Sea ; that Sakurajima threw out so much pumiceous material
that it was possible to walk a distance of 23 miles upon the floating
debris in the sea, and that Asama ejected so many blocks of stone, some of
which are said to have been from 40 to over 100 feet in diameter, and a

lava stream 68 kilometers in length.

                                8. The Form of Volcanoes.

     The form I particulai-ly refer to is the regular so-called conical form,,
which is very noticeable in many of the Japanese mountains, especially

perhaps in those of recent origin. Outlines of these volcanoes, as exhibited

either by sketches or photographs, show curvatures which are similar to
each other. In the Kurile Islands I have had opportunities of comparing

two volcanoes by so altering my position until one of the mountains

partially eclipsed another standing at no great distance in the background.

One of these mountains was Otosoyama (Mount Fuss). The other
mountain, like many of the peaks in the Kurile Islands, is without a

name.

     From a collection of photographs, I traced the profiles of a number of

important mountains in this country. These profiles are repeated in this

paper. From an examination of these figures I found that the curvature

of a typical volcano was logarithmic, or in other words the form of such
a mountain was such as might be produced by the revolution of a logarith-

mic curve round its asymptote. In my original paper on this subject I

said that the form agreed with that which would be produced by the
piling up of loose material. As pointed out by Mr. George F. Becker, in
a paper on the form of volcanic cones, &c. (' American Journal of Science,'
October 1885), I ought to have said it was the form due to a self-

supporting mass of coherent material. Mr. Becker continues my observa-

tions by an analytical investigation of the conditions of such equilibrium.
If the height of a column is a, its radius y, the distance of any horizontal
plane from the base x, the specific gravity of the material r, and the co-

efficient of resistance to crushing at the elastic limit k, then the equation
of the curve which, by its revolution about the x axis, will generate the
finite unloaded column of ' least variable resistance ' is
--428
EEPORT 1886.

     The value c can be obtained from photographs or drawings of a
mountain, while r may be obtained from pendulum experiments or
from specimens of volcanic material. With these data we can determine

the modulus of resistance for the elastic limit of the materials which com-

pose a mountain on a large scale, for many constituents of the earth's crust.

     Mr. Becker concludes his observations by remarking that a study of
the form and dimensions of lunar volcanoes would lead to values of j,
whence we might approximately determine whether the lunar lava is

similar to that of terrestrial origin.

      In the following table I have followed out Mr. Becker's suggestion
and calculated ' the modulus of resistance to crushing at the elastic limit
in lbs. per square foot for a number of Japanese mountains.'' The different

values for -- for the same mountain are in great measure due to my not

being able to obtain an accurate scale for the various photographs which
had to be investigated. Another difficulty was obtaining a value for r or

the density of the mountain. Professor T. C. Mendenhall, who made a
number of experiments with pendulums on the summit of Fujiyama,
says the rocks of that mountain have a density of 1.75. This is when
they have air in their pores. As powder, the density becomes 2.5. Wada
gives the specific gravity of the rock on Fujisan as 2.6. Assuming the

density of the earth at 5.67 (Bailey) then the density of Fujisan, as de-

termined by Professor Mendenhall's experiments, is 2.08. In my calcu-

lations for the following table I have assumed a density of 2.5 for the
materials of all the mountains mentioned.

kine's ' Civil Engineering,' we may say that the average strength of Fnji-

ean lies betw^een that of rnbble work and sandstone. Iwaki-san, Nantai-
san, and Alaid are like good rubble masonry, while the strength of the
ill-fated Krakatoa is not much above that of ordinary brickwork. In
making the above calculations I have used

my original communication on the forms of volcanoes published in the

 ' Geological Magazine.'

    A2. series of tracings from photographs of Fujisan and other moun-

tains not hitherto published. For most of these a scale can be obtained.
The best scale for Fujisan is probably the difference in height of Hoyei-
san and the summit. Hoyei-san is a parasitic crater on the southern
side of Fuji and in the profiles is marked H. This difference in height

is about 4,137 feet.

    A scale may also be obtained from the line of sea-level or from the

diameter of the crater, which is about 750 metres.

     Two profiles of Fujisan from the surveys of Mr. 0. Schiitt are also given.

      Causes modifying the natural curvature of a mountain and therefore
interfering with the above calculations are

     1. The tendency, during the building up of the mountain, of the
larger particles to roll farther down the mountain than the smaller

particles.

     2. The effects of atmospheric denudation which carries materials
from the top of the mountain down towards the base.

     3. The position of the crater and the direction in which materials are

ejected.

     4. The existence of parasitic craters on the flanks of a mountain.
     5. The direction of the wind during an eruption.
     6. The sinking of a mountain in consequence of evisceration beneath

its base.

      7. The expansions and contractions at the base of a mountain due to
the acquisition or loss of heat before and after eruptions.

                                          9. Theoretical Moimtains,

crumbling strength as being three-quarters of the breaking strength,
while for rubble work and brickwork it has been taken as one-half. (See
Rankine's ' Civil Engineering,' p. 361, &c.)

feet, and the height to which mountains of the following different
materials could be built upon such a base without crushing would

approximately be

                         10. Effect of Volcanic Eruptions on the People.

    From the translations of Japanese works relating to volcanoes which

I have given, it is seen that the eruptions of these mountains have from
time to time exerted a very marked influence upon the minds of the
Japanese people. Divine interference has been sought to prevent erup-
tions, priests have been ordered to pray, taxes have been repealed,

charities have been instituted, special prayers against volcanic disturb-
ances have been formulated and have remained in use for the period of
one hundred years, while special days for the annual offering up of these
prayers have been appointed. At the present day there is a form of

worship to mountain deities not uncommon, which may have had its

origin through the fear created by volcanic outbursts. Displays of
volcanic activity have certainly intensified this form of worship.

                                                             Conclusion.

    In conclusion to this report, it gives me pleasure and satisfaction to

testify to the great work which has been accomplished, and the great

interest which is still being displayed in connection with seismological

investigation in this country. Professor Forrel, of Switzerland, speaking

at the Institution of Civil Engineers, testified to the gi'eat merit of the work
which has been accomplished in Japan, and remarked that the observers
of seismographs in that country had in two years accomplished more than
twenty centuries of European science had been able to show (' Minutes of

Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers,' vol. Ixxxvi., session
1885-6, part 1, p. 40). Inasmuch as the grants of the British Association

have in no little measure assisted towards whatever may have been done
in Japan, it cannot fail to be of interest to the members of that Asso-
ciation to know the extent to which they have rendered assistance in

advancing seismological science in Japan.

    With the assistance of the British Association, an extensive series of
experiments lasting over several years were made upon artificially pro-
duced disturbances, which led to an insight into the nature and method

of propagation of earth-vibrations. It was with the assistance of the
British Association that a general seismic survey was made of North
Japan. One result of this work has been that the Imperial Government
of Japan has extended similar observations over the whole empire, and

now there are about 600 stations at which earthquakes are recorded. The
first complete seismograph made under the auspices of the British Asso-
ciation has been reproduced in this country, and is now being gradually

distributed throughout the empire.
ON THE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.  431

     The Imperial University has endowed a chair of seismology, which
is lield by Mr. K. Sekiya, an iudefatigable worker at earthquake phenomena,
and has established a well-equipped earthquake observatory. The Imperial
Meteorological Department has also established an observatory, at which,
in addition to the ordinary work of observing, they make and test instru-
ments to be used in the country.

     In these and other ways is Japan working at a study which for many
years has made but little progress.

     One valuable work towards which the Government of this country is
at present directing its attention is, how and where to construct buildings
which either partially or wholly may escape the effects of earthquake
movement.

     With these few general remarks on what is being accomplished in
Japan, the members of the British Association will recognise that their
endeavour to give an impetus to scientific investigation in the far East

Las not been unsuccessful.

        The Modern Development of Thomas Yoiincfs Theory of

                   Colour-vision. By Dr. Arthur Konig.

     [A commumcation ordered by the General Committee to be printed in externa
                                             among the Eeports.]

    § 1. In the third book of his ' Optics ' Isaac Newton puts the question,
whether the sensation of colour is brought about by some sort of vibrations
which the light produces in the constituents of the retina.

     In a paper read before the Royal Society of London in 1801 Thomas
Young makes an observation bearing upon this statement of Newton, in
which he points out that the number of those vibrations depends on the

nature of the above-mentioned constituents.

     The infinite number of perceptible colours requires an infinite number
of various constituents in each surface element of the retina. This is an
impossible supposition. But we can explain all phenomena of colour-per-
ception by supposing that each surface element of the retina consists of
three constituents, each of which, when affected, causes a different colour-

sensation. On this supposition all the various shades of colour are resultants

of three fundamental sensations originating in those constituents. Later on

Thomas Young proposes red, green, and violet as these fundamental sen-

sations. It is true that he does not explicitly say that the sensation of
white is the resultant of the simultaneous action of all the three consti-
tuents, but this is a self-evident conclusion if his supposition is to explain
the famous experiment of Newton.

     The principle which he intuitively laid down for the more limited field

of the theory of colour-vision was, a quarter of a century later, brought

out again by Johannes Miiller under the name ' the law of specific energy

of the organs of sensation ' (' Gesetz der specifischen Energie der Sinnes-
organe '), and proved to hold good for the whole field of physiology.

    It is little known that the insight of Thomas Young had even a greater
depth. He had already explained that the confusion of colours, which his

contemporary Dalton made, was a consequence of the absence or paralysis
 432 REPORT-- 1886,

-- --of those fibres of the retina as he calls them which are calculated to

 perceive red. Thus the theory of colour- vision, accepted mp to the present
 date, was already established in principle.

      The knowledge of facts was too meagre as yet to prove the ideas of
Thomas Toung, and, therefore, they were gradually more and more dis-
 regarded. It was not until thirty years ago that Maxwell and Helmholtz
 saved them from ntter oblivion. The former even attempted an experi-

 mental quantitative demonstration of the truth of these ideas.

      The methods and the results of Maxwell's investigations are too well
 known to be specially dwelt upon here. But we must specially dwell
 upon this point, that at the same time Helmholtz most emphatically de-
 clared that colour-blindness (which in the meantime was better studied)
 was the result of the absence of one fundamental sensation, although he
did not know Thomas Toung's ideas on this point.

      The results of Maxwell's investigation must be greatly valued, because
 they contained the first measurements with spectral light ; but for the
very same reason, that they were the first, they could not be such that

--final conclusions could be drawn from them.
      During the last ten years that is, twenty years after Maxwell's in-

--vestigations the well-known scientists Kries, Frey, Bonders, and Lord

Rayleigh, supplied with greatly improved instruments, carried out more
exact measurements, which, however, extend only over certain parts of
the spectrum. These facts, and the circumstance that great facilities were

off"ered at the physical laboratory of the University in Berlin for investi-

gations of this kind, induced me to take up these measurements and to

extend them over the whole spectrum, and they were finally carried out

by me and my colleague Dr. Dieterici.

     § 2. The investigation must begin with the reduction of the infinitely
large number of colour-sensations to the smallest possible number of
elementary sensations, which by their intensity and mutual relation produce

every possible kind of colour-sensation. This is a purely experimental

problem, whose solution can and will be made independent of every theo-
retical hypothesis. This is the reason why we choose the expression ' ele-
mentary sensation ' and not ' fundamental sensation,' because the latter

expression usually refers to a simple process going on at the terminal

of the optical nerve. This distinction is necessary, as will appear

later on.

     The first important simplification of our problem is afforded by the
fact that in the case of every individual we can produce every sensation
of colour by spectral light and their mixture. It seems expedient here to
lay down the following definition : given that the distribution of light in
our spectrum is such as we have it in a diff'raction-spectrum, then we
shall call ' curves of elementary sensation ' those curves which determine
the intensity of elementary sensation for any given wave-length.

     Having premised this definition we can at once proceed to a brief

description of the apparatus.

     It is an apparatus constructed by Prof. Helmholtz for mixture of

colours, and on this occasion improved by us in many details. It is a

spectroscope wiii an equilateral prism P (fig. 1), and two collimators C C
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

the telescope T paving instead of the eye-piece a slit S, at the focus of its

object-glass. Each collimator contains an achromatical iceland-spar J,
and in front of the slit a Nicol IT ; but for the present we shall disregard
these additions to the collimators. The slits 83 and S3 being illuminated

Let us consider the

ejffect of placing the ice-

land-spar between the slit

and the object-glass of the

collimator. This effect will

be that in general we shall

have two pairs of spectra

at S,, one pair due to sUt S2, the other due to S3, and that the lights of
one pair belonging to the same slit will be polarised perpendicularly to
each other. It is evident that an eye placed close

before the slit Sj will see the same picture as                                                                                Fig. 2.

monochromatic light, but a light which is the

resultant of two component lights, and now the

object of interposing the Nicol between the slit

and the source of light is simply to vary the ratio

of these two components to each other. When

the iceland-spar is quite close to the slit we have

monochromatic light in the corresponding half

of the picture.

In this manner we can compare mono-

chromatic light with monochromatic, a mixture (The two parts of this figure,

we examined.

The coefficients and variables of the equation are given by the position

of the collimators, the distances between the iceland-spars and the slits,
the positions of the Nicols, and the micrometricaUy measured width of the
two bilateral slits. The source of light was a specially constructed gas-
lamp, so that our direct results had, of course, reference to the prismatic
spectrum of a certain kind of gaslight. But in order that they should

have a general character we calculated what they would have been if we
had employed a diffraction spectrum of sunhght. Of course I cannot
think of entering upon the description of a great many and very interest-

ing details of our proceeding. I shall therefore pass over directly to the
results of our investigation.

the whole spectrum into three parts. The parts near the ends we shall
call ' boundary regions ' and the parts between them the ' interval' For
these persons each boundary region has its own light, varying in intensity

only but not in colour, and the colour of any part of the interval they can
produce by the mixture of the light of two parts, one from each boundary

region. Here we must assume two elementary sensations, and the simplest

way to analyse the colour-system of such persons is to take the sensations
of the boundary regions as elementary sensations. On these assumptions

we have determined the curves of elementary sensations for this class of

persons.

   We Khave obtained three different curves. The curve in fig. 3 was

obtained from every person but the other curve was diflerent with dif-

ferent persons. Some had the curve W,, others had the curve W,. So

that as far as our own observations go we must distinguish all the colour-

Ablind into two classes, and two classes only.  third very difierent class

of the colour-blind was found by Professors Holmgren and Donders. But

their analysis was a qualitative one only. For the purpose of simplifying

calculations, which I shall mention later on, the curves were drawn in

such a manner that the area bounded by them and the axis of abscissae

should be the same for each curve.

     So far we have two large classes of persons, and we have seen that the

small number of persons belonging to the first class possess one elemen-

tary sensation only, whereas the large number of persons belonging to the

second class possess two elementary sensations, and we have also seen

that this class must be subdivided into two divisions or types.

     Now(c) we pass over to the third very large class, which includes all

Wepersons not belonging to any of the two preceding classes.                          shall

presently see that if in the case of these persons we assume three elemen-

tary sensations, we shall be able to explain all colour-equations made by

them.
     It has been found by Lord Rayleigh and Professor Donders that the

persons of this class differ from each other considerably, and that this

class, too, must be divided into two subdivisions at least ; the persons

belonging to the first subdivision forming the great majority of this
                                                               --

third class, whereas the persons of the second subdivision are not more

numerously represented than the persons of the preceding class.

   A person of this third class on examining the spectrum finds two

boundary regions situated similarly as in the preceding class, and we
assume, as we did before, that the colour-sensations of these regions are

elementaiy sensations. The parts from the boundary regions to a certain

distance towards the middle of the spectrum we shall call the ' boundary

intervals,' and the remaining part between them we shall call the ' central

interval.' The colour-equations have shown that in each boundary in-
terval we must assume two elementary sensations, one which ifj the same

for both, whereas the other is the elementary sensation of the adjoining

boundary region, and similar equations have also shown that any colour

of the central interval is the result of the three elementaiy sensations

already found, that is, the sensations R, G, and V. I would like to

mention here that only such colour-equations could be used, in the case

of which the colours as to their hue and saturation could be easily matched,

and in whose combination the errors of observation had no great influence

upon the results of calculation.

To obtain the first object whitish colours had to be avoided, and only

neighbouring parts of the spectrum had to be mixed ; whereas to obtain
the second object the component parts of the spectrum had to be at a

considerable distance from each other. This, of course, places the experi-

menter in a sort of dilemma, and many thousands of colour-equations had

to be produced before the proper ones were obtained.

   VThe continuous curves R, G, and (fig. 4) belong to the first sub-

division of this third class, and the two dotted curves together with the

curve V belong to the                          Fig. 4.

second subdivision. I

shall henceforth de-

note the colour-sensa-

tions of the first sub-

division as the normal,

and those of the second

as the abnormal.

   § 4. Having accom-

plished the analysis of

colour-sensations with-

out the assistance of

any hypothesis let us

consider whether we *

can draw any inferences as to the physiological process which produces the
sensations of colours. Following the above-mentioned usual definition, we

shall call that sensation, which is caused by a simple process at the terminal

of the optical nerve, a ' fundamental sensation.' It is evident that for every

person the number of fundamental sensations is equal to the number of
elementary sensations, and that we can speak of ' curves of fundamental sen-

sation ' just the same as we did before of curves of elementary sensation.

We shall employ the following symbols for fundamental sensations :

    By means of these equations we can construct curves having the same

relation to fundamental sensations as the others had to elementary sen-

sations.

    The object of this superposition is to examine whether among the
infinite number of possible curves of fundamental sensations we can find
three such curves that a person of the first class will have some one of
them, a person of the second class will have some two of them, and a

person of the third class will have all three of them. This of course

would be the simplest relation between the three classes.

     Such a relation was found to exist, but only after we disregarded the
first class and the second (abnormal) division of the third class. But it

is a remarkable circumstance that all persons of the first class so far

known were found to have pathologically defective eyes.
     The case of the first (normal) subdivision of the third class we shall

presently discuss.

     The result of those superpositions were the curve JR, ®, and 35 in
fig. 5. They all belong to the normal (the numerous) division of the

                                                                           third class. The curves

@special case of the third class, namely, a case in which the curve has

BO far altered its form as to coincide with Si, then the abnormal division
would be a transition form. Are there any facts in our experience that

could lead us on to make such an assumption ? Before answering this

question I must call your kind attention to the following circumstance :
     If we construct Newton's colour-diagram (fig. 6), we find that the

colours of the three fundamental sensations are :

For ift, red (somewhat more purple than the colour of the long-
            waved end of the spectrum).

For ®, green (about the wave-length 505 ^yu).

For 9S, blue (about the wave-length 470 fxfi).

Assuming now that the colour of the fundamental sensation of ®

remains the same, whereas the form of the curve is altered in such a

manner as to coin-

cide with St, it is                          Fig. 6.

evident that the                             Green

sensation belonging

to this curve would

be a resultant of the

sensations belong-

ing to 01 and ®i,
that is, a yellow of

about the wave-

length 575 fxfi.
      I need hardly

mention that co-

lour-sensations are

entirely subjective,

and that in general

the colour-sensa-

tions of two classes

                                      A,a,B

cannot be compared

to each other. For-

tunately Professors Red                               &,H Blue

von Hippel and

Holmgren have met with a young man who with respect to his right eye

belonged to the first type of the second class, and with respect to his

left eye belonged to the normal division of the third class.

    And this is the only person who can assist us in answering our

question. His fundamental sensations for the first-mentioned eye were
yellow and blue as compared to the sensations of the other, that is, the

normal eye.
     This circumstance, therefore, justifies us in assuming that the first

type of the second class is a special case of the third class. But whether

the second type is also a special case of the third class future experience

only will show.

     § 5. The following experiments will serve as an additional evidence

that our results are correct. These experiments were made at my insti-

gation by Mr. Brodhun, a student in our laboratory.
     Before entering upon the details of these experiments I must premise

a few observations. According to our theory the colour at any part of
the spectrum is determined by the ratio between the fundamental sensa-
tions, whose resultant produces that colour. The change of this ratio
--438 KEPORT 1886,

Adetermines the rate at which the colour changes.  sUght inspection of

our fundamental curves shows that in the normal division of the third

class there are two places in the spectrum at which the ratio of the

fundamental sensations changes most rapidly, the one near the line D, the

other near the Hne F.

    Now what is the simplest experimental method for determining the

places in the spectrum at which the change of colour is the most rapid ?

If we take a light of known wave-length, and match it to a part of

                              Fig. 7.

another spectrum, simply by subjectively judging the colour, the

difference in wave-length will give us the error of our judgment.

Repeating this process with the same light at the same place ia gx'eat

number of times we shall obtain a mean error, which our judgment is apt

to make in regard to this colour. It is evident that the smaller the

change of colour at a given place of the spectrum the larger will be that

mean error. This is the way in which Mr. Brodhun has determined

experimentally the places in the spectrum at which the colour changes

A A Amost rapidly. The curve  is the result of this sort of experimental

Weinvestigation on a person of the third class.  see that the places of

Dmost rapid change of colour are about the lines and F, and this agrees

perfectly with what we have predicted from the inspection of our curves

of fundamental sensation.

    The curve B B B, which was obtained in the same way from a person

belonging to the second type of the second class, shows that there is one

place of most rapid variation of colour, and this agrees perfectly with the

inferences which we can draw from the inspection of the two curves of

fundamental sensation for this type.

These are the pi-incipal features of our investigation on this subject.

Its result seems to prove that the views of Thomas Young, slightly

modified by modern experimental research, are perfectly correct.

Thomas Young's theory of colour -vision, one of the most beautiful

tmgs in his laurel crown, after lying as it were buried in the darkness of

oblivion for more than half of a century, was brought to light again by

Maxwell and Helmholtz, and, as we have seen, modern science seems

On the Explicit Form of the Complete Cubic Differential Resolvent.
                   By the Kev. Egbert Harley, F.R.S.

   m[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed extenso

                                            among the Keports.]

This paper is intended as supplementary to others relating to the
theory of differential resolvents which I have had the honour to sub-
mit to the Section at former meetings of the Association (see ' Reports,'
Transactions of Sections, 1862, pp. 4, 5 ; 1865, p. 6 ; 1866, pp. 2, 3 ;
1873, pp. 17-21 ; 1878, pp. 466-8).

    About four years ago Mr. Robert Rawson and myself calculated by

independent methods the complete cubic differential resolvent ; in other

words, we determined the explicit form of the linear differential equation
of the second order which is satisfied by any root of the general algebraical
equation (with unmodified coefficients) of the third degree. The result
at which, after much labour, we both arrived has not hitherto been
published ; and I desire now to place it on record, indicating at the same

time some of the details of my own calculation. The process employed

by Mr. Rawson may be elsewhere explained.

     Write the cubic equation in the form

and consider the coefficients a, b, c, d as functions of a single parameter,
say X. Differentiate with respect to x, and denote the differentiations by

accents ; then a slight reduction gives

              ^,^ +(a'h--ah') i/ (a'c-ac') y+^(a'd--ad') .
              + +^"^

                                                 a(a7/ 2by c)

Integral ise the function of ?/ by any of the known methods, the result

takes the form

                - +Ay'= {(a'b ab')y^ (a'c--ac')y
                    +^(a'd-ad')} (By^ + Cy + B),

where

                A=a(aW-6abcd+4-ac^ + UH--3b^c^);

                B=2a(ac-b^)
                                                                              ;

                C=-a''d+7abc--6h^;

                D=-abd + 4<ac^-3b^c.

    Develop the right-hand member and eliminate aU powers of y higher
than the second by means of the original cubic.

              On the Phenomena and Theories of Solution.
                    By Professor W. A. Tilden, F.R.S.

     [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                             among the Reports.]

In what follows I propose to review the principal phenomena ob-
served in the act of solution of solids, and especially of metallic salts
and other comparatively simple compounds in liquids, with the object of
arriving, if possible, at some conclusion as to the physical explanation of
the facts. For want of time and space an exhaustive statement of all
that is known cannot be attempted. The most important parts of

--the subject omitted are the following : Electrolysis, formulae relating to

expansion and density of solutions, their absorption-spectra, and other
optical properties, and magnetic rotatory power.

     One question which must arise in the course of the discussion is
whether the phenomena are to be accounted as chemical or physical, and
this necessarily involves another question, namely, what is chemical
combination, and by what criterion can it be distinguished from adhesion

or cohesion, or other manifestation of molecular or molar attraction ?

Postponing this enquiry for the present, we niay assume that chemical

combination has generally been supposed to be distinguished by definite
proportions in weight and volume of the acting masses, by definite
thermal changes, and by marked differences between the properties of the
compound and those of its components.

     The various theories which have been proposed to explain the nature
of solution are roughly divisible into two classes, namely, those which
represent solution as a kind of chemical combination, and those which
explain the phenomena by reference to the mechanical intermixture of
molecules, or by the influence of the rival attractions of cohesion in the
solid and liquid, and of adhesion of the solid to the liquid.

     The older writers seem universally to have regarded the act of solu-
tion as a manifestation of chemical attraction. Thus Henry (' Elements

of Chemistry,' 11th ed., 1829, vol. i. Chap. II.) refers to the solution

of common salt in water as 'one of the simplest cases that can be adduced

of the efficiency of chemical affinity, for solution is always the result of
an affinity between the fluid and the solid which is acted upon, often
feeble it is true, yet sufficient in force to overcome the cohesion of the
solid. This affinity continues to act until at length a certain point is
attained where the affinity of the solid and fluid for each other is balanced
by the cohesion of the solid, and the solution cannot be carried further.
This point is called saturation, and the fluid obtained is termed a saturated

solution.'

     Tui-ner, in his ' Elements of Chemistry ' (1842), also attributes solution
to ' the exercise of chemical attraction.'

     Gay-Lussac (' Ann. Chim. Phys.' xi. 297) states that ' the solubility
of a body in water depends on two causes, affinity and heat ; or more
exactly the affinity of salt for water varies with the temperature.'

     BerthoUet, in his ' Statique Chimique,' gives an elaborate statement
of his view, which is too long to quote in full, but the substance of
which is to set forth the influence of affinity in bringing about solution
--' ;

ON THE PHENOMENA AND THEORIES OF SOLUTION.  445

and the resistance offered by gases in virtue of their elasticity and by

solids in virtue of their cohesion.

     But Berthollet seems to have regarded chemical affinity as very closely

connected with the cause of cohesion, if not identical with it. In the
English translation by B. Lambert, 1804, to which alone I have had

access, the following passages occur in the introduction, pp. xviii et seq. :

' The first effect of affinity to which I call attention is that produced by
the cohesion of the particles which enter into the composition of a body
it is the effect of the reciprocal affinity of these particles which I dis-
tinguish by the name of the force of cohesion, and which becomes a
force opposed to all those tending to cause them to enter into another
combination, while it, on the contrary, tends to reunite them.

      ' Every af&nity which tends by its action to diminish the effect ot
cohesion ought to be regarded as a force opposed to it, and of which the
result is solution. When, therefore, a liquid acts on a solid, the force of

solution can produce the liquefaction of the solid if it is superior to that
of cohesion ; but this effect sometimes takes place immediately and
sometimes it requires that the cohesion should be first weakened by

a commencement of combination ; there are circumstances in which the
liquid can only act on the surface of the solid and wet it ; finally the
solid cannot even be wetted when its affinity with the liquid does not

produce an effect greater than that of the mutual affinity of the parts of

this latter.

      ' These two forces, therefore, according to their relations produce
different results, which must be distinguished, but which are not to be
attributed, in conformity with the opinion of some philosophers, to two
affinities, one of which they have considered as chemical and the other as

derived from the laws of physics,' &c.

      The same views with illustrative examples are expressed in Berthollet's

work on the ' Laws of Chemical Affinity.' On page 63 of the English
translation, by M. Farrell, 1804, we find this passage : ' Solvents act on

bodies which they dissolve by their affinity and quantity like all sub-
stances which tend to combine ; and whatever has been said of combina-

tion in general is applicable to them.'
      It seems pretty clear, therefore, that Berthollet regarded solution as

an act of chemical combination. He seems to have got some of his ideas

from Guyton de Morveau, who some years before had published experi-

ments on the adhesion of solids to liquids with the object of proving that

 ' the adhesion of solids to liquids is in proportion to their affinity of

 solution.'

      L. Gmelin (' Handbook,' vol. i. p. 112) summarises very clearly the

views prevailing up to his time : ' Cohesion appears to exert a much more

decided influence (than gravitation) on the decomposition of chemical

--compounds at least of the less intimate kind. The hitherto received

theory on this matter is as follows :--When a solid body dissolves in a

liquid, the cohesion of the solid acts in opposition to the dissolving power
of the fluid ; the two forces tend to equilibrate each other ; and in pro-
portion as the fluid takes up more and more of the solid, its tendency to

--dissolve a further quantity or in other words, its affinity for the solid

diminishes, and ultimately becomes no greater than the cohesion of the

solid and the tendency of its particles to remain united amongst them-
selves, and then the process of solution stops. But the cohesion of a
solid body is generally diminished by elevation of temperature ; con-
sequently when the fluid is heated up to a certain point a further solution
usually takes place, till by this new addition of the solid body the
affinity of the fluid for it is so far diminished that equilibrium between

that force, and the cohesion of the sohd is again established. If now a
solution thus saturated while warm be cooled down to its former

temperature the solid body regains its original cohesive power, and a
portion of it separates from the fluid in order to unite in larger and
usually crystalline masses, the quantity remaining in solution being only

just so much as the fluid would directly have taken up at this lower

temperature.'

     Amonsr modern chemists we find Professor Josiah P. Cooke statins:

in his ' Chemical Philosophy ' (ed. 1882, p. 151) ' that the facts seem to
justify the opinion that solution is in every case a chemical combination
of the substances dissolved with the solvent, and that it diffei's from
other examples of chemical change only in the weakness of the combining

force.'

     But the most consistent and powerful supporter of the hypothesis
that in solutions the dissolved substance and the solvent are chemically
combined together is M. Berthelot, whose views are expressed very clearly
in his ' Mecanique Chimique,' from which the following is extracted
(vol. ii. p. 160 et seq.) :

     ' Les phenomenes de la dissolution normale sont en quelque sorte inter-

mediaires entre le simple melange et la combinaison veritable. En efiet,

d'une part I'aptitude a s'unir pour former un systeme homogene indique
une affinite reelle entre le solide et le dissolvant ; mais, d'autre part, cette

union cesse sous I'influence d'une simple evaporation, et elle se produit,
en apparence du moins, suivant des proportions qui varient d'une maniere
continue avec la temperature.

     ' Cependant il me parait probable que le point de depart de la dissolu-

tion proprement dite reside dans la formation de certaines combinaisons
definies entre le dissolvant et le corps dissous. Tels seraient les hydrates
definis formes au sein de la liqueur meme, entre les sels et I'eau existant
dans cette liqueur ; hydrates analogues ou identiques aux hydrates

definis des memes composants, connus sous I'etat cristallise.
     ' On est done conduit tout naturellement a se demander si ces hydrates

ne subsisteraient pas jusque dans les dissolutions, et s'il ne s'en formerait

pas d'analogues, dans les cas memes ou I'on ne saurait pas les isoler par

cristallisation.

      ' Je pense en efiet qu'il en est ainsi, et que chaque dissolution est
reellement formee par le melange d'une partie du dissolvant libre avec
une partie du corps dissous, combinee au dissolvant suivant la loi des
proportions definies. Tantot cette combinaison se formerait integrale-

ment et d'une fa9on exclusive, ce qui me parait etre sensiblement le cas

pour les premieres limites d'equilibre entre I'eau et les acides forts.
Tantot, au contraire, cette combinaison ne se foi'merait qu'en partie,

le tout constituant un systeme dissocie dans lequel le corps anhydre

coexiste avec I'eau et son hydrate, ce qui me parait etre le cas pour les

dissolutions formees par I'acetate de sonde, le sulfate de sonde et la

plupart des sels alcalins. Plusieurs hydrates definis d'un meme corps

dissous, les uns stables, les autres dissocies, peuvent exister a la fois au
ON THE PHENOMENA AND THEOBIES OF SOLUTION.  447

sein d'une dissolution. lis constituent alors un systeme en equilibre,

dans lequel les proportions relatives de chaque hydrate varient avec la

quantite d'eau, la temperature, _ ainsi qu'avec la presence des autres
corps, acides, bases on sels, capables de s'unir pour leur propre compte,

soit a I'ean, soit au corps primitivement dissous. Ce serait le degre
inegal de cette dissociation des hydrates, variable avec la tempera-

ture, qui ferait varier le coefficient de solubiUte du corps dissous lui-

meme.'

    We may now turn to those writers who, whilst referring the

phenomena of solution to a molecular attraction of some kind, do not

attribute solubility to the formation of chemical compounds of definite

composition.

   --Graham is one writer who distinctly ranges himself on this side. He

says : ' The attraction between salt and water which occasions the

solution of the former, diflFers in several circumstances fi'om the affinity

which leads to the production of definite chemical compounds. In
solution combination takes place in indefinite proportions, a certain

quantity of common salt dissolving in or combining with any quantity of
water, however large. . . . But the maximum proportion of salt

dissolved or the saturating quantity has no relation to the atomic weight
of the salt, and indeed varies exceedingly with the temperature of the
solvent. The limit to the solubility of a salt seems to be immediately

occasioned by its cohesion.' And again : " The force which produces

solution differs essentially from chemical affinity in being exerted be-
tween analogous particles, in preference to particles which are very unlike
and resembles more in this respect the attraction of cohesion.'

      Brande, also, appears to have taken a similar view, for, although he
makes no formal statement of his opinion, the following passage occurs

--in his ' Manual ' (5th edition, 1841), p. 110 : ' When common salt is

dissolved in water its particles may be regarded as disposed at regular

distances throughout the fluid ; and if the quantity of water be consider-

able, the particles will be too far asunder to exert reciprocal attraction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

in other words, they will be more powerfully attracted by the water than
by each other.'

     Daniell, in his ' Chemical Philosophy ' (1842), ascribes the phenomena
of solution to the conflict between the ' heterogeneous adhesion ' of liquid
to solid and the ' homogeneous attraction' of cohesion.

     In Miller's 'Chemistry,' vol. i. (2nd edit. 1860), p. %7, we find

--the following passages, which show more in detail the application of

the same idea : ' Adhesion is frequently manifested between solids and
liquids with sufficient force to overcome the power of cohesion, and the
substance is then said to become dissolved, or to undergo solution. . . .
Anything that weakens the force of cohesion in the solid favours solution.
Thus if the substance be powdered it becomes dissolved more quickly,
both from the large extent of surface which it exposes and from the

partial destruction of cohesion. In the same way heat, by increasing the

distance between the particles of the solid, lessens its cohesion, and
probably thus contributes so powerfully to assist in producing solution.
If a solid body be introduced in successive portions into a quantity of a
liquid capable of dissolving it, the first portions disappear rapidly, and as
each succeeding quantity is added it is dissolved more slowly, until at

length a point is reached at which it is no longer dissolved. When this

occurs the force of cohesion balances that of adhesion, and the liquid is
--448 REPORT 1 886.

said to be saturated. . . . Although in the majority of instances the
solubility of a substance is increased by heat, it is not uniformly so.
(Exceptions quoted : lime, sulphate and sucrate of lime, sulphate and

seleniate of soda, &c.). These anomalous results may be partly explained

by the consideration that heat diminishes the force of adhesion as well
as that of cohesion ; generally speaking cohesion is the more rapidly
diminished of the two, although not uniformly so, and in the cases of

which we are now speaking it would appear that the adhesive force

decreases in a greater ratio than the cohesion of the saline particles.'

     The same idea forms the basis of the theory which has been supported

so actively by the writings and experimental researches of Dr. W. W. J.

Nicol (' Phil. Mag.' Feb. 1883, &c.).

  --Dr. Nicol's view is stated in the following passage : ' The solution

of a salt in water is a consequence of the attraction of the molecules of
water for a molecule of salt exceeding the attraction of the molecules

of salt for one another. It follows, then, that as the number of dissolved
salt molecules increases, the attraction of the dissimilar molecules is more
and more balanced by the attraction of the similar molecules ; when these
two forces are in equilibrium saturation takes place ' (Feb. 1883).

     L. Dossios has made use of the kinetic theory of Clausius relating to
the constitution of bodies and the process of evaporation as the basis
of a theory of solution. If we assume the kinetic energy of two

neighbouring molecules to be less than their attraction, such molecules
remain at a determinate distance from each other. This is the solid state.

The gaseous condition is assumed when the kinetic energy of a molecule

overcomes the combined attractions of the other molecules present. In
a liquid the energy of two neighbouring molecules is sufficient to enable
them to overcome each other's attraction, but is not equal to the united
attractions of the surrounding molecules. Relations of the same kind

may be supposed to exist in an aggregation of dissimilar molecules such

as compose a solution.

    Two liquids are miscible in all proportions when the attraction of

dissimilar molecules is capable of overcoming the attraction of similar

molecules, &c.

    The solution of solid bodies in liquids may be reduced to the same

principles. As, however, the attraction of the molecules of solids to one
another is large, and the kinetic energy destroyed, a solution of a solid
cannot be formed in all proportions, but a point of saturation is attained,
whilst the solubility of solid bodies increases generally with the tempera-
ture, since the action of heat is always opposed to molecular attraction

(' Jahresbericht,' 1867, p. 92).

    A physical theory, which differs from those referred to above in not

requiring the assumption of an attraction of either chemical or mechanical
nature between the molecules of the solvent and those of the solvend, was
briefly enunciated in a paper communicated to the Royal Society by
TUden and Shenstone in 1883. In discussing the connection between
fusibility and solubility of salts, the authors point out that the facts tend
to ' support a kinetic theory of solution based on the mechanical theory
of heat. The solution of a solid in a liquid would accordingly be
analogous to the sublimation of such a solid into a gas, and proceeds
from the intermixture of molecules detached from the solid with those of
the surrounding liquid. Such a process is promoted by rise of tempera-

ture, partly because the molecules of the still solid substance make longer

excursions from their normal centre, partly because they are subjected to
more violent encounter with the moving molecules of liquid' ('Phil.
Trans.' i. 1884, p. 30). Such a theory, however, serves to account only

for the initial stage in the process of solution, and does not explain the
selective power of solvents nor the limitation of solvent power of a given

liquid, &c.

    How far is it true that evolution of heat indicates chemical com-

hination ? Does the evolution of heat in dissolving a solid in water or
in adding more water to its solution indicate the formation of hydrates,
that is, of chemical compounds of the dissolved substance with water in
definite proportions ? Thomsen answers this question in the negative
(' Thermochem. Untersuchuugen,' iii. p. 20).

=The total heat of solution of SO3 in 1600 H,0 is therefore 21320

+ 17857 39177.

The following diagram (1) shows graphically the successive thermal

changes consequent upon adding this quantity of water gradually to

sulphuric anhydride. Although more than half the total heat evolution

occurs on addition of the first molecule of water, the succeeding mole-
^--cules give a quite appreciable amount ; the second gives, in fact,

    At what point in such a curve should we be justified in setting up a
distinction between the efiect due to chemical combination and that due

to other causes ?

      In the act of solution of solids, and especially of anhydrous salts in

water, the volume of solution is always less than the sum of the volumes
of the solid and its solvent, with the exception of some ammonium salts

in which expansion occurs. Similarly the addition of water to a solu-

tion is followed by contraction. This contraction may be due to mere

mechanical fitting of the molecules of the one liquid into the interspaces

between the molecules of the other, just as when one pint of small shot
is mixed with one pint of large shot the volume of the mixture is less
than two pints. This, I apprehend, would not by itself be attended by
loss of energy (See Mendelejeff", ' J. Russ. Chem. Soc' xvi. 643, 644.
Abs. in ' J. Chem. Soc' Feb. 1885, p. 114). Or it may arise from the

adjustment of the motion of the molecules of the constituents to the

conditions requisite for the formation of a uniform liquid (Thomsen
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               '

heat we can calculate the amount of heat that would be evolved for a

taking the coefficient of expansion of H2SO4H2O to be '00056 for 1° C,
and its specific heat -442, we find that this would correspond to an evolution

of heat amounting to 4588-9 calories. The evolution of heat actually-
observed being 6379 according to Thomsen, there is a difierence of 1790
heat units, which is unaccounted for on the hypothesis that the change of
volnme is due to just such a change in the mean distances and motions
of the molecules of the liquid as would be brought about by a change of
temperature, and this may really indicate some kind or some amount of

chemical combination.

     The majority of solids, and nearly all salts, expand on being melted.

And as, whatever theory we adopt as to the constitution of solutions, we

must admit that the dissolved substance is in the liquid state, it is obvious
that in all cases where a solid is dissolved by a liquid the change of
volume which is observed must be the resultant of the two distinct
changes of volume consequent upon the (1) liquefaction of the solid, and
(2) the intermixture of the resulting liquid with the solvent.

     The diagram (fig. 1) already given exhibits the amount of contraction
observed in the case of sulphuric acid and water, and the following table
shows the observed and calculated molecular volumes by which the amount

of contraction is indicated.

tion of a much greater amount of heat than the solution of the same

quantity of the soHd in a relatively small mass of water.
     In like manner it is observed that the addition of water or of salt to

a solution already formed occasions contraction, but the amount of this

contraction constantly diminishes with each successive dose of water or

of solid salt. This has just been shown for the water. The following

table, taken from Nicol's paper (' Phil. Mag.,' June 1884),^ shows the effect

Aof adding salt in successive molecules. The column headed shows

that the molecular volume of each successive molecule is greater than
the preceding, the increase being from 17'08 up to 22*87 for the last

molecule.

   In this case, common salt, we find in accordance with the general rule

(Thomsen, iii. p. 28 et seq.) that the heat of dissolution being negative

the heat of dilution is also negative. Supposing we explain the heat-

absorption which attends the act of solution by referring to the change of

the solid salt to liquid it still remains to be considered to what cause we
can ascribe the heat-absorption attending dilution when liquid is mixed

with liquid and no change of state is involved. There is contraction upon

adding water to a solution of common salt, but this, if it is connected

with any thermal change at all, would probably lead to an evolution of
heat. It has just been shown that the thermal change attending solution
of salt in water cannot be due solely to the change of state from solid to
liquid. If it were, the same amount of heat-absorption would be observed
in dissolving salt in any proportion of water, and no change would be
produced by adding more water. There is therefore apparently some
agency which gives a positive thermal change on solution of the solid,
and another which occasions a negative change on the dilution with more
water, the observed amounts of heat absorbed being the difference be-
tween these two.

     The positive thermal change probably corresponds to some kind of
union between the salt molecules and the water. The negative thermal
change is chiefly connected in the act of solution with the physical change
from solid to liquid. The negative change consequent on dilution is not

so easily accounted for. But it may be due to double decomposition with

the water. The reaction

                    NaHO + HCl = NaCl + H.O

is attended with heat-evolution, and its reversal

                    NaCl + H2O = NaHO + HCl

must lead to heat-absoi'ption.
     From Thomsen's results

                 NaHO + HCl + 2OOH0O = + 13745,

and

                      =NaCl -1- lOHoO - 525,

and

              (NaCllOHjO) + 190H,O =
                          =- (1230 - 525) - 705.

--So that for complete decomposition we should require 13745 cal.,

whilst in diluting a solution almost saturated down to a very weak con-

dition, the hypothesis does not require more than  ----705  , or a little

more than five per cent, of the whole.

    My own experiments on heat of dissolution of salts at different

temperatures (' Proc. R. S.' 1885) led me to the conclusion that decom-

position of this kind did occur, and that it increases with rise of

temperature. Thomsen, on the other hand (iii. p. 20), considers that

his results do not point to a decomposition in such cases as common salt

but he admits it in^the case of bisulphates of sodium and potassium.
     As a rule, a salt which on being dissolved in water gives out heat gives

a further amount when its solution is diluted. On the other hand, a
salt which in dissolving absorbs heat absorbs a further amount when

its solution is diluted. Of thirty-five salts examined by Thomsen, twenty-
454 REPORT-- 1886.

nine conform to this rule. The exceptions most difficult to explain are
sodium sulphate and carbonate, both of which exhibit anomalies in their

solubility.

However we may ultimately explain the peculiarities of these two

salts, the fact remains that heat evolved or absorbed during the admixture

of any substance with water is in every case a continuous function of

the quantity of water added, and a thermal change gradually diminishing

in amount is observed on the addition of successive quantities of water,

till an indefinitely large volume has been added, and the change becomes

too small to be traced by the thermometer.

Similarly the contraction which ensues on diluting an aqueous

solution proceeds continuously, and, as already shown, the molecular

volume of a salt in solutions of different strengths is continuously

greater the larger the amount of salt present, so that in none of these

thermal or volumetric phenomena is any discontinuity observed nor any

indications of the formation of compounds of definite composition dis-

tinguishable by characteristic properties.

If, however, we admit that no definite chemical compounds are

formed in such a case as the admixture of sulphuric acid II2SO4 with

water, what are we to say to the parallel case of the neutralisation of

some polybasic acids with alkali ?

The second mol. of NaHO to the preceding mixture + 12249

The third mol. of NaHO to the preceding mixture + 6951

     Arsenic acid gives similar results, the several values being in
each case a little higher than those obtained with phosphoric acid
(Thomsen, i. 204).

   The case of periodic acid (Thomsen, i. 244) is still more noteworthy.

                H5l06Aq+ KHOAq = + 5150C.

                            + 2KH0Aq= 26590
                           + 3KH0Aq= 29740
                            + 5KH0Aq= 32040

    Here we have great inequality in the amount of heat evolved on
addition of successive molecules of alkali and no sign of approaching a
maximum. These values are indicated on the accompanying diagram
(fig. 3):-

The second molecule of NaHO therefore seems to give more heat than

the first.

In the case of acids and alkalies we do not hesitate to accept such

results as indicating the formation of definite chemical compounds, and

the increase in the specific heat of water at this higher temperature.

--(For numerical values see Naumann, ' Thermochemie,' pp. 269 271.)

    It is also well known that the vapour pressure of water holding in

solution almost any dissolved solid is less than the vapour pressure of
pure water, and that the boiling point of a liquid is raised by the addition

to it of any soluble non-volatile substance.
     The well-known researches of Wiillner (Pogg. ' Ann.' ciii. p. 529, and

ex. p. 564) led him to the conclusion that the reduction in the tension of
the vapour of water consequent upon the addition of soluble substances
is proportional to the amount of dissolved substance (see, however,

Nicol, * Phil. Mag.' Oct. 1885).

     The law connecting the amount of dissolved substance with the
diminution of pressure, or the amount of diminution with the tempera-

ture, is, however, a matter of small importance in connection with the

present inquiry. The fact that there is reduction of pressure is the
important point, and this can only be explained upon the hypothesis that
there is no free water present at all ; that is, that there is no water
present which is not more or less under the influence of the dissolved
substance. If any water were present in an uncombined state the rate
of evaporation from the surface would doubtless be slower than the rate
of evaporation of pure water at the same temperature, but the pressure
of the evolved vapour must in time attain to the same maximum..

Water of Crystallisation.

What becomes of water of crystallisation forms a part of the same
Wequestion as to the relation of solvent to solvend.
                                                      know that when

white copper sulphate is dissolved in water evolution of heat results, and

a blue solution is formed of the same colour as the crystals of the
hydrated salt and the solution formed by dissolving them in water.

Similarly blue anhydrous cobalt chloride dissolves in water, forming a

red solution of the same tint as the red crystals which contain the salt

Weand water united together.   are, therefore, disposed to conclude that

these salts, and by analogy those which are colourless, retain their hold
upon the water of crystallisation when they are dissolved in water.

     Thomsen has also shown ' that of the thirty- five salts examined by him

twenty-nine exhibit the peculiarity that when the anhydrous salt dissolves

in water with evolution of heat, the addition of more water also causes

evolution of heat, and that when, on the contrary, the heat of solution is

negative, the heat of dilution is also negative. The former without

exception unite with water to form crystalhsable definite hydrates ; the

latter do not.

  --Thomsen states his opinion on the point thus (iii. p. 31) : ' There

is no doubt that the salts which dissolve in water with evolution of much

heat, and form crystallised hydrates, are present also in the solution as

tydrated compounds ; but a determination of the number of water mole-
cules contained in such compounds would be very difficult,' &c. Thomsen

oonsiders the hypothesis very probable that a salt dissolved in water cannot

retain chemically combined a larger number of water molecules than are

already combined in the acid and base from which the salt may be pro-

duced. Thomsen also considers that the chemical constitution of the
hydrates present in a solution is not altered by dilution of the liquid with

more water.
    But against these facts above stated we find that salts which are very

soluble, and which crystallise with a large amount of water, such as
calcium chloride, do not, as a rule, reduce the pressure of vapour of water

in which they are dissolved to a greater extent than salts which, like
sodium chloride and potassium nitrate, crystallise habitually without

water. There can be no doubt that every one of these and similar thermal

effects are, like the corresponding volume claanges, merely differential
results, which represent the resultant of several simultaneous or im-

mediately consecutive operations.

   A very important observation has been made by Dr. Nicol, which

bears directly on this question. In his study of the molecular volumes

of salt solutions (' Phil. Mag.' Sept. 1884) he finds that when a salt

containing water of crystalHsation is dissolved this water is indistinguish-

able by its volume from the rest of the water of the solution. In the

--Report ' presented to the British Association last year the following

passage occurs : ' These results point to the presence in solution of

what may be termed the anhydrous salt, in contradistinction to the view

that a  hydrate, definite or  indefinite,  results     from  solution                                       or  in  other
                                                                                                         ;

words, no part of the water in solution is in a position, relatively to the

salt, different from the remainder.' These two statements are not strictly

consequent upon each other.

     I feel inclined to take the view that, save perhaps in excessively dilute

solutions, the dissolved substance is attached in some mysterious way (it

by the bydrated salts which give coloured solutions, by the control of

the vapour pressure by the dissolved salt, and by the altered specific

heat.

    With regard to water of crystallisation, E. Wiedemann (' Wiedem.
Ann.' xvii. 1882, p. 561) has shown that hydrated salts in general expand

and the observations of Thorpe and Watts (' Chem. Soc. Journ.' 1880,
p. 102) on the specific volume of water of crystallisation in the sulphates
of the so-called magnesium group show that, whilst the constitutional
water, or water of halhydration, as it was called by Graham, occupies less
space than the remaining molecules, each successive additional molecule
occupies a gradually increasing volume.

to depend more on the nature of the basic radicle than on the acid radicle

    The fusibility of a substance has much to do with its solubility. This
has been pointed out by Carnelley (' Phil. Mag.' March 1882) in reference

to carbon compounds, and by myself and Mr. Shenstone (' Phil. Trans.,'
1884, and ' Jour. Chem. Soc' July 1884) in reference to salts.

      Neither fusibility alone nor chemical constitution alone seems to be

sufficient to determine whether a solid shall be soluble or not ; but it may
be taken as a rule to which there are no exceptions that when there is

close connection in chemical constitution between a liquid and solid, and
the solid is at the same time easily fusible, it will also be easily soluble in

that liquid.'

     I take it that a salt containing water of crystallisation may be con-

sidered as closely resembling water itself. For example

                                      MgS04 7H20

may be considered as a congeries of eight molecules of water, H2O7H2O,

Wein which one molecule of water is replaced by the elements of the salt.

Lalhydration, as long ago pointed out by Graham.

            MgS04H206H20 [giving MgS04K2S046H20, &c.

So that MgS04 7H20 being like solid water in constitution, and also

easily fusible by heat (it melts at 70°), it is easily soluble in water, and
the solubility increases rapidly with rise of temperature.

     The effect of fusibility on increase of solubility with rise of tempera-
ture is well shown by comparison of two such salts as

                       Potassium chlorate . . . m.p. 359°

between baryta and strontia on the one hand, and lime and magnesia on

     Take the converse of easy fusibility associated with no connection of

Dr. Carnelleyhas taken up the question of the relation between atomic

constitution and solubility from a diflFerent point of view, and he has shown

by reference to many examples, drawn chiefly, though not exclusively,

from the aromatic division of carbon compounds, that of two isomeric

compounds the one which has the less symmetrical constitution has

the lower melting-point and the greater solubility ('Phil. Mag.'

February and March 1882).

Kremers in 1854 and 1855 attempted a discussion of the relations

between the constitution of salts and their solubilitj (' Pogg. Ann.' xcii.

497, and xciv. 87 and 255). He seems to have arrived at no very definite

conclusions. One thing which he attempted to do was to trace the con-

nection between atomic (molecular) volume and solubility, and he would

probably have been more successful if he had had the advantage of a

uniform and consistent system of atomic weights. As it was, he arrived

at the conclusion (' Pogg.' xciv. p. 90) that ' greater atomic volume is

associated sometimes with greater solubility, sometimes with less.' This

part of the subject has been taken up more successfully by Dr. Nicol

Mag(' Phil.  '                           June  1884,  January 1886),  and             he  has  shown  that  the

molecular volume of certain salts is larger in strong solutions than in

weak ones, and that in the cases examined the solubility is greater

the more nearly the molecular volume in a saturated solution ap-

proaches the molecular volume of the salt in the solid state. But it has

not, so far as I know, been shown that the molecular volume in the solid

state determines the degree of solubility of the salt. Thus the molecular

volume of KCl solid is 37-4, and the molecular volume of NaCl solid is

27 1. But sodium chloride is more soluble at temperatures below about

25° than potassium chloride, and silver chloride, which is insoluble, has

a molecular volume, 2.5'8, scarcely less than that of sodium chloride.

KNO3Similarly, the molecular volume of        (solid) is 48-7, and that of

NaNOj, 37'9, but the latter is more soluble than the former.

Molecular volume is dependent

(1) On the atomic weights of the elements present.

(2) On the constitution of the substance, that is, on the manner in

which the constituent atoms are united together.

(3) On the density of the substance.

It has been already shown that in many cases increase of molecular

weight corresponds to diminished solubility.

In the equation

                  =Mol. vol.   Mol. weight

                               Density

the value of molecular volume is greater in proportion as molecular
weight is greater, but also in proportion as density is less It is the
latter which seems to coiTespond to increased solubility.

      (4) Molecular volume is also probably connected with fusibility
and perhaps with hardness as distinguished from density.' But
neither molecular volume nor fusibility is sufficient to determine the

degree of solubility of a solid. There must be another element in the

--question which may be, and probably is, attraction or affinity what-
--ever that may mean between the substance and the solvent.

     This is shown by such a case as the nitrates of potassium, sodium,
and silver :

                                      Surface Action of Solids.

      The absorption and condensation of gases upon solid surfaces, and more
 especially in porous substances, is well known. The action of the same
 substances upon liquids has not been studied to the same extent, but some
 facts are known which bear upon the question under discussion.

       Graham, in 1830, published ('Pogg.' xix. 139) some experiments by
 which he showed that animal charcoal, purified by acids, and containing
 only a small quantity of silica, was capable of removing, from solution
 in water, not only colouring matters, a fact long previously known, but

 various metallic salts. Common salt was not precipitated, but solutions

 of nitrate of lead, acetate of lead, tartar emetic, ammonia-sulphate of
 copper, were completely deprived of their metal. In some cases the salt

 was taken up again when heat was applied. In some other cases, as
 solution of silver nitrate in ammonia and lead oxide in caustic potash, the
 metal was more or less reduced, being first precipitated as oxide. The
 quantity of lead oxide precipitated was so great as to be recognisable by

 its white colour in the charcoal.

      In 1845 Wari'ington (' Phil. Mag.,' xxvii. 269) drew attention to the
power possessed by charcoal of removing bitter substances and alkaloids
from aqueous solutions.

     Many other solid substances, when in a state of fine subdivision, exert

a similar action. Precipitated sulphide of lead, oxide of iron, alumina,
clay, &c., possess this power as well as platinum in the state of sponge or
deposited upon asbestos (Stenhouse).

     Cotton immersed in solution of alum was observed many years ago by
Chevreul to be capable of withdrawing a liquid containing less alum than
the original solution, and it has long been known to possess the power of

abstracting oxide of lead, tannin, and various soluble colouring matters

from their respective solutions (see Crum on the manner in which

cotton combines with colouring matter, 'Phil. Mag.' April 1844; and
' J. Chem. Soc' 1862).

      Other porous insoluble substances are said to possess similar powers.
Thus sand is said to be capable of removing acetic acid from the first
portions of vinegar filtered through it (Gmelin, i. 114), and similarly to
remove salt from sea-water (' Ure's Diet.' 1878, Art. Water, Sea). I
confess to have tried this experiment without success. Solutions of

common salt, and of alum of diflFerent strengths, were filtered through
about twelve feet of dry white sand. The first portions of liquid running

through were collected separately, but the quantity of salt present was
not appreciably less than in the original solution.

     However, it is probable that by varying the form of the experiment
the result might have been somewhat different. J. Thoulet (' Compt.
Rend.' xcix. 1072, c. 1002) finds that the attraction between the surface
of a solid and a dissolved salt can be observed when marble, kaolin, or
quartz is immersed in solutions of sodium or barium chloride, and that

the action is proportional to the surface of the dissolved solid.

     The action of filter paper upon saline solutions has been examined by

Mr. Bayley ('Jour. Chem. Soc' 1878). When a drop of a solution of a

metallic salt is placed upon filter paper, the water spreads away into the

Apaper, leaving a more concentrated solution in the centre of the spot.

great difference is, however, observed in the behaviour of the salts of
various metals. Silver, lead, and mercuric salts give a wide water ring,
           ON THE PHENOMENA AND THEORIES OF SOLUTION.      465

as also do solutions of copper, nickel, and cobalt when dilute. But cad-
mium salts differ from all the rest in spreading to the edge of the blot.

     The water ring was widest when dilute solutions were used.
     Mr. Bayley's results have been confirmed and extended by J. U,
Lloyd (' Chem. News,' li. 51-54).

      Other porous substances, such as unglazed earthenware, behave in a
similar manner, and are even capable of depriving salts of water of
crystallisation, as observed by Potilitzin in the case of cobalt chloride

(' Ber.' xvii. 276).

     All these facts are undoubtedly connected, not only with the ascent
of liquids in tubes, but with the property which very finely divided,
though insoluble, powders generally possess of showing a rise of tempera-

ture ' when wetted, and of remaining suspended in a liquid in a state which

is sometimes referred to as pseudo-solution, until small quantities of
certain soluble matters are added ; that is to say, in every case there is
adhesion or surface attraction manifested between the solid and the hquid,
which is greater in proportion as the particles of the solid are smaller
and expose a greater surface ; and this adhesion is competent to separate
substances which are so closely and intimately united that everyone would
agree to say they were chemically combined.

                     SuPERSATaRATION.

The fascinating character of the phenomena has attracted a host of

experimenters, but no definite conclusion as to an explanation has been

generally accepted.

    Mr. Tomlinson, who a few years ago published many papers on the

subject, has given (' Proc. R. S.' xvi. 403) a history of the chief researches

up to his time. He has also arranged in five groups the salts he has

investigated according as they do or do not yield supersaturated solu-

tions, and according to the behaviour of those supersaturated solutions.

The following definition of supersaturation is given by Mr. Tomlinson

When(loc. cit.) : '  water at a high temperature is saturated with a salt,

and on being left to cool in a closed vessel retains in solution a larger

quantity of the salt than it could take up at the reduced temperature, the

solution is said to be supersaturated.'

Such solations crystallise when brought into contact with a crystal of

the same salt, or of a compound truly isomorphous with it (J. M.

Thomson, ' Jour. Chem. Soc' 1879).

    Crystallisation, often in a modified form, is also in many cases brought
about when the solution is cooled to a low temperature or evaporated,
or when certain absorbent substances, such as paper or plaster, are

introduced into the liquid under certain conditions (Jeannel, ' Compt.

Rend.' Ixii. ; Grenfell, ' Proc. Bristol Nat. Soc' vol. ii. Part II. 130).

    It has been supposed by many chemists following the views expressed

in the earlier of the well-known researches of Lowel (' Ann. Chim.' [3]
xxix., xxxiii., xxxvii., xliii., xliv.) that supersaturation is due to the

     ' Or, in the case of water, a fall in temperature, if below the temperature of

maximum density. See V. d. Mensbrugghe, Phil. Mag., [5] 2, p. 450, referring bo

Jungk's experiments. Since the above was written some interesting experiments

have been published by F. Meissner {Wiedemanti' s Annalen, 1886, p. 114), upon

the effect of moistening finely divided silica and other powders with water, benzene,

and amylic alcohol. In every case above 0° a very notable rise of temperature was

observed.

formation of peculiar hydrates containiDg less water, and more soluble

than the normal salt. On the other hand, Lowel, in his last memoir

(' Ann. Chim.' [3] xlix.), recants his earlier belief, and definitely expresses
himself in favour of the opinion that a supersaturated solution (referring

specially to sulphate of sodium) contains the anhydrous salt, and that no

solution can be properly called supersaturated.

' Dans toutes les dissolutions, quelque riches qu'elles soient, qui ne

HOsont pas en contact avec un exces de cristaux a 10                                              ou a 7H0, les

lOHO, et si leur temperature ne tombe pas a un degre suffisamment bas

pour determiner la formation spontanee de cristaux a 7H0 ' ('Ann.

Chim.' [3] xlix. p. 56).
    Tomlinson, de Coppet, and other writers have since adopted the same

views.

     De Coppet showed (' Compt. Rend.' Ixxiii. 1324) that a supersaturated
solution of sodium sulphate may be formed by dissolving in cold water the

anhydrous salt, provided the latter had been heated above 33°, and preserved

from contact with the dust of the air. He also succeeded in preparing

supersaturated solutions of sodium carbonate, and magnesium sulphate

by dissolving the dehydrated or partly dehydrated salt in cold water.
     Nicol (' Phil. Mag.' June and Sept. 1885) has made similar observa-

tions, and has also shown from density determination of sodium sulphate

and thiosulphate of various strengths that in passing the ordinary satu-

ration point there is nothing to indicate any change in the constitution

of the solution. He therefore concludes that a so-called supersaturated

solution is merely a solution saturated or non-saturated of the anhy-

drous salt, and that in this respect it differs in no way from an ordinary

solution which is not capable of supersaturation. Nicol also considers,

as Lowel seems to have done, that any solution of a hydrated salt con-

tains no hydrate, but that combination between the salt and the water

takes place at the moment of crystallisation.

      I thought at one time that supersaturation resulted from dissociation

of the dissolved salt into water and the anhydrous salt, owing to the

-- --action of the higher temperature above 33° to which, by the ordinary

process of making supersaturated solutions, the liquid is exposed. Bat

before the experiments of De Coppet and Nicol had come to my know-

ledge I had satisfied myself that this was not so ; for on saturating a
solution at the temperature of the air with crystals of sodium sulphate,
and then filtering the solution into a stoppered bottle and cooling to about
0°, the cold solution exhibits all the phenomena of supersaturation so long

as it is kept at that lower temperature. This is difficult to explain on any

hypothesis of dissociation.

     Supersaturated solutions are at present only known to be formed by

hydrated salts, or by anhydrous salts only at such low temperatures that

hydrates are formed, e.g., common salt. I am inclined to the belief
that this is due to their much greater fusibility. If we compare the melt-

ing-points of those salts which are known to give supersaturated solutions

readily with the melting-points of those which, although easily soluble, do

not give supersaturated solutions under any conditions that have yet been

tried, we see this difference plainly.

     Since contraction occurs when most solids are dissolved in water, it
follows that if the dissolved substance could be withdrawn again without

changing the temperature of the liquid expansion would occur. Now super-

fused substances (and supersaturated solutions) contract as they solidify,

with the single exception (so far as I know) of water, which expands when

frozen. If it were not for the declaration of Professor Osborne Reynolds
that ' dilatancy ' is not a property that can be exhibited by ordinary matter,
but only by such hypothetical stuflF as consists of hard, inelastic particles
 devoid of cohesion and friction, one would be tempted to try and explain
 superfusion and supersaturation by appeal to a hypothesis of that kind.
 Certain it is that in a superfused liquid there exists a condition of strain
which is overcome by cohesion only when the latter has been considerably

increased by lowering the temperature. And relief from this strain may

often be obtained in more than one way, as in the crystallisation of
 dimorphous substances like sulphur, and in the deposition of modified
salts (such as Na2S04 7H20, &c.) from solutions.

      The fact that in some cases it is possible to reduce the temperature
of small drojas of a superfused liquid, such as sulphur, much below that at
 which larger masses can be preserved in the liquid state, seems to show

 that the surface tension in sjDheroidal masses operates against the ten-

 dency to change of state. Whether it is suflBcient appreciably to retard

the change is more than I can say, but Van der Mensbrugghe ^ has shown

 by mathematical analysis that the potential energy of a free liquid surface
increases with the surface, and in this way he explains the very facts to
 which I have just referred.

                                                       Conclusion.

      Such facts as these lead us to the consideration of what is me&nt

by chemical combination. Take, for example, a common metallic salt,

such as copper sulphate, CUSO4. Here the law of definite proportions
being rigidly observed, and the compound being very difierent in
external characters from its ingredients, chemists have no difiiculty in
agreeing that this is a case of true chemical combination. But when the
 salt combines with water of crystallisation great difference of opinion
 arises as to whether the elements thus superadded are chemically com-
bined with those of the salt, or whether a new kind of chemical afBnity
 is called into play. The difierence is one of degree, not of kind. Blue
 vitriol is composed of copper sulphate and water united in definite and
 quite simple proportions, and the chief reason for supposing the water to
 be combined in a manner difierent fi'om the other ingredients of the salt
 is that it can be detached by heat or otherwise more easily, and that it
 occupies a relatively larger volume. But, as already stated, the water*
 combined with such a salt is attached in difierent degrees of intimacy,
 the first molecule occupying a smaller volume than the second, and so
 on, the act of union of the salt with these successive molecules being
attended by the loss of successively smaller amounts of energy.

      Taking a step further, suppose this salt dissolved in water, the

resulting liquid is produced with many of the attendant phenomena

--which usually accompany recognised chemical combinations changes of

     ' ' On the Application of Thermodynamics to the Study of the Variations of
Potential Energy of Liquid Surfaces,' Pldl. Mag., 1876 [5], ii. p. 450 ; and Fliil. Mag.

volume, of specific heat, and thermal changes, positive or negative. The
same may be said of the act of diluting this solution. More water (or
more salt) being added, similar physical phenomena are exhibited ; and it
is important to notice, as already stated more than once, these changes
are all continuous one with another, the specific volume of the added
water constantly tending towards that of water itself. The conclusion
«eems inevitable that chemical combination is not to be distinguished by
any absolute criterion from mere physical or mechanical aggregation, and
it seems not improbable that it may ultimately turn out tha^t chemical
combination differs from mechanical combination, called cohesion or adhe-
sion, only in the fact that the atoms or molecules of the bodies concerned
come relatively closer together, and the consequent loss of energy is

greater.

     The researches of Miiller-Brzbach, published in a long series of papers
{especially ' Ber.' 1880, p. 1658, and 1881, p. 217), strongly support such a
view. He has shown by numerous examples that in similarly constituted
solid bodies those are the most stable in the formation of which the
greatest contraction occurs. Thus when lead replaces silver, or potassium
replaces sodium in the nitrate, or when chlorine replaces bromine or

iodine in combination with another element, contraction occurs. And in
general, contraction is observed when an element of reputed strong

affinity (as indicated by the results of thermo-chemical experiment) takes

the place of one of reputed smaller affinity. This is only an extension of
what has already been observed in the combination of water with salts,
and which in all probability applies generally in the comparison of atomic
combination as distinguished from so-called molecular combination.

    We are in the habit of using the word ' attraction ' in a somewhat

indefinite and unsatisfactory manner in referring to the hypothetical
cause of the union of atoms or molecules. "We do not know what this
"thing is which is called chemical affinity or attraction. There can be

little doubt, however, that it is connected intimately with atomic or
molecular motion. It does not require a great stretch of imagination to
·conceive that combination occurs most readily and intimately between

those atoms or molecules whose motions are nearly alike. And confining
our attention to the phenomena now under discussion, it seems not
improbable that this may be the explanation of the selective action of

solvents, and the disposition so often shown for like to dissolve in like.

It may also, perhaps, go some way towards explaining the great amount
of heat evolved and the great contraction which ensues when many

anhydrous salts are brought into contact with water, as compared with
the effects of dissolving the same salts when in the hydrated state.

      On the Ex'ploration of the Raygill Fissure in Lothersclale,
                  Yorkshire. By James W. Davis, F.G.S.

     [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extemo
                                            among the Keports.]

The Raygill Fissure, in the mountain limestone in Lothersdale, about

five miles south-east of Skipton, was investigated to some extent by
a Committee of the Association, and a report was presented by
--470
EEPOET 1886.

the Committee and printed in the Annual Report for 1883. The

fissure descended in a slightly diagonal direction in the form of a
pothole from the surface to a depth of about 120 feet, and of this depth
the lower 90 feet has been dug out and thoroughly examined, resulting in
the discovery of numerous bones of animals, particulars of which are re-
corded in the report referred to above. The specimens are deposited in

the Museum of the Philosophical and Literary Society at Leeds. Towai'ds

the close of 1883 it was found that the fissure assumed a more or less
horizontal direction, and the work of excavation was rendered very diffi-
cult and laborious by the position of a large mass of limestone in front of

the fissure, constituting at that time the face of the quarry. This obstruc-

tion the proprietor of the quarry very kindly engaged to remove, and
operations were suspended to enable this to be done.

      Since 1883 the face of the limestone has been quarried and the ob-

structing mass of limestone removed, and during the present summer

operations have been renewed on the fissure. Its course has been traced to
a distance of 114 feet, with a gradual declination in a south-easterly direc-

tion. The present entrance to the fissure is 4 feet wide : it diminishes to

2 feet 6 inches, but at a distance of 60 feet expands and forms a lofty cave,
thence forwards the diameter again diminishes. The termination of the

fissure so far as it has been explored appears to receive a tributary extend-
ing almost vertically in a north-westerly direction. The general direction
of the fissure tends towards the hillside, forming the channel of a water-
course at present running at no great distance ; and it is probable that it
formerly opened into it, although no direct evidence at present exists of

the exit. Borings have shown the bottom of the fissure to be filled in
with clay varying from 6 inches to several feet in thickness, with slight
alternating layers of sand and gravel, and occasionally fragments of grit

and limestone at the bottom. A few remains of mammals have been

found near the entrance to the horizontal portion of the fissure similar to
those already recorded.

     At the meeting at Montreal in 1884 a grant of 15L was made for the
further exploration of the cave. This sum has been expended in the

Aoperations described above. very much larger grant would be required

to investigate the remaining length of the fissure, because the work will
be increasingly laborious, and the consequent expense proportionately
heavy; and as there is no probability indicated in the work so far that the

already large series of animal remains will be greatly, if at all, increased,
it is not thought advisable to ask for a renewal of the Committee or
grant.

      In conclusion, it is desirable to render thanks to Mr. Spencer, and
latterly to his son, the proprietors of the Ray gill Quarries, for their permis-
sion to carry on the work, and for the uniformly kind and courteous
manner in which they have always placed themselves at the disposal of
the Committee ; and to Mr. J. Todd, the manager of the works, for the

trustworthy and careful manner, combined with much skill, in which he
has superintended the operations of the workmen employed.

 An Accurate and Rapid Method of estimating the Silica in an

                     Igneous Rock. By J. H. Plater.

  [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso

Prepare a flux by intimately mixing together two parts of bicarbonate
of soda, two parts of bicarbonate of potash, and one part of nitrate of

potash, all finely ground.

     The mixture must be heated until dry and perfectly pulverulent.
     In a platinum crucible, six centimetres high, mix thoroughly half a
gramme of the very finely powdered rock with one gramme of the flux,
place a cover on the crucible, and heat the contents to fusion.
     "With a Fletcher's gas crucible furnace, the chimney being used, com-

plete fusion can be effected in five minutes, with a small blowpipe gas

furnace in three minutes. Working with rocks containing not less than
45 per cent, of silica I have never found a crucible attacked. I have not

used the process with less siliceous rocks.
     After fusion remove the cover from the crucible and replace it by a small

glass funnel cut off at the apex of the cone ; then, without waiting for the
fused mass to cool, pour in it through the funnel 3 cc. of strong nitric acid.
Energetic action ensues, but there is no projection of the solid or fluid
contents of the crucible. Place it at once on a water bath and keep it for

ten minutes at a temperature of 100° C; at the end of that time if all hard,
and dark particles have not disappeared add 2 cc. of nitric acid, stir with
a platinum rod, and continue to heat. As soon as the disintegration of
the glass is completed wash with as little water as possible the crucible
cover, funnel, and rod, then evaporate the jelly and the washings to-
gether. After having driven off the greater part of the water, when
there is no longer any fear of projection, remove the crucible to a sand
bath and heat just below 250° C. until all nitrous fumes shall have dis-

appeared.

    The operation has up to this point been carried on in one vessel; now

turn the mass into a small glass beaker, washing the crucible, first with
5 cc. of water, then with 3 cc. of hydrochloric acid ; heat the beaker to

100° C, that the bases may be quickly dissolved by the acid, until the
silica left be white and free from red specks ; add now more water and

pour the contents of the beaker on to a 590 Schleicher and Schulls filter,
placed over a filter-pump drain as dry as possible, and calcine at once in

                                                                                                                                        ;

a small crucible. "Weigh the crucible and its calcined contents, con-
sisting of silica mixed, if these bodies be present in the rock, with

minute quantities of iron oxide and alumina, and a much larger quantity

of titanic acid. After weighing moisten very slightly with four or five

drops of strong sulphuric acid, stir the moistened silica with one gramme
of perfectly pure ammonium fluoride, put a cover on the crucible, and heat

it, first of all gently, then more strongly, finally to a full red heat. If the
few milligrammes left in the crucible are not perfectly soft repeat the

process ; but this it should not be necessary to do.

     The weight of the crucible and the calcined residuum having been
ascertained, it must be deducted from the previously recorded weight ; the
difference will give the weight of the silica present in half a gramme of

the rock.

ON THE DESIGN OF GIKDEB BRIDGES.  473

been more or less discarded in modern practice, and is replaced by lighter
structures, designed with a more scientific disposition of the material,
and constructed chiefly of angle and bar iron.

   --Both in Germany and in America the modern practice appears to be to

adopt large panels and great depth a system of construction which has
been greatly facilitated by the use of steel, owing to the greater length of
the bars and plates procurable in that metal, and the consequent diminu-
tion in the number of joints.

     In America, also, pin-jointed bridges are the rule, and riveted joints

-- --the exception exactly the reverse, in fact, of the English practice and

the deep pin and link truss, with a straight top boom and long panels,
there almost the universal method of construction for spans over 75 feet,
·differs in a striking manner from both English and German bridges. Its

construction has been brought to considerable perfection, and appears to
be eminently suitable for a country where distances are great, labour
scarce and expensive, and rapid construction of the utmost importance.

By this system the Americans are able to turn out a bridge with the

greatest accuracy and expedition, and can erect it without previous erec-
tion in the shops, and with little staging, in an incredibly short space of

time.

     In England, on the other hand, a strong bias among engineers in

favour of riveted joints has led to the absence of special appliances for
the manufacture of pin and link bridges; and the practical advantages of
the system are less esteemed, as English engineers do not push forward

their railways so rapidly as the Americans.

     As most English railway engineers must now look chiefly to the
development of new countries for future work these general facts should
be sufficient ground for an examination of their practice ; but if more
definite reasons are sought, reference may be made to the case of Canada,
where English engineers, who built the first bridges, have since been

superseded by Americans.
     The design of a bridge of exceptional span is almost invariably the

subject of special study, to an extent which is inadmissible in the case of

bridges of ordinary size. These are usually constructed in accordance
with a limited number of standard types, which experience has shown to
be suitable ; and ic is to these only that such general considerations as
have been suggested properly apply.

     The economic importance of smaller bridges is also greater, and it

is to bridges of spans less than 200 feet, which, with reference to the

American system, may be termed ' merchantable ' sizes, that the scope of

this paper is therefore limited.

     In order to ascertain the extent to which the weight of such bridges
is affected by their design, seven designs were chosen for bridges of
140 feet span for a double line of railway. The designs were selected to
represent leading English and American types ; their strength was deter-
mined by a rolling load of If ton per lineal foot for each track : and their
weights were estimated, including flooring, rail bearers and cross girders,
and the necessary stiffening or bracing for wind pressure and lateral
oscillations. Particulars of the design and weight of each bridge are
given in the following table :
474   EEPOET 1886.

ON THE DESIGN OF GIRDER BRIDGES.  475

limited, more often than elsewhere prohibitory of the adoption of the
most economical form for the main girders ; and although the question of
design requires careful study, there is no evidence of the existence of
inherent national errors or prejudices in design which would be likely to

place English engineers at a disadvantage in dealing with colonial work,
or to account for the fact that they have lost it in Canada, and recently

in one case in Australia.
     It has been suggested that the position of the designer in America is

more favourable to economy of construction.
     In America when a bridge is required the railroad company invite

tenders for its construction and erection in accordance with their speci-
fication, which generally states the class of bridge preferred, the load
which it is to carry, and the quality of the material, and defines in con-

siderable detail the stress to which its parts may be subjected. The

design is left to the bridge company tendering for its construction, but it

is required that sufficient information shall be supplied with each tender
to enable the railroad engineer to examine the proposal and determine
whether it fulfils the required conditions.

     The designer, who is consequently employed by the bridge company,

has in the first place to produce the most economical structure, while the

primary responsibility for its safety lies with the railroad engineer who

has prepared the specification, and will be enabled to check the corre-
spondence of the design with his requirements before the tender is ac-

--cepted, and to make the necessary modifications a work of considerable

difficulty unless the design is a good one to begin with.
     The English designer, on the other hand, has in the first place

to design a safe structure, since he is seldom immediately subject to
competition in respect to its economy, and is entirely responsible for its

security.

     The English system has advantages with respect to security ; while
its economic disadvantages are that the engineer is seldom able to
ascertain either the exact cost of his designs, or the relative economy of
their details, nor has he any personal interest to serve, or any other in-
ducement to reduce the cost to the lowest point. The system moreover
entails a want of correspondence between the design and the appliances
of the manufactory, where it is afterwards executed, especially if the work
is let by open tender. These disadvantages are accidental rather than
essential in their nature, and this should suggest their remedy in detail
rather than the condemnation of the system under which they arise.

     Much could be effected by manufacturers to promote economy in

design by the pubUcation of particulars of the relative cost of different

details of construction, in such a way as not to injxu'e their commercial

interests.

      It is also an open question whether standard sections could not be
adopted for the usual sizes of angle, tee, and other rolled bars, so that no

-- --difficulty need arise in this respect at least in making the design in

accordance with the scantling of the materials readily available for its

manufacture.

      Both the design of bridges generally, and the personal position which

the designer should occupy, are matters which may be left entirely to the

discretion of those concerned ; but engineers are in England very properly
subject to a certain degree of Government supervision in regard to struc-
tures which directly affect the safety of the travelling public.
----

--476
EEPORT 1886.

      The Board of Trade have exercised since 1840 a statutory power of
 inspecting arid testing bridges on railways for passenger traffic, and
 have issued rules for the guidance of engineers in designing these struc-
 tures, which have been generally accepted as applicable to all bridges,
 and exercise a strong influence over English engineers in their use of
iron and steel in all permanent engineering structures either at home or

 abroad.

      It is pi'ovided by these rules that the greatest strain produced by the
 combined moving and dead load on any part of a structure shall not
exceed, for wrought iron five tons, and for steel six and a half tons, per

 square inch.

     No defined quality or strength is required in order that either material
may be subjected to these stresses, but in the case of steel the engineer

must certify that it is possessed of considerable toughness and ductility,
and state the tests to which it has been subjected.

      It is also provided that the heaviest engines, boiler trucks, and travel-
ling cranes in use on railways shall be a measure of the load to which

bridges may be subjected.

      For convenience the strength of bridges is usually measured by an
assumed uniform load per foot run, intended to cover the weights of the

--heaviest engines and trucks. [The manner in which this equivalent

for the same actual load varies with the span of the bridge, was shown

by a diagram.']

     This diagram showed how important the rolling load becomes in small

--girder bridges, and in the floors of large bridges matters which have

certainly not been properly considered in numerous existing examples in

England. The determination of the greatest load to which a bridge may

be subjected, also afibrds an excellent example of the insufficiency of any
rules, however perfect, to relieve the engineer of a large amount of

responsibility.

     The origin of the rules may be traced in the Parliamentary Reports
of the Board of Trade, and of the Railway Commissioners who from

1846 to 1851 exercised the powers of the Board of Trade with respect to

railways.

     From these reports it does not appear that previous to 1849 the

inspecting officers had a defined rule for the strength of bridges either
of wrought or cast iron.

     In 1847, however, a Royal Commission was appointed in the following
terms :

     ' To enquire into the conditions to be observed by engineers in the ap-
plication of iron to structures subject to violent concussions and vibra-
tions ' and ' to endeavour to ascertain such principles, and to form such
rules, as may enable the engineer and mechanic to apply the metal with
confidence, and to illustrate by theory and experiment the action which
takes place under varying circumstances in iron railway bridges which
have been constructed.'

     The terms of this Commission clearly indicate that the interest of the
engineer was to be studied as well as the safety of the public.

     The Commissioners were Lord Wrottesley, then President of the
Royal Society ; the Rev. Robert Willis, M.A., an eminent mathematician

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

ON THE DESIGN OF GIRDEE BRIDGES.  477

Capt. Henry James, of the Portsmouth Dockyard ; and three civil engi-
neers, Messrs. George Rennie, William Cubitfc, and Eaton Hodgkinson.

      After examining the leading engineers and ironfounders of the day
as to their experience and practice, and making numerous and elaborate

experiments, the Commissioners reported that ' legislative enactments

which would fetter scientific men in the development of a subject as yet

so novel and rapidly progressive would be highly inexpedient.'
     They, however, made certain recommendations with respect to cast-

--iron bridges, which are substantially the same as the present rule for

 cast-iron structures tbat the breaking weight should be six times the
moving load added to three times the dead load.

      They also made a further recommendation, applicable to all elastic
horizontal bridges, that provision should be made for the increase of strain
in bridges under 40 feet long when subject to a rapidly moving load, as

--indicated by the increased deflection in sucb cases a recommendation

whicb until recent years was lost sight of.

      These recommendations were, immediately upon the publication of
their report, embodied by the Railway Commissioners in a circular letter

 of instructions to their inspecting officers.

     On the day following the date of this letter Capt. Simmons inspected

 the Torksey Bridge, a wrought iron box-girder bridge of two continuous
spans of 130 feet, designed by Mr. (now Sir) John Fowler, and objected

to it as of insufiicient strength.

      Its rejection was discussed by the Institution of Civil Engineers, and
the Railway Commissioners were accused of applying to wrought iron
the recently published recommendation of the Commission on IroUj

requiring a factor of safety of six for cast iron bridges.

     At the same time a lengthy correspondence took place between

--Mr. Fowler and the Commissioners, and Captain Simmons decided after
--the examination of such examples as were available that the bridge

should be strengthened so that the strain should not exceed five tons per
square inch.

     In fixing this he admitted that there was no decided authority upon
the subject, and that the variation in the circumstances of the construction

of bridges prevented the application of an invariable law. He recognised

as a principle the variation of the admissible strain in a bridge according to

--the proportion of live to dead load a point which has been recently revived.
   --In the end after a special examination to test the continuity of the

--spans the bridge was accepted with a strain under the most favourable

estimate of slightly over six tons per square inch.

     Between 1850 and 1858 the rule for cast iron bridges appears to have
found general acceptance, while there is conclusive evidence of the ab-
sence of a defined limit for the strain in wrought iron structures.

     In 1858 a wrought iron tubular girder bridge over the Spey was
brought before Captain (now Sir) Henry Tyler some time before its com-
pletion, and a lengthy correspondence ensued between Captain Tyler and
Mr. Fairbairn with reference to its strength. This correspondence Captain
Tyler laid before the Board of Trade, who, on March 30, 1859, issued a

circular letter of instructions fixing five tons per square inch as the

proper limit of strain for wrought iron. Upon this Captain Tyler based

his rejection of the bridge on April 30.

     It is very important to note that this rule was explained at the time
by Captain Tyler to represent a factor of safety of four for combined
 478 REPORT-- 1886.

 moving and dead load. It has not since been altered, and in practice it is
 assumed to be applicable to all wrought iron, whether the quality be good

 or not.

     Among the numerous considerations suggested by the survey (after

 the lapse of over 25 years) of the period of which a brief sketch has
 been given, the most striking is the confirmation which experience has
 given to the conclusions of the Commission of 1847. Derived from the
 interpretation by skilled mathematicians of the results of experiments
 conducted by practical engineers, combined with the evidence of the ablest
 engineers of the time, their conclusions were based upon a solid foundation
 of fact and experience.

       Their recommendations, although jealously resented by civil engineers
 at first, notwithstanding the avoidance of legislative interference, by
 which freedom was secured for the development of engineering science,
 led, under the judicious interpretation of the inspecting officers, to the
 present rule for cast iron structures. This rule is good in principle because

-- --it derives the load and consequently the stress to which the structure

 may be subjected, from the actual strength of the material.

      The present rule for wrought iron has no such foundation, and it is
 indeed only due to the high professional attainments of the inspecting
officers, and the sound judgment and great moderation with which they
dealt with the difficulties which natui-ally arose when wrought iron first
became generally used, that the present rule, introduced without special
 experimental research, has endured so long that it has obtained the

-- --sanction of what to younger engineers at least is an immemorial usage,

taken for granted and stereotyped beyond reach of improvement.

       Its principal fault is in allowing a fixed limit of stress without regard
 to the quality of the material. This does not lead to serious results so
long as the limit of five tons per square inch is understood to represent a
factor of safety of four applied to iron having a breaking strength of not less
than twenty tons, as explained by Captaiu Tyler in 1859 ; but it must not

be forgotten that the rule itself is used by many who do not know its

origin, and the absence of any stipulation as to the strength of the mate-
rial leads naturally to the assumption that five tons represents the safe

working stress for any quality of iron in the market ; and many inex-

perienced engineers do so interpret and use it.

     It is hardly necessary to state that there are many qualities of iron for

which such an assumption would be attended with considerable danger,
but it is not so apparent that a bridge made of utterly untrustworthy
material might not, under the ordinary tests, afford any indication of its
insecurity. Such is, however, the case, and the safety of the public

depends, in this respect, very much more upon the choice of a suitable
material by the engineer than upon the Board of Trade rule.

   A fixed limit of stress without regard to the quality of the material

also restricts the engineer in the development of economic design in the
direction of a greater use of better material, such as angle and bar iron of

superior strength and ductility. Nor does a fixed stress offer any induce-
ment to the manufacturer to improve the quality of plates.

    These considerations apply with much greater force to the present
rule for steel. As a material, steel is much more variable in its strength
than iron, which renders the application of an invariable coefficient more

objectionable.

     It is true that the Board of Trade, in accordance with a recommenda-
ON THE DESIGN OF GIBDEE BRIDGES.  479

tion of the Committee of 1877 appointed at the instance of the British

Association, allow in special cases the use of steel with a higher stress,

but exceptions of this nature are naturally ill-adapted to the design of
 bridges of ordinary spans.

      The rules cannot be regarded as suited to the nature of the material,
and there can be httle doubt that they have operated to hinder the appli-
cation of steel to uses for which it is admirably suited, and have thus
exercised a prejudicial effect upon one of the leading industries of the

present day.

      Unless the rules which determine limiting stresses or coefficients for
iron and steel can be brought into conformity with modern knowledge of
the properties of materials, and of the laws by which their application to
construction should be regulated, their entire abolition would be prefer-
able, because it would conduce to the advancement of engineering science,
and the development of the bridge-building industries. The safety of the
public need in no respect be compromised by the abolition of the limiting

stresses, if the rules requiring the engineer to certify the quality of the
material used were retained (and extended to apply to iron as well as

steel) in order to provide the inspecting officer with all the information

requisite to enable him to judge whether the stress to which a structure
was subjected was within safe limits.

     Freed from the deadening influence of the fixed coefficients, private
enterprise would establish standard rules for the determination of the
stress to which different materials under varying conditions might safely
be subjected ; to the great advantage of the professions and trades in-
terested in bridge-building, and having in future to compete with the
Americans.

    On the other hand, there are many objections to such a course, which

would practically amount to a reversion, after the experience of thirty
years, to the conditions of 1850. It is also to be feared that during the
time which must necessarily elapse before any rules obtained the sanction

of a common assent, differences of opinion causing much inconvenience

--would probably arise between civil engineers and the inspecting officers

of the Board of Trade which is much to be deprecated.

    A course more worthy of the scientific attainments of English engineers

would be the amendment of the rules ; so that, while leaving to the
engineer the gi'eatest possible freedom in the choice of design and material,
and leaving in his hands the responsibility for the correct determination
of every effect of the loading of a structure which the most modern
methods render calculable, they should determine for his guidance by
coefficients based upon experience, or where practicable upon experimental
research, the proper allowance to be made severally for each of all those
effects which are usually understood to be covered by the present

arbitrary factor of safety.

     Rules so designed could not fail to exercise an elevating effect on the
professional knowledge and skill of engineers, by affording a more distinct
conception of the effects for which the factors of safety provide ; and by
abolishing the use of coefficients, of which neither the origin, scope, nor

intent is known to the user.

    The division of the factor of safety into many separate coefficients,
some of which would vary with the quality of the material and character
of the workmanship, would encourage good workmanship and the use

of materials of a high class, without restricting the use of materials of a
--480 EEPOET 1886.

lower class and less perfect workmanship for purposes to whicli they are
adapted ; and would thus be in the highest degree beneficial to the manu-

facturers' interest.

     These results can hardly be attained otherwise than by rules framed
upon the recommendations of a Royal Commission, who could bring to
their aid the experience of the inspecting officers and of the leading
engineers and manufacturers, and institute special experimental research
to elucidate any doubtful questions. Such a Commission would indeed
be but a revival of that of 1847, to complete the work which the former
Commissioners were compelled to abandon in 1849, because the applica-
tion of wrought iron to engineering structures was yet in its infancy, and
steel in its modern form unknown ; and the scope of their enquiry could
hardly be better defined than in the terms of the former Commission.

     The draft rules appended have been prepared to show that the views
above expressed are capable of taking a practical form, and to render
more easily apparent the advantages claimed for them.

used is, in his opinion, suitable for the purpose to which it is applied ; and
to supply a statement of all the tests to which it has been subjected, in-
cluding in all cases those required for the determination of the working

Montreal meeting of the British Association, in which the principle of the

' sphere and roller ' mechanism was explained, and certain applications of

Ait suggested (see p. 631, Report for 1884).                                          subsequent paper on the

G' sphere and roller ' friction gear was read last year before Section                                                                           at

Aberdeen (see p. 1193, Report for 1885). The latter paper gave the
results of actual trial of the mechanism, and described a machine for

transmitting 2 H.P., but it specially dealt with the modes of obviating

the various difficulties experienced in the course of bringing the mechan-

ism into practical operation.

ment of the mechanism, and the present paper contains (1 ) a brief descrip-

account of the results will prove of interest and value, especially as the

question of friction gearing is one about which few facts are published,

and much uncertainty exists as to proper proportions of surfaces in

contact, dimensions of the various working parts, power transmitted, and

actual loss in its transmission.

                                1. Description of Machines.

    In the first two machines made for the transmission of power, the weight
of the ball was utilised for obtaining pressure on the rolling surfaces.

     In one of these the driving and driven surfaces of the wheels were of
cast iron ; in the other oak was tried, which proved to be useless owing to
its distortion, and secondly raw hide, which was found not sufficiently
rigid for the pressures required. Neither machine was of any use, the
efficiency being too small. Their failure was due both to the smallness
of the pressures and the vibration set up, which latter kept the ball
away from the wheels.

     The next machine ' was designed so that any required pressure could
be brought to bear on the rolling surfaces, and which, while trans-
mitting considerable force, should not occupy much space. The diameter

one I'espect, for there was no provision to prevent the ball from revolving^
whilst its axis of rotation passed through the point of contact made with

tlie driven wheel.

     Fisrs. 1 and 2 show a hoist in which this defect was obviated, and which

was designed so that the pressure on the driving and driven wheels

should vary with the load to be raised. This arrangement ensured a

greater efficiency than could otherwise be obtained.' The framing of the

Ahoist was made to bolt to a pair of vertical posts.  drum (m), which

replaces the differential arrangement originally used, is cai-ried on one end

of a shaft (n), which by means of a wheel (a) placed at the centre of its

length receives the motion from the ball (o). The other end of the shaft

is held in a bearing {p) ; and therefore, since there is no centre support
for it except the ball, the pressure on the ball must be due to the con-

stant weight (due to the shaft-wheel, &c.) plus the load multiplied by

a constant quantity. The hoist is started, stopped, reversed, or has its
speed changed by simply pulling one or other of two ropes which hang in

a convenient position.

This machine has worked most satisfactorily for more than half a year,,

and has given no trouble. It works at present thoroughly well, and

seems likely to last many years. Experimental data as to its efficiency

are given hereafter.

     There is great difficulty in making the framing of these machines light

and compact, and at the same time sufficiently rigid to withstand the

heavy pressures used. One chief source of difficulty is the part of the

frame necessary to carry the pressure-wheel (fig. 1). Figs. 3 and 4

show a machine in which this wheel is dispensed with. Two balls are-

employed in contact with each other at the point (o). The driving-shaft

(a) is of cast iron and is hollow, having two flanges, which at the points

{n n) press against the two balls. The drum (b) has also two coiTespond-

ing flanges, which touch the balls at the points I). The guide- wheels for
                                                                                                                                                                      (J,

each ball are moved simultaneously, so that the axes of the two balls move

symmetrically ; hence for each ball there is always the same ratio between
the speeds of the surfaces at n, I, and o ; and since the speed at n is the
same in each case, the other speeds must also respectively be equal, and

therefore all the surfaces roll freely upon each other.
    This machine is extremely compact, and works well. It is now at

the Liverpool Exhibition, and with two 6" balls transmits over 2 horse-

power.

                         2. Special Details of Construction.

   Mode of Preventing Injury to Sphere when its Axis of Rotation passes

                                       through a Point of Contact.

     The chief advantage of the sphere and roller mechanism is the power
of varying the velocity ratio of the driving and driven wheels by the
mere motion of a lever. As is fully set forth in the papers above referred
to, this result is obtained by causing the axis of rotation of the sphere to
assume different positions relatively to the driving and driven wheels.
When, however, the latter is required to move at a very slow speed, or
to actually come to rest, the axis of rotation passes so close to the driven
wheel that the sphere spins upon the point of contact, and there is con-

siderable danger of flats being ground upon the surfaces in contact.
This frequently occurred when the machine was running, and it there-

                                                                             FiG. 3.

fore became absolutely necessary to devise some means to stop the machine
when the axis was in the critical position. Fortunately it was found that

                                                                           Fig. 4.

stopping the machine in that position had a great advantage, because it
was impossible for the load to run down, the driven wheel being then
                                        --

unable to drive the sphere, and the only other way for the load to fall
was by the wheel sliding over it. By arranging so that the machine

should always stop at this point, and nowhere else, the danger to the ball
was averted, a brake could be dispensed with, and starting and stopping

easily arranged.

     The manner in which the difficulty was overcome is clearly shown in
fig. 1. The rigid arm (a) connecting the two guide-wheel frames (g)
has a lug cast on ih "When the axis of the ball passes through the
point c, the lug throws back the end (/) of the bell-crank lever (d), and
thus, by means of a connecting rod and two other levers, throws up an
arm (h), with a tooth on its free end. This tooth engages in a thread of
coarse pitch on the sliding part of the clutch (p) . As the clutch revolves

the screw draws out the sliding part, thus stopping the machine. When

the machine is started the arm (a) is moved, the bell-crank lever returns
to its former position, the tooth (h) falls away from the thread, and the
spring (s) forces the clutch into gear, and the ball again revolves, but
with its axis now in a safe position.

     There is the objection to this arrangement that only at one point of

the revolution of the clutch can the arm be moved so as to reverse the
driven shaft, and this causes delay in working.

    In the hoist next made (figs. 3 and 4) a much better device is used,

whereby it is only possible to stop the machine at one point of the revola-
tion of the driving- shaft, and thus there is little fear of stopping when it
is desired to reverse the motion. If, however, the axes of the balls are
left so as to pass through (Z I), not more than one or two revolutions
can take place before they stop, and there is not sufficient time for any
harm to be done.

     Referring to figs. 3 and 4, the handle (h) attached to the vertical shaft

(A;) controls the change of axes of the balls. When at the right position

a nipple on the bell-crank lever (m) moves the lever (r), and lifts the
end (z). Meanwhile the revolution of the driving-shaft brings the arm
(s) against (s), (s) and the nut (d) thus cease to revolve, and the rod (g),

being advanced through the nut, throws the clutch out of gear. On turn-
ing the handle the arm is released, and the spring (s) moves the rod

axially, and brings the clutch into gear. This arrangement answers per-
fectly, allowing a free movement of the axes of the balls, with quick

--reversal of motion and change of speed.
      Bearings. Great attention has necessarily been bestowed on the
bearings, the following conditions being required :

     (a) Diameter as small as possible, to reduce the loss in friction.
     (b) Such arrangements for lubrication as shall be as far as possible

perfect.

      (c) Security from escape of lubricant on to the rolling surfaces.

     The conditions of working are unusually severe, and the bearings,
which have been found to work satisfactorily, are therefore described in
detail, and illustrated in figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

     Fig. 5 shows a bearing suitable for taking an oblique thrust. The
part (/) is a portion of the framing of the machine. The bush (a) is of
phosphor bronze, both the ends of the shaft (b) and set screw (c) have
steel points, made as hard as possible, with a small hole drilled in the
centre of each. Stauffer lubricant is introduced through the tube (h)

into the inside space.
    ON SPHERE AND ROLLER MECHANISM FOR TRANSMITTING POWER. 489

     The bearing is first adjusted by means of the screw (d), which has
a large flat head, forcing the bush (a) in, and taking up all the slack on
the conical part of the bearing. The set screw (c) is next turned until it
takes all the end thrust on the shaft (6). The bush is now locked by
means of the set screw (p). This makes a very efficient though expensive

bearing.

rings fit into recesses turned in the wheel {h Ji) ; the bottoms of the

recesses are packed with leather rings (//). It is obvious that on
screwing up the collar (c), the rims on both sides of the wheel are forced

into the leather, thus making a running joint, the oil having to escape

past the leather before it can get out.

     This device answers fairly well, for the wheel (g) being hollow and
filled with oil, perfect lubrication is ensured, although in this case also
a slight amount of oil escapes.

     Some experiments just made show that even the best of leathers are
very porous and spongy, absorbing oil very readily, and when employed
as a packing for bearings this material seems to act as a pumping appa-

ratus, continually sending oil in the wrong direction. Leather is not

therefore a safe material for packing a running joint against oil ; and in
spite of numerous tests, so far, no really suitable material has been

found.

of strips of leather and cotton wick, are sufficient to prevent the escape

of the lubricant at the running joint. These bearings run for months

without requiring attention.

The production of balls at a low cost, and yet suitable for standing

the heavy pressures without excessive wear, has been one of the chief

difficulties encountered.

In first small models the balls were made of boxwood, lignum-vit83,

ivory, oak, gutta-percha, india-rnbber, and brass, of which the last was

most satisfactory. In the large machines, lead, mixtures of lead, zinc,

and tin, cast iron, phosphor bronze, and hollow unhardened cast steel have

been tried. Of these, hollow cast-iron balls have proved the best. With

solid cast iron it seems almost impossible to get spheres quite free from

flaws ; as many as sixteen balls, cast by four different founders, only left,

on turning up, two which were fairly good. But this material stands the

wear and tear much better than was expected. In one case a hollow

cast-iron ball 8" diameter has been in frequent use in a ^-ton hoist

It might be mentioned here that, though with absolutely rigid material

the surface of contact between the balls and the wheels would be reduced

to a point, yet according to the pressure and material a considerable facet

is formed. The amount by which the centre of the surface of contact is

depressed is, however, extremely small. Thus in a 6" ball in contact with

a plane surface this depression is only -0017" for a facet i" diameter.

     Experience shows that the harder the material the less is the loss due
to rolling friction, no greater normal pressure being required. Some ex-
periments recently made show that two chilled iron spherical surfaces 6"
diameter rolling on each other give at about 1,500 lbs. normal pressure
a coefficient of friction of over '25. For some time past expei'itnents have
been proceeding with the object of procuring perfectly sound chilled balls.
So far not one has been obtained, though some twenty to thirty have
been cast.

3. Data derived from Experiments with Sphere Hoist and with

                                       Special Apparatus.

The hoist shown in figs. 1 and 2 has been in daily use in the works

of Mr. Edward Shaw at Bristol for more than six months. Two sets of

experiments have recently been made upon it, the results of which are

given below (Tables I. and II.), and have also been plotted (Plate IX.).

In both cases the driving-belt was replaced by a cord on which

weights were hung, so that the force required to raise the load could be

ascertained. The first set of experiments (Table I.) shows the forces

required to overcome the friction of the machine, and raise the load from

a position of rest. The second set of experiments shows the forces re-

quired when the machine is in motion to lift the load at a constant speed.

In both cases the efficiency of the machine has been worked out for every

experiment in the following way :

                                Experiments with Special Apparatus.

     In designing tlie sphere and roller machines it was assumed that
between the rolling surfaces the coefficient of friction was

                                                              /i=0-l,

and consequently that the pressure required between the ball and the
disc must be ten times as great as the force to be transmitted. During
the experiments above recorded it was found that the 'coefficient of fric-
tion was not constant, but increased with the pressures, the highest value
being about

                                                          /i=0-16.

     The machine at the Liverpool Exhibition gave results even higher

than this, and, generally speaking, it has been observed that the value of
the coefficient at the high pressures used increases slightly with the pres-
sure. It is evident that the circumstances of the case are peculiar, and

--that even the few published experiments npon rolling friction such as

--those upon locomotive tyres did not furnish satisfactory data for guid-

ance. It was therefore determined to conduct a series of experiments with
special apparatus, and for this jjurpose the machine shown in figs. 11 and 12

                                                &Figs. 11 12.

was designed. This apparatus consists of two discs (a) and (6), six inches
in diameter, the edges of which are in contact, and which can be replaced by
other similar discs of diiferent material. One of these discs (a) is driven
w
-- ----

directly from a motor by means of a pulley (p), the other (h) being driven
by friction at their point of contact. The latter disc is connected directly

to a dynamometer brake (c), the resistance of which is shown by means

of a lever (e) and a rod (/). At the same time the normal pressure at

the point of contact (d) is measured by means of a combination of levers

A(l and k). These levers act thus.  weight (w) being hung upon the

end of the lever (l), which has its fulcrum at the top of the support (I),

acts by means of a link (h) upon a second lever (A;), which has its fulcrum

at the lower end. The lever (k) carries the bearings of the shaft of the

disc (6), and thus the weight (w) is an exact measure of the horizontal
forces between the discs, the leverage being such as to make this latter

just twenty-one times as great as the weight in question.

The resistance overcome by the belt was threefold :

(a) The brake friction.

(b) The bearing ,,
(c) The rolling ,,

     The first only of these could be accurately determined, the sum of the
others berng estimated in the following way. Up to a certain point
the belt was powerful enough to overcome all the friction and to make
the wheels skid over each other, but beyond that the sum of the resist-
ances was suflBcient to make the belt slip, which it did at a fairly constant
point. Thus for a definite increase of pressure the increase of (b) and
(c) could be determined by the diminished reading of (a). jSy this means

the forces transmitted to the driven wheel were approximately estimated.

     Three sets of experiments were made :

(i.) Cast-iron discs with flat faces, i^in. wide.
(ii.) Cast-iron discs with flat faces, y'y in. wide.
(iii) Chilled cast-iron discs with spherical faces ground true.

The results of these experiments are given in the following Table III.

          REPORT 1886.

     The above results are plotted in the form of curves (Plate X.), the
pressures between the surfaces being taken as abscissae, the correspond-

ing forces transmitted as ordinates.

    From these curves it is clearly seen that by reducing the area of the

surface in contact a less pressure is required to transmit a given force
thus the curves 1, 2, and 3 rise above each other in regular order (3 being
the curve corresponding to the chilled iron spherical surfaces) ; and,

moreover, that while the two first are straight lines the last rises more

rapidly as the pressure increases, and, in fact, gives at last a coefficient of

friction

          /i=0-262.

    Finally it may be remarked that, whereas at lower pressures and with

larger surfaces in contact the presence of oil upon the latter causes con-
siderable variations in frictional resistance, it was found that at the
highest pressures used in the last set of experiments oil poured continuously

upon the rolling surfaces had no appreciable effect whatever.

               On ImjproveTnents in Electric Safety Lamps.
                           By J. Wilson Swan, M.A.

      [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                             among the Keports.]

I SHOWED an Electric Safety Lamp in this Section last year. I have
now improved the lamp in various ways, and I propose to describe and

exhibit the improvements.
     The objects I had in view in altering the original design were :

     1st. To reduce the weight as much as possible consistently with the

giving of sufficient light.

     2nd. To simplify the construction, with a view to minimising the cost
of manufacture and the cost of keeping in order.

     3rd. To make the lamp better able to resist a blow.
    4th. To seal in the liquid, so that the lamp could be held in any

position.

     5th. To add a fire-damp indicator.
     The lamps on the table embody these improvements, and are here for

the inspection of members.
     The details of construction and the record of experiments are given

in the diagram.

   --With regard to the first point namely, the size and weight of the

--apparatus that, of course, depends, in a great degree, on the amount

and duration of the light. Guided by the fact that the best of the oil
safety lamps scarcely gives the light of one standard candle, and that

most of those in common use give only a quarter or half a candle, I have

assumed that an average light of one candle, over 12 hours for datal men,
and 1:^ candle over 9 hours for hewers, is sufficient, and I have fixed the

size of the battery in the new lamps on this assumption. No alteration

of the design is necessary when more or less light than this is required,
but merely an increase or decrease of the size and weight of the battery
contained within the lamp body.
       ON IMPROVEMENTS IN ELECTRIC SAFETY LAMPS.      497

In this respect the Electric Safety Lamp has a marked advantao-e

over all safety lamps of the ordinary kind, which depend on the combns.

tion of oil ; theij cannot be made to give a mnch larger light without
radical alteration, if at all. If the Electric Safety Lamp is required to

give 5 or even 10 candle-light, it is only necessary to proportionally in-
crease the size and weight of the battery. Safety is not in the slightest

degree impaired.

     There is nothing easier than to be deceived as to the amount of light

that can be obtained from a certain size and kind of battery applied to
an incandescent lamp. If the lamp is constructed so as to allow such a
large current to pass through the carbon filament as will heat it to the
enormously high temperature at which disintegration rapidly takes place,

ten times as much light is produced as when, by the use of a different

lamp, the current is diminished, and the temperature of the filament

thereby lowered to a degree which will prolong the life of the lamp to an
economical point.

      In the case of a miner's safety lamp, it is very desirable to get as

much light as possible from a given weight of battery, and hence it is

allowable to subject the lamp filament to what may be termed a rather

high pressure, but not such a high pressure as will prevent the lamp
from lasting about 700 hours. Subject to this condition I find I can
obtain an average light of one standard candle during 12 hours, and 1^^
candle during 9 hours, from a battery, which, with all the appurtenances
of the lamp attached to it, weighs altogether 5| lbs. The same battery,

with a different lamp filament, will, of course, give either more light

for a shorter time, or less light for a longer time than that I have
mentioned.

     The battery cells are slightly different in construction from those in
last year's lamp. They consist, as before, of a central solid cylinder of

peroxide of lead, with a conducting core of lead wire, fixed concentrically,
by means of guide rings of india-rubber, within a tube of lead, the in-

ternal surface of which is in the spongy state. The annular space
between the peroxide of lead cylinder and the lead tube is filled with

dilute sulphuric acid. Four such elements are fitted into four ebonite

lined holes in a block of wood saturated with paraffin. The lead wire
connections between cell and cell are covered with india-rubber, and
embedded in channels in the wood, and covered with Chatterton's com-
pound. Over the buried connecting wires is fixed a veneer of ebonite,
which further protects them, and also forms a level seat for the cushion
of india-rubber, which, when pressed down by the cover-disc makes the
cells liquid-tight, so that the whole block may be laid on its side, or in-

verted, without leakage.

     In the form of lamp I showed last year the cover of the case which
contained the battery had to be screwed off to get at the battery

terminals, for the purpose of putting them in connection with the charg-
ing circuit. In the new design the removal of the cover is avoided by
bringing down the battery terminals to the bottom. Access is given to
these through two small holes, within which fit two pins connected with
the positive and negative charging wires. Charging is effected by simply
placing the lamp on a bench fitted with charging pins, in connection
with wires from a dynamo, so that the charging pins enter the two holes
at the bottom of the lamp case. The lamps remain on the dynamo cir-
cuit, receiving their charge during the time the men who have used the

lamps are resting, and they become fully charged by the time these men

return to work.

     It is a point in favour of this kind of lamp that the operation of re-

--newing the charge is effected with little trouble and cost far less than

is involved in replenishing and cleaning ordinary safety lamps. For
example : one horse power is sufficient to charge one hundred lamps at a
time; that item of cost will, therefore, not exceed a farthing a lamp per

week.

     The total cost will not exceed fivepence per week, where several hun-
dred lamps are in constant use. That amount will, I estimate, cover the
total weekly cost per lamp, including renewal of lamp-bulbs, the cost of
fuel, wages for keeping the lamps charged and in repair, and interest at
ten per cent, on the capital outlay for the whole plant, including the lamps

themselves.

     In one of the modifications of the lamp the light is fixed upon the top
of the case, with a view to the illumination of the roof and sides of the

mine.

     This form of lamp is intended for the use of over-men while travelling

in the workings.

     The bull's-eye form, with the light on one side, is intended for the use
of the hewer. While the hewer is at work the lamp will be hung up on
a hook as usual.

"Where low workings have to be traversed the lamps can be fastened

to the breast of the miner by a strap across the shoulder.

The only other point requiring explanation is the fire-damp indicator.

The want in the lamp I showed last year, of the means of showing the

presence of fire-damp, was urged as an objection to it. I have met the

objection by adding an indicator. This will not be required on every

lamp, but only on lamps used by over-men. I have made the indicator in

three forms ; two of these act on the same principle as Liveing's fire-
Adamp indicator.
                                          spiral coil of thin platinum wire is arranged so that

it can be heated to a low red heat by switching through it the current

generated by the lamp battery. If this takes place in an atmosphere in

which fire-damp is present, the wire becomes hotter than when heated in

pure atmospheric air, because combustion of the fire-damp with the

oxygen of the air, brought about by the electrically heated wire, produces

additional heat, and, consequentlj^, increases the temperature of the wire,

so that it is sensibly brighter whan heated in air containing fire-damp
than when heated in air in which there is no fire-damp.

In one form of the indicator I have followed Mr. laveing's idea of

having a comparison wire, shut up, air-tight, in a glass tube containing

pure air. In another I have deviated from Liveing's construction in two

ways namely,                          by  having  only one wire  (the  test wire), and  instead  of
                                   ;

this being in a wire gauze cage, always exposed to the atmosphere in

which the lamp is placed, it is in a tube which, when the current is

turned on to heat the wire, is completely closed. It is not easily con-

ceivable, even if the test were made in an atmosphere of air and fire-damp

of maximum explosiveness, that flame would pass the fourfold lining of

fine copper wire gauze of the Liveing indicator ; still it is, perhaps, more

consistent with the absolute safety of the lamp itself to make the test in

a closed vessel. With the double wire arrangement, when fire-damp is

present in the air, even in so small a proportion as half a per cent., the
exposed wire glows with perceptibly greater brightness than the enclosed
ON IMPROVEMENTS IN ELECTRIC SAFETY LAMPS.  499

comparison wire. "With the single wire arrangement, under the same
atmospheric conditions, the wire would glow for an instant with extra
brightness, and then, after the small quantity of enclosed fire-damp is
consumed, would die down to normal redness.

     The third form of indicator acts upon a different principle. In it
there is a platinum wire within a small tube, and the means of turning
on the current from the lamp battery to heat the wire, as before but here

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

the hot wire is employed only to effect the combustion of any fire-damp

that may be present, with a view to the production of a partial vacuum

resulting from the condensation of the watery vapour of the burnt gases.
The degree of vacuum or shrinkage is shown by the rise of liquid in an
adjacent gauge-tube, and from this the exact percentage of fire-damp

present in the air may be ascertained. This form of test is also, and
necessarily, made in a closed vessel. The hot wire is completely cut off

from contact with the outer air.

     I think it will appear to the Section that I have produced a miner's
lamp having the advantage of absolute safety, and which is, at once, more
efficient and more economical than any other miner's lamp yet con-

structed.

       On the Birmingham, Tame, and Rea Blstrict Drainage.

The author in submitting this paper begs to state that he has not

entered into any discussion of the relative merits of the various systems

of sewage purification now in operation, nor has he advanced any theory
of his own in relation thereto, but has confined himself to a practical and
historical account of the work of the Birmingham, Tame, and Rea District

Drainage Board, merely adding from time to time such remarks as seemed
needful for the proper explanation of the subject under consideration.

     In giving an account of the formation and work of the Drainage
Board, the works of sewage purification previously undertaken by the
Corporation of Birmingham form so important a part that any general
description of the Drainage Board would be incomplete without some
reference thereto ; but inasmuch as the efforts of the Birmingham Cor-

poration to deal with the sewage difficulty have been so prominently
before the various bodies interested in sanitary work, both from the pro-
ceedings in Parliament and from several published statements, it has not

been thought necessary to make further allusion thereto than may be

required for giving a complete history of the position and work of the

Board.

     It may perhaps be desirable to glance briefly, in the first instance, at

the sanitary condition of the district generally prior to the formation of

the Board, with a view of setting forth more clearly the advantages the
various authorities now comprising the Board were intended to derive
from their union.

     The borough of Birmiagham, together with the towns of Walsall, West

                                                                                                        KK2

 Bromwich, Wednesburj, Darlaston, Tipton, part of Wolverhampton, and
 a number of other urban or rural sanitary districts, forming the major
 part of what is known as the 'Black Country,' is situated near the summit

-- --of one of the great watersheds of England that of the Trent beino-

 drained by the River Tame, which, with its various feeders, forms a small
 stream, dischai-ging into the Trent about midway between Tamworth and

 Burton. Whatever may have been the benefits derived by the large

 population of the Black Country from being situated high np in the

-- --watershed, one great disadvantage that of sewage pollution soon

 became apparent owing to the naturally diminutive character of the
 watercourses and the large amount of liquid refuse poured into them.
 The Corporation of Birmingham, as the principal local authority, was
 early made aware of the responsibility thus incurred, and was earnestly

 combating the sewage difficulty at a time when the authorities of many

 towns considered it, if not exactly the right thing to do, at any rate only
 a venial oS'ence, to discharge their sewage into the rivers or streams that

 flowed in their vicinity.

     At the time the formation of the Drainage Board was suggested none
of the authorities of the towns or districts draining into the Tame had
made, so far as the author is aware, any really systematic attempt at
sewage purification except those of Birmingham and Wolverhampton.

     The Corporation of Birmingham constructed, as far back as 1853,
two main intercepting sewers whereby the sewage from those portions of
the borough draining to the Biver Rea and Hockley Brook was conveyed
to the general outlet at Saltley, where subsequently a system of tank
purification had been adopted, and which was developed from time to
time, until at the period when the Drainage Board was formed the Cor-
poration possessed land and works thoroughly capable of purifying, so far
as precipitation by lime could purify, the sewage of the borough. The
Manor of Aston Local Board had caused plans to be prepared in 1874
for the intercepting sewers for diverting the sewage of its district from
the River Tame and the Hockley Brook, and by agreement the Handsworth
Local Board, whose district is situated on the same watersheds but
higher up, became joint owners of such sewers. These sewers were con-
structed in 1876, and although the sewage was thus diverted in detail it
was only to cast it into the Tame again in one united volume, pending the
decision of these boards as to the method of sewage treatment to be
adopted ; a problem that threatened to be very difficult of solution had not
the Drainage Board about that time been formed, and so relieved those
authorities of further trouble. The authorities of the district of Balsall
Heath, a small but somewhat thickly inhabited area draining to the Rivers
Rea and Cole immediately above the Borough of Birmingham, had esta-
bli:=hed some precipitating 'works of an elementary character at the outlet
in the River Cole area, but owing to the great increase of population all
around the use of these works had become objectionable, and as the only
outlets for this district lay through the Borough of Birmingham, it became
necessary, if great expense were to be avoided, that some arrangement
should be made for the Corporation to provide the requisite outlets. The
district of Harborne, likewise situated in the watershed of the Rea above
the Borough of Birmingham, had also established a system of tank purifi-

cation, but open to similar objections to those above named in Balsall
Heath, this district also suffering from precisely the same difficulties as

to outlet. These, then, were the only districts in the neighbourhood of
OK THE BIRMINGHAM, TAME, AND REA DISTRICT DRAINAGE. 501

Birmingham of which the authorities had made any efforts to deal with
their sewage, whilst on the other hand there were several districts
urgently in need of sanitary reform that had been nnable, owing to their

positions in relation to other districts, to take independently the necessary

step except at a prohibitive cost.

     Birmingham and its sewage farm holding by virtue of its position
the key of the situation, and the Corporation anticipating that great ex-
pense and inconvenience must ultimately arise if some united action were
not taken, it was decided to apply to the Local Government Board, under
the Public Health Act, 1875, for an order to form the following urban
and rural sanitary districts or portions of them into a united district for
the purpose of sewage disposal, viz., the Borough of Birmingham, the Local
Oovernment Districts of Aston Manor, Handsworth, Smethwick, Balsall
Heath, Harborne, and Saltley ; the contributory places of Aston, King's
Norton and Northfield, and Perry Barr ; and portions of the districts of
the West Bromwich Improvement Commissioners, and of the Solihull Rural

Sanitary Authority the principle of selection adopted being to choose only
                                                                                                        ;

those districts lying round Birmingham which were restricted in their

outlets, or which had no reasonable facilities for establishing purification

works of their own.

    An inquiry lasting several days was held by J. T. Harrison, Esq., the

Government Inspector, at the Public Offices, Birmingham, in which the

West Bromwich Commissioners proved to the Inspector's satisfaction

that they were in a position to establish their own purification works, and

the Rural Sanitary Authority of Solihull, having also recently prepared a

scheme, was likewise omitted by the Inspector.

All the other districts were formed into a united district, under the

title of the Birminglnim, Tame, and Rea Main Sewerage District, the Pro-

visional Order coming into operation on September 29, 1877.

The Joint Board consisted at first of twenty elective members, chosen

from the members of the various constituent authorities, of which the

Borough of Birmingham sent  eleven  and  the others one  each                              and  two
                                                                                        ;

ex.officio members, viz., the Mayor of Birmingham and the Chairman of
the Aston Manor Local Board. The district was enlarged in 1881 by the

addition of the parish of Sutton Coldfield, but no alteration was made in

the constitution of the Board until Sutton Coldfield was incorporated

early in the present year, when the number of members was increased to

24, Sutton Coldfield sending one member and the representation of the

borough being increased to the same extent.

The first meeting of the Board was held December 6, 1877, when Mr.

Alderman Avery, a gentleman well known in connection with the sanitary

work of the Borough of Birmingham, was elected Chairman, a position he

still occupies.

     The duties of the Board are the acquiring of such lands and the con-
struction and maintenance of such outfall works as may be necessary

for the purification of the sewage of the various constituent authorities, so

that it may be discharged into any streams or watercourses without breach

of the Rivers Pollution Act, 1876. It is incumbent on each of the con-

stituent authorities either to construct such intercepting sewers as may be

required for conveying the sewage of its district to the outfall works, or

otherwise to arrange terms with one or other of the constituent authorities

for the user of such sewers as may be necessary for that purpose. The

Joint Board exercises supervision over the size, character, and direction
502 EEPOKT-- 1886.

of new intercepting sewers, so that they may be laid down with general

reference to the requirements of the united district at large, and in the case

of its being desirable that one constituent authority should use the exist-

ing intercepting sewers of another constituent authority, it devolves on the

Joint Board to say whether such sewer can and ought to be so used to the

extent of, but not exceeding, 40 gallons per head per day of the popula-

tion of the distrif :t.

The costs of the Joint Board are divided into the costs of management

and the costs of outfall works (outfall works being the land, tanks, and

works for purifying the sewage).

All the constituent authorities, with the exception of Perry Barr, are

liable to the costs of management, but no constituent authority is liable to

the expenses of outfall works until some portion of such authority's district

has been placed in connection with any of the said outfall works.

The various districts contribute to the expenses of the Board in pro-

portion to the number of rated tenements in each district or contributory

place, such number being ascertained from the poor-rate made last before

the times for issuing the Board's precepts.

The total area of the drainage district is 47,275 acres ; the population

in 1885 was estimated at 619,693 ; and the ratable value 2,401,093Z.

AAppendix       gives a detailed statement of the area, population, and

ratable value.

In accordance with the Provisional Order, the Drainage Board pur-

chased as going concerns all existing lands and works for treatment of

sewage owned by the various constituent authorities, such being Birming-

ham, Astou Manor, Harborne, and Balsall Heath. Of these the works

at Harborne and Balsall Heath were abandoned as soon as arrangements

for outlets had been carried into effect, and the sites of such works were

ultimately sold. Prom the Borough of Birmingham the Board acquired

about 159 acres of freehold and 103|^ acres of leasehold land, together

with the extensive system of tanks, machinery, plant, farm implements,

and stock situated at the general outlet at Saltley ; and from Aston Manor

about six acres of land, also situated at Saltley and surrounded by the

Corporation farm.

As the outlet at Saltley is the natural point of discharge for fully

nine-tenths of the total population of the Drainage District, one of the

first cares of the Drainage Board after its formation was to assist the

various constituent authorities in their endeavours to put themselves in

communication with the outfall works purchased from the Birmingham

Corporation. Accordingly arrangements were speedily made for the

Corporation to receive into their main sewers the sewage from the districts
of Harborne and Balsall Heath, on payment of an annual sum for user ;.
the Manor of Aston Local Board entered into a contract for the construc-

tion of the sewer for conveying its sewage from the temporaiy outlet into

the Tame to the Board's tanks, the Aston Rural Sanitary Authority be-
coming joint owner with Aston Manor and Handsworth, and thereby

procuring an outlet for the Erdington and Witton poi'tions of its district -^

the Handsworth Local Board extended one of the Aston and Handsworth

joint sewers , so as to accommodate the northern portion of its district,
and has since, in conjunction with Smethwick, extended the other joint

sewer, thereby completing for the present the intercepting sewers of

its own district and providing for Smethwick an outlet for the larger

portion of that district. The Saltley Local Board constructed the inter-
          ON THE BIEMINGHAM, TAME, AND REA DISTRICT DRAINAGE. 503

cepting sewers, and the Rural Sanitary Authority of King's Norton, after
arranging with the Corporation of Birminghana for an outlet through
their main sewer, constiiicted the intercepting sewers for the drainage of
portions of its district. For those portions of the Drainage District that

could not conveniently be brought down to the common outlet at Saltley,
the Corporation of Birmingham constructed the sewer for accommodating

the area draining to the Cole comprised in the districts of Birmingham,
Balsall Heath, King's Norton, and Aston Rural, this sewer being tun-

nelled across the ridge dividing the watersheds of the Tame and Cole,
and discharging on to the new farm. The Aston Rural Sanitary Autho-

rity constructed the sewer for the drainage of Sutton Coldfield, this sewer

also discharging on to the new farm.
     As the result of the intercepting works just described, the whole of

the populated areas of the Drainage District, with one exception, are now

placed in communication with the outfall works. The one exception is
the district of Smethwick, which, being situated at the summit of the
watershed, has had to await the development of the intercepting system

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

but it is believed that arrangements are contemplated whereby this diffi-
culty will be shortly removed.

      In the meantime, pending the completion of these intercepting
arrangements, the Drainage Board had been proceeding with the very
important duty of extending its outfall works so as to meet efficiently the
additional strain that would in due course be brought upon them. It had
been generally understood at the time the Board was formed that an
extension of the outfall works would be necessary, and after due consider-
ation it was decided that the application of the sewage to land after
partial treatment by lime, and in the tanks, would be the most satisfactory
method of purification. The Board accordingly directed its attention to

the acquisition of the required area of land. An opportunity that pre-

sented itself in 1880 of obtaining the unexpired term of 102 years
of a lease of 96 acres of suitable land at Tyburn, about 2^ miles
below the existing tanks, was embraced, and shortly after a lease for
99 years of 123 acres of adjoining land was obtained, while 250 acres of
freehold from the Right Honourable the Earl of Bradford, 350 acres from

the trustees of W". W. Bagot, Esq., and 118 acres from various other

owners were acquired by mutual arrangement, and more recently a further
plot of 18| acres has been leased from the Right Honourable Lord Norton
for 21 years, thus making a total of 955^ acres of additional land, or,
including the land already occupied by the Board at Saltley, a total area
of 1,227 acres available for works of sewage disposal. The rent of the
leasehold land is at the rate of 4>l. per acre, and the average cost of the

freehold, including timber, buildings, mill rights, tenants' compensation,
law charges, &c., 152Z. per acre.

     The nature of the land is very favourable for the purification of sewage,
the natural surface of the gi'ound being, as a rule, even and unbroken, and
the level such as to admit of the irrigation of the whole by gravitation,
with the exception of about 100 acres. The subsoil is gravel and sand,
varying from 6 feet to 10 feet in thickness. To reduce the risk of flooding
from the river the Board removed the mills and weir, and straightened the
river at Minworth at the lower end of the farm lands, thereby lowering
the water-level of the river several feet, and by the construction of outfall

cuts, carried to suitable outlets into the river, the subsoil drains are placed

beyond the influence of backwater, the result being that no inconvenience

                                                                                                                                             I

is experienced from the proximity of the river, except during unusual
floods. For conveying the sewage to the land a conduit 8 feet in diameter
and about 2f miles long has been constructed, capable of discharging

38 million gallons per day when running half-full, or double that quantity
running full, the fall being 2 feet per mile. This conduit commences at

the outlet end of the large tanks at Saltley and terminates at Tyburn,
valves being placed at suitable intervals for dischai"ging the sewage on to
the land passed through. Below Tyburn the capacity of the conduit has
been reduced, a conduit 3 feet 6 in. in diameter being sufiicient for the
remainder of the farm. The sewage is drawn from these conduits into
open brick carriers, which again discharge into secondary carriers of
earth, and thence into the flooding carriers. The brick carriers are con-
structed with a slight fall, steps being provided in the inverts at suitable

intervals for drawing down the water. The land is drained to a minimum
depth of 4 feet 6 in., but in many cases, owing to the level nature of some

of the land, a greater depth has been found necessary at the lower ends
of the drains. The subsoil drainage consists of 3-in. and 4-in. agricul-
tural drain-pipes placed from ^ to | of a chain apart, and discharging into
main drains of 'J-in., 12-in., 15-in., and 18-inch stoneware socket pipes,
which in turn discharge into the outfall channels. Koads generally
12 feet wide, with passing places at intervals, have been laid out with the
view of meeting the requirements of the steam cultivating operations as
well as for the conveyance of produce. In addition to the farm buildings
at Saltley, purchased frona the Corporation, farm buildings in a central
position at Tyburn have been erected, together with entrance lodge,
manager's house, and six labourers' cottages ; also smaller buildings at
Minworth and four labourers' cottages. The various farmhouses and
buildings originally existing have also been repaired and extended.

     The total cost of the land and works to the present has been 403,695?.,
of which the purchase of original land and works is 170,544Z., new land
110,800/., new works 113,299Z., farming stock and implements for new
land 9,052L The details of cost are given iu Appendix B.

     The method of treating the sewage as now carried on is as follows :
     The sewage on ari-iving near the liming sheds at the upper end of the

works is mixed with lime, both to neutralise the acids (present to an
unusual extent in Birmingham sewage) and also to assist precipitation,
which, however, is not now necessary to so great an extent as formerly

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

the sewage then passes through the large or roughing tanks, where the
grosser impurities are precipitated, and thence it is conveyed by the
main conduit to the land and disposed of by ordinary imgation. The
sixteen small tanks required at one time for completing the precipitation
process are still used under certain circumstances, and are a valuable

auxiliary when rainfall has increased the normal quantity of sewage.
The sludge from the tanks is elevated by bucket dredgers and pumps
into movable wooden carriers, and flows into beds formed in the land at
the Saltley or western end of the farm. The sludge contains about

90 per cent, of water as it comes from the tanks, but after lying on the

ground for about fourteen days much of this water drains away or is

evaporated, leaving the sludge in a layer about 10 inches thick and of a
consistency that admits of its being trenched into the land. Crops are
then planted, and after a time the sludge becomes pulverised and capable
of bsing irrigated. About forty acres of land were required for the
          ON THE BIRMINGHAM, TAME, AND EEA DISTEICT DRAINAGE, 505

sludge last year, and the same land may receive a coating of sludge every
two to three years.

   A few words may be said as to the difficulty at one time experienced

in dealing with the mud from the tanks. After the construction of the
first two large tanks in 1859 the mud therein deposited was dredged out

and run on to the adjacent land, where it accumulated for some years,

forming at one time a large mass of foul matter about seven acres in

area and over four feet deep. In consequence of the nuisance arising

therefrom proceedings were taken, about 1871, by the residents in the

vicinity, and an injunction obtained restraining the Corporation from

depositing the mud so as to cause a nuisance. Great efforts were made

by the Corporation to reduce the amount of mud, large quantities being

conveyed away in boats, but it was not until the experiment had been

tried of trenching the mud into the land, and found perfectly satisfactory,

that the present system V7as adopted, about the end of 1872, and the

difficulty finally overcome.

Practically the whole of the sewage of the Drainage District, amount-

ing to sixteen million gallons per day, flows by gravitation to the outfall

works. Only a very small area requires its sewage lifted by pumping, the
cost of such pumping beiug 104Z. per annum.

The Board farms the whole of the land, no portion of it being

sub-let.

Of the produce milk is a large and increasing item, 128,995 gallons,

realising 4,406Z., being sold last year. During the present year about
280 acres of land are devoted to mangolds, swedes, and kohl rabi ; 250
acres to market garden produce, 100 acres to Italian rye grass, 130 acres
to cereals, and about 340 acres are pasture.

     The total amount realised last year from the sale of stock and produce
was 20,008Z. During the same time stock was purchased to the extent of

7,760Z.

With regard to the financial aspect of the Board's work it is perhaps

needless to say that a considerable sum of money has annually to be

obtaiued from the rates. The total amount raised by the Board's precept

last year was 33,089Z., of which interest and repayment of loans absorbed

17,5161.                                      management  expenses,  rent,  rates,  taxes,  &c.,  5,594L ;                                                                                                                                         the

balance of 9,9791. representing the loss on the year's working of the

farm.

    Appendix C is a detailed statement of the actual income and expendi-
ture of the farm and works during 1885. The great loss, as will be seen

from the statement, is in the woi-k at the outlet (which comprises the

lime, wages, machinery expenses, and other charges connected with inter-

cepting and dealing with the mud from the tanks). The amount ex-

pended under this head (exclusive of rent) was 10,715L, for which sum

4,778 tons of lime were provided for precipitation, and 135,476 cube

yards of mud were arrested                                in the tanks and dug into the land                                                                                                                                                       the corre-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

sponding income is practically nil. Since the opening out of the irriga-

tion land the expenses at the outlet have undergone some reduction, and

there is every prospect not only of a further reduction in the future, but

also of a gradual increase in the receipts from the irrigation land as the

demand for the farm produce is developed ; but bearing in mind the large

initial outlay in purchase of land and the construction of works, and the

annual working expenses in disposing of so large a volume of sewage, it
--506
                  EEPOET 1886.

is not to be expected that assistance from tlie rates can be dispensed with,,

nntil, in the somewhat distant fatnre, the large annual sum now required

for interest and repayment of loans shall cease. It should, however, be
remembered in dealing with sewage farm accounts that after all the great
item on the credit side of the balance-sheet (although it is one that

cannot be represented by a money value) is the satisfactory disposal of

the sewage.
     In conclusion, it is only fair to observe, with reference to remarks

made in the first part of this paper as to the sanitary condition of the
Tame Valley, that since the date then referred to considerable progress
has been made in sewage purification, Walsall, West Bromwich, Wednes--
bury, Darlaston, and other towns and places having taken up the question
in a practical and energetic manner.

The President delivered the fonowing Address :

A mebe catalogue of facts, however well arranged, has never led to any important

scientific generalisation. For in any suhject the facts are so numerous and many-

sided that they only lead us to a conclusion when they are marshalled by the light

Aof some leading idea.  theory is then a necessity for the advance of science, and

we may regard it as the branch of a living tree, of which facts are the nourishment.

In the struggle between competing branches to reach the light some perish, and

others form vigorous limbs. And as in a tree the shape of the young shoot can

give us hut little idea of the ultimate form of the branch, so theories become largely

transformed in the course of their existence, and afford in their tiu:n the parent

stem for others.

    The success of a theory may he measured by the extent to which it is capable

of assimilating facts, and by the smaUness of the change which it must undergo in

the process. Every theory which is based on a true perception of facts is to some

·extent fertile in affording a nucleus for the aggregation of new observations. And

a theory, apparently abandoned, has often ultimately appeared to contain an element

of truth, which receives acknowledgment hy the light of later views.

It will, I think, be useful to avail myself of the present occasion to direct your

attention to a certain group of theories, which are stOl in an undeveloped and

somewhat discordant condition, but which must form the nucleus round which

many observations have yet to be collected before these theories and their descend-
ants can make a definitely accepted body of truth. If I am disposed to criticise

some of them in their actual form, I shall not be understood as denying the great

service which has been rendered to science by their formulation.

Great as have been the advances of geology during the present century, we

have no precise knowledge of one of its fundamental units. The scale of time on

which we must suppose geological history to be dravra is important not only for

geology itself, but it has an intimate relation with some of the profoundest questions

of biology, physics, and cosmogony.

   We can hardly hope to obtain an accurate measure of time from pure geology,

for the extent to which the events chronicled in strata were contemporaneous is not

written in the strata themselves, and there are long intervals of time of which no

record has been preserved.

    An important step has been taken by Alfred Tylor, Croll, and others, towards

the determination of the rate of action of geological agents.' From estimates of

the amount of sediment carried down by rivers, it appears that it takes from 1,000

to 6,000 years to remove one foot of rock from the general surface of a river

basin.

    From a consideration of the denuding power of rivers, and a measurement of
the thickness of stratified rock, Phillips has made an estimate of the period of time

comprised in geological history, and finds that, from stratigraphical evidence alone,

we may regard the antiquity of life on the earth as being possibly between 38 and

96 millions of years.

    Now while we should perhaps be wrong to pay much attention to these figures,

yet at least we gain some insight into the order of magnitude of the periods with
which we have to deal, and we may feel confident that a million years is not an
infinitesimal fraction of the whole of geological time.

    It is hardly to be hoped, however, that we shall ever attain to any very accurate

knowledge of the geological time scale from this kind of argument.
     But there is another theory which is precise in its estimate, and which, if

acceptable from other points of view, will furnish exactly what is requisite. Mr.
Croll claims to prove that great changes of climate must be brought about by
astronomical events of which the dates are known or ascertainable.^ The pertur-

bation of the planets causes a secular variability in the eccentricity of the earth's

orbit, and we are able confidently to compute the eccentricity for many thousands

of years forward and backward from to-day, although it appears that, in the

opinion of Newcomb and Adams, no great reliance can be placed on the values

deduced from the formulae at dates so remote as those of which Mr. Croll speaks.

According to Mr. Croll, when the eccentricity of the earth's orbit is at its
maximum, that hemisphere which has its winter in apheUon would undergo a
o-lacial period. Now, as the date of great eccentricity is ascertainable, this would

explain the great ice-age and give us its date.

     The theory has met with a cordial acceptance on many sides, probably to a great
extent from the charm of the complete answer it aifords to one of the great riddles

of geology.

     Adequate criticism of Mr. Croll's views is a matter of great difficulty on account
of the diversity of causes which are said to co-operate in the glaciation. In the
case of an effect arising from a number of causes, each of which contributes its
share, it is obvious that if the amount of each cause and of each effect ia largely
conjectural the uncertainty of the total result is by no means to be measured by
the uncertainty of each item, but is enormously augmented. Without going far

into details it may be said that these various concurrent causes result in one

fundamental proposition with regard to climate, which must be regarded as the key-

--stone of the whole argument. That proposition amounts to this that climate is

...unstable.
                                                                                                                                                                                 _
      Mr. Croll holds that the various causes of change of climate operate inter se in

such a way as to augment their several efliciencies. Thus the trade-winds are

driven by the difference of temperature between the frigid and torrid zones, and if
from the astronomical cause the N. hemisphere becomes cooler the trade-winds on

that hemisphere encroach on those of the other, and the part of the warm oceanic

current, which formerly flowed into the cold north zone, will be diverted into the
 S. hemisphere. Thus the cold of the N. hemisphere is augmented, and this in its
turn displaces the trade-winds further, and this again acts on the ocean-currents,
 and so on ; and this is neither more nor less than instability.

      But if climate be unstable, and if from some of those temporary causes, for
 which no reasons can as yet be assigned, there occurs a short period of cold, then
surely some even infinitesimal portion of the second link in the chain of causation
must exist : and this should proceed as in the first case to augment the departure
 from the original condition, and the climate must change.

       In a matter so complex as the weather, it is at least possible that there should

 be instability when the cause of disturbance is astronomical, whilst there is stability

in an ordinary sense. If this is so, it might be explained by the necessity for a

prolonged alteration in the direction of prevailing winds in order to affect oceanic

currents.*

However this may be, so remarkable a doctrine as the instability of climate

must certainly be regarded with great suspicion, and we should require abundant

Nowproof before accepting it.  there is one result of Mr. Croll's theory which

should afibrd almost a crucial test of its acceptability. In consequence of the pre-

cession of the equinoxes the conditions producing glaciation in one hemisphere must

be transferred to the other every 1 0,000 years. If there is good geological evidence

that this has actually been the case, we should allow very great weight to the

astronomical theory, notwithstanding the difficulties in its way. Mr. Croll has

urged that there is such evidence, and this view has been recently strongly supported

by M. Blytt.^ Other geologists do not, however, seem convinced of the conclusive-

ness of the evidence.

Thus Mr. Wallace,' whilst admitting that there was some amelioration of

climate from time to time during the last glacial period, cannot agree in the

regular alternations of cold and warm demanded by Mr. Croll's theory. To meet

this difficulty he proposes a modification. According to his view large eccentricity

in the earth's orbit will only produce glaciation when accompanied by favourable

geographical conditions. And when extreme glaciation has once been established

in the hemisphere which has its winter in aphelion, the glaciation will persist, with

some diminution of intensity, when precession has brought round the perihelion to

the winter. In this case, according to Wallace, glaciation will be simultaneous on

both hemispheres.

Again he contends that, if the geographical conditions are not favourable,

astronomical causes alone are not competent to produce glaciation.

     There is agreement between the two theories in admitting instability of climate
at first, when glaciation is about to begin under the influence of great eccentricity

of the orbit, but afterwards Wallace demands gi-eat stability of climate. Thus he

maintains that there is great stability in extreme climates, either warm or cold,

whilst there is instability in moderate climates. I cannot perceive that we have
much reason from physical considerations for accepting these remarkable proposi-

tions, and the acceptance or rejection of them demands an accurate knowledge of
the most nicely balanced actions, of which we have as yet barely an outline.

     Ocean currents play a most important part in these theories, but at this moment

our knowledge of the principal oceanic circulation, and of its annual variability, is

very meagre. In the course of a few years we may expect a considerable accession

--to our knowledge, when the Meteorological Office shall have completed a work but

just begim viz., the analysis of ships' logs for some sixty years, for the purpose of

laying down in charts the oceanic currents.
     With regard to the great atmospheric currents even the general scheme is not

yet known. Nearly thirty years ago Professor James Thomson gave before this

Association at Dublin an important suggestion on this point. As it has been

passed over in complete silence ever since, the present seems to be a good oppor-

tunity of redirecting attention to it.

     According to Halley's theory of atmospheric circulation, the hot air rises at the
equator and floats north and south in two grand upper currents, and it then acquires
a westward motion relatively to the earth's surface, in consequence of the earth's
rotation. Also the cold air at the pole sinks and spreads out over the earth's

surface in a southerly current, at first with a westerly tendency, because the air
comes from the higher regions of the atmosphere, and afterwards due south, and

then easterly, when it is left behind by the earth in its rotation.
     Now_ Professor Thomson remarks that this theory disagrees with fact in as far

as that in our latitudes, the winds, though westerly, have a poleward tendency,

instead of the reverse.

In the face of this discrepancy he maintains that ' the great circulation alreadv

described does actually occur, but occurs subject to this modification, that a thin

--stratum of air on the surface of the earth in the latitudes higher than 30°

stratum in which the inhabitants of tliose latitudes have their existence, and of

--which the movements constitute the observed winds of those latitudes being, by-

 friction and impulses on the surface of the earth, retarded with reference to the
rapid whirl or vortex motion from west to east of the great mass of air above it,

tends to flow towards the pole, and actually does so flow to supply the partial void

in the central parts of that vortex, due to the centrifugal force of its revolution.

Thus it appears that in the temperate latitudes there are three currents at different

--heights that the uppermost moves towards the pole, and is part of a grand

primary circulation between the equatorial and polar regions ; that the lower-
most moves also towards the pole, but is only a thin stratum forming part of a
secondary circulation ; that the middle current moves from the pole, and constitutes

the return current for both the preceding ; and that all these three currents have a

prevailing motion from west to east.'

      Such, then, appears to be our present state of ignorance of these great terrestrial
actions, and any speculations as to the precise effect of changes in the annual dis-

tribution of the sun's heat must be very hazardous until we know more precisely

the nature of the thing changed.

    When looking at the astronomical theory of geological climate as a whole, one

cannot but admire the symmetry and beauty of the scheme, and nourish a hope

that it may be true ; but the mental satisfaction derived from our survey must not

blind us to the doubts and difiiculties with which it is surrounded.

     And now let us turn to some other theories bearing on this important point of

geological time.

     Amongst the many transcendent services rendered to science by Sir William
Thomson, it is not the least that he has turned the searching light of the theory of

energy on to the science of geology. Geologists have thus been taught that the
truth must lie between the cataclysms of the old geologists and the uniformi-

tarianism of forty years ago. It is now generally believed that we must look for

a greater intensity of geologic action in the remote past, and that the duration of

the geologic ages, however little we may be able mentally to grasp their greatness,
must bear about the same relation to the numbers which were written down in
the older treatises on geology, as the life of an ordinary man does to the age of

Methuselah,

     The arguments which Sir William Thomson has adduced in limitation of geo-
logical time are of three kinds. I shall refer first to that which has been called the
argument from tidal friction ; but before stating the argument itself it will be
convenient to speak of the data on which the numerical results are based.

      Since water is not frictionless, tidal oscillations must be subject to friction, and
this is evidenced by the delay of twenty-four to thirty-six hours, which is found

to occur between full and change of moon and spring-tide. An inevitable result

of this friction is that the diurnal rotation of the earth must be slowly retarded,

and that we who accept the earth as our timekeeper must accuse the moon of a

secular acceleration of her motion round the earth, which cannot be otherwise
explained. It is generally admitted by astronomers that there actually is such an
unexplained secular acceleration of the moon's mean motion.

     No passage in Thomson and Tait's ' Natural Philosophy ' has excited more
general interest than that in which Adams is quoted as showing that, with a

certain value for the secular acceleration, the earth must in a century fall behind a
perfect chronometer, set and rated at the beginning of the century, by twenty-two
seconds. Unfortunately this passage in the first edition gave an erroneous com-
plexion to Adams's opinion, and being quoted, without a statement of the premisses,
has been used in popular astronomy as an authority for establishing the statement
that the earth is actually a false timekeeper to the precise amount specified.

      In the second edition ("in the editing of which I took part) this passage has
been rewritten, and it is shown that Newcomb's estimate of the secular acceleration
only gives about one-third of the retardation of the earth's rotation, which resulted
from Adams's value. The last sentence of the paragraph here runs as follows :

                                   » Brit. Assoc. Report, Dublin, 1857, p. 38-9.
              TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                    515

* It is proper to add that Adams lays but little stress on the actual numerical

values which have been used in this computation, and is of opinion that the amount

of tidal retardation of the earth's rotation is quite uncertain.' Thus, in the opinion

of our great physical astronomer, a datum is still wanting for the determination

of a limit to geological time, according to Thomson's argument.

     However, subject to this uncertainty, with the values used by Adams in his

computation, and with the assumption that the rate of tidal friction has remained

constant, then a thousand million years ago the earth was rotating twice as fast as

--at present. In the last edition of the ' Natural Philosopby ' the argument from

these data runs thus :

' If the consolidation of the earth took place then or earlier, the ellipticity of
~ ~,the upper layers (of the earth's mass) must have been
                                          instead of about                    as

it is at present. It must necessarily remain uncertain whether the earth would

from time to time adjust itself completely to a figure of equilibrium adapted to the
rotation. But it is clear that a want of complete adjustment would leave traces

in a preponderance of land in equatorial regions. The existence of large continents

and the great eSective rigidity of the earth's mass render it improbable that the

adjustment, if any, to the appropriate figure of equilibriiun would be complete.

The fact, then, that the continents are arranged along meridians, rather than in an

equatorial belt, afibrds some degree of proof that the consolidation of the earth

took place at a time when the diurnal rotation differed but little from its present

value. It is probable, therefore, that the date of consolidation is considerably

more recent than a thousand million years ago.'

    I trust it may not be presumptuous in me to criticise the views of my great

master, at whose intuitive perception of truth in physical questions I have often

marvelled, but this passage does not even yet seem to me to allow a sufiiciently

large margin of uncertainty.

It will be observed that the argument reposes on our certainty that the earth

possesses rigidity of such a kuid as to prevent its accommodation to the figure
and arrangement of density appropriate to its rotation. In an interesting dis-

cussion on subaerial denudation, Croll has concluded that nearly one mile may
have been worn off the equator during the past 12,000,000 years, if the rate of

denudation all along the equator be equal to that of the basin of the Ganges.^
^Now, since the equatorial protuberance of the earth when the ellipticity is
                                                                              is

fourteen miles greater than when it is gi^, it follows that 170,000,000 years

Nowwould suffice to wear down the surface to the equilibrium figure.  let

these numbers be halved or largely reduced, and the conclusion remains that

denudation would suffice to obliterate external evidence of some early excess of

ellipticity.

     If such external evidence be gone,'' we must rely on the incompatibility of the
known value of the precessional constant with an ellipticity of internal strata of

equal density greater than that appropriate to the actual ellipticity of the surface.
Might there not be a considerable excess of internal ellipticity without our being
cognisant of the fact astronomically ?

     And, further, have we any right to feel so confident of the internal structure of

the earth as to be able to allege that the earth would not through its whole mass
adjust itself almost completely to the equilibrium figure ?

     Tresca has shown in his admirable memoirs on the flow of solids that when the
stresses rise above a certain value the solid becomes plastic, and is brought into
what he calls the state of fluidity. I do not know, however, that he determined at
what stage the flow ceases when the stresses are gradually diminished. It seems

probable, at least, that flow will continue with smaller stresses than were initially

the equatorial half of that hemisphere, viz. between 0° and 30° N. lat. ; and that it^ths
of the land in the S. hemisphere is in the equatorial half of that hemisphere"viz.

necessary to start it. But if this is so, then, when the earth has come to depart

both internally and externally from the equilibrium condition a flow of solid will

set in, and will continue until a near approach to the equilibrium condition is

attained.

'When we consider the abundant geological evidence of the plasticity of rock,

and of the repeated elevation and subsidence of large areas on the earth's surface,

this view appears to me more probable than Sir William Thomson's.
    On the whole, then, I can neither feel the cogency of the argument from tidal

friction itself, nor, accepting it, can I place any reliance on the limits which it

assigns to geological history.

The second argument concerning geological tune is derived from the secular

cooling of the earth.

   We know in round numbers the rate of increase of temperature, or temperatura

gradient, in borings and mines, and the conductivity of rock. These data enable

us to compute how long ago the surface must have had the temperature of melting

rock, and when it must have been too hot for vegetable and animal life.

Sir William Thomson, in his celebrated essay on this subject,^ concludes from

this argument that ' for the last 96,000,000 years the rate of increase of tempera-

ture underground has gradually diminished from about ith to about ^th of a

degree Fahrenheit per foot. ... Is not this, on the whole, in harmony with geo-

logical evidence, rightly interpreted ? Do not the vast masses of basalt, the general

appearances of mountain ranges, the violent distortions and fractm-es of strata, the

great 2}revalence of metamorpliic action (which must have taken place at depths of

not many miles, if so much), all agi-ee in demonstrating that the rate of increase of

temperature downwards must have been much more rapid, and in rendering it

probable that volcanic energy, earthquake shocks, and every kind of so-called

plutonic action, have beeu, on the whole, more abundantly and violently operative

in geological antiquity than in the present age ? '

Now, while I entirely agree with the general conclusion of Sir William Thom-

son, it is not unimportant to indicate a possible flaw in the argument. This flaw

will only be acknowledged as possible by those who agree with the previous criti-

cism on the argument from tidal friction.

The present argument as to the date of the consolidation of the earth reposes on

the hypothesis that the earth is simply a cooling globe, and there are reasons why

this may not be the case. The solidification of the earth probably began from the

Nowmiddle and spread to the surface.       is it not possible, if not probable, that

after a firm crust had been formed, the upper portion still retained some degree of

Tiscosity ? If the interior be viscous, some tidal oscillations must take place in it,

and, these being subject to friction, heat must be generated in the viscous portion

moreover the diurnal rotation of the earth must be retarded. Some years ago, in a

paper on the tides of a spheroid, viscous throughout the whole mass,- 1 estimated the

amount and distribution of the heat generated, whilst the planet's rotation is being

retarded and the satellite's distance is being increased. It then appeared that on

that hypothesis the distribution of the heat must be such that it would only be

possible to attribute a very small part of the observed temperature gradient to such

a cause. Now, with a more probable internal constitution for the earth in early

times, the result might be very difierent. Suppose, in fact, that it is only those

strata which are within some hundreds of miles of the surface which are viscous,

whilst the central portion is rigid. Then, when tidal friction does its work the
same amount of heat is generated as on the hypothesis of the viscosity of the whole

planet, but instead of being distributed throughout the whole mass, and principally

towards the middle, it is now to be found in the more superficial layers.

    In my paper it is shown that with Thomson's data for the conductivity of rock

and the temperature gradient, the annual loss of heat by the earth is one 260

millionth part of the earth's kinetic energy of rotation.

   DAlso, if by tidal friction the day is reduced from D^ hours to hours, and the

nmoon's distance augmented from n,, to earth's radii, the energy which has been

converted into heat in the process is

----iji) 1 8-84 ^_- -- --j times the earth's kinetic energy of rotation.

     From these data it results that the heat generated in the lengthening of the

day from twenty-three to twenty-four hours is equal to the amount of heat lost by

the earth, at its present rate of loss, in 23,000,000 years.

    Now if this amount of heat, or any sensible fraction of it, was actually

generated within a few hundred miles of the earth's surface, the temperature

gradient in the earth must be largely due to it, instead of to the primitive heat of

the mass.

Such an hypothesis precludes the assumption that the earth is simply a cooling

mass, and would greatly prolong the possible extension of geological time. It

must be observed that this view is not acceptable unless we admit that the earth
can adjust itself to the equilibrium figure adapted to its rotation.'

     It seems also worthy of suggestion that our data for the average gradient of

temperature may be somewhat fallacious. Kecent observations^ show that the

lower stratum of the ocean is occupied by water at near the freezing temperature,

whilst the mean annual temperature of the earth's surface, where the borings have

"been made, must be at least 30° higher. It does not then seem impossible that
the mean temperature gradient for the whole earth should differ sensibly from the
mean gradient in the borings already made.

The foregoing remarks have not been made with a view of showing Sir William

Thomson's argument from the cooling of the earth to be erroneous, but rather to

maintain the scientific justice of assigning hmits of uncertainty at the very least

as wide as those given by him. Professor Tait =" cuts the limit down to 10,000,000

                            ;

justify us in accepting such a narrowing of the conclusion.

The third line of argument by which a superior limit is sought for the age

of the solar system appears by far the strongest. This argument depends on the
amoimt of radiant energy which can have been given out by the sun.

     The amount of work done in the concentration of the sun from a condition of
infinite dispersion may be computed with some accuracy, and we have at least a

--rough idea of the rate of the sun's radiation. From these data Sir William

Thomson concludes : *

      ' It seems, therefore, on the whole most probable that the sun has not illu-
minated the earth for 100,000,000 years, and almost certain that he has not done

so for 500,000,000 years. As for the future, we may say, with equal certainty,

that inhabitants of the earth cannot continue to enjoy the light and heat essential

to their life for many million years longer unless sources now unknown to us are

prepared in the great storehouse of creation.'

     This result is based on the value assigned by Pouillet and Herschel to the
sun's radiation. Langley has recently made a fresh determination, which exceeds

Pouillet's in the proportion of eight to five.^ With Langley's value Thomson's

estimate of time would have to be reduced by the factor five-eighths.

     In considering these three arguments I have adduced some reasons against

     ' Since the meeting of the Association Sir William Thomson has expressed to me

his absolute conviction that, with any reasonable hypothesis as to the degree of
viscosity of the more superficial layers, and as to the activity of tidal friction, the
disturbance of temperature gradient through internal generation of heat must be
quite infinitesimal.

history showing continuity of life, must be limited within some such period of past

time as 100,000,000 years.'

avail, yet it seems as likely that meteorology and geology will pass the word of
command to cosmical physics as the converse.

    At present our knowledge of a definite limit to geological time has so little
precision that we should do wrong to summarily reject any theories which appear

to demand longer periods of time than those which now appear allowable.

In each branch of science hypothesis forms the nucleus for the aggregation of

observation, and as long as facts are assimilated and co-ordinated we ought to

follow our theory. Thus even if there be some inconsistencies with a neighbouring

science we may be justified in still holding to a theory, in the hope that further

knowledge may enable us to remove the difficulties. There is no criterion as to

what degree of inconsistency should compel us to give up a theory, and it should

be borne in mind that many views have been utterly condemned when later

knowledge has only shown us that we were in them only seeing the truth from

another side.

                  By Professor A. W. RiJCKER, M.A., F.B.8.

     Let a mass of liquid or a liquid film be attached to two equal circular rings,,
the planes of which are perpendicular to the line joining their centres.

     It will form a surface of revolution, the equation of which is, according to Beer,

F Ewhere and are elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds respectively, the

amplitude being ^, and the modulus k= \/a'--/3^/a = siu 6.

     If 6 be conceived as increasing from 0, when it is in the first quadrant the

figure will be an unduloid lying between the cylinder and the sphere, in the second
quadrant a nodoid, the limits of which are the sphere and a circle. In the third
and fourth quadrants the figure will be dice-box-shaped with a contraction in the
middle, being a nodoid in the third and an unduloid in the fourth quadrant. The
one passes into the other through the catenoid.

     If DOW we suppose the rings to be at a fixed distance apart and the volume of

the surface to be altered, the curvature will change, and the direction of the change
will depend on the diameter and distance apart of the rings, and on the magnitude

of the maximum or minimum ordinate (the principal ordinate), which lies halfway

between them. The object of the paper is to investigate the general relation be-
tween these quantities when the mean curvature is a maximum or minimum, if the
changes in the form of the film take place subject to the conditions that the

diameter and distance of the rings are constant.

     It has been recently shown by Professor Remold and the author that, if these

conditions hold,

             E(a«E - /3'F + a^Ai cot ^i)8a + a-(F - + Aj tan =(/)i)8/3 0,

where      is the upper limit of the integrals and A, = \/ 1 - sin^ 6 sin^ (p^.
          (f)^

Writing this in the form ASa + BS^ = 0, it is proved that the curvature has in
A Bgeneral a critical value when -- = ; so that

           2E -F(l + cos' 6) + 2Ai cot 2^^ =

is a condition which must be satisfied by 6 and (f)^.

     To find values of ^j corresponding to given values of 6 the equation must be
solved by trial ; but it is proved that, if a pair of corresponding values is given when

6 lies (say) in the first quadrant, the values of <pi can be at once found whicb

correspond to -tt ^, tt + ^, and 2Tr--6.

    The values of cp^ corresponding to 6 and --tt 5 are equal, and, if <^j be the value

corresponding to tt + ^ and -^ir 6, it is given by the equation

                     -- =tan (/>! tan (tt <^j)         sec 6.

    By means of these equations a curve can be drawn, showing the relations between

<^i and 6, and thence are found the values otpjY, Xjp and X/Y, where aY, 2X, and
2p are the diameter and distance of the rings and the magnitude of the principal

diameter.

    If we now conceive the two rings gradually to approach or recede from each

other, and the principal diameter to be altered so that the condition of critical
curvature is always fulfilled, it is proved that the changes in its form would be as

follows :

Beginning with the cylinder the distance of the rings is (as has been shown

by Maxwell, Art. Capillarity, ' Enc. Brit.') half their circumference. As the

diameter increases the rings move apart, and the distance between them is a

maximum when 6 = 64-2°, being 17 per cent, greater than in the case of the cylinder.

When 6 = 90°, the figure is a sphere, and the distance between the rings is about

4 per cent, less than in the case of the cylinder. The sphere has a larger diameter

than any other figure of critical curvature. The surface next becomes a nodoid,

and the distance between the rings diminishes till when 6 = 180° they touch, and

thus the surface reduces to a circle. In the next quadrant the rings separate, but

the figure is now dice-box-shaped, and the pressure exerted by the film is out-

wards. When 6 = 270°, the figure is the cateuoid. The principal ordinate is then

less than that of any other figure of critical curvature, and the radius of the rings

is a mean proportion between this minimum ordinate and the maximum which

was attained in the case of the sphere. The same relation holds between the

principal ordinates of any two figures which correspond to values of which differ

by 180°. In the fourth quadrant the figure becomes an unduloid, the pressure is

inwards, the rings continue to separate, and the ratio of the distance between the

rings to the principal ordinate is a maximum when 6 = 298°.

In the paper tables  and  curves  are  given     to    illustrate  the  ' march                                       of these

functions.

     To secure continuity the problem is discussed without reference to the question

as to whether the surfaces are in stable equilibrium.

    In conclusion it is shown that by means of the curves we can solve a number of
problems with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes. Thus, if any two of the

three quantities, the diameter of the rings, the distance between them, and the
diameter of the surface of critical curvature, are given, the third can be found.

 4. A Mercurial Air-pump. By J. T. Bottomlet, M.A., F.B.8.E.

The primary object of the pump described in this paper is the removal of the
520 BEPOKT-- 1886.

mercury whicli works the pump from contact with the external atmosphere. When

the Sprengel pump is used for producing and maintaining a nearly complete vacuum
during a course of experimenting which lasts over a good many days or weeks, it is
found that the mercury running down through the pump and discharging into the

open air takes up minute quantities of air, which it carries with it in ^ state of very
intimate mixture. This intimately mixed air the mercury does not lose in passing

through the air-traps, hut the air is deposited along the walls of the pump head,
and collects into bubhles which are at first exceedingly minute, and gradually in-

crease to a sensible size. These bubbles ultimately escape from contact with the
glass and deteriorate the vacuum.

     The pump described consists of a combination of a single fall Sprengel with a

Geisler pump, and in addition the movable reservoir is furnished with an air-tight
stopcock, by means of which the air is got rid of from that reservoir and prevented
from re-entering.

     In using the pump it is first worked as an ordinary Geisler pump till nearly all
the air of the enclosure to be exhausted has been removed. In this way advantage
is taken of the comparatively great speed of the Geisler pump. When a good

exhaustion has been obtained the stopcocks and the lift of the movable reservoir

--are so managed that the pump is thereafter used as a Sprengel the small remain-

ing traces of air being pumped by the Sprengel into the exhausted chamber of the
Geisler ; and when a sufficient quantity of air has been collected in this chamber
it can be removed by a single Geisler operation.

    5. On the Cutting of Polarising Prisms. Sy Professor Silvanus P.

                                              Thompson, D.Sc.

     The author described a method of cutting Nicol prisms analogous to that
communicated in 1885, the end faces being inclined at 70° to a natural face of
the crystal, and having a line of mutual intersection at right angles to the natural
long edges. The author also described a new method devised by Mr. Ahrens of
cutting the triple polarising prism described by the author at the Aberdeen meeting.
The new method of cutting effects a great saving of spar, and depends upon finding
a certain characteristic plane in the crystal which defines the external longitudinal

faces of the prisms.

 6. On a Varying Gylindrical Lens. By Tempest Andekson, M.D., B.Sc.

   A cylindrical lens of continuously varying power lias long been a desideratum,

and one was constructed and described by Professor Stokes, Pres. R.S., at page 10

of the Report of the British Association for 1849. He points out that

     ' If two piano-cylindrical lenses of equal radius, one concave and the other
convex, be fixed one in the lid and the other in the body of a small round box with
a hole in the top and bottom, so as to be as nearly as possible in contact, the lenses
will neutralise one another wlien the axes of the surfaces are parallel, and by merely

turning the lid round an astigmatic lens may be formed, of a power varying con-

tinuously from zero to twice the astigmatic power of either lens.'
      This very beautiful optical contrivance has the disadvantage that the refraction

varies from zero in both du-ections at once, the refraction at any given position of
the lenses being positive in one meridian, and negative or concave to an equal degree
in a meridian at right angles to the first ; moreover, there is no fixed axis in which
the refraction is either zero or any other constant amount. It has in consequence
never come into extensive use in the determination of the degree of astigmatism.

     The author has planned a cylindrical lens in which the axis remains constant in
direction and amount of refraction, while the refraction in the meridian at right

 angles to this varies continuously.

    A cone may be regarded as a succession of cylinders of different diameters

graduating into one another by exceedingly small steps, so that if a short enough

portion be considered, its curvature at any point may be regarded as cylindrical.

    A lens with one side plane and the other ground on a conical tool is therefore
              TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                       521

a concave cylindrical lens varying in concavity at different parts according to the

·diameter of the cone at the corresponding part. Two such lenses mounted with

axes parallel and with curvatures varying in opposite directions produce a com-
pound cylindrical lens whose refraction in the direction of the axes is zero, and
whose refraction in the meridian at right angles to this is at any point the sum of
the refractions of the two lenses. This sum is nearly constant for a considerable
distance along the axis so long as the same position of the lenses is maintained.
If the lenses be slid one over the other in the direction of their axes, this sum

changes, and we have a varying cylindrical lens. The lens is graduated by marking
on the frame the relative position of the lenses when cylindrical lenses of known

power are neutralised.
     It was found by a practical optician to be impossible to work glasses on a cone

of large diameter, consequently a conical tool was constructed with an angle of
45° at the apex, and 8 inches diameter at the base,

   A glass about 4 inches long was ground on the sides of this near the base, and

as the resulting lens if ground on plane glass would have been too concave for most

purposes, the outer side of the glass was previously ground to a convex cylindrical

·curve, and its axis applied parallel to the generating line of the cone in the plane

of the axis of the cone.

     The result was concavo-convex cylinders of varying power suitable for the

practical measurement of astigmatism.

    Lenses were exhibited varying from to -- 6DCy, and from to + 6DCy.

            7. On the Latv of the Propagation of Light.
By Professor J. H. Potnting, M.A., and B. F. J. Love, B.A.

     The authors describe a new method of proving that the intensity of illumina-
tion of a screen varies inversely as the square of the distance from the source. The
same experimental arrangement with slight modification allows us also to prove the

--law of absorption of light a law which we believe has hitherto been assumed
--without veritication by experiment. The arrangement is as follows : Two illumi-

nating surfaces at different distances are viewed through a narrow blackened tube,
each surface occupying half the field of view. The illuminating powers of the two

surfaces are adjusted till for a given distance of the tube they appear equally

"bright. They then appear equally bright for any other distance of the tube.
Tills was verified both for air and for an absorbing medium consisting of a dilute

alkaline solution of phenol-phthalein, which coloured the transmitted light violet.

    From this it can be shown that if I be the intensity of illumination of a screen

at distance 1 from the source, the Ulumination at a distance x is I e~"^'^""   When

Whenc = the medium is transparent.  c differs from 0, e-'^ is the ' coefB.cient of

absorption.'

8. On a new form of Current-weigher for the Absolute Determination of the
         Strength of an Electric Current. By Professor James Bltth.

The object of this paper is to describe a method of absolutely determining the

strength of an electric current by measuring in grammes' weight the electro-magnetic

force between two parallel circular circuits, each carrying the same current.

For convenience of calculation the circles have the same radius, and are placed

with their planes horizontal.
--AThe construction of the instrument is as follows :
                                                       delicate chemical balance

is provided, and the scale-pans replaced by two suspended coils of wire. Each of

these is made of a single turn of insulated copper wire (No. 16 about) fixed in a

groove round the edge of an annular disc of glass or brass of suitable diameter.

The disc is made as thin and light as possible consistent with perfect rigidity. By

means of two vertical pillars of brass this aunulus is attached to a rigid cross-bar

of dry wood or vulcanite, in the middle of which is placed a hook for suspending
--522 EEPOET 1886.

the whole from one end of the balance-beam. On each side of the hook, and

equally distant from it, two slender rods of brass are screwed into the wooden bar,,
which support two small platinum cups for holding mercury or dilute acid. The

position of these cups is so adjusted that when the whole hangs freely the cups are

in Une with the terminal knife-edge of the balance-beam, and have their edges just

slightly above its level. The free ends of the insulated wire surrounding the disc,

after being firmly tied together for a considerable length and suitably bent, are

soldered to the brass supports of the platinum cups, which thus serve as electrodes
Aby means of which a current may be sent through the suspended coil.
                                                                      precisely

similar coil is suspended from the other end of the balance-beam.

   We now come to the arrangement by means of which a current is led through

the suspended coils, so as to interfere as little as possible with the sensibility of the

--Anbalance. This constitutes the essential peculiarity of the instrument, and is effectedl
in the following way:   insulated copper vnre, having its ends tipped with

short lengths of platinum, is run along the lower edge of the beam, and is firmly

lashed to it by well-rosined silk thread. The ends of this wire, bent twice at right

angles, are so placed that their platinum tips dip vertically into one of each pair_ of

the platinum cups which are attached to the vertical rods of the suspended coils.

From the other cup of each pair proceed two similarly tipped copper wires, which

run along the upper edge of the beam, and are also firmly tied to it. These wires,

however, only proceed as far as the middle of the beam, where they are bent, first

outwards, one on each side of the beam, at right angles to it, and then downwards,

so that the platinum tips are vertical. The latter dip into two platinum cups

attached to two vertical rods, which spring from the base-board of the balance.

These rods are placed at equal distances on each side of the beam, and are of such

length that the platinum cups are in line with the central knife-edge of the beam,

and have their edges just a little above its level. There are thus in all six cups and
six dipping wires. Three of these are in line on one side of the beam, and three on

the other. Also the line joining the points of each pair of dipping wires is made to

coincide with the corresponding knife-edge ; and, further, the edges of the cups are

all in the same plane when the balance is in equilibrium.

From this it wiU be obvious that any motion of the beam in the act of weighing-

causes only a very slight motion of the platinum wires, which dip into the fluid

contained in the cups. The resistance, due to the viscosity of the fluid, is thus very

small, even in the case of mercury, and much smaller when dilute acid is used.

In point of fact, the diminution of sensibility due to this cause is less than in the

case of determining the specific gravity of solids by weighing in water in the

ordinary way. With clean mercury it is quite easy to weigh accurately to a

milligramme.

The fluxed coils, constituting two pairs, have the same diameter as the suspended

coils, and, like them, are made of single turns of insulated wire wound round the

edges of circular discs of glass or brass. The discs of each pair are fixed, at the

requisite distance apart, to a cylindrical block of wood, so as to have their planes

exactly parallel and their centres in the same straight line. To ensure this they

are turned up and finished on the same cylindrical block on which they are finally

Whento rest.  in position they are so placed that, when the balance is in equi-

librium, each suspended coil hangs perfectly free to move with its plane horizontal

and exactly midway between a pair of fixed coils. For this purpose, as will be

seen, it is necessary that two large holes be drilled in the upper disc of each pair, so

as to allow the brass pillars of the corresponding annular disc to pass freely through.

When the connections are made, the current is led through the entire apparatus in

such a way that, while the electro -magnetic force acting on the one suspended coil

causes it to descend, the electro-magnetic force acting upon the other causes it to

ascend. The total force tending to disturb the equilibrium of the balance is thus

exactly four times that due to an equal current circulating in two parallel circles of

the same diameter and with their planes at the same distance apart. The current-

strength is estimated from the number of grammes required to restore the balance

to equilibrimn, the weights being placed in small scale-pans attached to the movable

part of the apparatus.

     The electro-magTietic force between each fixed and the corresponding suspended
coil is calculated from the formulae given by Clerk Maxwell (vol. ii. p. 308),

     This gives for 1 ampere a force = -04818 gramme weight.

      Besides the one exhibited I have constructed several modifications of the in-
strument, only one of which, however, need be particularly mentioned. In it
both the fixed and movable coils are replaced by flat spirals of wire, each of eleven
turns. Here the practical construction is more difficult, and the calculation of the
constant somewhat more laborious, unless one is content with merely integrating
over the area of both the fixed and suspended spirals. This is, I think, however,

hardly legitimate, at least with thickish wires, as we thereby suppose that electricity

is circulating in the insulating spaces between the wires as well as in the wires them-
selves. To avoid this I have actually calculated the force exerted by each one of
the coils of the fixed spiral upon each coil of the suspended spiral. This entails
great labour, as the elliptic integrals have to be calculated for values of the modulus
difiering very slightly from each other. The labour, however, is worth the taking,

as the attractive or repulsive force between two flat spirals is so much greater than
that between two simple circles.

9. On the Proof hy Cavendishes Method that Electrical Action varies inversely
    as the Square of the Distance. By Professor J. H. Potnting, M.A.

     The proof of the law of electrical action depending on the fact that
there is no electrification within a charged conductor was first given by
Cavendish. His proof was made more general by Laplace, who has been
followed by other writers, including Maxwell. Maxwell and MacAlister
have also verified the experimental fact, repeating an investigation of Cavendish

--only recently published in Maxwell's edition of the Cavendish papers. The proof

may be analysed in the following way: Take the case of a uniformly charged
sphere. The action at a point within it may be considered as the resultant

of the actions of the pairs of sections of the surface by all the elementary cones,.
with the point as vertex. If, then, the resultant action is zero for all points and
for all sizes of the sphere, it follows that the action of the pair of sections by each
elementary cone is zero ; and, since the sections of the surfaces are directly as the
squares of the distances, the two sections neutralising each other, the force per
unit area must be inversely as the squares of the distances. There appear to be two
objections to this proof. (1) That it takes no account of the always existing oppo-
site charges. A\1ien the sphere, for instance, is positively charged, an equal and
opposite negative charge is on the walls of the room, and the action of this should
be considered. Probably this objection could be removed. (2) There is a solution
.524                            BEPORT-- 1886.

--still simpler than the inverse square law viz., that no element of the surface has

any action within the closed conductor. If we suppose that a conductor is a com-

plete screen to electrical action, then, whatever the law of the force exerted across
an insulator, there will he no action within the conductor. In any null proof it is
not sufficient merely to show that there is no action in the null arrangement, but it
is also necessary to show that on disturbing- the null arrangement some action is
manifested. Now, in the case here considered it is impossible to obtain any action

within the conductor in any statical arrangement ; it is only during changes of the

system while charging or discharging that we can get a disturbance of the null
arrangement. But here new phenomena come in, for we have currents, and there-

fore electro-magnetic action. But, even disregarding the different kind of action

occurring, the only experiment which I know of on this point was that of Faraday
with his electrified cube. While the most ^dolent charges and discharges were
taking place on the outside of the cube, so that the null arrangement was probably

disturbed, he found no action on his electroscope within. Possibly the actions were
alternating, and so rapid that no electroscope of ordinary construction would reveal
them. But he himself went into the cube, and he would probably be sensitive to

rapidly alternating electromotive forces. It appears to me, then, that we cannot
accept this proof, and must fall back upon the more direct proof of Coulomb. I do
not know whether Maxwell was aware of this objection ; but it is worthy of note

that in the remarkable fragment published since his death, as ' An Elementary

Treatise on Electricity,' he returned to Coulomb's proof, and was apparently
building up the mathematical theory of electricity in a way quite different from

that followed in his larger work.

10. On the Electrolysis of Silver and Copper, and its Application to the
   Standardising of Electric Current- and Fotential-Meters. By Thosias

    Gray, B.Sc, F.R.S.E.^

This paper contained an account of a large number of experiments on the electro-

lysis of silver and copper, and its application to the standardising of electrical cur-

rent- and potential-meters which have been made during the past year in the

Physical Laboratory of Glasgow University. It forms a summary of the reports

made from time to time to Sir William Thomson on this subject.

In the earlier experiments pure silver sheet and solutions of pure silver nitrate

were used for the electrolytic cells. The results obtained with these cells confirmed

those obtained by Kohlrausch, Lord Rayleigh, and other observers as to the great

accin-acy obtainable with silver, and also as to the nature of the deposit and the

care required in the manipulation of the experiment. The cathode plate consisted

in almost all cases of a sheet of pure silver, placed, with its plane vertical, between

two parallel sheets of the same metal. In a few experiments a platinum bowl was
used very much in the same manner as that described by Lord Rayleigh in his

paper to the Royal Society, but generally the plates of sheet silver were preferred.

The mode of treating the plates both before and after the deposit was upon them

is fully described, and it is pointed out that when the plate is made thoroughly

clean, and its size properly proportioned to the strength of the current to be

measured, the deposit is finely crystalline, and adheres very firmly to the plate. The

~best results were obtained when the current density at the cathode is between

and 555 of an ampere per square centimetre of the surface on which the deposit is

taking place, the solution being supposed to contain five per cent, of silver nitrate.

It is also pointed out that the loss of silver from the anode can be used satisfactorily

as a check on the amount of sUver deposited on the cathode, but that the current

~density at the anode must be considerably smaller than that which will give good
deposits on the cathode. About  of an ampere per square centimetre is stated

.as the maximum current density at the anode which can be safely used if the loss

Aof silver is to be weighed. somewhat greater current density may be used at the

cathode if the strength of the solution be increased, but the deposit is more roughly

crystalline and less adherent. The current density cannot he increased in nearly
the same proportion as the increase in the amount of silver nitrate in the solution,
and hence when sheet silver cathodes are used the most economical and most satis--
factory method is to use weak solutions and large plates. Rolled silver gives

imsatisfactory results until the outside skin has been removed by use, polishing, or

scraping.

     The later experiments described in the paper refer for the most part to copper,
and include experiments on the uncertainty likely to arise from oxidation of the

plate, or current density ; and of the addition of acid to the solution. It was found

that there is no difficulty in washing and drying a plate without oxidising it

sensibly, and methods are described for doing this. The loss of weight by corrosion

in the liquid introduces an error which is nearly proportional to the surface of the

plate exposed, and judging from Dr. Gore's experiments it is also no doubt influ-

enced by the temperature, if that be not constant ; but the effect of temperature was

not investigated. The amount of corrosion is also influenced to some extent by the

density of the solution, and it appears to be least when the density is between 1-15'

and 1-10. It is concluded that in the use of copper for standardising purposes the
current density and the density of the solution must be known, and the proper

correction made on the electro-chemical equivalent to suit the particular circum-

stances. If this be attended to, copper is capable of giving residts within a tenth

per cent, of accuracy, and is much more easily managed than silver. Silver is-

preferable for the highest accuracy, but the accuracy which copper is capable of
giving is easily obtained, and it seems sufficient for most practical purposes.

     Experiments on the ratio of the electro-chemical equivalent of copper to that

of silver were also made, and led to the conclusion that when the proper cor-
rection for corrosion in the liquid is made the ratio is very nearly 0"2942, which,

on the assumption of ·00II18 as the mass in grammes of the silver deposited by

one coulomb of electricity, gives for the corresponding number for copper

·0003290.

"When a nearly saturated solution of copper sulphate is used, and a current

density of 5^5 of an ampere per square centimetre of the cathode, the amount of
copper deposited by a coulomb of electricity is ·0003287 gramme.

It is pointed out that if the solution does not contain free acid there is a danger

of obtaining too great an increase of weight, due apparently to the oxidation of the

copper as it is being deposited. The same remark as that made above with regard

to the silver anodes applies to the copper anodes if they are to be weighed. If the

copper anodes are so small as to give a current density exceeding about the fortieth

of an ampere per square centimetre the current is liable to stop almost completely,-

even when an electromotive force of as much as 25 volts is used to produce it

this is apparently due to excessive resistance at the surface of the anode. After a
few minutes the current will again resume nearly its old strength, and gases will

be given off freely at the anodes. These gases are readily dissolved by the liquid,

--and generally as the final result the gain and loss of copper do not differ very

greatly--although they always do differ from those obtained when no gases are

given off.

Lastly, the arrangements of one of the standardising tables in Sir William

Thomson's laboratory are illustrated, and the different pieces of apparatus and the

mode of using them described.

11. Description of a new Calorimeter for lecture purposes. By T. J. Bakee.

     The instrument consists of two exactly similar metallic air-thermometers
mounted aide by side with their U-shaped thermometer-tubes adjacent, so that
their indications can be easily compared with each other.

     The air-vessel of each thermometer contains a cylindrical well, in which the
substance to be experimented with is immersed. Each well is provided with a
discharging tube furnished with a stopcock. The scale common to both ther-

4. On Hering^s and Young's Theories of Colour-vision. By John Tennant.

     The author briefly pointed out that, for the purposes of experiments in colour-
mixture, Hering's theory, like Young's, has only three independent variables, and
leads to the same general results.

     The author then considered the subject of simultaneous contrast, and showed
that the only possibility of a deception of the judgment lies in the fallibiUty of the
memory. Hence if two patches of the same grey (say) be seen simultaneously
they ought, according to the psychological explanation, to appear the same what-
ever their surroundings. This he showed, by an experiment with discs, is not the
case. Hence simultaneous contrast is a real and not an illusory eiFect, and demands

a physiological explanation.

     The author, however, pointed out that there may be illusions of judgment in

these cases owing to our habit of attributing permanence to local colour, and that

this may account for some of the experiments which have been adduced in favour

of the psychological explanation.

   --The author then considered some of the difficulties of Hering'a theory,

noticing

     1. That pure red and green are not complementary, as they should be.

   A2. difficulty raised by Rood as to the relative intensity of a compound grey

and its components.
     Lastly, the author considered the subject of changes of hue under varying

intensity of light. He showed that if we assume that the functional processes of

assimilation and dissimilation supposed by Hering draw their materials from, and
contribute them to, a common source in the blood, it is natural to suppose that
they are not wholly independent.

    He supposed yellow and green to correspond to the dissimilating blue, and red
to the assimilating processes in their respective substances. He further supposed
the red-green substance to be the most sensitive to drafts upon the common stock.

These suppositions are found not only to explain the variations of hue with varying

intensity of light, but also that tendency of colours when mixed with white light

towards reddish violet, which has received no explanation from current theories.
     The author, without accepting Hering's theory as established truth, thought it

the best working hypothesis in the immediate future.

 A8. Note on some Observations of the Loss which Light suffers in passing

                 through Glass. By Sir John Conrot, Bart., M.A.

     The object of the experiments was to determine the percentage of light which
passed through plates of glass of the same kind hut of different thickness. The
amount reflected from the first surface would he the same in all cases, and, assimiing,
as is usually done, that the same percentage of the incident light is reflected

--from both surfaces, the amount reflected from the second surface would be nearly

the same the diiference in the amount of light which reached the second surface,
owing to the increased absorption in the thicker plates, being but slight. It was
therefore thought that this method would aiford a means of determining not only
the amount reflected, but also the amount absorbed, without assuming the truth of

the formulse for reflection.

    A photometer, similar to that described in Pickering's ' Physical Manipulation '

(pt. i. p. 132), was used for most of the observations ; but measurements were also
made with a polarising photometer, and also with another arrangement, in which of
two white surfaces illuminated by the same lamp, one was seen directly, and the
other through the glass. If atmospheric absorption be neglected, which at such
distances is of course insensible, the apparent brightness of an illimiinated surface
does not vary with the distance ; no correction was therefore needed with this
instrument for the optical shortening of the path of the ray, owing to the refrac-
tive power of the glass, which had to be allowed for in the experiments made with

the first-mentioned photometer.

     The experiments were made with plates of Messrs. Chance's lighthouse glass,
Tarying in thickness from 6'5 to 24 millimetres, and with Field's ordinary dense
flint, from 7 to 91'3mm. thick. "Vk'^ith Messrs. Chance's glass the transmitted
light ranged from 91'50 to 87-16 per cent., and with the flint-glass from 88-83 to

80-74 per cent.

     The experiments are incomplete, and are being continued.

          7. The peculiar Sunrise- Shadows of Adam's Teak in Ceylon.

                  By the Hon. Ralph Abeeceomby, F.R.Met.Soc.

   A great peculiarity has been noticed by many travellers about the shadow of

Adam's Peak at sunrise. The shadow, instead of lying flat on the ground, appears
to rise up like a veil in front of the spectator, and then suddenly to fall down to its
proper level. Various theories have been propounded to account for this, and it
has usually been supposed to be due to a sort of mirage. The author, in the course
of a meteorological tour round the world, spent a night on the top of the peak,
7,352 feet above the sea, and obtained unmistakable evidence that the appearance
is due to light wreaths of thin morning mist being driven past the western side of
the mountain by the prevaihng north-east monsoon up a neighbouring gorge. The
shadow is caught by the mist at a higher level than the earth, and then falls to its
own plane on the ground as the condensed vapour moves on. The appearance is
peculiar to Adam's Peak ; for the proper combination of a high isolated pyramid, a
prevailing wind, and a valley to direct suitable mist at a proper height on the

western side of a mountain, is only rarely met with. Any idea that the appear-

ance could be caused by mirage is completely disproved by the author's thermo-

metric observations.

     Another curious but totally distinct shadow efifect is sometimes seen from
Adam's Peak just before and at the moment of sunrise. The shadow of the base
of the peak stretches along the land to the horizon, and then the shadow of the
summit appears to rise up and stand against the sky. The first part seems to be
the natural shadow lying on the ground, and the sky part to be simply the ordinary
earth shadow of twilight, so clearly projected against the sky as to show mountainous
irregularities of the earth's surface. As the sim rises the shadow of the summit
against the sky gradually sinks to the horizon, and then the ordinary shadow
steadily grows shorter as the sun gets higher in the usual maimer.

     The author found a similar effect only at sunset on Pike's Peak, Colorado.
Towards sunset the shadow creeps along the prairie to the horizon, and then begins
to rise in the sky till the sun has j ust gone down, and the anticrepuscular shadow

rises too high to catch the outline of the Peak.

     This rise is evidently due not to the conduction of heat nor to the penetration of
solar radiation, but to some drainage or oozing causing mixture. This supposition
seems necessary also to explain the behaviour of Loch Katrine in March. Drainage

en masse appears to occur chiefly in winter and spring, not in summer when the
river water and the lake surface water are much warmer than the deep water of

the lake.

     The mean temperature of Loch Katrine probably has a greater range than that
of Loch Lomond.

     The shallower parts of the lakes resemble the deep parts as to uniformity of
temperature up tOl March. But their yearly range is greater. In both lakes the
mean temperature becomes unifonn along the whole length about April 4.

     To groups III. and IV. analogues are found in a deep and a shallow basin of
L/Och Lomond, in both of which the bottom temperature rose between April and
June. From this it is inferred that land-influences, especially drainage en masse,

produce most of the effect noticed in III. and IV.

     The great rise in the North Channel and southern plateau is evidently due to a

warm oceanic current.
     The rise in temperature in group II. is due to the incoming of warm water

from without. As the water between 30 and 75 fathoms Ln this group is very vmi-

form in temperature, and as the south plateau is 25 fathoms below the surface, it

is supposed that the dense plateau water is carried into the open basins (group 11.),
and through convection mixes thoroughly the water below 30 fathoms there.

     Loch Goil is specially remarkable for its isolation and the small rise of bottom

--temperature 0'6° F. in two months.

     In Upper Loch Fyne a lenticular mass of water below 43*0° F. was found in
June to float between two warmer layers. Its greatest thickness, 30 fathoms,
was opposite Inverary. The bottom layer of 44'0° F. was not found to be in con-

nection with any equally warm layer either inside or outside of the loch.

  10. On the Temperature of the Biver Thurso.
By Hugh Robert Mill, D.'Sc, F.B.S.E., F.C.8.

Temperature has been observed since October 1885 twice daily at three points on

Athis the earliest salmon river in the north of Scotland.  shallow feeding lake nine-

teen miles from the sea, a point twelve miles from the sea, and one near the river

mouth, were selected for observations. At any given time the different parts of the

river preserved nearly the same temperature, varying slightly according to the

amount of sunshine and direction of the wind. The water cooled down from

October to January, and rose steadily in temperature as the season advanced.

Diurnal variation was least in January, and increased during each subsequent

month. The water, colder than the air at the time of observation during winter,

became warmer than it in summer. Shallow water responds more rapidly than air

to sun-heating and to chilling by radiation, a fact accountable for by its greater

absorbing and conducting powers. The sea was warmer than the river during

winter, and cooler than it during summer.

Most of the observations discussed were made by Mr. John Gunn, Dale, and

Mr, David Gunn, Thurso.

        11. On the Normal Forms of Clouds. By A. F. OsLEE, F.B.S.

     The object of this paper is to explain a theory with regard to the principles

that may have the greatest effect in producing the leading forms that clouds

assume.

    There are doubtless many additional influences that produce or ^roTpagatefurther
changes and variations in these forms, but which may be regarded as exceptional

or occasional, through frequent disturbances of the regular action herein specially
referred to. These remarks will therefore be confined to those influences and

conditions that may be regarded as constant and uniform in their effects within

certain limits. They are simple and recognised physical causes, varying only in
amoimt and intensity. They may be classed under three heads :

     1st. The diminished specific gravity of the air when more or less charged with

invisible vapour.

     2nd. The differential horizontal motion of the atmosphere.

                  ' Average temperature of first few fathoms above bottom.

3rd. The vertical motion in the atmosphere produced by the heat of the sun's

rays expanding the lower air.

The first of these is universally recognised as the initial cause of all clouds, pro-

ducing the cumulus, the firstborn or primary cloud. Its origin is so well under-

stood that it is unnecessary to enter on the subject further than is required to make

the remarks that follow more intelligible or complete.

Water, or moisture on the earth's surface, is evaporated by the sun's rays, and

enters the adjoining atmosphere. Vapour being specifically much lighter than the

air rises more or less rapidly, according to the rate of evaporation. In this climate

it has not to ascend to any great elevation before the upper portion arrives in a

colder and more attenuated condition of the atmosphere, where it becomes con-

densed, but where the lower and flatter portion of the condensed vapour with the

uncondensed invisible vapour immediately beneath terminates, it is not possible

to say, as a certain amount of the invisible vapour often extends to the earth's

surface. All that can with certainty be asserted is that a large mass or bed of

air charged with vapour must exist immediately beneath the newly formed cloud

or it could not have risen, an amount of floating power being necessary to lift the

condensed vapour or cumulus into a cold atmosphere, where it becomes visible. Yet

when it has been so raised the friction of the surfaces of the minute globules of water

of which it is composed render them unable to penetrate or force themselves down-

wards through the air below, or but very slowly. It is therefore only in first raising

or lifting up the condensed vapour that the floating power of the uncondensed or
invisible vapour beneath is required, and not in sustaining it when raised.

The invisible vapour, however, that has raised the cumulus or crowning head of

condensed vapour, will itself become visible should the atmosphere in which it is

travelling become reduced in temperature by any of the cooling influences to

which it may be exposed in its travels.

     The lower atmosphere being always charged with more or less vapour, the
cumulus can only be formed when there is so much vapour generated as to float

above condensation height.

Thus far a calm is presumed to prevail.

    When, however, the atmosphere is in motion its diflTerential horizontal move-
ment produces the first important modification in the foim of the cumulus, the

height or depth of the lower current varies, and in this climate will generally much

more than include the cumulus or condensation height in these latitudes. The

friction of the earth from the irregularities of its surface, and the denser state of

the lower air, causing it to flow less rapidly than that which is higher and more

attenuated, the upper portion of a cloud moves more rapidly than the lower, and

the cumulus shears over into a slanting position, and finally assumes the form of

the cumulo-stratus, and, however reduced in depth or thickness the cloud may be-

come by this flattening and somewhat attenuating process, the cumulus character,

Athough much diminished, is seldom if ever entirely obliterated.'  young cloud is

thus distinguishable from a long-travelled one ; indeed, one that has gone but a short

distance is detectable.

In this climate a large well-developed cumulus is seldom formed in the cold

season, but they are frequent in the summer. The majority of the clouds of the
first stage seen in this country are born in warmer latitudes, and come as travelled

cumuli, and show more or less the condition of the cumulo-stratus. They may be

enlarged or diminished from below, and also diminished or increased in number,

according to the heat or dryness or dampness they meet with during their passage

myover the surface of the earth or sea, but  object is not to treat of cloud genera-

tion but only to suggest reasons for certain leading forms they assume after birth.
     The invisible vapour, however, is subjected to the same changes of form due to

    > Those who have been much on the sea may probably remember occasionally

seeing a large flat brown cloud of smoke in the not remote distance, that has been
discharged by a previously passing steamer. This came forth from its funnel in great
rounded masses far removed from a flat form. The differential action is thus most
clearly and simply illustrated in the change that has taken place since its dis-

charge.

                                                                   HK2

differential motion pre^-ious to its becoming visible, but in this climate it soon

rises to the small height at which it is condensed.

     In summer, when the air is in sufficient motion, and especially in tropical
climates, it may travel long distances in its invisible or gaseous state, so that it

has time to become elongated by differential action, and when condensed it at once

assumes the form of the true stratus, in which case it is not seen as a cumulus or

cumulo-stratus at all. When it has risen to condensation height its lines more

approach the horizontal, are clearly defined, and the irregularities that would be

curves under more rapid decrease of temperature at an earlier stage are seen as

elongated lines extending to points as the pure stratus.^

   We will now leave the lower and denser atmosphere which contains the

cumulus, cumulo-stratus, and stratus, and proceed to examine the next stratum
Weabove.
          here find that a rather rapid change talies place to a drier atmosphere,

as was proved by Mr. Glaisher's investigations regarding the dew-point in his

balloon ascents. It is almost like starting from a new globe, and the vapour of this

drier air does not become visible until a higher altitude is attained, where this

diminished quantity arrives at its level of visibility. Here the vapour is less dis-

turbed and carried for great distances, so that at the region of this attenuated

vapour the cloud is generally level. The cumulus and cumulo-stratus have never

reached this elevation, and we have instead the cirro-cumulus and cirro-stratus.
The differential movement of the atmosphere, however, though much diminished, is

still an important agent in its results, and effects are produced that are not possible

in the more bulky and dense clouds of the lowest range. The clouds are, at this

higher level, in a highly attenuated condition, and if the globules of vapour are too

small in the lower clouds to break through the air that separates them, or even to

descend, they are still less capable of doing so at a greater altitude, where they must

be still more minute ; but though they can neither coalesce nor descend, they can be

spread out gently by the differential action, or if rapidly expanded from beneath,
broken up into groups, larger or smaller according to the depth and density of the

stratum.

Now, suppose the heat of the sun to have caused the lower atmosphere to

expand considerably, the effect of it will be to lift up and spread the whole of the

superincumbent air, and with it the thin upper stratum of cloud, further from the
earth. The result of the vertical elevation or secondary action will be to rend it

asurider---the uplifted air becomes more attenuated as it rises, and will spread out in

all directions, and the flat cloud we are supposing to exist will of course do the

same; but in so doing will be rent into fragments or small groups, and thus produce

what is called a ' mackerel sky,' just as a similar result is produced, but by the

reversed action, in mud that has dried up and shrunk into small patches, while the
damp earth beneath remains expanded by the moisture it stiU contains. Should,

however, the expansion in the lower atmosphere take place very sloivly, it is possible

that the stratum of cloud may remain intact, and not be actually ruptured ; the

result would then be to spread out and attenuate the cloud as a whole ; all these

effects are supposed to take place in a still or very slowly moving atmosphere, but

supposing the same conditions take place in an atmosphere in rapid motion or

current of air, the tendency will be to elongate the cloud or group of clouds in the

direction in which the current is moving, and for this reason: the air is of course

going to where it is in demand, it is finding its equilibrium somewhere ; that which is

nearest the region requiring it will move forward fastest, that which is immediately

behind wiU follow with diminishing velocity, as it is further from the demand, the

result being to elongate the stream. Let it be supposed that a thin cloud is in a

current, it will have the same elongating influence communicated to it--ihia,ifaccom-

panied icith expansion from beloiv, will rupture the cloud into ribs or bars at right

angles to the current ; if, however, it is continuous but without expansion from

below, the reverse action will take place, and longitudinal bars will be formed in the

direction of the current. When, however, the main portion of a cloud is in a

stationary state or moving but slowly, and a quicker current catches a portion of it,

larger or smaller filaments that may be prominent are drawn out in what are

popularly called 'mares-tails: ' but this applies more to lower and denser clouds;
indeed, it will be observed that the upper stratum of clouds generally is modified
by conditions which do not sensibly affect the lower and denser clouds ; their attenu-
ated state shows the effects of vertical action as affecting their forms in a striking
manner, as well as the influence of varying velocity in horizontal motion.

     The principal clouds in this latitude come from the S. W., W., and N.W., and the
air from these points moves most rapidly ; the S.W. is much the fastest as well as
the most prevalent. It is a particularly rough and giisty stream, derived from the
heated tropical air which rises and is piled up as it were to a great elevation. This
as it flows away has to push that which is in advance of it until it has established
a stream ; the supply of air being more rapid than the outflow or diffusion causes
the elastic air to move in irregular gusts or masses, and hence the peculiar violence
<ind lulls alternating in the manner so well known. This stream descends to the

surface of the earth in the temperate zone, the latitude varying with the seasons.

     The more northerly and easterly currents are smooth, flowing to fill up the
deficiencies caused by the upward movement of the heated air, or by condensation
of vapour, by the fall of rain, or by eddies that carry the lower air into the higher
regions of the atmosphere, and by cyclones of various dimensions.

     The principles here set forth are only applied to two stratifications of clouds, an
upper and a lower one, but of course the same results are obtained in a lai-ger
number of strata ; it is only for simplicity of description and illustration that no
more than two are mentioned.*

               12. On a new Sunshine Recorder. By "W. E. "Wilson.

      The instrument consists of two parts, one of which, the indicator, is affected
by the sunshine, and the other of which registers the indications. The former, or
indicating apparatus, is a differential metallic thermometer, made of a spiral of two
 metals (zinc and steel) soldered together. Half of the spiral is a right-handed one,
and the other half is left-handed. The complete spiral is fixed at its upper end.

At its lower end a lever or pointer is attached. The upper half or right-handed

portion of the spiral projects through the roof of a ventilated box, and is exposed

to the sunshine. The lower or left-handed half is in the shade. Any change in

the temperature of the air does not cause the lever or pointer to move, as the upper

half of the spiral tends to move it as much in one direction as the lower half tends
to move it in the other. "WTien the sun shines on the exposed upper half the lever
moves over and completes an electric circuit, which passes through the recording

part of the apparatus.

     The recorder consists of a drum driven by a clock. The drum revolves once
in twenty-four hours, and is mounted on an axis with a screw of ten threads to an
inch which turns in a nut. This gives the drum a longitudinal motion of jg" as well
as its motion of rotation. The clock makes an electric contact once every minute,
and the electric circuit is led through an electro-magnet which causes a pricker to
strike the drum when the circuit is complete. The circuit, as previously mentioned,

is led through the lever of the bimetallic indicator, and the circuit is only closed

when the sunshine causes the lever to do so. When the circuit is complete the

electro-magnet pricks off dots every minute, which represent so many minutes of
sunshine. The drum is of such a length that it holds the daily record of sunshine

for three months.

     The instrument also is made to give the total time during which the sun shone
in the day. The hands of the clock are not driven by it, but by an electro-magnet
which works a ratchet. The electric current is led through this magnet as well as
the one that works the pricker, so that as the pricker records minutes of sunshine
on the drum, the hands of the clock move forward in intervals of minutes. At the

end of tlie day the clock shows the number of hours and minutes of sunshine for

Athe day. note is then made of the recorded total, and the hands put back to zero

again.

     The drum is covered with ' cyclostyle ' paper, and after the three months' record
is complete it is removed and put in a frame, under which can be placed ordinary
white paper. Printer's ink is then rolled over it, and a great many copies of the
original record can thus be printed for distribution. I think it might be of interest
to print several yearly copies on the top of each other on the same paper. By the
general resulting degrees of light and shade we should be able to see if there were,
any periods in the year which were liable to more sunshine than others.

  15. Description of a Differential Gravity Meter founded on the Flexure of

                 a Spring. By Sir W. Thomson, LL.D., F.B.8.

     The design and construction of the instrument now to be described was under-

taken on the suggestion of General Walker, of the East Indian Trigonometrical
Survey. At the Aberdeen Meeting of the British Association in 1885, General
Walker obtained the appointment of a committee to examine into the whole
question of the present methods and instruments for the measurement of gravi-
tational force, and to promote investigation, having for its object the production of
gravitation-measuring instruments of a more reliable and accurate character than,

those now in use.
      The secretary of this committee. Professor Poynting, has already issued a

circular note to the members of the committee (of whom the author is one), stating

 the conditions which must be fulfilled by any gravimeter laid before the committee
 for examination and report.

     An instrument, constructed according to the following description, promises to

 fulfil all the conditions mentioned in Professor Poynting's circular. Its sensibility
 is amply up to the specified degree. It is, of necessity, largely influenced by
 temperature, and it is not certain that the allowance for temperature, or the means

 which may be worked out for bringing the instrument always to one temperature,

 will prove satisfactory. It is almost certain, although not quite certain, that the
 constancy of the latent zero of the spring will be sufficient, after the instrument has
 been kept for several weeks or months under the approximately constant stresa
 under which it is to act in regular use.

      The instrument, which is represented in the accompanying sketch, consists of
 a thin flat plate of springy german silver of the kuid known as ' doctor,' used

of the incline by a glass plate through which the weight is viewed. The tube is
fixed to the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle of sheet brass, of which one leg,
inclined to it at an angle of about 1/5 radian, is approximately horizontal, and is
supported by a transverse trunnion resting on fixed V's under the lower end of the

tube, with a micrometer screw under the short, approximately vertical, leg of the

triangle.                                                                                         »

The observation consists in finding the number of turns and parts of a turn ot
the micrometer screw, required to bring the instrument from the position at which
the bubble of the spirit-level is between its proper marks, to the position which
equihbrates the spring-borne weight, with a mark upon it exactly in line with a

mchosen divisional line on a little scale of 20 half-millimetres, fixed in this tube the

vertical plane perpendicular to its length.

The instrument is, as is to be expected, exceedingly sensitive to changes ot
temperature. An elevation of temperature of 1° 0. diminishes the Young's modulus

of the german silver so much that about a turn and a half of the micrometer screw

(lowering the upper end of the tube at the rate of 2/3 millimetre per turn) pro-

duces the requisite change of adjustment for the balanced position of the movable
mweight. About 1| turn of the screw corresponds to a difference of 1/5000
                                                                                           the

force of gravitv, and the sensibility of the instrument is amply valid for 1/40 of
this amount ; that is to say, for 1/200,000 diflerence in the force of gravity. Hence

it is not want of sensibility in the instrument that can prevent its measuring

differences of gravity to the 1/100,000 ; but to attain this degree of minuteness it

win be necessary to know the temperature of the sprmg to within 1/20° G. I do

not see that there can, be any great difiiculty in achieving the thermal adjustnaent

by the aid of a water jacket and a delicate thermometer. To facilitate the requisite
thermal adjustment I propose, in a new instrument of which 1 shall immediately

commence the construction, to substitute for the brass tube a long double girder of

copper (because of the high thermal conductivity of copper), by which sufficient

uniformity of temperature along the spring throughout the mainly effective pprtion

of its length, and up to near the sighted end, shall be secured. The water jacket
will secure a slight enough variation of temperature to allow the absolute tem-

perature to be indicated by the thermometer with, I believe, the required

accuracy.

16. Comparison of the Harcourt and Methven Photometric Standards.

                       By W. Stepney Eawson, M.A.

The author of the paper explained the growing necessity for a reliable govern-
536 EEPORT-- 1886.

mental standard of liglit, and showed two of the standards to which reference was
 made in the report of a committee appointed by the Board of Trade in 1881.

      These were the Harcourt air-gas lamp and the Methven screen.
      The improvements made in the former since the last meeting of the British
 Association consisted in an adjustable black background and screen for protecting
the eye from the light of all but the upper point of the flame when regulating the
 height, and thereby enabling the exact height to be determined more accurately
 also in a rack and pinion movement with a scale engraved in millimetres for

setting the height of the platinum wire ; and besides these an entirely new method

 of preserving an accurately even rate of drop of pentane for feeding the lamp in
 the portable form exhibited.

      This device consists in producing a perfectly constant head by providing an
 overflow outlet from which the excess of pentane drops into a small bottle, which

 can be removed when necessary, and emptied into the main reservoir, which is on

 the top of the lamp, the bottle forming a stopper to the reservoir to prevent
 evaporation.

      The rate of drop into the lamp is regulated with great delicacy by letting the
pentane flow down a fine glass tube, in which there is a constricted passage, which
 can be more or less closed by a fine platinum wire which can be screwed in or out
 of it by means of a thread working in a cap at the top of the tube. This method
 is due to Mr. W. F. Donkin.

      In other respects the lamp remains exactly as described by Mr. Vernon Harcourt

 at previous meetings of the Association.

     The Methven screen was one of the form as now constructed, but differing from
 that upon which the committee on photometric standards reported in 1881. The

 author showed by a diagram the errors introduced by the alteration of form,
 amounting to fully 16 per cent, below its normal value.

     He gave the result of observations made by Mr. W. F. Donkin and himself,

 and showed that the errors may be determined theoretically, and were practically

 coincident with the result of observations.

      The value of the Methven varied from 1687 at 65" to 2-149 at 11".
      Observations also showed that the increased thickness of flame subtended by

 the disc as it approached the slot caused an increase in the value.

      Allusion was made to experiments for determining the absorption of light
 by cylindrical glass chimneys, and it was stated that whereas frosted glass absorbs
30-40 per cent, of the light a glass cylinder frosted on the outside only absorbs
from 7-15 per cent.

                17. Fuel Galorimttry} By B. H. Thwaite, F.C.8.

      Although instruments for the precise estimation of most of the agents of our

--industries have long ago been introduced, the heating value of coal the great

--natural source of power is rarely tested calorimetrically, even by the largest

consumers.

     At present the different qualities of coals are known as bests, seconds, &c.

whereas a calorific estimation might show that the seconds, or even inferior

quaUties, possessed a higher calorific efficiency than the Jirsts.

    By the utilisation of fuel calorimetry a user of coal would be able to ascertain

exactly the financial value of diflferent fuels, and to compare the heat energy pos-
sessed by the fuel with that economically evolved.

     Fuel calorimetry would prove a strong inducement to the adoption of more
perfect combustion arrangements, and thus aid the laudable objects of the Smoke
Abatement Society.

     The disadvantage of Dulong's calorimeter, in which the fuel is consumed in a

current of oxygen, is that the combustion occupies a considerable time, and conse-
quently requires correction for re-cooling ; moreover, unless the oxj'gen is applied
by compression, the instability of carbon dioxide in the presence of carbon prevents

                             ' See Engineeririg, November 12, 1886, p. 507.

the entii-e oxidation of the carbon, and part of the gases escape as carbon monoxide

·(CO), with a consequent loss of heat energy, and the measurements are incorrect.

In the apparatus of Messrs. Favre and Silbermann the gases resulting from

the combustion of fuel are deprived of the carbon dioxide and passed over cupric

oxide, for the estimation of the weight of carbon monoxide, but even this modifi-

cation does not enable an absolutely exact correction to be made.

Mr. Lewis Thompson designed some time ago an ingenious apparatus, in which

he obtained the oxygen for fuel combustion from potassium chlorate and potassium

nitrate intimately mixed with the fuel in a finely divided condition : the mixture is

ignited with a fuse.

The dissociation of the potassium chlorate, however, generates heat, and heat

is absorbed by the transition of the oxygen from a solid to a gaseous condition

the dissolution of the residual potassium chloride also absorbs heat, so that con-

siderable corrections have to be made.

Berthelot mentions that in the hands of Stohmann the solid oxygen arrangement

has been greatly improved and increased in accuracy. Berthelot and Vieille finally

decided to confine themselves to the use of oxygen in a gaseous form as the oxidis-

--ing agent in their calorimeter. By the use of gaseous oxygen a single difficulty only

ias to be overcome the complete oxidation of the fuel without producing a trace of

carbon monoxide or of hydrocarbon. This difficulty is successfully met by com-

pressing oxygen to about seven atmospheres, and with a weight of combustible

such that the proportion of oxygen consumed does not exceed 30 or 40 per cent, of

its total quantity. The air is forced into the small and strongly formed mortar-

jahaped vessel by a force-pump.

The advantages obtained by this new arrangement are that the calorimetric

measurement can be performed in from three to four minutes, whUst the actual

Acombustion occupies only a few seconds.  very small quantity of water is required,

80 that a high temperature is obtained, thereby increasing the precision. The pro-

duct is not found to contain any residual gases, judging from critical analyses.
     The ignition is effected by passing an electric current through a platinum wire

and cage (in which the fuel is placed).

With this instrument Berthelot and Vieille have established the calorific

value of the most important pyrogenic hydrocarbon compounds. The results are

given in the ' Comptes Rendus ' for May 31, 1886.

     The only disadvantage of this excellent instrument is its cost ; it can be
obtained from M. Golas, of Rue St. Jacques, Paris, who makes Berthelot's splendid

instruments of precision.

    Mr. W. Thomson, of Manchester, has lately improved the Lewis Thompson

calorimeter, employing gaseous in preference to solid oxygen, in a very simple
manner, and, as far as the author can judge, the instrument appears the most

satisfactory for popular use : the combustion is likely to be slightly incomplete

owing to the use of oxygen at atmospheric pressure, but for practical purposes the

instrument is all that could be desired.

The author suggests that the standard marketable value of coal should be ex-

pressed in the weight of fuel in decimals of a pound required to raise one pound
of water to 212° Fahr. or 100° Centigrade from an initial temperature of ("say)
77° Fahr. or 25° Centigrade.

18. On Secular Experiments in Glasgoiu on the Elasticity of Wires.
                   By J. T. BoTTOMLET, M.A., F.B.S.E.

The object of this paper is to put on record the state of the wires in the secular

experiments on stretching of wires commenced under the British Association and
Awith the aid of a money grant.
                                  committee was appointed at the last Glasgow

meeting for the purpose of inaugurating these experiments ; and preparations having
been made in tlie interval, the wires were set up in 1879. Several reports have

been already made to the British Association, and observations are carried on from

time to time on the condition of the wires, which are hung up in the Tower of the

University Buildings of Glasgow.
538 KEPOBT-- 1886.

There are pairs of wires of each of the metals platinum, gold, palladium.

These are hung side by side from the sa7ne top support, and one of the wires in each

pair carries a light load (^-^ of the breaking weight), the other a heavy load, about

Af of the breaking weight.     comparison is made between the pulling out of the

heavily loaded wire and the lightly loaded wire by means of apparatus described in

former Reports.

The wires were set up on May 3, 1879. By May 6 they had all come to a

fairly steady condition, though the heavily weighted wires were running down to

an extent just perceptible from day to day.

    From May 6, 1879, till August 7, 1880, the running down of the heavily

loaded wire in comparison with the lightly loaded wu-e was in the case of platinum

1'15  mm.,  on   a length  of  1553'33  centimetres                                               in  the  case  of the  gold  wire
                                                                                               ;

1*45 mm, on 1552-98 centimetres.

    From August 7, 1880, till March 3, 1886, a further running down has taken place,
which amounts in the case of the platinum to 0'40 mm., and in the case of the gold
to 0-80 mm.

2. On the Rule for Contracting the Process of Finding the Square Root of a
                       Number. By Professor M. J. M. HiLli.

     The rule is this :

      See ' Todhunter's Algebra,' Art. 246.

    When n+\ figures of a square root have been obtained by the ordinary method,

n more may be obtained by division only, supposing 2/1 + 1 to be the whole

number.
     After giving the demonstration Todhunter says : ' The above demonstration im-

Nplies that (the number whose square is to be found) is an integer with an exact

square root ; but we may easily extend the result to other cases.'
    He does not, however, give a general proof of his statement.
    The object of this paper is to show that the result of the division may exceed

by unity the remaining n figures of the square root, and then the rule fails.
     The proof given in text-books on algebra is applicable to the case when the

square root can be exactly obtained as an integer, but not to all other cases.

where P'K is parallel to SO. We have

       RQ : RP' = SQ : SO = constant

If P move over a plane, P' lies on

another (intersecting the first on the plane

    PIf lie on a surface, P' lies on another *S'

Thus, the plane

                                         Ix + my + nz = ka

is transformed into the plane

                                     Ix' + my' + nz' = k(x' -- h),

and so on.

    If we take SO = OL, the correspondence becomes involutional in character, i.e.f
if P' correspond to P, then P will correspond to P'.

    In that case the point S may be dropped,
and we have the following construction :

P is any point in space, PX' perpendicular to

Xplane LXX' ; OX' meets a parallel through

to PX' in P'. Then P' corresponds to P.
    Taking O as origin, and co-ordinates as

before, we have

the simplest obtainable for projection.

                     By Professor Catlet, LL.D., F.B.S.

Using throughout capital letters to denote homogeneous quadric functions of the

co-ordinates (x, y, z, w), we have as a form of quartic surface with eight nodes

S2 = (* J{ U,V, W)^ = ; viz., the nodes are here the octad of points, or eight points

a linear transformation on the functions U,V,W (that is, by substituting for the

original functions U,V,W linear functions of these variables) reduced to the form

Suppose now that the function Q can be in a second manner expressed in the

Rlike form a =P- + Q2 + R^ (where P, Q, are not linear functions of U,V,W)

W R[j2_p2 + V^-Q2+W*-R- = 0; U Vor, writing + P, + Q, + = A, B, C, and
U W R- P, V - Q, - = F, G, H, the identity becomes AF + BG + CH = ; and this

identity being satisfied, the equation Q = of the quartic surface may be written in

the two forms

               Q = (A + Fr- + (B + G)« + (C + H)^ = 0, and
               G = (A-F)* + (B-G)* + (G-H)2 = 0;

viz. the quartic surface has the nodes which are the intersections of the three

A G Hquadric surfaces + F = 0, B + = 0, C + = 0, and also the nodes which are the

of course also write the equation of the surface in the form

9. Note on Sir William Thomson^ s Correction of the Ordinary Equilibriti/m

       Theory of the Tides. By Professor J. C. Adams, LL.D., F.B.S.

In Art. 806 of Thomson and Tait's ' Treatise on Natural Philosophy,' it is

pointed out that if the earth's surface is supposed to be only partially covered by

the ocean, the rise and fall of the water at any place, according to the equilibrium

theory, would be falsely estimated if, as is usually done, it were taken to be the same

as the rise and fall of the spheroidal surface that would bound the water were there

no dry land.

In the articles which immediately foUow the above, it is shown that in order to

satisfy the condition that the volume of the water remains unchanged, the expres-

sion for the radius vector of the spheroid bounding the water must contain, in

addition to the terms which would be sufficient if there were no land, a quantity

(a) which depends on the positions of the sun and moon at the time considered,

and which is the same for aU points of the sea at the same time.

This quantity (a) contains five constant coefficients which depend merely on the

configuration of land and water. The values of these coefficients in the case of the

actual oceans of our globe have been carefully determined very recently by Mr.

H. H. Turner, of Trinity College, in a joint paper by Professor G. H. Darwin and

himself, which is published in vol. xl. of the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society.'

It should be remarked that every inland sea or detached sheet of water on the

globe has in the same way a set of five constants, peculiar to itself, which enter into

the expression ot the height of the tide at any time in that sheet of water.

    By taking such constants into account the formulae which apply to the oceanic

tides are rendered equally applicable to the tides of such a sea as the Caspian, which

are thus theoretically shown to be very small, as they are knovpn to be practically.

In the work above cited reference is made to a passage in a memoir by Sir

William Thomson on the Rigidity of the Earth, published in the * Philosophical

Transactions ' for 1862, as being the only one known to the writers in which any

consciousness is shown that such a correction of the ordinary equilibrium theory as

that above mentioned is required.

    However just this remark may be in reference to modem writers on the equili-

brium theory, it is only fair to Bernoulli, the originator of the equilibrium theory, to

point out that in his prize essay on the tides he distinctly recognises the fact that

when the sea is supposed to have only a limited extent the rise and fall of its

surface cannot be the same as if the earth were entirely covered by it. In parti-

cular, he shows that the tides are so much the smaller as the sea has less extent in
longitude, and thus explains why they are altogether insensible in the Caspian and

in the Black Sea and very small in the Mediterranean, of which the communica-

tion with the ocean is almost entirely cut off at the Strait of Gibraltar (see

XLBernoulli, 'Traits sur le Flux et Reflux de la Mer,' Chapitre   section ii.

It may be as well to mention that this treatise of Bernoulli, as well as the dis-

sertations of Maclaurin and Euler on the same subject, is published in the 3rd

volume of the Jesuits' edition of Newton's 'Principia,' and also appeai-s in the

Glasgow reprint of that edition.

                                  [Plate XL]

The observations of the five inner satellites of Saturn made at Washington

since the mounting of the 26-inch refractor in 1873 have been reduced and dis-

cussed, and new orbits of these satellites have been determined. It is true that

-our observations of these satellites are not very numerous, and that further observa-

tion will be necessary in order to reach a definitive result. It should be stated also

that the elliptical figure of this planet and the presence of its ring make it difii-

cult to determine the position of a satellite by means of a filar micrometer in a

manner that shall be wholly free from the suspicion of systematic errors. The

probable error of one of our measurements is + 0-27" ; and I am inclined to think

therefore that the Washington observations are as good as any that have been
made. The result of our discussion is that the five inner satellites move in orbits

whose planes very nearly coincide with the equator of the planet, and the plane of
the ring ; and also that these orbits are practically circles. The first result is what

is generally assumed, but the fact that our observations can be satisfied within the

limits of their probable errors by circular orbits seems to me a remarkable one. It

would have been interesting of course to have found elliptical orbits, which would

have given us the positions of the lines of apsides and their motions, and which

would have led to a value of the mass of the ring ; but the circular orbits exclude

fluch results.

     In the accompanying diagram the orbits of the satellites of Saturn are shown

as they would be seen from the pole of the planet's equator, with the exception of

the orbit of lapetus, which is not correctly drawn, since this orbit is inclined to the
Aplane of projection about 14°.
                                  glance at the diagram will show the relations of

the orbits. Thus, beginning at the centre of the planet, the distances to the edges

of the ring and to the satellites increase regularly until we reach Rhea. From Rhea

to Titan there is a large interval. The orbit of Titan is on the inner edge of the

coloured surface, and that of Hyperion is on the outer edge of this surface. This

small satellite is so connected with Titan that it may be looked upon as almost a
companion of the large satellite, from Hyperion to lapetus we have a very long

interval. It is in these two intervals that one woiild naturally look for new

satellites.

But what I wish now to call especial attention to is the fact of the circular

orbits of the five inner satellites. In this connection we may notice that the orbit

of the satellite of Neptune, those of the four satellites of Uranus, and also those of

the three inner satellites of Jupiter are likewise all circular. The orbit of the outer

satellite of Mars is very nearly circular. As for the orbit of the inner satellite of

mythis planet, the discussion of  observations of 1877 gave an eccentricity 0'0321,

which seemed real ; but the recent discussion of my observations of 1879 has dimi-

nished this eccentricity, and indicates that this orbit also must be nearly circular.

The observations of 1879 are better, I think, than those of 1877, since although the
satellite was fainter in 1879, the disc of the planet was so much smaller that the
measurements were not so liable to systematic errors which might produce a

spurious eccentricity.

     In the table on next page I have collected the distances and eccentricities of
the satellites of our solar system. The distances are expressed in equatorial radii

of the primary planets.

     This table shows that Hyperion has the largest eccentricity, but this satellite is

connected with Titan in such a manner that it may be considered an exceptional

case. Generally it appears that the satellites with small distances have also very

small eccentricities. To this it may be objected that such a result depends partly

on the difficulty of determining for the small distances a good definite value of the

eccentricity. There is some ground for such an objection, since in this case small

«rrors in the measurements -would have a greater influence on the eccentricity ; hut

in nearly every case the observations are now so numerous, and have been made by
so many observers, that the results given in the table must be nearly correct.

     4. On an Electric Motor Phenomenon.^ By "W. M. Mobdet.

When testing an electric motor in the works of the Anglo-American Brush

Electric Light Coi-poration a phenomenon presented itself which the author at
first found some difficulty in explaining. The motor was of the Schuckert-Mordey
' Victoria ' type, series-wound, constructed to give 36 horse-power with a current
of 20 amperes. It was supplied with power by a large Brush dynamo. On starting the

generator on the occasion in question, the motor, being connected in the circuit, also

started, but ran very slowly, and developed but little power. There being
apparently some fault in the connections or elsewhere, the circuit was opened in

order to stop the motor for the purpose of examination. On breaking the circuit

the motor, which at the time was running slowly, stopped suddenly, and instantly

started again, running backwards or oppositely to its usual directioDj at a rate of

speed considerably greater than wlien it -was connected in the circuit, slowly

decreasing- in speed until it stopped.

    An examination showed that its fields had been inadvertently connected as a
shunt on the armature instead of in series with it. On joining it up as a series

motor it ran without exhibiting any imusual action. The cause of the unexpected

reversal under the above-described circumstances will be understood from the

following explanation :

As the motor was series-wound, but improperly joined up as a shunt, it will

be understood that a strong field was produced, the current through the field-

magnet coils being large, the armature being traversed by onlj' a small portion of

the total current.

It will also be understood that on breaking the external circuit the momentum

of the armature converts a shunt motor into a generator, the motion of the arma-

ture producing a strong current, circulating in the armature in the reverse direction

to the previously received current, but in the fields in the same direction. In fact,

a shunt motor under such conditions acts like a series generator with its terminals

short-circuited. The intensity of this action in any motor depends to a great

extent upon the form of the generating ' characteristic ' of the machine, Properly

constructed shunt motors, having fields wound to a comparatively high resistance,

do not exhibit this action to any marked degree unless a suitable external circuit

is provided for them, while shunt motors which are incapable of acting as shunt

generators do not exhibit it at all. In the case in question, as the fields were of low

resistance, the generation of current was considerable, and instantly stopped the motor.

   A reference to the figures will show why, when it had stopped, the armature

started again in the reverse direction.

Fig. 1 shows the connections and the course

of the current when the motor was supplied

with current from an external source, and when

it was running in its proper ' forward ' direction.

Fig. 2 shows the direction of current under

the two conditions which successively occur

when the external circuit is broken. In the
first place the momentum of the armature

causes a current to be generated which, it will

be seen, is in the same direction in the field as

before, but in the opposite direction in the

armature. This at once stops the armature.

Then the momentary induced (' extra ') current
follows in the same direction at the moment

when motion has ceased, and causes the arma-

ture to start again in the reverse direction.

This extra current is produced in both the armature and the field-magnet coila,

but mainly in the latter, as in them the coefficient

of self-induction is very considerable.               Fig,

It may be added that the motor in question

has for several months been working very suc-

cessfuDy in New Zealand, where it is used to

supply power to the machinery at the Phoenix

Gold Mine. The current is transmitted to it

fi'om generators driven by water power at a con-

siderable distance from the mine, the conductor

consisting of three miles of copper wire, "IGo

inch in diameter, supported on telegraph poles.

The effective return is over 65 per cent.

     Eeferring to the proposed utilisation of the braking power possessed by motors
the author pointed out that sudden strains should be avoided, and that the power
should rather be wasted in a brake-block, where it did no harm, than in heatin"-
the motor itself. The exceptions were those cases where accidents could be pre'-

vented, or the generated current could be actually used.

     The author then proceeded to show that the extra current at hreaking-circuit
was much less in motors than in generators, on account of the opposing E.M.F. in

motor armatures. He thought that M. Marcel Deprez had in his recent experi-

ments taken needless precautions to avoid the effects of extra currents in his motors,
and said that he had frequently opened the circuits of Brush generators giving
2,000 to 3,000 volts and 10 amperes without in any case doing any harm.

          5. On Electric Induction hetween Wires aoid Wires.
                         By W. H. Pkeece, F.B.S.

     Along the Gray's Inn Road in London the Post Office has a line of iron pipes
huried underground carrying many telegraph wires. The United Telephone Com-
pany has a line of open wires along the same route over the housetops situated
eighty feet from the underground wires. Considerable disturbances were experi-
enced on the telephone circuits, and even Morse signals were read which were said

to be caused by the continuous and parallel telegraph circuits.

   A very careful series of experiments, extending over some period, proved un-

mistakably that it was so, and that the well-known pattering disturbances due to
induction are experienced at a much greater distance than was anticipated.

    It became of importance to lind out how far these effects could be detected.
     Experiments conducted on the Newcastle town moor extended the area of the

disturbance to a distance of .3,000 feet, while the effects were detected on parallel

lines of telegraph between Durham and Darlington at a distance of 10^ miles. But
the greatest distance experimented upon was between the east and west coast of the
Border, where two lines of wire 40 miles apart were affected, the one by the other,

sounds produced at Newcastle on the Jedburgh line being distinctly heard at
Gretna on a parallel line, though no wires connected the two places.

     Very careful experiments have shown that these effects are independent of the
earth, and are probably inductive effects through the air.

     Distinct conversation has been held by telephone through the air, without any

wire, through a distance of one quarter of a mile ; and this distance can probably be

much exceeded.

     Effects are not confined to the air, for submarine cables, half a mile apart in the

sea, disturb each other.

     The instrument is ' slewed ' around, so that the plane of the coil makes an angle
of 60° with the mei'idian, instead of coinciding with the meridian, and this point is
taken as zero, whence a scale in tangent divisions is drawn, coincident with the old
scale of tangent-divisions when the zero and the meridian agree. This renders the
instrument far more sensitive to increments of current for high deflexions, while

the divisions are still proportional to the current strength.

                         By J. T. BoTTOMLET, M.A., F.B.S. E.

     Wheatstone's rheostat was invented over forty years ago ; but, though admirable
in conception, and commonly shown on the lecture-table in explaining the nature
of and illustrating electric resistance, it is scarcely if at all used in the laboratory.
This is altogether owing to practical defects in the instruments as commonly con-
structed. The wire comes loose, the contacts are uncertain, and, the current beino-
incessantly broken and made again, the galvanometer needle is perpetually swino-ino-

about, instead of showing, as it ought, a continuously increasing or diminishing

deflection when the resistance is wound out of the circuit or wound into it.

     Modifications of the original instrument have been made from time to time
and a very important improvement was recently introduced by Mr. Jolin, of
Bristol. In John's rheostat a toothed-wheel fixed on one of the two cylinders gears
into a toothed wheel on a shaft carrying the other cylinder, and a spring fixed to
this shaft acts on the last-named cylinder, which surrounds it, on the principle
of the mainspring of a watch. By this arrangement the wire is kept tightly
stretched, and the barrels can be turned both forwards and backwards by means of
.a handle attached to one of them. Thus the necessity of shifting the handle from
one to the other when the motion is to be reversed is obviated.

     In Sir William Thomson's improved rheostat the spiral groove in the non-
conducting cylinder of previous instruments is dispensed with, and the wire is
guided between the cylinders so as to be laid on them spirally by means of a travel-
ling nut on a long screw. The screw is turned by the handle and carries a toothed-
wheel which gears intotwo toothed-wheels, one of which turns one of the cylinders,

iind the other the axial shaft of the other cylinder containing the watch-sprino-.

The guiding nut is also arranged to stop the motion of the screw-shaft at each en°d

                                                                                                          NN2

of the i-ano;e, and so prevent the possibility of overwinding. It also carries an
index which moves along a graduated scale and counts the turns of the wire on the-

insulating cylinder.

     Id Joliu's rheostat, as already described, the two cylinders are geared together
directlv, and turn in contrary directions, the wire passing from the upper side of
one to" the under side of the other. In Sir William Thomson's instrument, as is
seen in the diagram, the toothed-wheels of the two cylinders are turned in the same
direction by the wheel on the screw shaft, and the wire passes horizontally from

the top of one cylinder to the top of the other.

     The conducting cylinder and the wire are both of platinoid, a metallic alloy
having properties which make it specially suitable for the purpose. It has very
hifh electric resistaDce, veiy small temperature variation of resistance, and it
remains with its surface almost or altogether untarnished in the air. On account
of the last-named property the contact between the wire and the conducting cylinder
is as perfect as can be desired ; and continuity of action, which was a gi'eat ditfi-
culty in the old form of the instrument, is absolutely complete.

13. Description of Experiments for determining the Electric liesistance of
    Metals at High Temperatures' Bij J. T. Bottomlet, M.A., F.B.8.E.

This paper gives an account of apparatus and experiments for the purpose of

determining the electric resistance of certain platinum wires at temperatures varying

from 0° C. up to the temperature of dull redness, or even a little higher. The wires

experimented on were wires which have been used and are in use in an investiga-

tion on heat radiation at different temperatures in vacuum, and in air and other

gases. The necessity for knowing with accuracy the rate of variation of electric

resistance with temperature of the wires was explained in previous communica-

Ations (1884 and 1885) to Section of the British Association. The variation of

electric resistance of platinum with temperature differs so much in different speci-

mens that it is necessary to determine its value for each particular wire which is

used in the investigation just referred to.

The principal apparatus described are an air-thermometer and a copper heating

iacket ; but a somewhat detailed account is also given of other heating apparatus

employed, and of the electrical arrangements.

The air thermometer used is formed from a piece of thin glass tube from | in.

to i in. in internal diameter. This is allowed to fall in before the blowpipe and
drawn out to a capillary tube at each end ; and one of the ends (n) is conveniently

turned up along the side of the bulb. The length of the bulb is from 2 in. to 2^ in.

The thermometer is filled with perfectly dry pure air with the help of an aspirator,
and the capillary tube a is closed by drawing off a small portion by means of a

finely pointed blowpipe flame, care being taken that the blowpipe flame does not

play on the open end, which might contaminate the air within. When a number of

these bulbs are made and filled at one time, the end b is also closed, after the filling

with pure air, and the thermometers are then ready for use.

    When the thermometer is to be used it is placed in position, and very soon after
the heating commences the end b of the capillary tube is opened with a file. When

the bulb has taken the temperature which is to be measured, a hand blowpipe is

brouo-ht and b is closed again. The thermometer having been removed from the

hot space, it is allowed to cool, is carefully cleaned, if need be, and is then weighed.

The weighing so obtained (after a small correction for air contained which it is

usually unnecessary to apply) gives the weight of the glass. The thermometer is

then immersed under mercury or water which has been boiled and cooled (water

is preferred by the author for reasons stated), and the extremity of the capillary
tube a is cut off with a glass-knife. The water entering fills the space with the

exception of that occupied by the air which was left in the thermometer at the

Ahio-h temperature.  second weighing is then taken. Lastly the end b is opened

and the thermometer is filled with water, and a third weighing taken. The small

portions of glass cut off are of course weighed with the thermometer, and care is

taken as to drying the outside of the thermometer for weighings 2 and 3. The
                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                  549

Ijarometer is also read at the closing and at the opening of the l liermometer, and

the temperature of the water used is noted. Also the observed barometric pressure

&t opening is corrected for vapour pressure when water is used, care being taken

to ensure, as far as may be done, that the air left in the thermometer is saturated

with moisture, though the experiment is carried through with tolerable quickness

to avoid loss of air by absorption in the water.

Weighing No. 1 being subtracted from weighing No. 3, the whole volume of the

thermometer (which must be corrected for expansion of the glass) is obtained.

Weighing No. 2 being subtracted from weighing No. 3, the volume of the air at the
high temperature is obtained. From the ratio of these two volumes the tempera-

ture is calculated by well-known formulas. For temperatures below redness the

thermometers are made of German or somewhat hard English glass ; for higher

temperatures, of combustion-tubing.

   A few words will suffice to describe the copper jacket. . It consists of a con-

siderable number (eight in the jacket exhibited) of sheet copper cylinders, each

having a bottom, put one inside the other. These concentric cylinders fit each other

very closely, there being only space for a lapping with a few turns of the thinnest

asbestos thread to hold them together and keep an air space of perhaps 3^ of an

inch.

AThe internal diameter of the innermost cylinder is about an inch.          stopper

of woven asbestos closes the open end of the innermost cylinder and supports the

air thermometer and the electrodes, of thick copper, to which the platinum wire to

be tested is attached by silver soldering. The platinum wire is in the form of a

spiral, with the turns well separated, wide enough in diameter to admit the bulb of

Athe air thermometer.  very powerful Fletcher's ' solid flame ' burner gives

ample heat to raise the whole copper cylinder and its contents to redness.

     Experiments described have shown that the temperature within the copper

cylmder may be kept for any length of time so constant that there is no variation

of electric resistance perceptible with exceedingly sensitive electric measuring

apparatus.

     Temperatures lower than 300° 0. have generally been determined with the aid of

the vapours of liquids of high boiling points. A very convenient series of organic

liquids was proposed by Drs. Ramsay and Young two years ago.

The determination of the electric resistance of the wire was made by the poten-

Antial method.  electric series is formed, consisting of a single gravity Daniell, the

platinum coil to be tested, a known coil of platinoid on the outside of a large tin

vessel filled with cold water (which contains a lump of slaked lime to prevent

rusting of the tin vessel), and, lastly, a rheostat to regulate the series. The elec-

trodes furnished with spring clips of a high resistance (10,000 ohms) galvanometer

are clipped on alternately to the standard coil and the platinum wire under test.

                           By Thomas Gray, B.Sc, F.E.S.E.

     The instrument proposed in this paper consists of a tube, the length of which is
much greater than its diameter, covered with a single layer of wire, laid on uni-
formly all along its length. In the instrument proposed the tube is ten centimetres
in diameter and one metre long. The advantages claimed for this arrangement
are: the ease with which the constants can be obtained with sufficient accuracy;
the great uniformity of the magnetic field produced at the centre of the coil by a
current passing through it ; the ease with which the various details of manufacture
work out, and hence its comparative cheapness.

     The coil is mounted on a vertical axis, the line of which passes through the
centre of the axis of the tube, and turns above a horizontal table, to which is fixed
a scale of degrees on which the angular position of the coil can be read. Arrange-

                                   15. On Maijnetic Hysteresis. By Professor G. Forbes, M.A.

Professor Ewing^ has made a contribution to the science of magnetism, which

has only lately come into the hands of scientific men, but which is certain to lead

to an extension of our powers in dealing with applications as well as with the theory

of magnetism. Lord Rayleigh has already drawn deductions from it in a paper

communicated to the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for August 1886.

The consequences which 1 wish to draw from it have reference partly to prac-

tical applications, and specially to secondary generators or transformers, and partly

to Weber's molecular theory of magnetism.

If a coil of wire carrying an electric cun-ent encloses an iron core whose length

is at least 400 times its diameter, or which is of a ring shape, the magnetic induc-

tion produced at the middle of the bar, or at any part of the ring, is due altogether

to the direct action of the electric current, since there is no free magnetism. In

this case the magnetic force is proportional to the electric current.

   A curve may be drawn in which abscissae denote electric current or magnetic

force, and ordinates represent magnetic induction. As the magnetic force is

increased a                        curve is traced                                                                       but  this  curve  is  not retraced  as  the  magnetic  force
                                                                                                                      ;

decreases. If the magnetic force reach alternately a positive and a negative maxi-

mum a closed curve is traced, the area of which indicates the work done upon the

iron core in a cycle of these operations, just as the area of the curve traced by th©

steam engine indicator measures the work done by the engine in a complete cycle

of the movements of the piston-rod.

The nature of this curve shows that we cannot express the magnetic induction

in terms of the magnetic force alone. It is also a function of the history of the

iron in the immediate past. This phenomenon is called magnetic hysteresis.

     Fig. 1 (taken from Ewing) shows the increase of magnetic induction from zero
to a maximum, with increase of magnetic force and the subsequent cycle produced.

The arrows indicate the direction in which the curve is traced.

If the iron be subjected, during the process of magnetisation, to mechanical

shocks, these peculiarities disappear, and the induction becomes a pure function of

the magnetic force. It is generally supposed that the tremors of a dynamo machine

prevent the effects of magnetic hysteresis from showing themselves. This may

sometimes be the case. It is not always so. In the first model non-commutating

dynamo constructed by me the electromotive force did not diminish ten per cent,

after the exciting current was reduced to zero. That model consisted of a long

cylindrical electromagnet, rotating about its axis, its poles being connected by a

soft iron cylinder with closed ends. In secondary generators hysteresis must play

an important part. In this case the magnetising force is due to the sum of the two

currents in the primary- and secondary coils. Now the maximum value of the

current in the primary is reached earlier than the maximum of the sum of the two
currents, and the maximum of the secondary current later. This fact introduces

intere^ing modifications in the form of the magnetic indicator diagrams of the two

circuits, to which I wish to draw attention. I will suppose that the maximum of

magnetic induction is coincident in time with the maximum of the algebraical sum

of the primary and secondary currents.

The phase of the primary current may precede, and the phase of the secondary

cuiTent may follow, that of the magnetic induction by a value varying from to --T

when T is the period of a complete cycle. The currents are taken as harmonic

functions of the time.

To transform Ewing's cyclic curve of hysteresis into the corresponding diagram

for the primary or secondary circuit whose phase is +a or --a in advance of the

phase of induction. Let the maximum abscissa represent the magnetic force due to
the maximum current in that circuit, and describe a circle with this abscissa as

radius, and the zero of co-ordinates as centre. Take any point P on Ewing's

curve                              draw  its  ordinate PM.                                                                    Let this line, produced if necessary, cut the

Qhigher of these points operate on Q, the highest of Qj, and contrariwise. Draw
OQ' inclined to OQ at an angle +a or --a. Draw the ordinate Q' M', and cut
off P' M' = PM. P' is a point on the new curve corresponding to P on Ewing's

curve.

In this manner figures have heen drawn for the primary and secondary circuits

of a secondary generator for cases where the acceleration and retardation of phase

are--T  and,  T

              -.

84

In all these curves work is done in a complete cycle by the electric circuit on

the iron when the curve is traced in a direction contrary to the motion of the

Wehands of a watch, and contrariwise.        can now notice several facts :

      (1) In all diagrams for the primary circuit the curves are described in the
same direction as Ewing's curve, showing that it does work on the iron.

      (2) In both diagrams for the secondary circuit the curve is described in the

opposite direction to Ewing's curve, showing that work is done by the iron on the

circuit.

    (3) When the acceleration of the primary is T-- no work is done by the iron on

the primary circuit at any part of the cycle.

(4)     When      the  retardation  of  the  secondary  .   T--  no  work  .   done  by the circuit

                                                        is                 is

upon the iron at any part of the cycle.

      (5) In the diagram for the secondary circuit, if the retardation be the angle

corresponding to the abscissa OA, the curve passes through the origin, and the
work done in a cycle is zero (A being the point where Ewing's curve cuts the

axis of abscissae).

     (6) If the retardation be less than this, work is done in the cycle by the

secondary circuit on the iron core.

      (7) It follows from this that, owing to magnetic hysteresis, the retardation of
the secondary current cannot be less than the angle corresponding to the abscissa

OA except in so far as it derives energy by direct induction from the primary.

     In most early attempts to make secondary generators the mutual induction of
the primary and secondary coils was very shght, and here the retardation must be

at least equal to the angle indicated.

    These remarks hardly apply to the secondary generator of Gautard & Gibbs,

who made it a commercial success mainly by causing the direct mutual ind-uction of
the circuits to be a maximum.

     Lord Rayleigh has pointed out that since the hysteresial dissipation of energy
per unit volume of iron is the same whether the magnetic circuit be open or
closed, while the total work done on or by the electric circuits is greater with an
open magnetic circuit, therefore the most efficient secondary generator is one with
an open magnetic circuit. This is true only when hysteresial dissipation is the
only cause of the loss of efficiency. It has appeared, however, that in actual

secondary generators hysteresial dissipation is but a portion of the cause of loss of

efficiency. Eesistance of the generator itself is a principal cause, and the loss from

this cause varies as the square of the current, and would be much greater with the

high currents proposed by Lord Rayleigh for his elongated elliptical iron core than
in a secondary generator with a closed iron magnetic circuit. The efficiency which
Lord Rayleigh proposes to gain in hysteresial dissipation is proportional to the
current. The loss due to resistance is proportional to the square of the current.

     Throughout this investigation I have assumed that magnetic induction does not
lag behind the magnetic force.

     The second part of this paper has relation to the molecular hypothesis. This
hypothesis as developed by Weber and Maxwell gives no account of hysteresis.

--Ewing has proposed a further assumption that a molecule has a friction (not a

viscous friction, but what "VMiewell called stiction) which prevents it from turning
until the turning force exceeds a constant value C

    It seems to me that the fewer assumptions we make the more near to the truth
                                                                        ;

552 BEPORT--1886.

are we likely to be. Weber has made the assumption that a coBstant force tends
to restore the molecule to its original position. The simpler assumption seems to

be that in ideally soft iron the molecules take up positions depending upon the
influence of the others. I suppose that when there is no magnetisation the mole-
cules naturally group themselves in pairs with poles of opposite name in juxta-
position, and that the value of the resolved part of the magnetic force required to

Kseparate them must reach a certain value before any deflection takes place, and

then the deflected molecule sets itself in the direction of the magnetic force. This

Hseems to be a very likely hypothesis for iron of ideal softness. If be the magnetic

force and 6 the inclination of the axis of a pair of molecules to the magnetic force,
the molecules acted upon and set with their axis parallel to the direction of the

force are those for which sin 6 is greater than --. . The number of these varies

                                                                                             11

as the magnetisation. Calling the magnetisation I, we have

                                                                                                                7r

The curve deduced from this has the characteristics of extremely soft annealed
ii'on. The only want of resemblance is the suddenness in the rise of the curve

Hafter has reached the value K. This would doubtless be smoothed by any want

of perfect mobility of the molecules such as is involved in Maxwell's addition to
Weber's hypothesis, which must be taken into account in explaining the behaviour
of steel which has no connection with the cause of hysteresis.

      After a certain magnetisation is attained the magnetisation of the iron (if there
be no demagnetising influence of ends) must retain each molecule in its axial

direction, and the demagnetisation cannot commence until a reverse magnetic force

is applied.

     The effects deduced from this hypothesis are the same in character as those
deduced from Swing's friction hypothesis, but it seems to me that perfect mobility
rather than friction is more likely to be the explanation of a property specially
possessed by the softest kinds of iron, and I have thought that the hypothesis is at
least worthy of consideration.

   16. On a new System of Electrical Control for Uniform-motion Clocks.
                                By Howard Grubb, F.B.S.

     The two systems of electrically controlled clocks in use for di-iving astronomical
telescopes possess in common some disadvantages.

     1. At best they can only correct the rate of the clock itself, and have no power

to correct any error in the train of wheels between the clock and the endless screw
which drives the instrument.

     2. The checking apparatus acts on the clock governor itself, altering its rate
and as that portion of the instrument has a considerable vis inertice there is a
liability to a slight oscillation in rate after a correction is made.

     In the new system the author has endeavoured to avoid these disadvantage.s.
     The ' detector ' portion of the apparatus is attached directly, or almost so, to the

screw spindle itself, and the acceleration or retardation is effected by the temporary
introduction of a differential gearing into the train of wheels between the clock and
the screw spindle.

 17. Design for luorking the Equatorial and Dome of ' Lick ' Observatory,
         California, by Hydraulic Power. By Howard Gkubb, F.B.S.

      In the case of very large astronomical telescopes it is desirable to relieve the

observer as much as possible from the great physical exertion required to work the

instrument, dome, observing chair, &c.
     The author has worked out a system of hydraulic machinery which effects all

the necessary operations and at the same time brings them under the complete

control of oue individual.

     This was illustrated by a working model in which the hydraulic apparatus
was represented by clockwork governed, as in the case of the actual apparatus, by

·electricity.

                  2. On Lithanode. By Desmond G. Pitz-Gerald.

     It is claimed for this substance that it is the negative element par e.vcellence for
Toltaic batteries, primary or secondary, and also a perfect anode for the electrolytic

separation of the most electro-negative elements, e.g., chlorine. No other substance

fulfils all the desiderata for a negative voltaic element, and no other substance that
can be generally employed as an anode in electrolysis is unattackable by chlorine.
Lithanode is peroxide of lead in a dense, coherent, and highly conductive form. It
constitutes a step in the series of inventions, initiated by Plants and continued by
Faure, Volckmar, and others, by which the secondary battery has been perfected.

By this step local action in the negative element, a defect of all secondary batteries

excepting those constructed with lithanode, is entirely precluded. Lithanode is
obtained by moulding a plastic mass of oxide of lead with the solution of a salt,
such as ammonic sulphate, which is gradually decomposed by the oxide of lead.
The effect of the gradual chemical action is to cause the substance to ' set,' and to
acquire a high degree of cohesion and hardness. The mass is then electrolytically
converted into a peroxide of lead differing from other forms of this substance, and
withstands perfectly the processes of ' charging ' and ' discharging,' however rapidly

--these may be effected. 'The advantages attending the use of lithanode in secondary

batteries are 1, a permanent negative element; 2, economy of power; and 3,
diminished weight. The advantage in commercial processes of electrolysis is that
lithanode constitutes a cheap electrode, and the only one not attackable by

chlorine.

3. Draper Memorial Photographs of Stellar Spectra exhibiting Bright Lines.

                          By Professor Edward C. Pickering.

     The spectra of ordinary stars, whether examined directly by the eye or
indirectly by means of photography, present little variety. The comparatively
few cases of deviation from the usual type are therefore particularly interesting,
and the occurrence of bright lines in a stellar spectrum constitutes perhaps the

Fmost singular exception to the general rule. The brightness of the line in the

spectra of y Cassiopeise and fi Lyrte was noticed by Secchi. Rayet afterwards
found three rather faint stars in Cygnus, the light of which was largely concen-
trated in bright lines or bands. The adoption at Harvard College Observatory of
--554 BEPOET 1886.

a system of sweeping, with a direct-vision prism attached to the eyepiece of the

equatorial telescope, resulted in the discovery by the present writer of several

additional objects of the same class. Still more recently Dr. Copeland, during a
journey to the Andes, has extended the list by the discovery of some similar stars

in the southern heavens.

    Among the photographic observations which have been undertaken at Harvard-

College Observatory, as a memorial to the late Professor Henry Draper, is included

a series of photographs of the spectra of all moderately bright stars visible in

Athe latitude of the observatory.       recent photograph of the region in Cygnus

previously known to contain four spectra exhibiting bright lines has served to

bring to our knowledge four other spectra of the same Innd. One of these is that

of the comparatively bright star P. Cygni, in which bright lines, apparently due to

hydrogen, are distinctly visible. This phenomenon recalls the circumstances of
the outburst of light in the star T. Coronae, especially when the former history of
P. Cygni is considered. According to Schonfeld it first attracted attention as an
apparently new star in 1600, and fluctuated greatly during the seventeenth
century, finally becoming a star of the fifth magnitude, and so continuing to the
present time. It has recently been repeatedly observed at Harvard CoUege Ob-
servatory with the meridian photometer, and does not appear to be undergoing

any variation at present.
     Another of the stars shown by the photograph to have bright lines is D.M. + 37°

3821, where the lines are unmistakably evident, and can readilj' be seen by direct
observation vnth the prism. The star has been overlooked, however, in several

previous examinations of the region, which illustrates the value of photography in

the detection of objects of this kind.

The other two stars first shown by the photograph to have spectra containing

bright lines are relatively inconspicuous. The following list contains the desig-

nations, according to the Durchmusterung, of all eight stars, the first four being
those previously known: 35° 4001, 3.5° 4013, 36° .3956, 36° 3987, 37° 3821,.
38° 4010, 37° 3871, 35° 3952 or 3963. Of these 37° 3871 is P. Cygiii, and
37° 3821 is the star in the spectrum of which the bright lines are most distinct.

          4, An Apparatus for determwiing the Hardness of Metals.
                                By Thomas Turner, A.B.S.M.

     Hitherto there have been but few attempts to quantitatively determine the
relative hardness of metals. The method adopted by the United States Govern-
ment in 1856 consisted in the punching of a hole by a tool in the form of a
pyramid and under a constant pressure. The indentation was carefully measured,

its capacity calculated, and in this way relative hardness was expressed. But it
has been shown that the results obtained reaUy depended in part upon tenacity,

and so were not accurate representations of hardness. In 1859 Calvert and John-
son employed a modification of the same methodj which was further improved by
Bottone in 1873.

     The apparatus recommended by the author is an adoption of the method which
has already been employed in determinations of the hardness of minerals, namely,
by scratching the surface with a weighted diamond. The diamond is attached to
a graduated beam arranged so as to allow of motion in both a horizontal and a

vertical plane. By means of a sliding weight, sufficient pressure is applied to cause

a distinct scratch on drawing the diamond over a smooth surface of the metal to
be tested. The weight is then moved until the diamond just ceases to produce a
visible scratch, when the position of the weight on the scale is observed. Some
experience is necessary in observing the scratch, but when this has been obtained
the apparatus gives uniform results.

     The author's experiments with cast iron have shown fhe common idea that

hardness and tenacity necessarily accompany each other to be erroneous. Very soft
cast iron can be obtained with a high tensile strength, while hard cast-iron has
 very often a low tensile strength. A\Tien metal has to be worked, unnecessary
            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                       555

hardness leads to useless expenditure of power and tools, and in such circum-
stances a soft metal is much to be desired.

     The apparatus is intended to be used in connection with tensile tests of the
metal, and in this way afifords valuable information as to the mechanical properties

of the material.

                    5. On Star Photography.
            By Isaac Roberts, F.B.A.8., F.G.S.

     During the past eighteen months I have been at work taking photographic
negatives with a twenty -inch silver on glass reflector for the purpose of mapping
the stars in the northern hemisphere, between the pole and the equator, and up to

the present time about four hundred plates, each covering four square degrees of

sky, inclusive of overlap, have been secured between the pole and declination fifty-

seven degrees. The extent of the work done would have been much greater if the

weather had permitted.
    The negatives are exposed for fifteen minutes, which is sufficient time to show

very faiat stars, the magnitudes of which have not yet been determined. Stars of

the ninth magnitude are photographed faintly in one second.

     Recently I received from Admiral Mouchez, the Director of the Paris Observa-
tory, four magnificent enlarged photographs of stars in the constellation Oygnus

taken with the 13-inch refractor made by MM. Henry. The negatives were

taken one in June and three in August last year, and I deemed it desirable to direct

my 20-inch reflector on to the same sky spaces, and take negatives at the corre-

sponding time this year, with similar duration of exposures, namely, sixty minutes

each, so as to enable comparisons to be made between the results obtained with

two instruments constructed on different principles and with unequal apertures.
     The five photographs which were exhibited are the result. Those marked Nos.

M1 and 2 have 21'' 2", and Declination -i- 38° 12', one being exposed for thirty-four
Mminutes, and the other for sixty minutes. No. 3 has 19" 45", and Declination
M M+ 35° 30'. No. 4 has 19" 55'^, and DecUnation + 37° 45'. No. 5 has 20" 4",

and Declination + 35° 30'.
     The enlargements have been made to correspond very nearly with MSI. Henry's

photographs, and on comparing them with these it will at once be observed that

the appearance of the star discs difiers. In the Henry photographs the discs are
round, with perfectly sharp circumferences, whilst the reflector shows them round,

but with circumferences somewhat undefined, and presenting more the diffraction

appearances which always accompany telescopic eye-observations of stars.
    Another very striking difi'erence is the equal brightness of the Henry star

discs. Fifteenth or sixteenth magnitude stars seem as bright as those of first magni-

tude, and difl'er from them only in the diameter of discs, whereas the reflector
shows gradations between the brightest and faintest stars that wiU severely tax

the powers of classification. They diminish till they are lost in the colour of the

film on the paper, and on the negatives they can be traced to still fainter degrees,
and the imagination finds no difficulty in following the diminution till space from

oui' point of view appears to be filled with stars.

The reflector also seems to have the advantage over the refractor in the number

of stars photographed in a given time ; for instance, if I select at random any square

inch of surface upon one of the Henry's plates, and count the stars in it, they number,

mysay, fifty-nine ; but in the same space on    plate they number 109, bein^ in the

ratio of nearly two to one. Of course this is a rough mode of making the

comparison, but it is the readiest method available at present.

    The plates which I now submit are not to be considered exceptional or picked,

but as average samples of those I can produce on any moderately clear night with

the mirror film in an average state of polish.

     If the photographs numbered 1 and 2 be compared with each other the relative

number of the stars which were imprinted on the films with thirty-four and sixty

minutes respective exposures may be counted.

   A photograph of my duplex telescope and observatory at Maghull was alsO'

exhibited.

6. Exhibition and Description of Miller's portable Torsion Magnetic Meter.

                               By Professor James Blyth.

The armature is formed of five small bars of soft iron, 5 mm. long, and weighing

1 gramme.

The index wheel has its rim divided into y|ot^S) ^^^ carries the outer end of a

flat spiral spi'ing, the inner end of which is firmly fixed to the long axis which

Acarries the small armature bars.  fixed pointer projects from the ends of the

case across the edge of the disc, and another pointer is fixed to the armature axis.

In the normal position the pointers both point to the zero of the scale.

    When the armatures are placed in a magnetic field they are turned roimd and

are brought back to their zero position by coiling the spring through a definite

Aangle depending upon the strength of the field.  constant is determined for the

instrument by experiments in a field of known strength, or if necessary it can be

empirically graduated.

It is hoped that the instrument will be found of service to makers of dynamos

for finding the strength of the field in various parts, and also for finding the best

forms of pole pieces.

There was also exhibited a form of small attraction magnetometer.

           7. On the Protection of Life and Property from Lightning}
                                    By W. McGregok.

     The paper proposes the formation of a committee with the following aims and

objects:

     (a) To travel, and by means of illustrated lectures or papers to awaken general

interest in this vital subject.

     (h) In a plain journal to publish details of any serious disasters, with pro-
fessional opinion in language to be easily understood by the public.

     (e) To provide scientific advice and co-operation.
     (d) To bring about esijrit de corps amongst architects, engineers, builders,
and manufacturers of Ughtning conductors.
     (e) To advise and encourage authorities whose duty it is to protect life and
property to employ the means provided by science.
     (/) To encourage and support insurance companies to insist on employment of
these means, and to frame a clause in the policy to enforce proper inspection and

testing.

     {(/) To insist upon architects showing the arrangements of metal in buildings,
the uatm-e and position of the means adopted for protection against lightning.

     (h) To investigate (if not already known) the cause why in a general assembly
it occurs that men are more frequently killed or injured than women, and why

certain localities are more specially selected by lightning.
      {{) Finally to enable the society, branch, or committee to illustrate to the

public the practicability of secm-ing perfect safety at a minimum cost, and to

have the lightning conductors or system of conductors as easily governed and
tested as the gas-pipes, and the tests read ofi' as simply and inexpensively as the
reading of the meter, which can be accomplished by observing the following

 rules :

     (1) Employ none but qualified persons.
      (2) Avoid extra expense and trouble by having testing-wires fixed at once.
     (3) Do not grudge an extra length of conductor if required by the nature of the

soil near the building. When you are selecting land for cultivation, or soil for

8. An improved Form of Clinometer. By John Hopkinson, F.L.8., F.G.S.

   A ' day-and-night ' compass-card is set to true N. over the compass-needle

which necessarily points to magnetic N. The diameter of the card is less than the
length of the needle, the points of the needle therefore projecting beyond the card,
so that the correction made is seen and can be adjusted wlien required. The same
result woidd be attained by placing the card below the needle. The clinometer
' dip ' is as usual below the magnetic needle, and can be easily seen outside the
compass-card. The advantage of being able to take the amount and direction of
the dip of strata with a single instrument without loss of time and liability to error
in making the correction for magnetic deviation, and at the same time having the
points of the compass exposed for more minute observation, must be obvious.

           Section E.--CHEMICAL SCIENCE.

--President of the Section William Crookes, F.K.S., V.P.C.S.

            THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2.

The President delivered the following Address :

A glance over the Presidential Addresses delivered before this Section on former

occasions will show that the occupiers of this chair have ranged over a fairly wide

field. Some of my predecessors have given a general survey of the progress of

chemical science during the past year ; some, takmg up a technological aspect of

the subject, have discussed the bearings of chemistry upon our national industries

others, again, have passed in review the various institutions in this country for

teaching chemistry ; and in yet other cases the speaker has had the opportunity of
bringing before the scientific world, for the first time, an account of some important

original researches.

    On this occasion I venture to ask your attention to a few thoughts on the very

--foundations of chemistry as a science on the nature and the probable, or at least

possible, origin of the so-called elements. If the views to which I have been led

may at first glance appear heretical, I must remind you that in some respects they

are shared more or less, as I shall subsequently show, by not a few of the most

eminent authorities, and notably by one of my predecessors in this chair, Dr. J. H.

Gladstone, F.R.S., to whose brilliant address, delivered in 1883, 1 must beg to

refer you.

     Should it not sometimes strike us, chemists of the present day, that after all

we are in a positioa unpleasantly akin to that of our forerunners, the alchemists of

the Middle Ages ? These necromancers of a time long past did not, indeed, draw
80 sharp a line as do we between bodies simple and compound yet their life-task

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

was devoted to the formation of new combinations, and to the attempt to transmute

--bodies which we commonly consider as simple and ultimate that is, the metals.

In the department of synthesis they achieved very considerable successes ; in the

transmutation of metals their failure is a matter of history.

    But what are we of this so-called Nineteenth Centui-y doing in our laboratories
and our libraries ? Too many of us are content to acquii-e simply what others have

already observed and discovered, with an eye directed mainly to medals, certifi-

cates, diplomas, and other honours recognised as the fruits of 'passing.' Others

are seeking to turn the determined facts of  chemistry to  useful pm-poses                                                                         whilst a
                                                                                                                                                ;

third class, sometimes not easily distinguished from the second, are daily educing

novel organic compounds, or are racking their ingenuity to prepare artificially some

product which Nature has hitherto furnished us through the instrumentality of
plants and animals. The practical importance of such investigations, and their

bearing on the industrial arts and on the purposes and needs of daily life, have been

signally manifested during the last half-century.

Still a fourth class of inquirers, working at the very confines of our knowledge,

find themselves occasionally at least face to face with a barrier which has hitherto

proved impassable, but which must be overthrown, surmounted, or txirned, if che-

mical science is ever to develop into a definite, an organised unity. This barrier

is nothing less than the chemical elements commonly so called, the bodies as yet
undecomposed into anything simpler than themselves. There they extend before us,
:as stretched the wide Atlantic before the gaze of Columbus, mocking, tauntino-,
and murmuring strange riddles, which no man yet has been able to solve.

The first riddle, then, which we encounter in chemistry is, ' What are the

elements ? ' Of the attempts hitherto made to define or explain an element none

satisfy the demands of the human intellect. The text-books tell us that an element

is ' a body which has not been decomposed '; that it is ' a something to which we

can add, but from which we can take away nothing,' or ' a body which increases

in weight with every chemical change.' Such definitions are doubly unsatisfac-

tory : they are provisional, and may cease to-morrow to be appUcable in any given

·case. They take their stand, not on any attribute of the things to be defined, but

on the limitations of human power                                                                                                                                      they are confessions of inteUectual impotence.
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

Just as to Columbus long philosophic meditation led him to the fixed belief of

the existence of a yet untrodden world beyond that waste of Atlantic waters, so to

our most keen-eyed chemists, physicists, and philosophers a Variety of phenomena

suggest the conviction that the elements of ordinary assiunption are not the

ultimate boundary in this direction of the knowledge which man may hope to

attain. Well do I remember, soon after I had obtained evidence of the distinct

nature of thallium, that Faraday said to me, ' To discover a new element is a very
fine thing, but if you could decompose an element and tell us what it is made of
that would be a discovery indeed wortli making.' And this was no new specula-

tion of Faraday's, for in one of his early lectures he remarked, 'At present we
begin to feel impatient, and to wish for a new state of chemical elements. For a
time the desire was to add to the metals, now we wish to diminish their number. .
To decompose the metals, then, to reform them, to change them from one to

another, and to realise the once absurd notion of transmutation are the problems

now given to the chemist for solution.'

     Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his hypothesis of the constitution of matter, says :
' All material substances are divisible into so-caUed elementary substances composed

of molecular particles of the same nature as themselves ; but these molecular particles
are complicated structures consisting of congregations of truly elementary atoms,
identical in nature and differing only in position, arrangement, motion, '&c., and
the molecules or chemical atoms are produced from the true or physical atoms by
processes of evolution under conditions which chemistry has not yet been able to

reproduce.'

Mr. Norman Lockyer has shown, I think on good evidence, that, in the

heavenly bodies of the highest temperature, a large number of our reputed ele-

ments are dissociated, or, as it would perhaps be better to say, have never been

formed.                                      Mr. Lockyer holds that ' the temperature                                                                                  of the sun and the electric
                                          _

·arc is high enough to dissociate some of the so-called chemical elements, and give

us a glimpse of the spectra of               their bases ; and he likewise says that                                                                                   ' a terrestrial

element is an exceedingly complicated thing that is broken up into simpler things

at the temperature of the sun, and some of these thuigs exist in some sun-spots,

while other constituents exist in others.'

The late Sir Benjamin Brodie, in a lecture on Ideal Chemistry delivered before
-- Wethe Chemical Society in 1867, goes even further than this. He says : '
                                                                                                                                                                       may

conceive that, in remote time or in remote space, there did exist formerly, or

-- Wepossibly do exist now, certain simpler forms of matter than we find on the surface
of our globe a, x, I, v, and so on. . . .                                                                                                                              may consider that in remote ages the

temperature of matter was much higher than it is now, and that these other things

-- --existed then in the state of perfect gases separate existences uncombmed. . .

We may then conceive that the temperature began to fall, and these things to com-

bine with one another and to enter into new forms of existence, appropriate to the
Wecircumstances in which they were placed. . . .
                                                                                                                                                                       may further consider that, as

the temperature went on falling, certain forms of matter became more permanent
Weand more stable, to the exclusion of other forms. . . .
                                                                                                                                                                       may conceive of this

--when once formed, could never be decomposed iu fact, that the resolution of

these hodies iuto their component elements could never occur again. You would

then have something of our present system of things. . . .

    ' Now this is not purely an imagination, for when we look upon the surface of
our globe we have actual evidence of similar changes in Nature. . . . When we

look at some of the facts which have been revealed to us by the extraordinary

analyses which have been made of the matter of distant worlds and nebulae, by

means of the spectroscope, it does not seem incredible to me that there may even be

evidence, some day, of the independent existence of such things as x and v.'

    In his Bui-nett Lectures ' On Light as a Means of Investigation,' Professor

--Stokes, speaking of a line in the spectrum of the nebulae, says : * It may possibly

indicate some form of matter more elementary than any we know on earth. There

seems no a priori improbability in such a supposition so great as to lead us at once

to reject it. Chemists have long speculated on the so-called elements, or many of

them, being merely verj' stable compounds of elements of a higher order, or even

perhaps of a single kind of matter.'

In 1868 Graham wrote of Sir W. Thomson's vortex-ring theory, as enlivening

' matter into an individual existence and constituting it a distinct substance or

element.'

    From these passages, which might easily be multiplied, it plainly appears that

--the notion not necessarily of the decomposability, but at any rate of the com-
--plexity of our supposed elements is, so to speak, in the air of science, waiting to

take a further and more definite development. It is important to keep before

men's minds the idea of the genesLs of the elements ; this gives some form to our

conceptions, and accustoms the mind to look for some physical production of

atoms. It is still more important, too, to keep in view the great probability that

there exist in Nature laboratories where atoms are formed and laboratories where

Weatoms cease to be.  are on the track and are not daunted, and fain would we

enter the mysterious region which ignorance tickets ' Unknown.' It is for us

--to strive to unravel the secret composition even of the so-called elements to
--undauntedly persevere and 'still bear up right onward.'

If we adopt the easy-going assumption that the elements, whether self-existent

or created, are absolutely and primordially distinct ; that they existed as we now

find them prior to the origin of stars and their attendant planets, constituting, in

Wewefact, the primal ' tire-mist,'
                      are little, if any, the wiser.           look at their

number and at their distinctive properties, and we ask, Are all these points acci-

dental or determinate ? In other words, might there as well have been only 7, or

700, or 7,000 absolutely distinct elements as the 70 (in round numbers) which we

now commonly recognise ? The number of the elements does not, indeed, com-

mend itself to our reason from any « priori or extraneous considerations. Might

their properties have conceivably diflered from those which we actually observe ?

Are they formed by 'a 'fortuitous concatenation,' or do they constitute together a

definite whole, in which each has its proper part to play, and from which none

could be extruded without leaving a recognisable deficiency ?

If their peculiarities were accidental it would scarcely be possible for the ele-

ments to display those mutual relations which we find brought into such prominent

light and order in the periodic classification of Newlands, Mendeleeff, and Meyer.

Has not the relation between the atomic weights of the three halogens, chlorine,

bromine, and iodine, and their serially varying properties, physical and chemical,

been worn nearly threadbare ? And the same with the calcium and the sulphur

groups ? Surely the probability of such relations existing among some 70 bodies

which had come into fortuitous existence would prove to be vanishingly small

    We ask whether these elements may not have been evolved from some few

-- --antecedent forms of matter or possibly from only one such just as it is now held
that all the innumerable variations of plants and animals have'been developed from

fewer and earlier forms of organic life ? As Dr. Gladstone well puts it, they

* have been built up one from another, according to some general plan.' This

building up, or evolution, is above all things not fortuitous : the variation and
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  561

development which we recognise in the univeree run alono- certain fixed lines which
have been preconceived and foreordained. To the careless and hasty eye design
and evolution seem antagonistic ; the more careful inquirer sees that evolution,

steadily proceeding along an ascending scale of excellence, is the strongest argu-
ment in favour of a preconceived plan.

     The array of the elements cannot fail to remind us of the general aspect of the
organic world. In hoth cases we see certain groups well filled up, even crowded,
with forms having among themselves but little specific difference. On the other
hand, ia both, other forms stand widely isolated. Both disjilay species that are

--common and species that are rare ; both have groups widely distributed it might

be said cosmopolitan-- and other gi'oups of very restricted occurrence. Among
animals I may mention as instances the Monotremata of Australia and New

Guinea, and among the elements the metals of the so-called rare earths.
     Now, as these facts in the distribution of organic forms are generally considered

lay biological experts to rank among the weightiest evidences in favour of the origin
of species by a process of evolution, it seems natural, in this case as in the other,
to view existing elements not as primordial but as the gradual outcome of a process
of development, possibly even of a ' struggle for existence.' Bodies not in harmony

with the present general conditions have disappeared, or perhaps have never

--existed. Others--the asteroids among the elements have come into being, and

have survived, but only on a limited scale ; whilst a third class are abundant

because surroimding conditions have been favoui-able to their formation and

preservation.

     The analogy here suggested between elements and organisms is, indeed, not the
closest, and must not be pushed too far. Fi'om the nature of the case there cannot
occur in the elements a difference corresponding to the difference between living
and fossil organic forms. The ' great stone book ' can tell us nothing of extinct
elements. Nor would I for a moment suggest that any one of our present elements,
however rare, is like a rare animal or plant in process of extinction ; that any new

element is in the course of formation, or that the properties of existing elements are
gradually undergoing modification. All such changes must have been confined to

that period so remote as not to be grasped by the imagination, when our Earth, or
rather the matter of which it consists, was in a state very different from its present
condition. The epoch of elemental development is decidedly over, and I may
observe that in the opinion of not a few biologists the epoch of organic development
is verging upon its close.

     Making, however, every allowance for these distinctions, if evolution be a

cosmic law, manifest in heavenly bodies, in organic individuals, and in organic

species, we shall in all probability recognise it, though under especial aspects, in

tliose elements of which stars and organisms are in the last resort composed.
     Is there, then, in the first place, any direct evidence of the transmutation of

any supposed 'element' of our existing list into another, or of its resolution into
anything simpler ?

    To this question I am obliged to reply in the negative.

     I doubt whether any chemist here present could suggest a process which would

hold out a reasonable prospect of dissociating any of our accepted simple bodies.

The highest temperatures and the most powerful electric currents at our disposal
have been tried, and tried in vain. At one time there seemed a possibility at least
that the interesting researches of Prof. Victor jMeyer might show tiie two higher
members of the halogen group, bromine and iodine, as entering upon the path of

dissociation. These hopes have not been fulfilled. It maj' be said, in the general
opinion of the most eminent and judicious chemists, that none of the phenomena
thus elicited prove that even an approach has been made to the object in view.

     Even if we leave our artificial laboratories and seek an escape from the diffi-
culty by observing the processes of the great laboratories of Nature, we feel no

sufficiently firm ground.

   We --find ourselves thus driven to indirect evidence to that which we may

glean from the mutual relations of the elementary bodies. Such evidence of great

value is by no means lacking, and to this I now beg to direct attention. First, we

562 REPOET-- 1886.

may consider the conclusion arrived at by Herscliel, and pursued by Clerk -Maxwell,

that atoms hear the impress of manulactured articles. Let us look a little more

Aclosely at this view.     manufactured article may well be supposed to involve a

manufacturer. But it does somethino^ more : it implies certain!}' a raw material,

and probably, though not certainly, the existence of by-products, residues, paralei-

pomena. AVhat or where is here the raw material ? Can we detect any form of

matter which bears to the chemical elements a relation like that of a raw material

--to the finished product like that, say, of coal-taj' to alizarin ? Or can we recognise

any elementary bodies which seem like waste or refuse ? Or are all the elements,

according to the common view coequals ? To these questions no direct answer is

as yet forthcoming.

And this leads us up to a hypothesis which, if capable of full demonstration,

would show us that the accepted elements are not coequal, but have been formed

by a process of expansion or evolution. I refer to the well-known hypothesis of

Prout, which regards the atomic weights of the elements as multiples, by a series

of whole numbers, of uuity = the atomic weight of hydrogen. Everyone is aware

that the recent more accurate determinations of the atomic weights of different

elements do not by any means bring them into close harmony with the values

which Prout's law would require. Still in no small number of cases the actual

atomic weights approach so closely to those which the hij-[3othesis demands that

we can scarcely regard the coincidence as accidental. Accordingly, not a few

chemists of admitted eminence consider that we have here an expression of the

truth, masked by some residual or collateral phenomena which we have not yet

succeeded in eliminating.

     The original calculations on which the most accurate numbers for the atomic

weights are founded have recently been recalculated by Mr. F. W. Clarke. In

bis concluding remarks, speaking of Prout's law, Mr. Clarke says that 'none of

the seeming e.xceptious are inexplicable. In short, admitting half-multiples as

legitimate, it is more probable that the few apparent exceptions are due to un-

detected constant errors than that the great number of close agreements should be

xaerely accidental. I began this recalculation of the atomic weights with a strong

prejudice against Prout's hypothesis, but the facts as they came before me have

forced me to give it a very respectful consideration.'

But if the evidence in favour of Prout's hypothesis in its original guise is

deemed insufficient, may not Mr. Clarke's suggestion of half-multiples place it upon

an entirely new basis? Suppose that the unit of the scale, the body whose atomic

weight, if multiplied by a series of whole numbers, gives the atomic weights of the

remaining elements, is not hydrogen, but some element of still lower atomic weight ?

We --are here at once reminded of helium an element purely hypothetical as far as

our Earth is concerned, but supposed by many authorities, on the faith of spectro-

scopic observations, to exist in the sun and in other stellar bodies. INIost solar

eruptions present merely the characteristic lines of hydrogen C, F, and H, and

along with them one particular line whicli at first was classed in the sodium group,

but which is a little more refrangible, and is designated by the s^-mbol D^. Ac-

cording to Mr. Norman Lockyer and the late Father Secchi, this ray undergoes

modifications not comparable to those afl'ecting other rays of the chromosphere.

In the corresponding region of the spectrum no dark ray has been observed. That
Hthe accompanying lines C, F, and
                                   pertain to hydrogen is evident ; and as J),

has never Ijeen obtained in any other spectrimi, it is supposed to belong to a body

foreign to our Earth, though existing in abundance in the chromosphere of the sun.

To this hypothetical body the name helium is assigned.

     In an able memoir on this subject, read before the Academy of Brussels, the
Abbe E. Sp^e showsthat,if helium exists, it enjoys two very remarkable properties.

Its spectrum consists of a single ra}', and its vapour possesses no absorbent power.

The simple single ray, though I believe unexampled, is by no means an impossible

phenomenon, and indicates a remarkable simplicity of molecular constitution. The

non-absorbent property of its vapour seems to be a serious objection to a general

physical law. Professor Tyndall has demonstrated that the absorptive power

increases with the complexity of molecular structure, and hence he draws the con-
clusion that the simpler the molecule the feebler the ahsoi'ption. This conclusion
the Abbe Spee regards as perfectly legitimate; but it neither explains nor even
necessitates the absence of all absorptive power.

     Granting that helium exists, all analogy points to its atomic weight being

below that of hydrogen. Here, then, we may have the very element, with

atomic weight half that of hydrogen, required by Mr. Clarke as the basis of

Prout's law.

     But a more important piece of evidence for the compound nature of the chemi-

cal elements has yet to be considered. Many chemists must have been struck with

certain peculiarities in the occurrence of the elements in the Earth's crust ; it is a

stale remark that we do not find them evenly distributed throughout the globe.

Nor are they associated in accordance with their specific gravities ; the lighter ele-

ments placed on or near the surface, and the heavier ones following serially deeper

and deeper. Neither can we trace any distmct relation between local climate and

mineral distribution. And by no means can we say that elements are always or

chiefly associated in nature in the order of their so-called chemical affinities ; those

which have a strong tendency to form with each other definite chemical combina-

tions being found together, whilst those which have little or no such tendency exist

Weapart.  certainly find calcium as carbonate and sulphate, sodium as chloride,

silver and lead as .sulphides ; but why do we find certain groups of elements with

little affinity for each other yet existing iu juxtaposition or commixtiu-e ? The

members of some of these groups are far from plentiful, not generally or widely

diflused, and certainly they ai'e not easy to separate.

As instances of such grouping we may mention

1. Nickel and cobalt, of which it may be said that had their compounds been

coloiu'less they would have been long regarded as identical, and possibly even yet

would not have been separated.

2. The two groups of platinum metals.

3. The so-caUed 'rare earths,' occurring in gadolinite, samarskite, &c. and

evidently becoming more numerous the more closely they are examined.

  --Certain questions here suggest themselves : Is the series of these elements

like a staircase or like an inclined plane ? Will they, the more closely they are

scrutinised, be found to fade away the more gradually the one into the other P

Further, will a mixture hitherto held to be simple, like {e.g.) didymium, be capable

of being split up in one direction only, or in several ? I have been led to ask this

.last question because I have separated from didymium bodies which seem to agree

neither with the praseodymium and neodymium of Dr. Auer von Welsbach, nor

with the components detected by M. de Boisbaudran and M. Demar^ay.

Why, then, are these respective elements so closely associated ? What agency

has brought them together ?

    An eminent physicist evades the difficulty by suggesting that their joint occur-

rence is simply an instance of the working of the familiar principle ' Birds of a

feather flock together.' In their chemical and physical attributes these rare earths

are so closely similar that they may be regarded as substantially identical in all

the circumstances of solution and precipitation to which they may have been

exposed during geological ages.

But do we, in point of fact, recognise any such agency at work in Nature ? Is

there any power which regularly and systematically sorts out the different kinds of

matter from promiscuous heaps, conveying like to like and separating unlike from

unlike ? I must confess that I fail to trace any such distributive agency, nor, in-

deed, do I feel able to form any distinct conception of its natiure.

I must here remark that coral worms in some cases do effect a separation of

certain kinds of matter. Thus a Gorgonia of the species Melithan, and Mussa

sinuosa, imdoubtedly eliminate from sea-water not merely lime, but even yttria
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and other recent corals, Pocillojiora dainicornis, and a Symphyllia close to the yttria-

secreting Mussa, separate samaria from sea-water. Sea-weeds and aquatic moUusks

contain a larger proportion of iodine and bromine than the waters which they

                                                                      oo2

inhabit, and may thus be said to separate out these elements from the chlorine with

which they are mingled.

But if we examine these cases of elimination we see that they are limited in

their scope. They extend only to substances existing in solution, of which there is

a fresh supply always at hand, and which are capable of entering into the animal

or vegetable economy. Again, the elimination of iodine and bromine, effected as

just described, is of a very imperfect character, and, when such water-plants and

animals die and decay, their constituents will be again distributed in the water.

   We cannot well consider that nickel and cobalt have been deposited in ad-

--mixture by organic agency, nor yet the groups iridium, osmium, and platinum
   ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium.
  --Since the earthy metals to which I have referred such as yttrium, samarium,

--holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, &c. are very rare, the probability of their

ever having been brought together in some few uncommmon minerals discovered

only in a few localities must be regarded as trifling indeed, if we suppose that

these metals had at any time been widely diffused in a state of great dilution with

other matter. The features which we have just recognised in these earths seem to

point to their formation severally from some common material placed in conditions

m each case nearly identical. The case is strengthened by a consideration of the

other groups of elements, also similar in properties, having little affinity for each

other and occurring in admixture ; either all or at least some of the elements con-

cerned being moreover decidedly rare. Thus we have nickel and cobalt not

plentiful or widely distributed                                                                                                                   cobalt,  perhaps,                             never  found    absolutely free from
                                                                                                                                               ;

nickel, and vice versa. AVe have also the two platinum groups, where very

similar features prevail.

A weighty argument in favour of the compound nature of the elements

is that drawn from a consideration of the compound radicles, or, as they

might be called, pseudo-elements. Their similarity with the accepted elements

is perfectly familiar to all chemists. If, for example, we suppose that in some age

or in some country men of science were cognisant of the existence and of the

behaviour of cyanogen, but had not succeeded in resolving it into its constituents,

nothing, surely, would prevent their viewing it as an element, and assigning it a

place with the halogens. It may fairly be held that if a body which we know to

be compound can be found playing the part of an element, this fact lends a certain

plausibility to the supposition that the elements also are not absolutely simple.

This line of thought, or at least one closely approximating to it, was worked out

by Dr. Camelley in a paper read before this Association at its last meeting. From

a comparison of the physical properties of inorganic with those of organic com-

pounds, Dr. Carnelley concludes that ' the elements, as a whole, are analogous to the

hydrocarbon radicles.'' This conclusion, if true, he adds, should lead to the fm-ther

inference that the so-called elements are not truly elementary, being made up of

Aat least two absolute elements, named provisionally and B. Hence, he argues,

it should be possible to build up a series of compounds of these two primary

elements which would correspond to what we now call elements. Such an

--arrangement, to be admissible, would have to fiilfil certain conditions : The

Asecondary elements thus generated from and B must exhibit the phenomena of

periodicity, and the series would have to form octaves : the entire system is bound

to display some feature corresponding to the ' odd and even series ' of Mendeleeffs

responding to the eighth gi-oup ; and, lastly, the atomic weights in such a system

ought to agree with the atomic weights as experimentally determined.

This last condition Dr. Carnelley rightly regards as the most crucial, and he

finds his arrangement gives atomic weights which in a majority of instances

coincide approximately with the actual atomic weights. Thus out of a total

of sixty -one elements whose atomic weights have been determined with at
                              --

. TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  565

least approximate accuracy, and whose places in the periodic system are not dis-
puted, twenty -seven agree almost exactly with the actual numbers, whilst nineteen
others are not more than one unit astray.

     For a detailed consideration of the conclusions which follow from Dr. Carnelley's

views I must refer to his paper as read at our last meeting. Two points bear more

--especially upon the subject now under consideration that is, if this speculation on

the genesis of the elements is well founded. First, the existence of elements of
identical atomic weights, isomeric with each other, would be possible ; as such
Dr. Carnelley mentions respectively nickel and cobalt (now found to have slightly

different atomic weights), rhodium and ruthenium, osmium and iridiiun, and the
metals of some of the rare earths. Secondly, in Dr. Carnelley's scheme all the
chemical elements save hydrogen are supposed to be composed of two simpler

A Aelements, = 12 and B = -- 2. Of these he regards as a tetrad identical with

--carbon, and B as a monad of negative weight perhaps the ethereal fluid of space.
     Dr. Carnelley's three primary elements therefore are carbon, hydrogen, and the

«ther.

     Starting from the supposition that pristine matter was once in an intensely
heated condition, and that it has reached its present state by a process of free
cooling. Dr. E. J. Mills suggests that the elements as we now have them are the

result of successive polymerisations. Dr. Mills reminds us that chemical substances

in the process of cooling naturally increase in density, and, if such increase be

measui-ed as a function of time or of temperature, we sometimes observe that there
are critical points corresponding to the formation of new and well-defined sub-

stances. In this manner, ordinary phosphorus is converted into the red variety,

I is transformed into I,,, So becomes S^, and 'NO., N.^O^. Among organic bodies

styrol, in like manner, according to Dr. Mills, is converted into metastyrol, aldehyd
into paraldehyd, the cyanates into cyanurates, and turpentine into metatereben-

thene. At the critical points above referred to heat is liberated in especial abun-
dance, and the bodies thus formed are known as polymers. If wo could gradually
cool down substances through a vast range of temperature, we should then pro-
bably discover a much greater number of such critical points, or points of multiple
proportion, than we have been able to discover experimentally.

     The heat given out in the act of poljTaerisation naturally reverses to some
extent the polymerisation itself, and so causes a partial return to the previous con-
dition of things. This forward and backward movement, several times repeated,

constitutes ' periodicity.' Dr. Mills regards variable stars as instances, now in

evidence, of the genesis of elementary bodies.

     From a study of the classification of the elements, Dr. Mills is of opinion that
the only known polymers of the primitive matter are arsenic, antimony, and perhaps
erbivuH and osmium ; whilst zirconium, ruthenium, samarium, and platinum approxi-

mate to the positions of other polymers. Hence, from this genetic view, these

elements may be described as products of successive polymerisations.

    I must now call attention to a method of illustrating the periodic law, proposed
ty my friend Professor Emerson Eeynolds, of the University of Dublin, which will

here assist us. Professor Reynolds points out that in each period the general pro-
perties of the elements vary from one to another with approximate regularity

tmtil we reach the seventh member, which is in more or less striking contrast with

the first element of the same period, as well as with the first of the next. Thus
chlorine, the seventh member of Mendeleeff's third period, contrasts sharply
both with sodium, the first member of the same series, and with potassium,
the first member of the next series; whilst, on the other hand, sodium
and potassium are closely analogous. The six elements whose atomic weights
intervene between sodium and potassium vary in properties, step by step, until
chlorine, the contrast to sodium, is reached. But from chlorine to potassium, the
analogue of sodium, there is a change in properties per saltum. Further, such
alternations of gradual and abrupt transitions are observed as the atomic weights

--increase. If we thus recognise a contrast in properties more or less decided
                                   ----                      --                     ;

between the first and the last members of each series, we can scarcely help admitting
the existence of a point of mean variation within each system. In general, the
fourth element of each series possesses the properties we might expect a transition-

--element to exhibit. If we examine a particular period for instance, that one

whose meso-element is silicon, we note : First, that the three elements of lower

atomic weight than silicon, viz. sodium, magnesium, and aluminium, are distinctly

electro-positive in character, while those of higher atomic weight, viz., phosphorus,
sulphur, and chlorine, are as distinctly electro-negative. Throughout the best known,

periods this remarkaljle subdivision is observable, although, as might be anticipated,
the differences become less strongly marked as the atomic weights increase.
Secondly, that the members above and below the meso-element fall into pairs of
 elements, which, while exhibiting certain analogies, are generally in more or less

direct chemical contrast. Thus, in the silicon period we have

                                   Si'"

                           + A1'"                  P'"-

                           + Mg"                   S"-

                           + Na'                   Cl'-

This division also happens, in many cases, to coincide with some characteristic

valence of the contrasted elements. It is noteworthy, however, that the members

on the electro-negative side exhibit the most marked tendency to variation in atom-

fixing power, so that valence alone is an untrustworthy guide to the probable posi-

tion of an element in a period.

     Thus for the purpose of graphic translation Professor Reynolds considers that

-- --the fourth member of a period silicon, for example may be placed at the apex of

a symmetrical curve, which shall represent, for that particular period, the direction

in which the properties of the series of elements vary with rising atomic weights.

In the drawing before you (fig. 1) I have modified Professor Reynolds's

mdiagram  one or two points. I have turned it the reverse way, as it is more

convenient to start from the top and proceed downwards. I have represented

the pendulous swing as gradually declining in amplitude according to a mathe-

matical law, and I have introduced another half-swing of the pendulimi between

cerium and lead, which not only renders the oscillations more symmetrical, but

brings gold, mercury, thallium, lead, and bismuth on the side where they are in

complete harmony with members of foregoing groups, instead of being out of har-

mony with them. This modification has another advantage, inasmuch as it leaves

many gaps to be hereafter filled in with new elements just when the development

of research is beginning to demand room for such expansion.

I do not, however, wish to infer that the gaps in Mendeleefi's table, and in this

graphic representation of it, necessarily mean that there are elements actually

existing to fill up the gaps ; these gaps may only mean that at the birth of the

elements there was an easy potentiality of the formation of an element which

would fit into the place.

Following the curve from hydrogen downwards we find that the elements form-

ing Mendeleefi's eighth group are to be found near three of the ten nodal points.

These bodies are ' interperiodic,' both because then- atomic weights exclude them

from the small periods into which the other elements fall, and because their

chemical relations with certain members of the adjacent periods show that they are

probably interperiodic in the sense of being transitional.

  --This eighth group is divided into the three triplets iron, nickel, and cobalt

rhodium, ruthenium, and palladium ; iridium, osmiiun, and platinum. The members,

of each triplet have often been regarded as modifications of one single form of matter.

Notice how accurately the series of like bodies fits into this scheme. Beginning

at the top, run the eye down analogous positions in each oscillation, taking either

the electro-positive or electro-negative swings :

--places gallium, indium, and thallium.

 nitrogen, vanadium, columbiiim ; nor erbium follow phosphorus, arsenic, antimony;
 iior thulium follow clilorine, bromine, iodine ; nor j'tterbium follow potassium,
 rubidium, caesium. The inference to be drawn is that these bodies are out of

--place, owing to their atomic weights not ha^nng been correctly determined an

 inference which is strengthened by the knowledge that the elementary character of
 some of these bodies is more than doubtful, whilst the chemical attributes of most
 of them are unknown.

     The more I study the arrangement of this zigzag curve the more I am convinced
 that he who grasps the key will be permitted to unlock some of the deepest

 mysteries of creation. Let us imagine if it is possible to get a glimpse of a few of
 the secrets here hidden. Let us picture the very beginnings of time, before
 geological ages, before the earth was thrown oft' from the central nucleus of molten
 fluid, before even the sun himself had consolidated from the original jirotyle}
 Let us still imagine that at this primal stage all was in an ultragaseous state, at a

 temperature inconceivably hotter - than anything now existing in the visible

 universe ; so high, indeed, that the chemical atoms could not yet have been
 formed, being still far above their dissociation-point. In so far as protyle is
 capable of radiating or reflecting light, this vast sea of incandescent mist, to an
 astronomer in a distant star, might have appeared as a nebula, showing in the
 spectroscope a few isolated lines, I'orecasts of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen

 spectra.

      But in courss of time some process akin to cooling, probably internal, reduces
 the temperature of the cosmic jn-oti/le to a point at which the first step in granula-
tion takes place ; matter, as we know it, comes into existence, and atoms are
formed. As soon as an atom is formed out of pr-otyle it is a store of energy,
 potential (from its tendency to coalesce with other atoms by gravitation or
 chemically) and kinetic (from its internal motions). To obtain this energy the
 neighbouring protyle must be refrigerated by it,' and thereby the subsequent
 formation of other atoms will be accelerated. But with atomic matter the
 various forms of energy which require matter to render them evident begin to act
 and, amongst others, that form of energy which has for one of its factors what we

now call atomic weight. Let us assume that the elementary proti/le contains within

itself the potentiality of every possible combining proportion or atomic weight.

Let it be granted that the whole of our known elements were not at this epoch
simultaneously created. The easiest formed element, the one most nearly allied to

-- --the protyle in simplicity, is first born. Hydrogen or shall we say helium ? of all

the known elements the one of simplest structure and lowest atomic weight, is the
first to come into being. For some time hydrogen would be the only form of matter
(as we now know it) in existence, and between hydrogen and the next formed
element there would be a considerable gap in time, during the latter part of which
the element next in order of simplicity would be slowly approaching its birth-
point : pending this period we may suppose that the evolutionary process which
soon was to determine the birth of a new element would also determine its

atomic weight, its affinities, and its chemical position.

    We' require a word, analogous to protoplasm, to express the idea of the original

primal matter existing before the evolution of the chemical elements. The word I
have ventured to u.se for this purpose is compounded of -irpd (earlier than) and Sxtj
(the stuff of which things are made). The word is scarcely a new coinage, for 600
years ago Eoger Bacon wrote in his Dc Arte Chymiee, ' The elements are made out
of i/'Xi), and every element is converted into the nature of another element.'

    ^ I am constrained to use words expressive of high temperature ; but I confess I
am unable clearly to associate with jnotyle the idea of hot or cold. Temperature,

radiation, and/ree coolhiy seem t3 require the periodic motions that take place in the
chemical atoms ; and the introduction of centres of periodic motion into protyle
would constitute its being .so far changed into chemical atoms.

    ' I am indebted to my friend G. Johnstone Stoney, F.R.S., for the idea here put

forward, as well as for other valuable suggestions and criticisms on some of the

theoretical questions here treated of.

      In the original genesis the longer the time occupied in that portion of the

cooling down during -which the hardening of the iirotyle into atoms took place,

the more sharply defined would be the resulting elements ; and, on the other hand,

with more irregularity in the original cooling, we should have a nearer approach
to the state of the elemental family such as we know it at present.

     In this way it is conceivable tbat the succession of events which gave us such

--groups as platinum, osmium, and iridium palladium, ruthenium, and rhodium

iron, nickel, and cobalt, if the operation of genesis had been greatly more prolonged,

would have resulted in the birth of only one element of these groups. It is also
probable that by a much more rapid rate of cooling, elements would originate even

more closely related than are nickel and cobalt, and thus we should have formed

the nearly allied elements of the cerium, yttrium, and similar groups ; in f^ct the

minerals of tlie class of samarskite and gadolinite may be regarded as the cosmical

--lumber-room where the elements in a state of arrested development the uncon-
--nected missing links of inorganic Darwinism are finally aggregated.

      I have said that the original protyle contained within itself the potentiality of

all possible atomic weights. It may well be questioned whether there is an abso-

lute uniformity in the mass of every ultimate atom of the same chemical element.

Probably our atomic weights merely represent a mean value around which the

actual atomic weights of the atoms vary within certain narrow limits.

Each well-detined element represents a platform of stability connected by

ladders of unstable bodies. In the first accreting together of the primitive stuif

the smallest atoms would form, then these would join together to form larger

groups, the gulf across from one stage to another would be gradually bridged over,

and the stable element appropriate to that stage would absorb, as it were, the un-
stable rungs of the ladder which led up to it. I conceive, therefore, that when we
say the atomic weight of, for instance, calcium is 40, we really express the fact that,

while the majority of calcium atoms have an actual atomic weight of 40, there

are not a few which are represented by 39 or 41, a less number by 38 or 42, and

Weso on.  are here reminded of Newton's ' old worn particles.'

Is it not possible, or even feasible, that these heavier and lighter atoms may

have been in some cases subsequently sorted out by a process resembling chemical

fractionation ? This sorting out may have taken place in part while atomic matter
was condensing from the primal state of intense ignition, but also it may have

been partly efiected in geological ages by successive solutions and reprecipitations

of the various earths.

     This may seem an audacious speculation, but I do not think it is beyond the

power of chemistry to test its feasibility. An investigation on which I have been
occupied for several years has yielded results which to me appear apposite to the

question, and I therefore beg permission here to allude briefly to some of the

results, reserving details to a subsequent communication to the Section.

    My work has been with the earths present in samarskite and gadolinite, separat-

ing them by systematic fractionation. Chemical fractionation, on which I hope to

say more on another occasion, is very similar to the formation of a spectrum with a

wide slit and a succession of shallow prisms. The centre portion remains un-

changed for a long time, and the only approach to purity at first is at the two ends,

while a considerable series of operations is needed to produce an appreciable change

in the centre. The groups of didymium and yttrium earths are those which have

chiefly occupied my attention. On comparing these rare earths we are at once
struck with the close mutual similarity, verging almost into identity, of the mem-

bers of the same group.

The phosphorescent spectra of these earths when their anhydrous sulphates are

submitted to the induction discharge in vacuo are extremely complicated, and change

in their details in a puzzling manner. For many years I have been persistently

groping on in almost hopeless endeavour to get a clue to the meaning I felt con-

vinced was locked up in these systems of bands and lines. It was impossible to

divest myself of the conviction that I was looking at a series of autograph inscrip-

tions from the molecular world, evidently of intense interest, but written in a strange

and baffling tongue. All attempts to deciplier the mysterious signs were, however,,
for a long time fruitless. I required a Rosetta stone.

    Down to a date comparatively recent nothing was more firmly fixed in my mind

than the notion that yttria was the oxide of a simple body, and that its phosphores-
cent spectrum gave a definite system of coloured bands, such as you see in the
drawing before you (fig. 2). Broadly speaking, there is a deep red band, a red
band, a very luminous citron-coloured band, a pair of greenish-blue bands, and a
blue band. It is true these bands varied slightly in relative intensities and in
sharpness with almost every sample of yttria I examined ; but the general cha-
racter of the spectriim remained unchanged, and 1 had got into the way of
looking upon this spectrum as characteristic of yttria : all the bands being visible

--when the earth was present in quantity, whilst only the strongest band of all the
--citron tjand was visible when traces, such as millionths, were present. But that

the whole system of bands spelled yttria, and nothing but yttria, I was firmly

convinced.

     During the later fractionations of the yttria earths, and the continued observa-

tions of their spectra, certain suspicions which had troubled me for some time

assumed consistent form. The bands which hitherto I had thought belonged tc
yttria began to vary in intensity among themselves, and continued fractionation

increased the dift'erences first observed. Whilst I was in this .state of doubt and

uncertainty, and only beginning to see my way towards arranging into a consis-

tent whole the facts daily coming to light, help came from an unexpected quarter.

M. de Marignac, wdth whom I had been for some time in correspondence, kindly
sent me a small .specimen of the earth which he had discovered and provisionally
named Ya (now Gadolinia). In the radiant-matter tube this earth gave a bright

spectrum, like the one in the diagram before you (fig. 3). The spectrum above it

(fig. 2) is that ascribed to yttria. Look at the two. Omitting minor detaDs, Ya

-- --is yttria with the chief characteristic band the citron band left out, and with

the double green band of samaria added to it. Now look at fig. 4, which represents

the .spectrum of a mixture of sixty-one parts of yttria and thirty-nine parts of

samaria. It is identical almost to its minutest detail with the spectrum of Y''a^
                   TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  571

--·with this not unimportant difterence the citron band is as prominent as any

other line. Ya consists, therefore, of samaria with the greenish bkie of yttria and

some of the other yttria bands added to it.

    I may aptly call the Ya spectrum my Rosetta stone. It threw a flood of light
on all the obscurities and contradictions I had found so plentiful, and showed me

that a much wider law than the one I had been working upon was the true law
governing the occurrence of these obscure phenomena. For what does the spectrum

of Ya show ? It proves that what I had hitherto thought was one of the chief

-- --bands in the yttria spectrum -the citron baud could be entirely removed, whilst

-- --another characteristic group the double green of yttria could also be separated

from the citron.

     It would exceed legitimate limits were I to enter into details respecting the

chemical and physical reasons which led me to these definite conclusions. To

settle one single point more than 2,000 fractionations have been performed.
     The meaning of the strongly marked symbolic lines had first to be ascertained.

For a long time I had to be content with roughly translating one gi'oup of coloured

symbols as ' yttrium ' and another group as ' samarium,' disregarding the fainter

lines, shadows, and wings frequently common to both. Constant practice
in the decipherment has now given me fuller insight into what I may call the
grammar of these hieroglyphic inscriptions. Every line and shadow of a line, each
faint wing attached to a strong band, and every variation in intensity of the shadows
and wings among themselves, now has a definite meaning which can be translated

into the common symbolism of chemistry.

     In a mineral containing the rarer earths those most widely separated in chemi-

cal properties are most easily obtained in a state of comparative purity by simple
chemical means. For instance, in separating didymium from lanthanum, or sama-

rium fi-om yttrium, a few simple chemical reactions and a little waste will give

these bodies in a state of purity ; but when it comes to splitting up yttrium into
its components ordinary- chemical separation is useless, and fractionation must be
pushed to the utmost limit, many thousand operations and enormous waste of

material being necessarj' to effect even a partial separation.
     Returning, therefore, after this explanatory digression, to the idea of heavy and

light atoms, we see how well this hypothesis accords with the new facts here

brought to light. From every chemical point of view the stable molecular group,,

yttrium, behaves as an element. Excessive and systematic fractionation has acted

the part of a chemical 'sorting Demon,' distributing the atoms ofyttriuminto several

groups, with certainly different phosphorescent spectra, and presumably diflerent

atomic weights, though all these groups behave alike from the usual chemical
point of view. Here, then, is one of the elements the spectrum of which does not

emanate equally from all its atoms, but some atoms furnish some, other atoms

others, of the lines and bands of the compound spectrum of the element. And as

this is the case with one element, it is probably so in a greater or less degree with

all. Hence the atoms of this element difler probably in weight, certainly in the

internal motions they undergo.

Another important inference which may be drawn from the facts is that the^

atoms of which yttrium consists, though differing, do not differ continuously^

Webut per saltum.  have evidence of this in the fact that the spectroscopic bands

characteristic of each group are distinct from those of the other groups, and do not

pass gradually into them. "We must accordingly expect, in the present state of

science, that this is probably the case with the other elements. And the atoms of

a chemical element being known to difler in one respect may differ in other respects,

and presumably do somewhat differ in mass.

     Restricted by limited time and means, even a partial separation of these atomic

groupings is possible to me only with enormous ditticulty. Have we any evidence

that Nature has eflected such a separation ? The following facts I think supply

this evidence.

The earth yttria occurs in several minerals, all extremely rare. These minerals

are of very diverse chemical composition, and occur in localities widely separated,

geographically. Does the pure yttria impure in respect to every other known
572 REPORT-- 1886.

·element) from these different sources behave diflerently to the radiant-matter test ?

To the chemist hitherto the earth yttria has been the same thing- and has possessed
the same properties, whatever its source ; hut armed with this new power of seeing
into the atomic groupings which go to make up yttrium, we find evidence of

differentiation between one yttrium and another.

     Thus when the samarskite yttrium was formed all the constituent atoms--deep

--red, red, orange, citron, greenish-blue, and blue ' condensed together in fair pro-

portion, the deep red being faintest. In gadolinite yttrium the citron and greenish-
iblue constituents are plentiful, the red is very deficient, the orange is absent, and
the others occur in moderate quantities. In the yttrium from xenotime the citron
is most plentiful, the greenish-blue occui-s in smaller proportion, the red is all but
absent, and the orange is quite absent. Yttrium from monazite contains the
greenish-blue and citron, with a fair proportion of the other constituents ; the
greenish-blue is plentiful, and the red is good. Yttrium from fluocerite is very
similar to that fi"om monazite, but the blue is weaker. Y^ttrium from hielmite is
very rich in citron, has a fair quantity of blue and greenish-blue, less of red, no
orange, and only a very faint trace of deep red. Yttria from euxenite is almost
identical with that from hielmite. Y'^ttria from cerite contains most red and citron,
a. fair amount of orange, less greenish-blue and blue, and only a trace of deep red.

     This is unlikely to be an isolated case. The principle is very probably of

general application to all the elements. In some, possibly in all elements, the

whole spectrum does not emanate from all its atoms, but difl'erent spectral rays may
come from difierent atoms, and in the spectrum as we see it all these partial

spectra are present together. This being interpreted means that there are definite
differences in the internal motions which go on in the several groups of which
the atoms of a chemical element consist. For example, we must now be prepared
for some such events as that the seven series of bands in the absorption-spectrum

of iodine may prove not all to emanate from every molecule, but that some of

these molecules emit some of these series, others others, and in the jumble of all
these kinds of molecules, to which is given the name ' iodine vapour,' the whole
eeven series are contributors.

     To me it appears the theory I have here ventured to formulate, taken in con-
junction with the diagram in fig. 1, may aid the scientific imagination to proceed

a step or two further in the order of elemental evolution. In the undulating

curve may be seen the action of two forces, one acting in the direction of the

vertical fine, and the other pulsating backwards and forwards like a pendulum.
Assume the vertical line to represent temperature slowly sinking through an
unknown number of degrees, from the dissociation- point of the first-formed element

down to the dissociation-point of those last shown on the scale. But what form
of energy is represented by the oscillating line? .Swinging to and fro like a

mighty pendulum to points equidistant from a neutral centre ; the divergence from
TieutraUty conferring atomicity of one, two, three, and four degrees as the distance
from the centre is one, two, three, or four divisions; and the approach to, or

retreat from, the neutral line deciding the electro-negative or electro-positive

--character of the element all on the retreating half of the swing being positive and
--all on the approaching half negative this oscillating force must be intimately

connected with the imponderable matter, essence, or source of energy we call

electricity.

     Let us examine this a little more closeh'. Let us start at the moment when
the first element came into existence. Before this time matter, as we know it,
was not. It is equally impossible to conceive of matter without energy, as of
energy without matter ; from one point of view the two are convertible terms.
Before the birth of atoms all those forms of energy which become evident when

--matter acts upon matter could not have existed they were locked up in the

protyle as latent potentialities only. Coincident with the creation of atoms all
those attributes and properties which form the means of discriminating one
chemical element from another start into existence fully endowed with energy.

     The pendulum begins its swing from the electro-positive side ; lithium, next to

hydrogen in simplicity of atomic weight, is now formed ; then glucinvim, boron,

and carbon. Definite quantities of electricity are bestowed on each element at the

moment of birth, on these quantities its atomicity depends,' and the types of

monatomic, diatomic, triatomic, and tetratomic elements are fixed. The electro-

negative part  of  the  swing  now  commences                                                         nitrogen  appears, and  notice  how
                                                                                                   ;

curiously position governs the mean dominant atomicity. Nitrogen occupies the

position below boron, a triatomic element, therefore nitrogen is triatomic. But

nitrogen also follows carbon, a tetratomic body, and occupies the fifth position

Howcounting from the place of origin.  beautifully these opposing tendencies are

harmonised by the endowment of nitrogen with at least a double atomicity, and

making its atom capable of acting as tri- and pentatomic. With oxygen (di-

and hexatomic) and fluorine (mon- and heptatomic) the same law holds, and one-

half oscillation of the pendulum is completed. Again passing the neutral line the

electro-positive elements sodium (monatomic), magnesium (diatomic), aluminium

(triatomic), and silicon (tetratomic) are successively formed, and the first com-

plete oscillation of the pendulum is finished by the birth of the electro-negative

--elements, phosphorus, sulphur, and chlorine ; these three like the corresponding
--elements formed on the opposite homeward swing having each at least a double

atomicity depending on position.

     Let us pause at the end of the first complete vibration and examine the result.

We have already formed the elements of water, ammonia, carbonic acid, the atmo-

sphere, plant and animal life, phosphorus for the brain, salt for the sea, clay for the

soUd earth, two alkalies, an alkaline earth, an earth, together with their carbonates,

borates, nitrates, fluorides, chlorides, sulphates, phosphates, and silicates, sufficient

for a world and inhabitants not so very different from what we enjoy at the present

daj". True, the human inhabitants would have to live in a state of more than

Arcadian simplicity, and the absence of calcic phosphate would be awkward as far

as bone is concerned. But what a happy world it would be ! No silver or gold

coinage, no iron for machinery, no platinum for chemists, no copper ^\"ire for

telegraphy, no zinc for batteries, no mercury for pumps, and, alas ! no rare earths

to be separated.

The pendulum does not, however, stop at the end of the first complete vibration

it crosses the neutral point, and now the forces at work are in the same position as
they were at the beginning. Had everything been as it was at first, the next

element again would have been lithium, and the original cycle would have recurred,

repeating for ever the same elements. But the conditions are not quite the same
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

--the form of energy represented by the vertical line has declined a little the

--temperature has sunk and not lithium, but the one next allied to it in the series

--comes into existence -pottassium, which may be regarded as the lineal descendant

of lithium, with the same hereditary tendencies, but with less molecular mobility

and higher atomic weight.

Pass we rapidly along the to and fro curve, and in nearly every case the same

law is seen to hold good. The last element of the first complete vibration is

chlorine. In the corresponding place in the second vibration we do not have an

exact repetition of chlorine, but the very similar body bromine and when for a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

potential elements would all be equal to one another. Some would be unable

to resist the slightest disturbance of the unstable equilibrium in which they took

their rise ; others would endure longer, but would ultimately break down as

temperature and pressure varied. Many degrees of stability would be here repre-
sented ; not all the chemical elements are equally stable, and if we look with

scrutinising eyes we shall still see our old friend the missing link, coarse enough to

be detected by ordinary chemical processes, associated in the groups containing

such  elements  as  iron,  nickel,  and  cobalt                           palladium,  ruthenium,  and  rhodium
                                                                       ;

iridium, osmium, and platinum. Whilst in their more subtile form these missing

links present themselves as the representatives of the differences which I have

detected and described between the atoms of the same chemical element.

Dr. Carnelley has pointed out that ' those elements belonging to the even series

of Mendeleeff's classification are always paramagnetic, whereas the elements belong-

ing to the odd series are always diamagnetic' On this curve the even series to the

left, as far as can be ascertained, are paramagnetic, and, with a few exceptions, all

to the right are diamagnetic. The very powerful magnetic metals, iron, nickel,

cobalt, and manganese, occur close together on the proper side. The interperiodic

groups of which palladium and platinum are examples are said to be feebly mag-

netic, and if so they form the exceptions. Oxygen, which, weight for weight, is

more magnetic than'iron, comes near the beginning of the curve, while the power-

fully diamagnetic metals, bismuth and thallium, are at the opposite end of the

curve.

    On the odd, or diamagnetic half of the swing, the energy appears to have con-

siderable regularity, whilst it is very irregular on the opposite side of the curve.
Thus, between the extreme odd elements, silicon (28), germanium (73), tin (118),
the missing element (163), and lead (208), there is a difference of exactly 45 units,

conferring remarkable symmetry on one half of the curve. The differences on the
even side are 36, 42, 51, 39, and 53 (giving the missing element between cerium

and thorium an atomic weight of 180) ; these at first sight appear conformable to
no law, but they become of great interest when it is seen that the mean difference
of these figures is almost exactly the same as that on the other side of the curve

--viz. 44-2.

This uniformity of difference-- actual on the one side and average on the other

brings out the important inference that, whilst on the odd side there has been

little or no variation in the vertical force, minor irregularities have been the rule on

the even side. That is to say, the fall of temperature has been very uniform on the

--odd side where every element formed during this half of the vibration is the
--representative of a strongly marked group sodium, magnesium, aluminium,

silicium, phosphorus, sulphur, and chlorine ; whilst on the even side of the swing

the temperature has sunk with considerable fluctuations, which have prevented the

formation here of any well-marked groups of elements, with the exception of those

of which lithium and glucinum are the types.

    If we can thus trace irregularities in the fall of temperature can we also detect

any variation in the force represented by the pendulous movement? I have

assumed that this represents cliemical energy. In the early formed elements we
have those in which chemical energy is at its maximum intensity, while, as we

descend, affinities for oxygen are getting less and the chemism is becoming more

and more sluggish. Part may be due to the lower temperature of generation not

nermitting such molecular mobility in the elements, but there can be little doubt that

the chemism-forming energy, like the fires of the cosmical furnace, is itself dying

out. I have endeavoured to represent this gradual fading out by a diminution of

amplitude, the cui've being traced from a photographic record of the diminution of

the arc of vibration of a body swinging in a resisting medium.

\Vben we look on a curve of this kind there is a tendency to ask, what is there

above and below the portion which is seen ? At the lower end of our curve what

Weis there to be noted ?   see a great hiatus between barium (137) and iridium

(192-5), which it seems likely will be filled up by the so-called rare elements.

Judging from my own researches, it is probable tliat many of these earthy elements

will be found included in one or more interperiodic groups, whilst the higher mem-

fcers of the calcium, the potassium, the chlorine, and the sulphur groups, together

with the elements between silver and gold, cadmium and mercury, indium and

Wethallium, and antimony and bismuth, are still waiting to be discovered.                                              now
come to an oasis in the desert of blanks. Platinum, gold, mercury, thallium, lead,
and bismuth, all famihar friends, form a close little group by themselves, and then

after another desert space the list is closed with thorium (2-3.3) and uranium

(240).

    This oasis and the blanlts which precede and follow it may be referred with
much probability to the particular way in which our Earth developed into a mem-

ber of our solar system. If this be so it may be that on our Earth only these blanks

occur, and not generally throughout the universe.

What comes after uranium ? I should consider that there is little prospect of

the existence of an element much lower than this. Look at the vertical line of

temperature slowly sinking from the upper to the lower part of the curve ; the

figures representing the scale of atomic weights may be also supposed to represent,

inversely, the scale of a gigantic pyrometer dipping into the cauldron where suns
and worlds are in process of formation. Our thermometer shows us that the heat
Las been sinking gradually, and, pari passu, the elements formed have increased

in density and atomic weight. This cannot go on for an indehnite extent.

Below the uranium point the temperature may be so reduced that some of the

earlier formed elements which have the strongest affinities are able to enter into

combination among themselves, and the result of the next fall in temperature will

then be--instead of elements lower in the scale than uranium--the combination of

oxygen with hydrogen, and the formation of those known compounds the dissocia-

tion of which is not beyond the powers of our terrestrial sources of heat.

    Let us now turn to the upper portion of the scheme. AVith hydrogen of

atomic weight = 1 , there is little room for other elements, save perhaps for hypothetical
helium. But what if we get ' through the looking-glass,' and cross the zero-line in
search of new principles--what shall we find the other side of zero ? Dr. Car-

nelley asks for an element of negative atomic weight ; here is ample room and vero-e
«nough for a shadow series of such uusubstantiahties. Helmholtz says that elec-

tricity IS probably as atomic as matter ; ' is electricity one of the negative elements ?

and the lummiferous ether another ? Matter, as we now know it, does not here

        the forms of energy which are
Aexist                                                                       apparent in the    motions of matter are  as yet
                         ;
only latent possibilities.                      substance of negative weight is not inconceivable.*

But can we form a clear conception of a body'which combines with other bodies in

Aproportions expressible by negative quantities ?

         genesis of the elements such as is here sketched out would not be confined to
our little solar system, but would probably follow the same general sequence of

events in every centre of energy now visible as a star.

Before the birth of atoms to gravitate towards one another, no pressure could be
exercised                                       but at the outskirts of the

at the shell on which the tremendous forces involved in the birth of a chemical

element exert full sway--the fierce heat would be accompanied bv gravitation

sufiicient to keep the newly-born elements from flving oft' into space. ' As tempera-

ture increases expansion and molecular motion" increase, molecules tend to fly
asunder, and their chemical affinities become deadened ; but the enormous pressure

of the gravitation of the mass of atomic matter outside what I may for brevity call

the birth-shell_ would counteract this action of heat.

     Beyond this birth-shell would be a space in which no chemical action could take
place, owing to the temperature there being above what is called the dissocia-

tion-point for compounds. In this space the lion and the lamb would lie down

chlorine would show no tendency to closer bonds ; and even fluorine, that energetic-
gas which chemists have only isolated within the last month or two, would float
about free and uncombined.

     Outside this space of free atomic matter would be another shell, in which the
formed chemical elements would have cooled down to tbe combination-poiut, and
the sequence of events so graphically described by Mr. Mattieu Williams in ' The-

Fuel of the Sun ' would now take place, culminating in the solid earth and the

commencement of geological time.

And now I must draw to a close, having exhausted not indeed my subject, but

Wethe time I may reasonably occupy.        have glanced at the difficulty of de&ning

an element ; we have noticed, too, the revolt of many leading physicists and chemists

Weagainst the ordinary acceptation of the term element.            have weighed the im-

probability of their eternal .self-existence or their origination by chance. As a re-
maining alternative we have suggested their origin by a process of evolution like

that of the heavenly bodies according to Laplace, and the plants and animals of

our globe according to Lamarck, Darwin, and "Wallace. In the general array of

the elements, as known to us, we have seen a striking approximation to that of the

organic world. In lack of direct evidence of the decomposition of any element,

Wewe have sought and found indirect evidence.  have taken into consideration

the Light thrown on this subject by Prout's law, and by the researches of ]\Ir.

WeLockyer in solar spectroscopy.    have reviewed the very important evidence

dra-wn from the distribution and collocation of the elements in the crust of our

Weearth.  have studied Dr. Carnelley's weighty argument in favour of the com-

pound nature of the so-called elements from their analogy to the compound radicles.

We have next glanced at the view of the genesis of the elements ; and, lastly, we

have reviewed a scheme of their origin suggested by Professor Reynolds's method

of illustrating the periodic classification.

    Summing up all the above considerations we cannot, indeed, venture to assert

positively that our so-called elements have been evolved from one primordial

matter : but we may contend that the balance of evidence, I think, fairly weighs

in favour of this speculation.

     This, then, is the intricate question which I have striven to unfold before you,

a question which I especially commend to the young generation of chemists, not

only as the most interesting but the most profoundly important in the entire

compass of our science.

     I say deliberately and advisedly the most inferesfhif/. The doctrine of evolu-
tion, as you well know, has thrown a new light upon and given a new impetus
to every department of biology, leading us, may we not hope, to anticipate a

correspotiding wakening light in the domain of chemistry h

I would ask investigators not necessarily either to accept or to reject the hypo-

thesis of chemical evolution, but to treat it as a provisional hypothesis ; to keep it

in view in their researches, to inquire how far it lends itself to the interpretation

of the phenomena observed, and to test experimentally every line of thought which

points in this direction. Of the difficulties of this investigation none can be more

fully aware 'than myself. I sincerely hope that this, my imperfect attempt, may

lead some minds to enter upon the study of this fundamental chemical question,

and to examine closely and in detail what I, as if amidst tbe clouds and mists of a

far distance, have striven to point out.

    I. On the Absorption Spectra of Uranium Salts.
By "W. J. Russell, F.R.S., and W. Lapraik, F.G.S.

Well-marked absorption bands are produced in the visible spectrum by the differ-

ent salts of this metal. The salts are divided into two very distinct classes, uranoua

and uranic salts, and  each  class  gives  an  entirely different  absorption  spectrum
                                                                                                          ^

toth consist of three distinct bands or groups of bands: those produced by tbe
uranous salts are at the red end of the spectrum, and those produced by the uranic

salts at the blue end, the one set of bands beginning where the other set ends, so that
·when both salts are together in solution there are a series of bands visible which are
distributed with tolerable regularity over the whole visible spectrum. Nine uranic
salts, some organic some inorganic, have been examined, and it has been f lund that
allgive the same spectrum, that is, the spectrum is unaffected by the acid radicle.
"With other metals, such as cobalt for instance, this is not the case, diiferent radicles

producing different spectra. This spectrum, common apparently to all uranic salts,

is however slightly altered by the addition of free acid, the acid causing a diminu-
tion of intensity in the least refrangible bands, and causing an apparent slight shift
in others. Crystals of the uranic nitrate give an absorption spectrum similar to
that produced by an aqueous solution of this salt.

     The uranous salts give also in all cases examined a common spectrum, and one

in which all the bands are less refrangible than those belonging to the uranic salts.
The authors have also examined a few of the uranous salts in the solid state, and
find that these salts have then a far more complicated spectrum than when in

solution.

   After a short historical introduction experiments were described in which phos-

phorus trichloride and bromine were mixed in various proportions; in all cases

a considerable quantity of heat was evolved, and when sufficient bromine was

present crystals were  dej osited  on cooling                                                       on  analysing  these it was found that
                                                                                       ;

the amount of bromine present at any given temperature was proportional to the
amount of bromine present in the mixtures, also that those crystals which contained
the most bromme were the least stable ; at a temperature of 10° C. it was possible

to obtain a compound containing ten atoms of halogen, while at 35° C. the compound
PCljBrj was decomposed (MichaeUs).

     It w'as also found that bromine replaces part of the chlorine of the trichloride, but

not much more than half even when such a large excess was present as twelve
atoms of bromine to one of
                            the trichloride                                                         Gladstone, however, found that in the

presence of a smaU quantity of iodine all the chlorine of the trichloride may be
replaced by bromme and the penta-bromide formed.

   The constitution of these compounds was then discussed and it was sugoested

that they are merely compounds of phosphorus with varying proportions of\alo-
gen, and not
              molecular  compounds                                                       the  number of  atoms     of  halogen with which

 5. Dissociation and Contact-action? By the Rev. A. Irving, B.Sc, B.A.

     The author refers to a letter of his which appeared in ' Nature ' on March 25 last
in which he suggested that the true explanation of the many instances known of
contact-action of soHd bodies in facilitating combination of gases, which under
ordinary conditions and in the free state are chemically inert to one another, was to
be found in the transformation of a portion of the energy of translation of the

molecules into intramolecular work, producing [ot tending to produce) dissociation
as a preliminary to chemical change.

578 REPORT-- 1886.

In this paper sucli explanations as have been offered from time to time are-

criticised and rejected as inapplicable to ail the phenomena, and an attempt is made

to reason out a general explanation on purely thermo-dynamical principles. The

initial-temperature of dissociation is referred to the inequality of the atom-tempera-

tures (absolute) of the molecules, there being (from a variety of causes) a number

of molecules in every mass of gas in a state of greater thermal activity (both as

regards translational and internal vibrational energy) than that which corresponds

to the mean condition which is indicated by the thermometer. For such molecules

a smaller addition of heat is required to bring about dissociation, while the enor-

mous increase in the extent of solid surface presented by the introduction of a porous

or finely divided solid, increases proportionately the number of instances of impact

in a given period of time, and a corresponding increase iu the amount of intra-

molecular work done iu promoting the vibrational energy of the atoms.

The term ' quasi-nascent state ' is used to indicate sucli a degree of tension, thus

brought about within some of the molecules, that atoms of opposite electro-chemical

energies can, under the influence of their mutual attraction, escape from the mole-

cules in which they were previously held, and enter into new combinations.

Collateral evidence of the truth of the theoretical view here propounded is

brought forward, (1) from a purely dynamical example given by Sir W. Thomson

Ain a discussion in Section last year (2) from tl\e action of Mr. Crookes' radio-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

last at the Royal Institution.

The general application of the theory is pointed out as claiming more considera-

tion than the more empirical explanations hitherto oftered, each of which only

applies to a few instances of the kind. It also enables us to refer the contact influ-

ence of chemically inert solid bodies, and the action of such purely physical

agencies as heat, electricity, and light, in promoting combination, to the same

general principles, while it seems to extend our idea of the action of atoms in th&

nascent state.

     The author examines the evidence for and against the existence of water of

crystallisation in solution, derivable from thermo-chemical and other data. He

shows that there is no relation between heat of hydration of the solid salt and the
number of water molecules in the hydrated salt ; that it is not sufficient to deduct
the heat of change of state of the water to obtain the true heat of solution of a
dehydrated salt ; and that the heat of neutralisation of a dissolved base by a
dissolved acid is conclusive against the existence of water of crystallisation in

aqueous solution, for with the seven soluble bases this is a constant for HjSO^ and

another constant for 2HC1 and 2HNO3, while the sulphates and other salts

formed possess in the solid state most varied amounts of water of crystallisation,
and if this exist.? in solution it would be necessary to assume that the constancy
of the neutralisation results is a coincidence, an assumption directly opposed to the

probabilities of the case.

5. On the Magnetic Rotation of Mixtures of Water, and some of the Acids of

     the Fatty Series 2vith Alcohol and tvith Sul])h%mc Acid, and Observations

    on Water of Grijstallisation.^ By W. H. Peekin, Ph.D., F.B.8.

     The author first pointed out that the magnetic rotation of water was higher
than that of a sum of the value of H.^ + O, as deduced from other compounds, and
that therefore the magnetic rotation of a body containing these elements would
show whether they existed as water or were otherwise combined. Formic, acetic,
and propionic acid were then each mixed with water in the proportions of one mole-
cule of acid to one of water, and examined as to their molecular rotation. This was
of special interest because acids so diluted were believed to form trihydric alcohols.
Alcohol diluted in a similar manner was also examined at the same time for the
sake of comparison, because it could not form a compound with water. The result
of the niunbers obtained from the magnetic rotation showed that these diluted
compounds consist simply of the acids + water, the diluted alcohol giving similar

confirmatory numbers.
     Sulphuric acid was then examined in a similar manner, both concentrated and

bydrated by the addition of water in the proportion of one, two, and three mole-

cules to one of acid.

    From the residts obtained the author concludes that sulphuric acid forms with
water the compound (HO)^SO only.

     The study of these hydrated compounds having caused the author to consider
the subject of water of crystallisation, he first draws attention to the want of
consistency as to the presence or absence of water of crystallisation in the simple
salts of metals belonging to the same class, and to the same thing shown in the
existence of hydrated methyl-bromide, &c., and concludes that its relation to a
salt or other body has not any connection with chemical combination, but that it is
purely physical, and is present as a necessity of the crystalline form, and that it is
present only when it is conducive to the production of that form which is most
readily produced under the circumstances existing at the time, in support of which he
brings forward the case of the alums and other isomorphous compounds, and shows
that if this be the function of water of crystallisation salts containing it when
dissolved wiU no longer remain in union with it, which is now believed to be the
case by so many who have studied the subject of the solution of salts.

             By William Ramsay, Ph.D., and SYDNEr Young, D.Sc.

    The subject of this paper may well be included in a discussion on the nature

of solution, for it is impossible to devise a completely satisfactory theory of
solution without a knowledge of the molecular structure of the solvent. During

the last few years we have made determinations of the vapour pressures, densities

of the saturated and unsaturated vapour, specific gravities, and, in some cases,
compressibilities of methyl and ethyl alcohol, ether, and acetic acid under various

conditions of pressure and temperature. By means of the thermo-dynamical

equation

                                 L = (S.-S,)f.4..

the heats of vaporisation have also been calculated.
     The data which bear most strongly on the subject under discussion are the

densities of the saturated vapour, that of hydrogen under similar conditions of tem-

perature and pressure being taken as unity. At low temperatures the saturated
vapours of the alcohols and ether follow Boyle's and Gay Lussac's laws ; hut if the

temperature is raised the density of the saturated vapour is found to increase, slowly

at first, but more and more rapidly, luitil the critical point is reached, when the

specific gravity of the liquid is equal to that of its saturated vapour, and the devia-
tion from Boj^le's law is very great. Thus with ethyl alcohol the density of the
saturated vapour is normal at about 40°, and it remains normal at lower tempera-

tures. With acetic acid very different results are obtained. The constants for

this body have not been determined up to the critical point, the temperature being
too high for the method adopted. From about 140° to 280°, however, the density
of the saturated vapour is found to increase, and there can be no doubt that this

increase would go on up to the critical point. When the temperature is reduced

below 140° the density of the satui-ated vapour (which at this point is about 50,
the normal density being 30) does not continue to decrease but becomes nearly
constiint, and at still lower temperatures rises again more and more rapidly until
at 50° it is nearly 60. There is then a marked difference between such

substances as ethyl alcohol, in which no dissociation of any kind is known to occur,
and acetic acid, the vapour of which is believed by many chemists to consist, in
part, of molecules of the formula n(C.^H^O,,), n being generallj^ supposed equal to 2.

It is very improbable that the increase of the density of the saturated vapour with

rise of temperature, which appears to be common to all bodies, is due to the union

of simple gaseous molecules to form complex groups, for dissociation is always in-
creased by rise of temperature ; on the other hand, owing to the high pressure, the

molecules are brought into clo.se proximity, and the abnormality may be caused by
a general attraction of the molecules for each other. At low temperatures, at

which the pressure is small, the molecules are far apart, and such a general attrac-
tion is out of the question. The deviation in the case of acetic acid at low
temperatures is therefore probably due to the combination of the simple gaseous
molecules to form complex groups of the formula n(0.,H,02). This is borne out by
the fact that with nitric peroxide, the vapour of which is known to dissociate
according to the equation N.^Oj = 2N0.,, a similar increase of the density of the
saturated vapour takes place. The densities of the unsaturated vapour at various
constant temperatures have been determined by the Natansons (' Wied. Ann.' July
1886) and the vapour pressures by ourselves ('Phil. Trans.' 1885). The junction
of the isothermals showing the relation of pressure to vapour density with the
horizontal lines indicating vapour pressures gives points on the cm've representing
the relation of the densities of the saturated vapour to pressure ; and it is thus
found that the density of the saturated vapour increases with fall of temperature
and pressure.

      It is extremely improbable that the increase of the density of the saturated
vapour of acetic acid at both high and low temperatures can be due to the same

cause, the conditions being so totally different ; and it may fairly be concluded that

at high temperatures the abnormality of this and of all other bodies is due to a
physical rather than a chemical attraction. The existence of complex molecular
 groups in the vapours of normal substances, such as alcohol, is therefore very im-

likely, and it can hardly be supposed that they are formed at the moment of con-

densation ; hence, in all probabilit}', the molecules of ordinary liquids are simple

 gaseous molecules in close proximity.
      Other facts observed in the course of this research lead to the same conclusion.

We shall discuss their bearing on the question in the ' Philosophical Magazine.'
    We have attempted to study the solubility of eosin in alcohol at temperatures

above the critical point, but the experimental difficulties are so great that no very
definite conclusions have been arrived at. It appears, however, most probable that
at temperatures but slightly higher than the critical point, the eosin remains in
solution for some time (as shown by its fluorescence), but that it is gradually

deposited.

   7. On the Nature of Solidion} By Professor Spencer U. Pickering.

     Although various special experiments seem to render it incontestable that
hydrates of a salt do exist in solution in some cases, the strength of the hydrate
theory should be derived from more general considerations as to the nature of the

solvent and substance dissolved, and from the thermal results of dissolution. At

the same time, however, equally general considerations render this theory inade-
quate to explain all the facts observed, though to such special lines of argument,
such as those which Dr. Nicol derives from the specific volumes, no weight what-
ever can be attached, for they would lead to the conclusion that the radicles com-
posing the salt itself are no more united than is the salt with its water. The

explanation of this conflicting evidence may be explained by the recognition of

the real complexity of the units of matter ; a great number of our so-called mole-
cules unite to form aggregates which bear the stamp of true chemical compounds
in most respects, but are so greatly Influenced by physical conditions that their
composition, to our imperfect means of investigation, appears indefinite. The
existence of such compounds alone can explain the peculiarities of minerals,

artificial crystals of isomorphous salts, alloys, basic salts, &c. Dissolution is a

result not of the formation of definite hydrates onlj-, but also of (apparently)

indefinite hydrates. The formation of these hydrates would always be accompanied
by an evolution of heat, but at the same time the aggregates of a solid being more
complex than those of a liquid, an act of decomposition absorbing heat would
also be a no less invariable accompaniment. The coexistence of two such counter-

acting actions can alone explain ail the thermal effects of dissolution.

1. On the Fading of Water-colours. By Professor W. N. Hartley, F.B.8..

     Referring to the article Light and Water-colours, written by Mr. J. C.
"Robinson, in the ' Nineteenth Century,' Professor Hartley pointed out that colours
consist of mineral substances, for the most part of a stable character and organic
substances consisting of stable colours and unstable changeable colours. With the

exception of ultramarine, bodies of the former class may be generally considered as
unalterable unless they contain lead or mercury ; those of the second class may be

considered alterable under certain conditions. The action of light, according to the
researches of Chastaing, on these two classes of substances when it is capable of
affecting them is diflerent : on mineral substances the red rays cause oxidation ; the
oxidising power decreases as the rays tend more towards the yellow; the yellowish-
green rays are without action and form a neutral region ; the blue rays reverse the

-- --action of the red for they promote reduction and this action increases in intensity

in the violet and ultra-violet rays.

    On organic substances the action of light is an oxidising one throughout, con-

tinuously increasing in power as the rays extend through the red and yellow into
the violet end of the spectrum. There is, however, a modification in the green, the
rays having a diminished oxidising power. The action of light on organic sub-
stances is not confined to oxidation, for bodies of a complex and imstable character

may be changed in composition, and, being resolved into more stable compounds,

changed in colour or rendered colourless.
     Experiment on colours showed that this was apparently the case with crimson

lake, gamboge, bistre, and to a less extent with brown madder and sepia. Indigo
is permament. Ultramarine is bleached by acids, but not by light.

     In order to preserve water-colour drawings in which yellow and delicate red tints

are largely used, as, for instance. Turner's sun-light pictures, they should be kept in
a very subdued light, preferably of a yellow tint, such as is obtained by blinds of un-
bleached linen. For artificial illumination the arc-light is unsuitable, but incan-
descence lamps are preferable to gas, as yielding no products of combustion, which

in the case of gas are capable of causing injury. The action of the violet rays is
two to three times as powerful as the red or yellow ; and there is a great difference
between the action of diffused daylight sufficientlj' strong to view pictui-es, and direct
sunlight. Without exact measurements it is difficult to appreciate its magnitude,

but the latter may be safely set down as on an average forty times, and in summer

even probably four hundred times as great as the former ; hence a picture which
would fade in ten years in sun-light might be preserved for several hundred years
in a subdued yellow light. The author has not observed any destructive action of
light on grey tints made from mixtures of indigo and light red, even in sketches
painted as long as sixty years ago, by his fiither, and since exposed to subdued
daylight. The acidity in drawing paper should be corrected by a wash of a dilute
solution of borax, and in no case ought any paste or glue to be placed at the
back of a drawing for the purpose of mounting it.

          2. On the Distribution of the Nitrifying Organism in the Soil.
                                By R. Waeington, F.B.S.

     Previous experiments, conducted at Rothamsted on this subject (' Trans. Chem.
Soc. ' 1884, p. 645) had led to the conclusion that the nitrifying organism is
always to be met with down to 9 inches from the surface, and that at 18 inches
it is sometimes present ; but experiments with soil 2 to 8 feet from the siu-face failed

to yield evidence of the presence of the organism.

     Further experiments have been made in 1885, and during the present j'ear, both
in the field with the stiflT clay subsoil previously worked on, and in another field having
a loamy subsoil ; in all sixty-nine new experiments have been made. The soil in
the previous experiments was removed, with suitable precautions, from a freshly
cut surface, and placed in sterilised solutions consisting of diluted urine (0-4 per
cent.) It having since been found that the facility with which urine nitrifies is
greatly increased by the presence of gypsum ('Trans. Chem. Soc' 1885, p. 758),
an addition of a small quantity of gypsum was made to the solutions employed in
all the recent experiments ; rather larger quantities of soil were also employed.
The results may be summarised as follows:

mo nitrification was obtained. The considerable diflerence between the earlier and

later results is to be attributed to the employment of gypsum in the later solutions.
The nitrifying organism in the subsoil is indeed less abundant, and probably much

more feeble than in the surface soil, and is apparently imable to start nitrification

in the decidedly alkaline solution which urine produces in the absence of gypsum.

    Although it appears that the nitrifying organism may exist at considerable

depths, nitrification is practically confined to the surface soil. The quantity of

nitrogen as nitric acid annually obtained in the dram age water from soils of

diflei-ent depths in the drain gauges at Rothamsted is on an average of nine years :
        ....Soil 20 inches deep
        ....Soil 40 ,,             40.2 lbs. per acre
        ....Soil 60 ,,,,

                                   38-8 ,,

There is no evidence here of a greater production of nitrates when the subsoil

is included in the experiment.

      Nitrates are always found most abundantly in the surface soil unless heavy

Tain has occurred to wash them downwards. Two fallow soils at Rothamsted

were found to contain the following quantities of nitrogen as nitrates in lbs. per

acre :

     The author has found that different gases (hydrogen, electrolytic gas, cyanogen,
and sulphurous acid) could be preserved over dry mercm-y for several years with-
out any sensible alteration. This result is contrary to the conclusion arrived at by
Faraday, that it was impossible to preserve gases over dry mercury, but agrees
with the expeiiments of Sir Himiphry Davy, recorded in the Laboratory Notebook
of the Royal Institution. The author collected the gases in hot tubes over pure

Jiot mercury.

      Broadly speaking, the operation of chemical fractionation consists in fixing

upon some cliemical reaction in which there is the most likelihood of a difference

in the behaviour of the elements under treatment, and peiforming it in an incom-

plete manner, so that only a certain fraction of the total bases present is separated,

the object being to get part of the material in the insoluble, and the rest in the

soluble, state. The operation must take place slowly, so as to allow the affinities

-- --which, by the nature of the case, are almost equally balanced time to have free

play. Let us suppose that two earths are present, almost identical in chemical

properties, but diii'ering by an almost imperceptible variation in basicity. Add to

the very dilute solution dilute ammonia in such amount that it can only precipi-

tate half the bases present. The dihition must be such that a considerable time

elapses before the liquid begins to show turbidity, and several hours will have to
elapse before the full effect of the ammonia is complete. On filtering we have the
earths divided into two parts, and we can easily imagine that now there is a

slight difference in the basic value                                 of  the two portions        of  earth                         that  in  solution
                                                                                                                                ;

being, by an almost imperceptible amount, more basic than that which the ammonia

has precipitated. This minute difference is made to accumulate by a systematic

process until it becomes perceptible by a chemical or physical test.

In most methods of fractionation a rough sort of balance of affinities is arrived

at before long, beyond which further separation by the same method is difficult.
I have long noticed this action when fractionating with ammonia, with oxalic acid

and nitric and with formic acid. One valuable point which renders this fact

noteworthy is that the balance of affinities revealed by fractionation is not the

same with each method. It was in consequence of the experience gained in these

different methods of fractionation that in my paper read before the Royal Society,

June 10 last ('Chemical News,' vol. liv. p. 13), after stating that I had not been
able to separate didymium into Dr. Auer's two earths, I said, ' Probably didymium '

will be found to split up in more than one direction according to the method

adopted.'

    The process adopted must vary according to the bodies under treatment. Frac-
tional crystallisation has yielded new results with didymium in the hands of Ur.

Auer  von    Welsbach                                           and  precipitation  with formic  acid,  with                       ammonia, with
                                                             ;

ammonium oxalate, crystallisation of the oxalates from strong nitric acid, and

fusing the nitrates and chlorides have all given me good results.

Working with the samarskite earths, fractional precipitation with oxalic acid

separates first erbia, holmia, and thulia, then terbia, and lastly yttria. This is the

only method which is applicable for the separation of small quantities of terbia

from yttria.

     Fusing the nitrates separates ytterbia, erbia, holmia, and thulia from yttria. It
is not so applicable when terbia is present, and is most useful in purifying the
gadolinite earths. This process is the only one known for separating ytterbia

from yttria.

The formic acid process is best for separating terbia, as terbic formate is diffi-

cultly soluble in water, the other formates being easily soluble.

Selection must be made of these methods according to the mixture of earths

under treatment, changing the method as one earth or the other becomes concen-

trated on one side or thro^ii out on the other. Each operation must be repeated
very many times before even approximate purity is attained. The operations are

more analogous to the separation of members of homologous series of hydrocarbons

by fractional distillation than to the separations in mineral chemistry as ordinarily

adopted in the laboratory.

    When the balance of affinities, of which I spoke above, seems to be established,

the earths appear in the same proportion in the precipitate and the solution ; they

are thrown down by ammonia, and the precipitated earths are worked up by some
other process so as to alter the ratio between them, when the previous operation

can be again employed.

Fractional precipitation by ammonia is the process generally adopted, for

although in some cases it is not so powerful as other processes it is more generally

applicable.

The best plan is to add half the equivalent amount of precipitant to the liquid.

and, after complete settlement, filter. Starting with, say, 1000 grms. in the zero

--1bottle, transfer the filtrate to bottle  and the precipitate to bottle +1.  Then

add another 1000 grms. to the bottle, and repeat the operations as in the folio-wing

one of one base and one of the other ; and the two molecules thus intimately-

associated might tend to remain together, whether as precipitate or as filtrate. On

the whole, I prefer nitric acid, as having little tendency to form double salts, and
being easily got rid of.

      It is occasionally necessary to completely precipitate the whole contents of the

bottles with ammonium oxalate, and after ignition to redlssolve the earths in

acid and proceed as before. If this precaution is not adopted the accumulation of

ammonium nitrate in the solution dissolves an appreciable amount of the earths.
     In the ordinary operations of separating distinct entities, such as the known

gadolinite or samarskite earths, it is not difficult, as I have already pointed out,

to find different chemical processes, which may be successively employed. When,

however, the separations attempted are those of the constituents of yttrium, the

simple straightforward fractionation, continued steadily month after month and
year after year, is the only plan I know of.

     The operation may be somewhat hastened by removing from the main series

certain bottles in which one particular constituent is concentrated and sub-
fractioning these by themselves. Also to avoid the spreading out sideways to too
great an extent after a certain distance has been proceeded from the centre, say

to bottles -- 20 and + 20 : the earths are allowed to accumulate in the last bottle

at each end. They will after a time be in sufficient amount to subfractionate on
their own account, and, being at the end of the series, they ofler a good chance of

getting the extreme constituents pretty pure.
      It will be seen from the above description that there is little hope of success

in fractionation unless the supply of crude earths is very large. In my laboratory

I have, either worked up or ready for working, over 50 kilos, of samarskite con-
taining about 10 per cent, of yttria, and about 20 kilos, of gadoHuite containing
48 per cent, of yttria, besides a considerable quantity of other rare yttria minerals,
giving a total yield of about 15 kilos, of yttria.

                           4. On the Fractionation of Yttria.^
                       By William Crookes, F.B.S., V.P.C.S.

     Having already explained the methods of chemical fractionation, it is necessary

now to describe some of the results yielded by an extended perseverance in these

operations.

    I must, in the first place, explain that my work has been confined to a limited

--and very rare group of bodies the eartliy bases contained in such minerals as

samarskite, gadolinite, &c. These have been i-epeatedly put through the fractiona-
tion mill by other chemists, but the results have been most xmsatisfactory and

contradictory, no sufficiently good test being known whereby the singleness of any
earth got out by fractionation could be decided, except the somewhat untrust-
worthy one of the atomic weight. I say untrusticoi-thy because it is now known
that fi-actionation, unless it is pushed far beyond the point to which some Conti-
nental chemists have even carried it, is quite as liable to give mixtures which
refuse to split up under further treatment of the same kind, as it is to yield a

 chemically simple body.

     It is well known that a limited group of these rare earths, when phosphoresced
in vacuo, yield discontinuous spectra. The method adopted to bring out the spectra

is to treat the substance under examination with strong sulphmlc acid, drive off
excess of acid by heat, and finally to raise the temperature to dull redness. It is
then put into a radiant-matter tube, of the form shown in fig. 1, and the induc-
tion spark is passed through it after the exhaustion has been pushed to the required
degree. The phosphorescence occurs beneath the negative pole. Bodies like yttrium
sulphate, &c., under the stimulus phosphoresce, emitting light whose waves tend
to collect round definite centres of length. The phosphorescent light which the
discharge evokes is best seen in a spectroscope of low dispersion, and with not too

bands seen in solutions of didymium than to the lines given by spark spectra.

only ; the centre of each band may be taken as accurately determined within the

unavoidable errors of experiment, but it is impossible to define their edges with

much precision.

As a general rule, the purer the earth the sharper the band, and when impuri-

ties are removed to the utmost exteiit, the sharpness is such as to deserve the

name of a line.

To this rule one exception occurs. The body which I have named SS, or 609,

is remarkable for the great sharpness of its phosphorescent line, and I have noticed

scarcely any variation in its sharpness, however large the bulk of extraneous earth

associated with it. This line, however, is sharper and brighter when the current

is first turned on than it is after phosphorescing for a minute or so.

In the Bakerian lecture on yttrium delivered before the Hoyal Society,^ I

described the phosphorescent spectrum given by this element, and in the address

which I have had the honour of delivering before this Section I gave a drawing

of the spectrum of yttrium, together with a sketch of the train of reasoning by

which I had been led to the opinion that excessive and systematic fractionation

had split up this stable molecular group into its components, distributing its atoms

into several groups, with difierent phosphorescent spectra.

    No longer than twelve months ago the name yttria conveyed a perfectly defi-

nite meaning to all chemists. It meant the oxide of the elementary body yttrium.

I have in my possession specimens of yttria from M. de Marignac (considered by

him to be purer than any chemist had hitherto obtained), from M. Oleve (called

by him ' purissimum '), from M. de Boisbaudran (a sample of which is described
by this eminent chemist as ' scarcely soiled by traces of other earths '), and also
many specimens prepared by myself at difierent times, and purified up to the

highest degree known at the time of preparation. Practically these earths are all

the same thing, and up to a year ago every living chemist would have described
them as identical, i.e., as the oxide of the element yttrium. They are almost indis-

tinguishable one from the other, both physically and chemically, and they give the

phosphorescent spectra in vacuo with extraordinary brilliancy. This is what I

Nowformerly called yttria, and have more recently called old yttria.    these

constituents of old yttrium are not impurities in yttrium any more than praseody-

mium and neodymium (assuming them really to be elementary) would be impurities

in didymium. They constitute a veritable splitting up of the yttrium molecule

into its constituents.

     The plan adopted in the fractionation of yttria does not difier in principle from

the methods described in my paper ' On the Methods of Chemical Fractionation.'

Dilute ammonia is added to a very dilute solution of the earth in only sufficient

quantity to precipitate one half. After standing for several hours the precipitate

is filtered. After each fractionation the filtrate is passed to the left and the

precipitate to the right, and the operations are continued many thousand times.
     The diagram (fig. 2) shows tlie scheme clearly, with the direction the precipi-

tates and solutions travel. Limited space, even on a large diagram, prevents me

from giving more than a fevr operations, but they will he sufficient to satisfy you
that enormous patience, a large amount of material, and a not insignificant
number of bottles, are requisites for successful fractionation.

     After a certain time, on examining the series of earths in the lowest fine
of bottles, their phosphorescent spectra are found to alter in the relative
intensities of some of the lines, and ultimately diff'erent portions of the frac-
tionated earths show spectra, such as I have endeavoured to illustrate at the
foot of the diagram (tig. 2), in which I have given the spectra of five com-
ponents of yttrium.

     The final result to which I have come ia that there are certainly five, and
probably eight, constituents into which yttrium may be split. Taking the con-

stituents in Older of approximate basicity (the chemical analogue of refrangi-

bUity) the lowest earthy constituent gives a deep blue band Ga (X 482) ; then
there is a strong citron band G5 (X 574), which has increased in sharpness till

it deserves to be called a line ; then come a close pair of greenish blue lines,.

G/3 (X 549 and X 541, mean 545); then a red band, G^ (X 619), then a deep red
band, G^ (X 647), next a yellow band, Ge (X 597), then another green band,.
Gy (X 564) ; this (in samarskite and cerite yttria) is followed by the orange line
S6 (X 609). The samarium bands remain at the highest part of the series.
These, I am satisfied, are also separable, although for the present I have scarcely

touched them, having my hands fully occupied with the more easily resolvable
earths. The yellow band, Ge, and green band, Gy, may in fact be due to a

splitting up of samarium.

     Until we know more about these bodies I refrain from naming them, but will
designate them provisionally by the mean wave-length of the dominant band. If;,
however, for the sake of easier discussion among chemists a definite name is thought

and only a very faint trace of Grj. Yttrium from euxeuite is almost identical

with that from hielmite. Yttrium from cerite contains most G( and G8, less Ga

and G^, only a trace of Grj, and a fair proportion of S8.

  --Referring to the diagram it is seen that Ya (gadolinium) is composed of the

following hand-foi-ming bodies: G/3, SS, G^, togetlier with a little samariiun.
Calling the samarium an impurity, it is thus seen that gadolinium is composed of

at least three simpler bodies.

You have probably anticipated in your minds a question which is likely to

occur at this point of the enquiry. If such results have been obtained by sub-

mitting yttrium to this novel method of analysis, what will be the result of

fractionating some other reputed element ?

Yttrium, as I have explained, is an exceedingly stable molecular group, capable

of acting as an element, just as calcium, for instance, acts as an element : to split

up yttrium requires not only enormous time and material, but the existence of a

test by means of which the constituents of yttrium are capable of recognition.

Had we tests as delicate for the constituent molecular groups of calcium, this also

might be resolved into simpler groupings. It is one thing, however, to find out

means of separating bodies which we know to be distinct and have colour or

spectrum reactions to guide at every step ; it is quite another thing to separate
colourless bodies which are almost identical both in chemical reaction and atomic

weight, especially if we have no suspicion that the body we are dealing with is a

mixture.

One of the chief difficulties in the successful carrying out of an investigation in

radiant-matter spectroscopy is the extraordinary delicacy of the test. This extreme

sensitiveness is a drawback rather than a help. To the inexperienced eye one part

of yttrium in ten thousand gives as good an indication as one part in ten, and by

far the gi'eater part of the chemical work undertaken in my hunt for spectrum-

forming elements was performed upon material which later knowledge shows did

not contain sufficient to respond to any known chemical test. It is as if the

element sodium were to occur in ponderable quantity only in a few rare minerals

seldom seen out of the collector's cabinet. With only the yellow line to guide,

and seeing the brilliancy with which an imponderable trace of sodium in a mineral

declares its presence in the spectrum, I venture to think that a chemist would have

about as stiff a hunt before he caught his yellow line as I have had to bring my

orange and citron bands to earth.

Chemistry, except in a few instances, such as water-analysis and the detection

of poisons, where necessity has stimulated minute research, takes little account of

' traces,' and when an analysis adds up to 99'999, the odd O'OOl per cent, is conve-
niently put down to ' impurities,' ' loss,' or 'errors of analysis.' When, however,

the 99-999 per cent, constitutes the impurity and this exiguous 0-001 is the precious

material to be extracted, and when, moreover, its chemistry is absolutely unknown,

the difficulties of the problem become enormously enhanced. Insolubility as

ordinarily understood is a fiction, and separation by precipitauts is nearly impos-

Asible.   new chemistry has to be slowly built up, taking for data uncertain and

deceptive indications, marred by the interfering power of mass in withdrawing

soluble salts from a solution, and the solubiUty of nearly all precipitates when

present in traces in water or in ammoniacal salts. '\\'hat is here meant by ' traces

will be better understood if I give an instance. After fifteen months' work I

obtained the earth yttria in a state which most chemists would call absolutely

pure, for it contained not more than one part of impurity (samaria) in two hundred

and fifty thousand parts of yttria. But this one part in a quarter of a million pro-

foundly altered the character of yttria from a radiant-matter-spectroscopic point of

view, and the persistence of this very minute quantity of interfering impurity

entailed another ten months' extra labour to eliminate these final ' traces ' and to

ascertain the real reaction of the earth called yttria.

      5. On the Colour of the Oxides of Cerium and its Atomic Weight.^
                                  By H. Robinson, M.A.

This paper was principally a criticism of Wolf's paper on the atomic weight of

cerium, puhlished iu the 'American Journal of Science and Art/ 1868. Great

prominence is given to this work in Clarke's ' Constants of Nature.' Wolf's eerie

oxide was white, and the atomic weight of                                                    the  metal  was  137              or,  as  recalculated
                                                                                                                           ·,

by Clarke, 138'. The writer of the present paper contended that Wolf's method

--of separation was wrong tliat it would not give eerie but lanthanum oxide, which

is white, and which contains a metal with an atomic weight lower than that of

cerium. Wolf's method of separation was repeated fractionation of impure cerous

sulphate by gentle evaporation. Robinson made similar experiments and found

the proportion of Ce^Oj to LajOg decreased from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1 by making the

same number of crystallisations Wolf had done. He also found that at the

temperature of the evaporation, 65°, 100' cc. of water held in solution 10'296

grains of Oe._,3SO^, wliile under the same conditions onl}' 2"106 grains of La23SO^

remained in solution in the same quantity of water. He maintained the colour of

eerie oxide is not white, as is sometimes supposed, but a pale sulphur yellow, and

that the atomic w^eight of cerium is 140"2, as found by himself and also by

Branner.

Riban has shown that the former of these bodies is less easily decomposed by

water ; the author shows that it is also more stable under the influence of heat.

Tilden has shown that at a low red heat turpentine breaks up more completely

than  campheue                                                   the  author  extends  this  observation  to  lower            temperatures,  by

The paradoxical result that the hydrochloride from the stable hydrocarbon is

less stable than that from the unstable one is held to prove that this is a ' molecular '

compound, the chlorine in it remaining associated with the hydrogen of the acid,

while at the same time being attached to the hydrocarbon.

          8. On Derivatives of Tolidin and the Azotolidin Dyes.
                        By R. F. RuTTAN, B.A., M.D.

     Tolidin and its older homologue benzidin have only quite recently become
prominent, owing to the discovery of the so-called azo-colours.

     Benzidin was first prepared by Zinin, in 1845,^ and its mode of formation from
hydrazobenzene described by Hafman ·* Schultz * established the now accepted
formula for this base, and investigated many of its reactions. Tolidin was
prepared in an analogous way to benzidin, but its reactions were not studied.
Petriew,^ who was the first to obtain orthotolidin, only in small quantity, however,
gives the melting-point 112°. This is too low ; the proper melting-point is 127-128°.

Generally this base resembles benzidin very closely in its behaviour, but diflers
considerably from toluidine.

     It forms with mineral acids two series of salts, the acid salts being the more in-
soluble. It gives a play of colours from green to blue, finally scarlet, on dropping

a dilute aqueous solution of bromine in an alcoholic solution of the base. It forms a
soluble monacetyl and an insoluble diacetyl derivative in form of silky needles. The

hydrogen of the amidogen groups may be replaced b}' two or four methyl groups

 forming secondary bases resembling tolidin, and melting at 69° and 81° respectively.

Further union -with methyl iodide gives the ammonium salt, crystallising in red
needles, from which the hydrate may be obtained by silver oxide.

     With chloroform by no experiment could even traces of an isocyanide be

obtained.

     Carbon disulphide forms a thiourea but yields no isosulphocyanide. The base
unites directly with cyanogen to form a dicyanogen compound of red colour and
very insoluble. With urea it unites directly, evolving ammonia, forming a com-
pound urea. The same substance can be obtained with phosgene gas, hydrochlorate
of tolidin being simultaneously formed. The diuitrodiacetyl crystallises in yellow
needles, soluble in hot nitrobenzol. Strong caustic potash forms from this the

nitrotolidin in red plates soluble in alcohol.

      Nitrous acid gives a tetrazoditolyl from which all the azotolidin colours are

derived. Their general formula may be represented by

                             CH3-CgH3-N = N-R

                                   CHj-C^Hg-N^^N-R

Rwhere represents more or less complex aromatic acids or their sodium salts.
RThus in Congo red, is the sodium salt of naphthylaminesulphonic acid ; in

chrysarine yellow it is sodium salicylate ; in azo blue B-uaphtholsulphonic acid.
These colours are peculiar, in that they alone of aU the artificial dyes are capable

of dyeing cotton and wood fibre directly, i.e., without the intervention of a mordant.

Cotton fibre boiled in tolidin hydrochlorate, washed, dried, and dipped first in
dilute nitrous acid, and then in some of the above acids is permanently coloured of
particular dye formed by that acid, thus showing that the tolidin probably unites
 with the oxycellulon of the cotton, and so acts as a mordant. This is rendered

further probable, as when once dyed by one of these colours cotton fibre will form
mixed colours directly with such basic dyes as fucsin, methyl blue, &c.

      TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7.

      The following Papers were read :

1. On the Treatment of PhospJwric Crude Iron in Open-hearth Furnaces.

                                By J. W. Wailes.

     The great importance of a process dealing with phosphoric iron must be
measured by the extent of the deposits of ore yielding phosphoric pig. These
deposits in Europe exceed by ten or twelve to one the deposits of ore yielding purer

pig-

      The amount of phosphorus that can be allowed in finished steel may be taken

at not more than one tenth per cent., though this is more by about half than

manufacturers care to deal with.

      The softer and purer kinds of steel, where great ductility is required, shoidd

contain as little phosphorus as possible, the efletft of this element being to render

iron and steel brittle at ordinary temperatures.

   A description of puddling was then given (illustrated in the diagrams), showing

the furnace and the reactions that take place during the process, and it was con-

tended that the manual labour of puddliug was rendered necessary by the limited

range of heat obtainable in puddling furnaces, which is not sufiicient to retain iron

after it has parted with a large proportion of its alloys in a molten condition, so

Athat the metal has to be removed from the furnace in a spongy state.  com-

parison was then drawn between the process of purifying phosphoric iron by
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                       593

puddling and the results obtained in the ' Batho furnace,' an improved form of the
Siemens regenerative furnace. It was shown that the Batho furnace was reduced
to a simple mechanical contrivance, and that the idea of a furnace as a building

had been entirely abandoned.

     The means of applying the basic lining to the simplified furnace, which consists
of detached regenerative stoves and a melting-vessel, connections between the two
being made by means of tubas lined with heat-resisting material.

     The basic lining is mixed with short fine wire, which is used like hair in plaster
on ordinary walls, simply to keep it from cracking and falling off. It was pointed
out that the difficulty of applying a basic lining to a vessel of this kind is reduced
to a minimum.

     The process of treating phosphoric crude iron in this vessel was then described
and reactions given similar to those obtained in the puddling furnace, but more
perfect as a natural result of a more perfect heat, producing more perfect reactions.
Instead of the metal being drawn from the furnace in a spongy state, it is run out
into moulds, fluid and in a more highly refined condition.

     Comparison was made with the Bessemer basic process, and it was shown that

in this process the oxidising base necessary had, in a large measure, to be obtained
by the oxidation of part of the metallic charge, whereas in the open-hearth treat-

ment the oxide is put in the furnace as oxide.

     It was pointed out that the purest homogeneous iron was not in one respect

equal to the produce of the puddling furnace.

      If highly-wrought iron, like a patent faggoted axle, be subjected after it is
superficially cut with a sharp tool to the shock of a falling weight, it will only open

-- --to the depth of the cut the fibre of the metal opening at this point whereas the

purest steel under similar treatment, not having this fibre, would break.
     In conclusion, it was stated that the open-hearth process described did not so

much supersede puddling as render the manual labour unnecessary, and by

natural reaction, under more perfect heat, arrive at a more perfect result.

       2. On the Basic Bessemer Process in South Staffordshire.

                              By W. Hutchinson.

On account of the great importance of the successful application of a dephos-

phorising process to South Staflbrdshire iron, Mr. Hutchinson was requested to give

an account of the procedure at the works of the South Staffordshire Steel and Ingot

Iron Co. The account included an analysis of the dolomite used in making the basic

lining, and a description of the preparation of the lining, together with the basic
Abricks and converted bottoms.
                                short description of the process was given. On

account of the siliceous character of the metal used it is first blown for a short

time in a Bessemer vessel with acid lining, and after partially desiliconising it is

transferred to the basic vessel, where the removal of the phosphorus is effected.

Analyses were given of the iron before and after desiliconising, and also of the

finished product. An account was given of the mechanical tests adopted and of

the branches of manufacture for which the material is particularly adapted. The

paper concluded with a reference to the basic slag produced during the process.

3. On the Production of Soft Steel in a neio type of Fia-ed Converter.
                              By George Hatton.

     Large and costly plants hitherto generally employed for steel-maMng beino-

beyond the reach of many iron manufacturers having existing works which they
might wish to adapt for steel-making, some rapid and continuous method of steel-
making involving only moderate expenditure on plant has long been desirable ; and
the fixed converter ofiers many advantages in this direction.

     Eeferring to Sir Henry Bessemer's use of a fixed converter, and the subsequent

use of such converters in Sweden, the paper points out the great difficulty always

attending the use of fixed converters of the old type, namely, the necessity for

maintaining a current of blast through the tuyeres after the blow was finished and
during the process of tapping, producing undesirable oxidation of the metal, and
describes M. Wittnofftt's suggestions for dealing with the difficulty, also the Clapp
and Griffiths diSerential piston valve for closing up the backs of the tuyeres.

     The type of converter as constructed by the writer at Bilston is next described.
It consists of a vessel, not unlike an ordinary Bessemer vessel in outward shape,
supported and rigidly fixed on four* cast-iron columns; the lower section, containing
the charge of metal, having tuyeres through the sides and a solid bottom of silica
bricks, is removable, and can readily be replaced by means of a hydraulic ram,
which raises it into position or lowers it for removal, as required. The blast boxes
are fixed around the casing of the upper section in a position above the metal-line,
connection from these to the tuyeres being through cast-iron down pipes, each fitted
with a ' bafiler " valve (one to each tuyere). These valves are simultaneously

closed at the termination of the blow, a small hole through each valve admitting
enough blast to support the metal in the converter and keep it out of the tuyeres.

     It is claimed that softer and more reliable material is obtained in this vessel
than in the ordinary Bessemer one. Owing to the action being less violent, there is
less risk of oxidation, as the final changes take place less rapidly; as, instead of the

--whole bath being constantly penetrated and oxidised as in the bottom-blown

--Yessel only about a third of the charge is under treatment at once, a further

indirect process of oxidation at the same time being carried on by circulation and
admixture of the oxidised iron with the remaining portion of the bath.

      This converter has an advantage over small Siemens plants, inasmuch as soaking

pits caa be used.

     Some analyses are given both of soft st«el produced and of steel castings, for the
manufacture of which this converter is well adapted.

          4. The Influence of Remelting on tlie Projjerties of Cast Iron.

                                    By Thomas Turner.

     In the ' Report of the British Association ' for 1853 (p. 87) an account is given
of an elaborate series of experiments undertaken by Sir William Fairbairn to
ascertain the effect of remelting on the mechanical value of cast iron. The metal
used was Eglinton hot blast grey iron, which was melted 18 times in an air furnace,
tests being performed at each remelting. It was found that the material gradually
improved up to the 12th melting, then rapidly deteriorated, becoming white, hard,
and weak at the 18th melting. The following analyses, given in the original paper,
are due to Professor Calvert :

                                                                   Percentage of

     In connection with Mr. A. E. Jordan, the author has also examined the condi-
tion of silicon in cast iron, and concludes, with Snelus and others, that in the vast

majority of cases at least, silicon does not occur in the graphitic form. He believes

it to he present in the form of silicide. Recently Dr. Sorby has observed by means
of the microscope minute crystals in cast iron, which he believes to be silicon. The
author does not consider the evidence in support of this opinion to be conclusive as
yet, and contends that, even if these minute crystals should prove to be silicon,
in their chemical behaviour they more closely resemble that element in the amor-

phous than in the graphitic condition.

6. The Influence of Silicon on tM Properties of Iron and Steel.
                           By Thomas Tuener.

The following is a preliminary account of a series of experiments the completion

of which wiU probably occupy several years. The object in view is to determine

the influence of silicon on the mechanical properties of steel as used either for

castings or tools, and also on the purest kind of iron met with in commerce.

For the present experiments, which were conducted at the works of the South

Staffordshire Steel and Ingot Iron Company, Bilston, iron was taken by means of a

small ladle from the Bessemer converter just after the blow was finished, and before

any addition of manganese had been made. It was therefore very nearly pure

iron, containing not more than one quarter of a per cent, of all substances other

than iron. This material was poured into a red-hot crucible of Stourbridge fire-

clay, and in which was placed a weighed quantity of silicon pig iron containing

10 per cent, of silicon. After being well mixed together the contents were allowed

to solidify in the pot and afterwards examined.

The material was originally rather redshort owing to the absence of manganese,

but redshortness did not seem to be at all diminished by a small addition of silicon,

and before 02 per cent, was reached the metal went to pieces on attempting to roll

it red hot. The metal appears to weld equally well with all proportions of silicon

Awhich are capable of being rolled, and is very tough when cold.  few hundredths

per cent, of silicon caused the metal to remain much quieter on pouring, while about

Ahalf a per cent, conferred the property of hardening in a remarkable manner.

chisel prepared from this material was very tough cold, and retamed its cutting edge

very well indeed, and giving a fracture much resembling tool steel. It was how-

ever very difficult to work while hot.

The author hopes to be able to give fuller details in a few months.

stands on an ordinary working bench. The furnace has also been found useful for

a variety of other uses in the laboratory.

                         3. On the Chemistry of Estuary Water.
                 By Hugh Robert Mill, D.Sc, F.B.8.E., F.C.S.

      Although chemical problems connected with ocean water and oceanic deposits
have been attacked by Forchhammer, Dittmar, and others, while recently Norwegian

 and German investigators have done much to elucidate the conditions obtaining in

 enclosed and partially enclosed seas, the chemistry of estuaiy water has been com-

 paratively neglected.
       In investigating an estuary the first essential is to ascertain the salinity (ratio

 of total dissolved matter to water), from point to point, and to trace its variations;
 the second to perform accurate analyses of the saline and gaseous contents at various
 positions suggested by the previous salinity observations. The first of these has
 been done completely for the Firth of Forth, and partially for the Firth of Clyde

 and some other river entrances in Scotland ; the second is in progress. By means

 of the hydrometer (form used by Mr. Buchanan on the Challenger Expedition) the
 distribution of salinity in the Firth of Forth has been proved to be nearly constant
 aU the year round, while that of the Firth of Clyde is subject to periodical variations
 through the whole mass of water. The conclusion drawn from the form of the
 density (salinity) curve for the Forth river-entrance is that mixture of river and
 sea water takes place by a true process of diffusion which produces and maintains
 a constant (though not uniform) gradient of density from river to sea. Possibly
 the difierent diffusive powers of the various potential compounds, the constituents

 of which exist in solution, may determine the formation of certain salts, and lead to
 the preponderance of these in certain places. The truth of this hypothesis will be
 tested by the second part of the inquiry, which is now being commenced.

      Observations of alkalinity by the method of Tornoe showed a marked increase
 of the (potential) calcium carbonate in solution with decrease of salinity, i.e., the
 dissolved matter of fresher water was richer in calcium carbonate than that of sea-

 water.

    5. An Apparatus for maintaining Constant Temperatures iip to 500°.

                             By G. H. Bailey, B.Sc, Ph.B.

     The apparatus consists of a tube of hard glass, 25 cm. long and 4 cm. in
diameter, placed horizontally over a furnace of 6 Bunseu burners, and enclosing

a smaller tube in which substances may be heated. Alongside this is the bulb of
an air-thermometer, which connects with a U-tube containing mercury. On heat-

ing, the mercm'y column is of course depressed in the near limb of the U-tube, and
rises in the further limb, the amount of the depression being indicated by a
millimeti-e scale. The instrument is first graduated by placing a high boiling
thermometer in the heating tube, and then constructing from the readings a curve,

by reference to which the temperature may be ascertained when the reading on the

scale is known.
     The gas supply passes through a tube fitting into the further limb of the U-tube

arranged as a gas regulator, so that, as the mercury rises in this limb, it cuts down
the supply. By raising or depressing this regulator the point at which the supply

is cut off "is determined, and any desired temperature can thus be maintained in the
heating tube. The apparatus has been foimd reliable up to 500°, and it is possible

6. On a neiv Apparatus for readily determining the Calorimetric Vahie of
     Fuel or Organic Compounds hy Birect Combustion in Oxygen. By
     William Thomson, F.B.8.E.

      This consists of an arrangement by which the organic substance is burned in a
small platinum crucible, set in a non-conducting cup or holder, the whole being
enclosed by a thin glass inverted test-tube, and the combustion performed under
water. The stream of oxygen is directed on to the burning material by a movable

narrow brass tube, so that the combustion is absolutely under control. By this
means plumbago or anthracite may be easily and perfectly burned, which cannot be

done by the apparatus devised by Mr. Lewis Thompson, which consists in burning
the material by means of a mixture of chlorate and nitrate of potash. This last
arrangement gives inaccurate results and is unscientific, inasmuch as there are
many things which modify the results which cannot be measured, and which vary
in each experiment.

      The gases from the combustion in oxygen pass through water contained in a long
thin glass beaker ; the glass, platinum, mercury, and brass work used in the

--apparatus is weighed, and from theii' specific heat their equivalent in water is

calcidated 2,000 grammes of water are used for 1 gramme fuel.

8. The Crystalline Strticture of Iron Meteorites. By Dr. O. W. Huntington.

     The object of this paper was to show that the true iron meteorites have a
common crystalline structure, varying only in details, and not in general character..

    In the first place it is shown that the Widmanstiittiau figures and the Neumann
lines are simply the effects of the segregation of impurities durmg the process of
crystallisation parallel to the planes of crystalline growth, and are phenomena
similar in all respects to those observed in the crystals of many minerals.

     It appears that the Widmanstattian figures, though presenting additional
600 REPORT-- 1886.

features wlaich cannot be discovered in the Neumann lines, grade into the latter by-
such insensible steps that no natural division can be made between the two classes
of phenomena. It is shown also that the plates, of which both the figures and the

lines referred to are sections, are always parallel to faces of one of the three
fundamental forms of the regular system, the octahedron, dodecahedron, and cube,
and that the complications observed are only due to twinning. Figures were
drawn illustrating these points, and representing Widmanstattian plates in all the

positions described.

     It is further shown that the planes of fracture frequently observed in the iron
meteorites are also parallel to the faces of the same three fundamental forms.
Such fractures have, in most cases, resulted from the concussion produced by the
rapid passage of the meteorite through the air, but may also at times be obtained
artificially, and ditfer in no respect from true cleavage planes, except in so far as
the malleaioility of the metal prevents us from developing the cleavage in the usual
way. This cleavage is distinguished from the jointed structure, sometimes result-
ing from the segregation of impurities and corresponding to the Widmanstattian
figures. It appears markedly in some of the most compact meteorites, and often
crosses the Widmanstattian plates. Finally, the close agreement of these phenomena
with what has been observed in the artificial crystallisation of iron and other

materials is pointed out.

     This investigation throws no new light upon the origin of meteorites, except so
far as it strengthens the opinion that the process of crystallisation must have been
extremely slow. The occurrence of large masses of native iron occluding hydrogen

gas, and containing nickel, cobalt, phosphorus, sulphur, &c., implies a combination

of conditions which the spectroscope indicates as actually realised in our own sun
 and in other suns among the fixed stars, and the most probable theory seems to be
 that these masses were thrown off from such a sun, and that they very slowly

 cooled, while revolving in a zone of intense heat.

                THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2.

The President delivered the following Address :

I HAVE felt it a great honour and an especial pleasure to be asked to preside at the
Ameeting of Section C in Birmingham.
                                      great honoiu", because of the repute of

my predecessors ; an especial pleasure because, as born in the Midlands, I am

naturally proud of the Midland metropolis, its intellectual activity, and its com-

mercial enterprise. Besides this there are few towns in England where I number

more friends of kindred tastes than in Birmingham. Geology especially seems to

thrive in this district, and little wonder wben you reckon among your residents, in

addition to a host of other workers, such leaders as Grosskey, onalleus ei-raticorum,

Allport, who taught me how to work with the microscope, and Lapworth, to

whose genius my duller mind is under constant obligation.

The addresses delivered at the annual meetings of the British Association afford

a convenient opportunity for what may be termed stock-taking in some branch of

science which has especially attracted the attention of the author ; for a brief re-

view of past progress ; for a glance forward over the rich fields which still await

Weexploration.  may compare ourselves to pioneers in a land as yet imperfectly

known, the resources of which are only beginning to be developed. Taking our

stand upon some vantage-ground at the border of the clearings, we glance forward

over plains as yet untrodden, over forests as yet untracked, to consider in what
directions and by what methods of investigation new lands can be won through

peaceful conquest, new treasures added to the world's intellectual wealth.

I purpose, then, on the present occasion to offer to you a few remarks upon a

branch of geological investigation which appears to me full of promise for future
workers. The keynote of my address might be conveyed in the following sentence

' The apphcation of microscopic analysis to discovering the physical geography of

bygone ages.' The ultimate aim of geological researches is obtaining answers, in

the widest and fullest sense, to these two problems in the history of our globe

the evolution of life upon it, and the evolution of its physical features. In the

former a host of labourers, before and since the epoch of Darwin's great book, have

been employed in collecting and co-ordinating facts, and in framing hypotheses by

scientific induction. In the latter the workers are fewer, but the results obtained

are neither small nor unhopeful. In the past generation, men like Godwin-Austen

pointed out the principles of work and gathered no small harvest, but in the present

the application of the microscope to the investigation of rock structure has facilitated

research by furnishing us with an instrument of precision ; this, by disclosing to

us the more minute mineral composition and structural peculiarities of rocks,

·enables us to recognise fragments, and sometimes even to determine the source of

the smaller constituents in a composite clastic rock. The microscope, in short,

enables us to declare an identity where formerly only a likeness could be asserted,

to augment largely in all cases the probabilities for or against a particular hypo-

thesis, and to substitute in many a demonstration for a conjecture.

602 REPOET-- 1886.

Once for all, I ask you to bear in mind that this address is mainly a recital of

other men's work, so that I shall not need to interrupt its continuity by remarks

as to the original observers. The subject is, indeed, one to which 1 have paid                                                      I

some attention, but I can only call myself a humble follower of such men as God-
win-Austen, ' the physical geographer of bygone periods,' and Sorby, who was the

first to apply the microscope to similar problems, and to whom in this class of in-
vestigation we may apply the well-known saying. Nihil tetigit quod non ornavit.

     With the deepest gratitude also I acknowledge the loan or the gift of specimens

from Drs. Hicks and Callaway, from Messrs. Howard Fox, Somervail, Shipman,

Gresley, Houghton, Marr, Teall, and J. A. Phillips, from Professors Lapworth and

Judd. Through their liberality I have had the opportunity of examining for my-

self the greater part of tlie materials which have already been described in the

principal geological periodicals, and of adding many new slides to my own

collection.

The nature of the materials of grits and sandstones has been so admirably

treated by Dr. Sorby in his presidential address to the Geological Society for 1881

that I may pass briefly over this part of the subject. I will, however, add a few

details in the hope of placing more clearly before you the data of the problems

which are presented to us. In order to exemphfy the size of the fragments with
which we have to deal, I have made rough estimates of the diameters of the con--
stituent grains in a series of quartzose rocks. Sometimes there is much variability,

but very commonly the majority of the grains are tolerably uniform, both in size

and shape. In a slide from the Lickey quartzite, exposed in the railway cutting

at Frankley Beeches, grains, often well rolled, ranging from -02" to "03" are very-
common. In a specimen of Hartshill quartzite, they range from -01" to -03", but

the most common size is a little under '025". In a quartzite from west of Rush-
ton (Wrekin) a good many grains range from "03" to -OS". In two specimens of

quartzite (white and pale grey) from near Loch Maree, the grains commonly vary

a little on either side of -02", while in a specimen of the ' fucoidal quartzite

(mouth of Glen Logan) much greater variety is exhibited, a good deal of the
material being about -01" in diameter, but with many scattered grains up to -03".
The grains in a pale grey quartzite, from the Bunter beds at the north side of Can-

nock Chase, range from about -01" to -015", and are very uniform. In a liver-

coloured quartzite from the same locality they are about as long, but narrower and

sharply angular in form. These will serve as examples of what we may call an

myaverage, moderately iine grit or sandstone. It is                                             impression that in a very-

large number of ordinary sandstones most of the grains range from about one

to three hundredths of an inch. In rocks, however, to which most persons would

apply the epithet ' rather coarse-grained,' fragments of a tenth of an inch or more
in diameter are common.

It is extremely difficult to give, in general terms, an estimate of the size of the

crystalline constituents of ordinary granites, and the more coarsely crystalline

gneisses. But speaking of those which enter into the composition of the ground

mass, I should say that the individual quartz grains do not often exceed -03", and

are very frequently between this and ·02". In the finer-grained granites and more

distinctly banded gneisses, and their associated quartziferous schists, about '01" is a

common size, while in the finer schists (believed by many geologists to be later in^

date than the aforesaid) they range from -002" downwards, and do not generally

exceed ·001". Felspar crystals, where they occur, probably do not diifer very

materially in area from the quartz, though they are often, as might be expected,,

rather longer and  narrower                                               mica  crystals,  cut  transversely, are often longer and
                                                                       ;

usually much narrower. Of other constituents, as being either rarer or more liable

to change, I will not speak in detail. The individual quartz grains, in the compact

and glassy varieties of the more acid igneous rocks, are about the same size as

those in an ordinarj^ granite.

Space does not permit me to enter upon the methods of distinguishing between

the materials furnished by the diflerent varieties of crystalline schists, gneisses, and"

igneous rocks of similar chemical composition. For the most important of these I

must refer you to Dr. Sorby's address, but I may add that there are others which)
                                                                                                                                     --

it -would he almost impossible to describe in words, as they can only be learnt by

long-continued work and varied experience. I do not pretend to say that in the

case of a gi-it composed of fragments of about -02" diameter we can succeed in
identifying the parent rock of each individual, but I believe we can attain to a

reasonable certainty as to whether any large number of its constituents have been

furnished by granitoid rocks, by banded gneisses and schists, by fine-grained schists

or certain phyllites,       by  older  grits  or  argillites, or by lavas     and scoria.                                         There

                                                                                                                                 _

seem to be certain minute differences between the felspars from a granitoid rock

and from a porphyritic lava, and more markedly between the quartz grains from

the two rocks. The latter can generally be distinguished from the polysynthetic

grains furnished by certain schists or veins, and these not seldom one from another.

Obviously the larger the fragments the less, cateris paribus, the difficulty in their

identification. "When they exceed one-tenth of an inch the risk of important error

is, I believe, to a practised observer comparatively small.

      Obviously, also, the shape of the grains leads to certain inferences as to the dis-
tance which they have travelled from their original source, and as to the means of

transport, but into the details of this I must forbear to enter. I will merely remind
you that small angular' fragments of quartz are so slowly rounded, when trans-
ported by running water, that, if well-rounded grains appear in large numbers
in a sandstone, it seems reasonable to suppose that these are, in the main, wind-

drifted materials.

     Thus every rock in which the constituent particles admit of recognition and of

identification may be made to bear its part in the work of deciphering the past

history of the globe. Where the constituents have been derived from other rocks

we obtain some clue to the nature of the earth's crust at that epoch ; where the

locality whence a fragment was broken can be discovered, the nature, strength, and

direction of the agents of transport can be inferred. Some idea as to the structure

and surface contour of the earth in that district, and at that time, can be formed,

and thus the petrologist, by patient and cautious induction, may, in process of time,

build up from these scattered fragments the long-vanished features of the pre-

historic earth, with a certainty hardly less than that of the paleontologist, when

he bids the dry bones live, and repeoples land and sea with long-vanished races.

wider then is the field, so much more fascinating, to many minds, is the investiga-

tion. There are many districts which are without fruit for the palreontologist

there are few indeed which, to the petrologist, do not offer some hope of reward.

The field of research is so wide that not one nor few men can gather all its fruits.

It needs many workers, and it is in the hope of enlisting more that I have ventured

to bring the subject before you to-day.

                  Materials of the coarse?- fragmental rocks of Great Britain.^

    I proceed now to give a brief epitome of the constitution, so far as I know it,

of our British grits, sandstones, breccias, and conglomerates. I shall exclude, as

involving too many collateral issues, the Post-Pliocene beds, and dwell more on
the earlier than on the later deposits, because the latter obviously may be derived
from the former by denudation, so that it becomes the more difficult to conjecture

the immediate source of the constituent particles. Further, in order to avoid con-
troversy on certain questions of classification, or for brevity, I shall occasionally
group together geological formations which I think separable.

    It may be convenient, however, to call your attention to the localities at which,
at the present day, granitoid rocks (many of which may be of igneous origin, but are

of very ancient date), gneisses, and crystalline schists are exposed in Great Britain,
as well as those where considerable masses of igneous rock, of age not later than
Mesozoic, occur. The former constitute a large part of the north-western and
central highlands of Scotland and of the islands off its west coast ; they are ex-

that country, and for want of space have not dealt fully with those of Scotland.

the greater part of the Malvern Chain, and crop out at the Wrekin ; they occur

on the south coast, at the Lizard, and in the district ahout Start Point and Bolt

Head ; they rise above the sea at the Eddystone. It is probable that these last

are the relics of a great mass of crystalline rock, which may have extended over

the Channel Isles to Brittany ; also, that we may link with the massif of the Scotch

highlands the crystalline rocks of Western Ireland on the one hand, and of Scan-

dinavia on the other. Among the indubitably igneous rocks we have granite, or

rocks nearly allied to it, in Scotland, in the Lake district, in Leicestershire, and

in Devon and Cornwall. Felstones, old lavas, and tuft's of a more or less acid type

occur in Southern Scotland, to some amount also in the Highlands, in the Lake

district, and in various localities of rather limited extent in West-central England,

as well as in the south-west region just mentioned, while in Wales we have, in the

northern half, distinct evidence of three great epochs of volcanic outburst, viz., in

mthe Bala, the Arenig, and anterior to the Cambrian ' grits and slates. In South

Wales there were great eruptions at the last-named epoch and inOrdovician times.

I have passed over sundry smaller outbreaks and all the more basic rocks as less

immediately connected with my present purpose. It is, I suppose, needless to

observe that a coarsely crystalline rock, whether igneous or of metamorphic origin,

must be considerably older than one in which its fragments occur.

   --Cambrian and later Pre-Cambrian. That the majority at least of the gneisses

and crystalline schists in Britain are much older than the Cambrian period will

now, I think, hardly be disputed by an}' who have studied the subject seriously

and without prejudice. There are, however, later than these, numerous deposits,

frequently of volcanic origin, whose relation to strata indubitably of Cambrian age

is still a matter of some dispute. Therefore, in order to avoid losing time over dis-

cussions as to the precise position of certain of these deposits, or the particular bed

which in some districts should be adopted as the base of the Cambi'ian, I will asso-

ciate for my present purpose all the strata which, if not Cambrian, are somewhat

older. The latter, however, exhibit only micro-mineralogical changes, and of their

origin, volcanic or clastic of some kind, there can be no reasonable doubt ; so that

the  difference  in  age  does  not  appear  to  be  enormous                                                 that  is to  say, I  include  with
                                                                                                           ;

the Cambrian the Pebidian of some recent authors.

     The utility of microscopic research has nowhere been better exemplified than in

the case of the oldest rocks of St. David "s. Some authors have supposed that the

base of the Cambrian series in this district has been ' translated ' beyond recognition,

others that it has been thrust out of sight by the intrusion of granitic rock. But low
down in the series, beneath the earliest beds that have as yet furnished fossils to

British palaeontologists, there is a weli-marked and widespread conglomerate ; under-

lying this, with apparent unconformity, comes a series of beds very different in aspect,

chiefly volcanic, and beneath this a granitoid rock. The conglomerate, in places,

even without microscopic examination, proves the existence, though probably at

some distance, of more ancient rock, as it is full of pebbles of vein-quartz and

quartzite ; but in other parts it is crowded with pebbles closely resembling the fel-

stones in the underlying volcanic group, and in some parts becomes a regular arkose,

made up almost wholly of quartz and felspar, closely resembling those minerals in

the granitoid rock, of which also small rounded pebbles occasionally occur. One or
two fragments of a quartzose mica-schist, which is not known to occur in situ in

the district, have also been found. It is therefore e\'ident that not only is the

volcanic series somewhat, and the granitoid rock considerably, older than the con-

glomerate, but also that an important series of rocks, some of which were thoroughly

metamorphic, was exposed in the district when the conglomerate was formed. I

have very little doubt that a study of the finer-grained sedimentary Cambrian beds

overlying the conglomerate will corroborate, were it needed, the conclusion which

the latter justifies. Passing on to North Wales the coarser beds in the Harlech

      ' I take the base of the Arenig as the commencement of the next formation,
the Ordovician, which thus represents one phase of the Lower Silurian in the

variable nomenclature of the Geological Survey.

axis, so far as they have been examined, are found to be full of fragmeutal quartz
and felspar, which is undoubtedly derived from a granitoid rock ; some beds being-

made up of little else. No rock of this character, so far as I am aware, is exposed

in this part of Wales, but a ridge of granitoid rock extends from the town of Car-
narvon to the neighbourhood of Port Dinorwig. Through this, apparently, the
great felstone masses which occupy considerable tracts on the northern margin of
the hills between Carnarvon Bay and the valley of the Ogwen have been erupted,
and over this comes a series of grits, slates and conglomeratic or agglomeratic beds,
overlain ultimately by the basal conglomerate of the undoubted Cambrian series.
It was formerly maintained that these felstones were only lower beds of the Cam-

--brian metamorphosed practically fused by some 'metapeptic' process. This

notion, however, was quickly dispelled by microscopic examination. The overlyinj;

conglomerate is often crowded with pebbles, identical in all important respects with
the felstone itself, which also presents many characteristics of a lava flow as

opposed to an intrusive mass, and is no doubt an ancient rhyolite now devitrified.
There is some difference of opinion among the geologists who have worked in this

district as to the exact correlation of various gritty, conglomeratic or agglomeratic

beds which succeed the felstone, as is only natural where disturbances are many,
and continuous outcrops generally few. But all agree on the existence of a series,
into which volcanic materials enter largely, between the above-named basal Cam-

brian conglomerate and the felstone. In this, then, and in the basal conglomerate

we have again and again more or less rounded fragments of old rhyolitic lavas.

We"VVe have numerous and varied lapilli, probably of like chemical composition.

have grits which are largely composed of quartz and felspar, resembling that in the

granitoid rock, together with fine-grained quartzose schists and bits of rhyolite, all

Wemingled together.  have also occasionally, as in the Cambrian conglomerate

near Llyn-Padarn, pebbles of the granitoid rock. Further, the basal conglomerate,

as near Moel Tryfaen, is sometimes crowded with fragments of gritty argillites.
Fine-grained schists, as will be noted, seem to be rare in this district, but, as such

rocks occur in situ in the Lleyn peninsula, they will probably be discovered

more abundantly when the Cambrian conglomerate is examined further in that

direction.

     Fine-grained micaceous, chloritic, and other schists occupy a considerable portion

of Anglesey, and in the neighbourhood of Ty Croes there is an important outcroj.i
of granitoid rock. The former were once regarded as metamorphosed Cambrian, the

latter as granite which aided in the metamorphism at the end of the Ordovician

period. In Anglesey the earlier Palaeozoic rocks are not generally rich in fossils,
so that it is sometimes difficult to settle their precise position. The oldest beds
which have been thus identified have been placed in the Cambrian (Tremadoc), but

some experts have doubted whether quite so low a position can be assigned to them.
Hence the exact age of the oldest Palfeozoic beds in this island is uncertain, and

whether the basal conglomerates near Ty Croes are of the same age as those in

Carnarvonshire. This, however, is certain, that some of the Anglesey grits above
the basal conglomerate are largely made up of quartz and felspar derived from a

granitoid rock. Others include numerous fragments of very tine-grained schists,

like those so abundant in the island, and the conglomerate contains pebbles some-
times full two inches in diameter, absolutely identical with the rocks in the adjacent

granitoid ridge (the foliated structure distinctive of some parts of it having been

even then assumed), together with various metamorphic rocks, some green schistose

fore they became fragments probably these were derived from the hypometamor-

phic series, which Dr. Callaway has described, and which also contains pebbles of

the granitoid rocks. Fragments of the characteristic fine-grained schists are, so

far as I at present know, less common among the Anglesey grits and conglo-
merates than one would expect, perhaps owing to their comparative destructi-
bility ; but I have found them occasionally and suspected their presence more often.
Hence there can be no doubt that older crystalline rocks have very largely con-
tributed to the formation of at least the coarser members of the lower Palaeozoics

of Anglesey.
606 EBPOET-- 1886.

    Passing now to Central England we come to regions whicL may be regarded as
almost the exclusive property of your local geologists. The HoUybush sandstone

on the flanks of the Malvern is, no doubt, largely composed of the finer debris of the

older rocks of that chain, but the Malvern hills are only an unburied fragment of
a vastly larger area of crystalline Archaan rock. This is just indicated some seven

miles farther north in the Abberley hills. It crops up at either end of the Wrekin,

and for a little space near Rushton, but in the later fragmental rocks of the district

we have abimdant proofs of its existence. The central part of the Wrekin is

composed of volcanic rocks, rhyolites of varied kinds, with agglomerates; these

were once regarded by our highest authorities as greenstones intrusive in beds of

Ordovician age, but Mr. S. AUport has taught us their true nature, and Dr. Calla-

way has proved their far greater antiquity. Similar rocks are to be found elsewhere

Wein the neighbourhood of the Wrekin, and in the district farther west.  cannot

affix a precise date to the volcanic outbursts of the Wrekin, but we can prove

that they are not newer than the quartzite which fringes the hill, as it contains

fragments of the perlitic and other glassy rocks of the apparently underlying series.

This quartzite is certainly much older than the newer part of the Cambrian, and

pebbles of rhyolites, resembling those of theAVrekin, occur in the indubitable Cambrian

beds farther west. For instance, a gi-it at Haughmond Hill is quite full of frag-

ments of volcanic rock, many of them scoriaceous ; another suggests the derivation of

some of its materials from a mica-schist, while, according to Dr. Callaway, the con-

glomerates and grits of the Longmynds (which form the main part of the mass)

are largely derived from older rocks, the former being crowded with pebbles of purple

Arhyolite, quartz, felspar, mica, and occasional bits of mica-schist.  most interest-

ing conglomerate, apparently older than the quartzite, occurs at Charlton Hill.

This contains more or less rolled fragments of grits, qvuxrtzites, and argillites, look-

ing in several cases as if they had undergone, before being broken off, the usual

micro-mineralogical changes. It contains also fragments of rhyolite and many of

coarse granitoid or gneissoid rocks of Malvernian type, besides numerous grains of

quartz and felspar of a like character. Finer-grained gneissoid rocks and schists,

micaceous, hornblendic or chloritic, are present in fair amount. The last bear
some resemblance to the Rushton rocks, and remind me strongly of rocks which

occur in the Highlands and in the Alps, apparently not in the lowest part of the

Archaean series. Some also resemble the Anglesey schists. The quartzite itself is
largely made up of grains of quartz which appear to me to have been derived from

old granitoid rocks. Occasional grains, however, suggest, by their composite struc-

ture, derivation from a quartzose rock of finer texture, and, as already said, bits of

the Wrekin rhyolite sometimes occur. The same is true of the Lickey quartzite,

in regard to all three constituents, in which an occasional grain of microcline, very

characteristic of old granitoid rocks, has been observed. The quartz-grains in this
and in the former rock are occasionally very much rounded. The Lickey quartzite

lias lately been shown by Professor Lapworth to overlie rhyolitic rocks, and it is
much older than the lowest Silurian. Not improbably it is of the same age, and

was once connected with that of the Wrekin district. The Hartshill quartzite,

near Nuneaton, has a similar composition, is below Cambrian, and overlies some

rhyolitic rocks. Thus these insulated areas prove the existence of an old fragmental

series, which is largely composed of materials derived from pre-existing and much

more ancient Archaean rocks. It is difficult to assign a date to the unfossiliferous

rocks forming the rugged hills of Charnwood Forest, but, as they have been

affected by very ancient earth-movements, and there is nowhere any valid evidence

of volcanic activity in the true Cambrians, they may be assigned with most pro-

bability to the antecedent epoch, which seems to have been one of great disturbance.

Microscopic examination has shown that materials of volcanic origin enter largely

into the composition of these Charnwood rocks, even the most finely grained ; but

besides occasional fragments of slaty rock in the breccias, for which a high antiquity

cannot be asserted, we find some pebbles of vein-quartz and two or three beds of

quartzite. The grains in these appear to liave been derived from old granitoid

rocks, and not from the porphyritic rhyolites of the district. In one case, at the

Brande, they are most conspicuously rolled, and this has happened, though less

-uniformly, in a grit from near the ruins, Bradgate, whicli also contains grains of com-

pound structure. In conclusion, I must briefly notice the so-called Torridon sand-

stone of North-western Scotland, which is in many respects invaluable to the student.

That it is not later than the base of the Ordovician is indisputable ; that it is under-
lain by and derived from a mass of Archaean rocks, gneisses, more or less granitoid,

with occasional schists, is universally admitted. Its coarser basement beds are

crowded with fragments of the underlying gneisses and schists, and since the epoch

of their formation no important change has taken place in either the one or the other.

The finer beds, though other materials occasionally occur, are largely, sometimes

almost exclusively, composed of grains of quartz and of felspar identical in every

respect with those in the underlying series. It may be a fact of some significance,

for it agrees with what I have elsewhere noticed in very old fragmental rocks, that

the felspar appears to have been broken ofl:" from the parent rock while still unde-

composed, and in many cases is even now remarkably well preserved. It would

^eem, therefore, as if the denudation of the granitoid rock had been accomplished

without material decomposition of its felspar, but I must not allow myself to

digress into speculations on this interesting and suggestive fact. While referring to

this district I may mention the quartzites, though, strictly speaking, they are

Ordovician in age. These in some cases consist all but exclusively of quartz

grains derived from the Archaean series, which, however, are generally smaller than

those in the Torridon ; it would seem as if the felspar of the parent rock had either
decomposed in situ, or had been broken up in consequence of the longer distance

from the source of supply. This quartzite is sometimes of singular purity, contain-

ing little or no earthy material, and only rarely a flake of mica or a grain of felspar,

tourmaline or epidote (?).

Onlovician-Silurian.^ln regard to the earlier of these formations I am better

acquainted with the volcanic than with the non-volcanic fragmental beds. Still,

so far as I have seen, we find among the latter frequent indications of a supply of

materials from regions of crystalline as well as of ordinary sedimentary rocks. The

quartzite of the Stiper Stones (possibly earlier than the Arenig) appears to have

derived most of its grains from granitoid rocks, and probably the same is true of

many of the coarser beds in the Caradoc group of Shropshire and Eastern Wales.
The Garth grit of Portmadoc appears to have derived much of its quartz from a

like source as the Stiper Stones, but it also contains bits of a fine grained quartzose

Aschist and of older clastic rocks.  grit from the Borrowdale series of Chapel-le-

dale contains, in addition, bits of old andesite and probably diabase, with fragments of

a rather granitoid gneiss and quartzose schists. Fragments of crystalline rock, both

small and large, abound in the Upper Llandovery beds at Howler's Heath, at

Ankerdine HiU, in the Abberley district, on the west flank of the Malveras, and at

May Hill, thus indicating that early in Silurian times far greater outcrops of

crystalline rock existed than are now visible west of the Severn. Mr. W. Keeping ^

<jalls attention to the abundance of fragments of quartz, felspar, and mica in the

* greywackes ' of the Aberystwith district, which give the rock sometimes quite a

granitoid appearance, and adds that, in his opinion,^ 'the abundance of felspar

crystals, so general in the Silurian rocks (Upper Silurian of North Wales, South

Wales, and the Lake district), points to the neighbouring presence of a vast mass

of early, perhaps primeval, igneous rocks as the great source of sediment supply in

Silurian times.' What I have seen of the Denbigh grit of North Wales and of the

Coniston beds of the Lake district confirms this conclusion. It is true that some
of the material may have been supplied by Ordovician volcanic rocks, and that the

quartz grains in the specimens which I have examined are not large. But we must

remember that the latter can hardly have been furnished by the lavas of the Lake

district, and those of North Wales, though richer in silica, do not, so far as I know,

generally contain large quartzes. These, indeed, may have been derived from the

denudation of Cambrian rocks, but I should doubt the sufficiency of such an ex-

planation. In one specimen, a Denbigh grit from Pen-y-glog, near Corwen, there

occurs, besides one of smaller size, a fragment about -1" in diameter, exhibiting a

--608 REPORT 1886.

micrographic arrangement of quartz and felspar. In Cornwall, among beds which

are almost certainly Ordovician or Silurian, we find similar evidence of derivation

from much more ancient rocks. The conglomerates of the Meneage district con-

tain, in addition to quartzites, greywackes, and other old sedimentary beds, abundant

fragments of a moderately coarse-grained granitoid rock, and occasionally a horn-

Ablendic rock similar to the well-known Lizard schist.  series of specimens which

[ have examined microscopically shows, in addition to compact igneous rocks,

apparently volcanic, quartz grains probably derived from granitoid rock, various

fine-grained schists and schistose argillites or phyllites, quartzites, grits, and other

older clastic rocks. One fragment of schist contains little eyes of felspar, and in

general structure reminds me of some in the so-caUed * Upper Gneiss ' series of

N.W. Scotland. Another, a fine-grained mica-schist or a phyllite, exhibits a

cleavage transverse to the rumpled foliation.

A rich harvest probably awaits the explorer in the ' greywackea ' of the
Asouthern uplands of Scotland.
                                ' Lower Silurian ' conglomerate from Kingside,

Peeblesshire, contains numerous fragments of igneous rocks, probably of volcanic

origin, and bits of granitoid rock, with some which are either very old quartzites or

perhaps vein-quartz. These have been crushed and re-cemented before being

detached from the parent rock. The basement conglomerate of the Craig Head

limestone group (Llandeilo-Bala) is full of rounded fragments of volcanic rocks.

These, as in the last-named case, exhibit considerable variation ; the majority, how-

Aever, are probably andesites, and perhaps in one or two cases even basalts.

Middle Llandovery conglomerate from near Girvan is largely made up of frag-

ments which appear to have been derived from very ancient quartzose rocks. The

greywacke of rather later age from near Heriot, Edinburghshire, contains, with

numerous volcanic fragments, and a little argillite, a few bits of fine-grained quartz-

schist, together with grains of quartz and felspar, suggestive of derivation from a

--more coarsely crystalline rock.
     Old Red Sandstone and Devoyiian. It is, I believe, indisputable that when the

Old Red Sandstone of Scotland was formed a great period of mountain-making had

ended and one of mountain-sculpture was far advanced. The conglomerates are

often full of fragments of the crystalline rocks of the Highlands, and no doubt the

sandstones derived their quartz-grains from the same source. In the southern

half of the country, however, as is well known, volcanic materials, more or les»

contemporaneous, play an important part. I have not been able to examine closely

the Old Red Sandstones of England and Wales, but their frequent near resemblance

to the sandstones of Scotland suggests a similar derivation. True, the materials

may have been sifted from older clastic rocks, but there is nothing specially to

suggest this, and the abundant pebbles of vein-quartz, which I have seen in one or

two localities, seem rather more favourable to the other hypothesis. I have only

examined microscopically a very few specimens of Devonian grit, all from the

south side of the county. These certainly seem to have derived their materials, in

part at least, from  crystalline rocks, both granitoid and schists  of finer grain                                                     one

      Carboniferous. In Scotland some of the basement beds of this series so closely

resemble the Old Red Sandstone that no further description is needed, and the same

remark may be made of the very few overlying sandstones which I have carefully

examined. In the North of England the basement conglomerates, so far as I have

seen them, are made up of earlier Palaeozoic rocks, but for many of the great

masses of sandstone which occur in the series a source of supply is not so easily

found. Dr. Sorby, who has made a special study of the Millstone grit of South

Yorkshire, tells us that it is formed of grains of quartz and felspar, apparently

derived from a granite, and contains pebbles, sometimes an inch or so in diameter,

of vein-quartz, of hard grits, of an almost black quartz-rock or quartz-schist, and of

a non-micaceous granite. He also notes one fragment of a greenstone, and another

either of a fine-grained mica-schist or of a clay-slate. The granite, he states,
more resembled those of Scandinavia than any one now visible in Britain, and the

bedding indicated a supply of materials from the north-east. In the Millstone

grit near Sheffield he says that the grains appear to be but little worn, as if they
       TRANsiACTIONS OF SECTIOI^ C.         609

Ahad not been drifted from far.  few also appear to have heen derived from

schists. From what I have myself seen I anticipate that Dr. Sorby's conclusions

may be extended to most of the other coarser Carboniferous clastic beds of Northern

England, except that, perhaps, as was inferred by Professor Hull, another impor-

tant, if not the principal, source of supply must be sought on the north-west. The

materials of the basement conglomerates and grits in North Wales appear to be

either Paleozoic rock or vein-quartz and an impure jasper ; but a microscopic

study of carefully selected specimens, especially from Anglesey, might produce

interesting results. In Central England, as the Old Red Sandstone is commonly
absent, and, if present, must have been speedily buried, we should naturally look

farther afield for the materials of the Coal Measure sandstones and Millstone grit,

where it occurs. But probably we shall be right in including this, as indicated by
Professor Hull, with the nortbern district. He also points out that in the south-

western part of England and in South Wales there is good evidence that the materials

have been brought by currents from the west. I have only examined one specimen

from this region, but it has proved very interesting. It is from a Carboniferous grit

near Clevedon, in Somersetshire. About one-third of the rock consists of quartz

grains which I should suppose derived from schists or gneisses of moderate coarse-

ness quite another third of fragments of a very fine-grained micaceous schist,
                     ;

about -0.3" long. It is possible that these may be phyllites, but I think it far more

probable that they are true schists. They are very like some of the more minutely

crystalline schists of Anglesey, and it is evident in some cases that the rock had

been corrugated subsequent to foliation. This grit also contains a few bits of

felspar and flakes of mica. I must not forget to mention some curious boulders

which have been discovered occasionally in actual coal-seams. Through the kindness

of Mr. RadclifFe I have been able to examine some specimens found at Dukinfield

Colliery. They are hard quartzose grits and quartzites, bearing a general resem-

blance to sundry of the earlier Palaeozoic rocks. One of the latter is as compact

and clean-looking as the well-known quartzite of the north-western Highlands.

Besides quartz, and perhaps a little felspar, it contains a small quantity of iron-

oxide (?), two or three flakes of white mica, a grain or two of tourmaline, and of a
Amineral resembling an impure epidote.
                                        similar quartzite has been found by

Mr. W. S. Gresley in a coal-seam in Leicestershire, and I have described another

from the ' thirteenth coal ' at the Cannock Chase Colliery. In each of these

quartzites the two minerals last named may also be detected.

Before quitting the Carboniferous series I must call attention to some interest-

ing grits which during the last few years have been struck in deep borings. In

the London district a red sandstone, in some places conglomeratic, has been found

underlying sundry members of the Mesozoic series. Some have thought this of

Triassic age, but inasmuch as it is very doubtful, as we shall presently see, whether

the coarser beds of the Triassic formations extended so far to the east, and the dip

of the red beds in the well at Richmond agrees better with that of the Palaeozoic

rocks in other parts of the buried ridge, I think these sandstones more probably

older tban any part of the Mesozoic series, perhaps not very far away from the base

of the Carboniferous. In the boring at Gayton, in Northamptonshire, Lower Car-

boniferous rocks were succeeded by reddish grits and sandstones. The finer beds

much resembled the ordinary Old Red Sandstone, and, like it, suggested a deriva-

tion from fairly coarse-grained crystalline rocks. But of the origin of one rock, a

quartz-felspar grit, there can he little doubt. I may briefly describe it as very like

the Torridon sandstone of Scotland, except that the cement is calcareous. I do

not, indeed, claim for it a like antiquity, for I think it far more probably about the

age of the lowest part of the Carboniferous series ; but it, too, must have been

derived from granitoid rocks. "While some of the grains are fairly well rounded,

     Permian. The sandstones of the northern area belonging to this formation do

not, as far as I have been able to ascertain, afibrd us much information. Quartz

grains, of course, abound, but as they are rather small, it is not possible to be sure

whether they have been primarily derived fi'om a granitoid rock or a schist. The

former, however, appears to me the more prohable source. They also contain

fragments of felspar still recognisable, flakes of mica, and possibly a little schorl.

The frequent occurrence of crystalline quartz as a secondary formation in these

mysandstones is a point of much interest, but has no relation to  present inquiry.

The breccias near Appleby, Kirkby Stephen, &c., which I have not seen, indicate

that at this time, not distant, masses of Carboniferous limestone, and of earlier

Palaeozoic rocks, were undergoing denudation ; but it appears to me improbable

that the finer materials of the sandstones were furnished by any rocks in the

vicinity.

     The Permians of the central area offer a rich field for future work. For the

materials of the sandy beds I should conjecture a distant source, but for the pebbles

in the conglomerates, and the fragments in the breccias, we need not ti'avel very
far afield. The Lower Carboniferous Measures contributed limestone and chert,

the former being especially abundant in the conglomerates, but the ' vein-quartz,
jasper, slates, and hornstone,' mentioned by some observers, indicate that yet

earlier rocks furnished their contingent, while of the igneous materials I will

speak dh-ectly. I shall pass ver}' briefly over the breccias, so well displayed,

for instance, on the Clent and Lickey hills, at no great distance from this town,

because I trust we shall have presented to us, in the course of this meeting, a

sample of the rich harvest which is awaiting explorers. Earlier investigators

looked towards Wales for the origin of these fragments ; we shall, I believe, learn
that the majority are more probably derived from rocks which, though now
almost bid from view, exist at no great distance. Some of the more compact
traps may have come from the old rhyolites, which, by the labours of your
gbeologists, have been detected in situ beneath the Lickey quartzite, while we may

venture to refer the ' red syenite ' and ' red granite ' to outcrops of crystalline

rocks of Malvernian age. These breccias have been regarded as proving the exist-

ence of glaciers in the Lower Permian age. It is, of course, possible that floating
ice has been among the agents of transport, but after carefully examining the
specimens in the museum of the Geological Survey, on which glacial striae are

asserted to occur, I am of opinion that the marks are due to subsequent earth-
movements. On only one specimen did I recognise glacial striation, and this pebble

is so difl'erent from the rest that I think it must have come from drift, and not from

the Permian beds.

No less interesting are the Permian breccias of Leicestershire. These have

W.attracted the attention of an indefatigable local geologist, Mr.  S. Gresley, and

to his kindness I am indebted for the opportunity of examining both rock specimens

and slices. As might be expected, fragments, which I have no hesitation in

referring to the Chamwood series, are not wanting, though hitherto they have not

occurred in any abundance ; but perhaps the most interesting member is a tolerably

hard conglomerate, containing rather abundantly pebbles of a speckled grit and

of a compact 'trap.' Microscopic examination of this conglomerate, which varies
from a fairly coarse puddingstone to a grit, shows that the above-named speckled
grit is composed of small and rather angular fragments of quartz, associated with

grains of brownish and greenish material, which may be in some cases decomposed

bits of a rather basic lava, in others possibly a glaucoiiite of uncertain origin.

But the ' trap ' pebbles are yet more interesting. These are. the more numerous,
and are commonly well rolled. They probably belong, roughly speaking, to one
species, but exhibit many varieties. In a single slide I have seen at least six,
perfectly distinct. Some are indubitably scoriaceous, others full of microliths of a
plagioclastic felspar, others almost black with opacite, others mottled brown
devitri6ed glasses, more or less fluidal in structure. Probably they belong to the
andesite group, with a silica percentage not very far away from sixty. In none
have I observed any signs of crushing or cleavage, so that I cannot refer them to
the Charnwood series, but conjecture that they are relics of volcanoes later in age
than the great earth movements which affected that series, though I cannot connect
them with the more basic post-carboniferous outbreaks of which we have indica-
tions at Whitwick and elsewhere. Quartz grains also occur, and some of these
exhibit a rather peculiar ' network ' of cracks which is characteristic of this mineral
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                 611

in the rocks of Peldar Tor, Sharpley, Szc, and one such grain is attached to a

fragment of minutely devitrified rock. Hence, as shown by larger fragments, the

Charnwood series has contributed to the materials of this conglomerate, but the

more abundant appear to have been derived from volcanic vents, the locality of

which is at present undiscovered.^

   --Trias. The Bunter beds and the lower part of the Keuper consist of more or

Tess coarse materials, while in the remainder of the latter such deposits are rare and

local. Hence it is e-vident that after the deposition of the Keuper sandstones a

very different set of physical conditions prevailed. The lower series consists of

sandstones and conglomerates; these beds occur in considerable force on the

eastern side of the Pennine chain, have a great development in Lancashire and

Cheshire, and thin away towards the south-east, almost disappearing in eastern

Leicestershire and in Warwickshire. As the Trias is followed southwards, along the

valley of the Severn, the Bunter in like way dies out, while the Keuper marls may

be traced on into Somersetshire and Devon. In that region also there is a grand

development of the lower and coarser members. As might be expected, there are

considerable differences between the lower Triassic deposits of the northern and

southern areas, so that it will be convenient to speak of them separately. The

northern group, as is well known, is separable in the Midland and north-western

district into the Lower Bunter sandstone, the Pebble-beds, and the Upper Bunter

sandstone, over which come, more or less imconformably, the Keuper sandstones.

Pebbles are either absent from, or very rare in every part of the Bunter except the

pebble-bed, and are generally small and scarce in the Keuper sandstones, except

in the basement breccias. It will be convenient to make a few remarks on them

before dealing with the associated sands and sandstones. The pebbles in the

Bunter conglomerate are most abundant, and generally attain the largest size in the

Midland district. Towards the north-west, though the conglomerate attains a

thickness of more than 500 feet, pebbles are rarer and smaller, and this, I believe, is

also the case in Yorkshire, though the thickness of the deposit is not so great. I

· can, however, answer for the occurrence of pebbles of fair size and in considerable

abundance for some distance to the north of Retford. In the Midland district
they are very frequently from about 2" to 4" in diameter, though smaller are inter-

mingled and occasionally some of larger size ; these attain in certain localities to
a diameter of 6", or even more. The majority, so far as I know, are well

rounded. In this district many different kinds of rock are found in the con-

--glomerate; the most abundant are quartzose vein-quartz, quartzites and hard

grits or sandstones. Besides these we find chert and limestone from the Car-

boniferous series, various fossiliferous rocks of Silurian, Ordovician, and possibly

Cambrian age, with mudstones and argillites, more or less flinty, of uncertain

date. Felstones, using the term in a wide sense, are not rare, and granites or

granitoid rocks sometimes occur. These, however, together with the scarce frag-

Aments of gneiss and schist, are usually very decomposed.  hard quartz-felspar

grit, sometimes very like a binary granite, may be foimd, and I have noticed a

peculiar black quartzose rock of rather schistose structure. As the lithology of the

Bunter conglomerate has already attracted the notice of more than one author, I

shall restrict myself to a brief mention of its more salient features. The most

abundant rock is a quartzite, frequently so compact as to give a rather lustrous

sub-conchoidal fracture, in which the individual grains can be with difficulty

distinguished. In colour it varies mostly from white to some tint of grey, but is

occasionally 'liver-coloured.' Rather obscurely marked annelid-tubes are the

only organic indications which I have observed in these quartzites, and these are

very rare. Under the microscope the rock consists chiefly of quartz fragments,

of various forms in different specimens, with an occasional fragment of felspar

(sometimes, I think, silicified), a flake of white mica, a grain of tourmaline, and of

an impure epidote (?). As a rule it is easy to distinguish this quartzite from the

      ' I pass by tlie interesting pebbles of hematite, which have received special
-attention from Mr. Gresley.

                                                                                                           ss2

other indurated arenaceous rocks which occur in the conglomerate, especially from

those containing fossils.

     The above-descrihed quartzites differ in appearance hoth macroscopically and
microscopically from those of Plartshill, the Lickey, and the Wrekin district,
but they closely resemble the most compact variety, which I have already described
as occurring in boulders in coal. They have also an extraordinary likeness to
quartzite pebbles in Old Red Sandstone and Lower Carboniferous conglomerates of
Southern Scotland and to the quartzites of the northern and western Highlands,
already described, a liver-coloured variety of which, as I have been informed, occurs

in the island of Jura. These quartzite pebbles, to my knowledge, may be traced

into Lancashire on the one side of the Pennine chain and to beyond Retford on the
other. The quartz-felspar grit consists mainly of quartz and felspar, obviously the
debris of granitoid rock. I have found it at various localities on the northern
margin of Cannock Chase and have received specimens from the Bunter beds near
the Lickey and near Nottingham. The rock, macroscopically and microscopically,
presents an extraordinary resemblance to the Torridon sandstone of North-west
Scotland, and differs from every other rock which I have seen in situ in any
other part of Britain. The nearest approach to it is the quartz-felspar grit, already
mentioned as ha\ing been sti-uck in the Gayton boring, Northamptonshire, but this
has a calcareous cement. The felstones vary from micro-crystalline to glassy rocks

more or less devitrified, some being slightly scoriaceous. They may be classified

lithologically as quartz-felsites, rhyolites (more or less devitrified), quai-tz-porphy-

rites, porpbyrites, and old andesites. Some specimens contain a considerable
amount of tourmaline, and I have seen this mineral in the vein-quartz pebbles. It

also occurs rather abundantly in a very hard, black quartzose grit. I have received
varieties of felstone, which I have found on Cannock Chase, from the Bunter beds
of the Lickey and from Nottingham. In Staffordshire pebbles of granitoid rock,
gneiss, and schist are not only rare, but also generally too rotten to admit of ex-
amination ; but I found, a few months since, in the conglomerate at Style Cop, near

Rugeley, two pebbles of a whitish gneiss, which appeared to me to indicate a
secondary cleavage-foliation, such as may be observed in many parts of the

Scotch highlands. The black quartz-schist already mentioned exhibits a peculiar
' squeezed-out ' structure, which ordinarily indicates that the rock has undergone

great pressure.

     The sandy matrix and associated sandstones of the conglomerate beds, together
with those of the Upper and Lower Bunter, and of the Lower Keuper, consist
 mainly of quartz grains, most of which appear to have been derived originally from
 granitoid rocks. They are often more or less angular, but at certain horizons, as
 described by Dr. Sorby, Mr. Phillips, Mr. G. H. Morton,' and others, well-rounSed
grains are so abundant as to suggest an exposure to the action of the wind. They are
 often stained red with iron peroxide, and mixed with more or less earthy matter.
 In Cheshire and Ijancashire recognisable grains of felspar have been noticed by Mr.
 Morton and others, and probably this mineral is, in most cases, the source of the
 argillaceous constituents which are often intermingled with the quartz grains. Flakes
 also of white mica are sometimes rather common. So far as I have been able to
 judge, distinct grains of rolled felspar are commoner in the north-western district
 than in Staffordshire, where, however, mica-flakes are sometimes rather abundant.

      The Keuper sandstones seem to me to differ from the above only in the general

 absence of the red colour, and in a more even bedding, especially towards the
 upper part (the wat erst ones), where they are interbedded with the marls. The
 appearance of these last suggests that the currents were gradually losing strength,
 and only capable of transporting the finer felspathic detritus with occasional tiny

  plates of mica.

      The lithology of the lower part of the Trias in the southern area is as yet

 imperfectly worked out, and a rich harvest awaits the student. My own know-

 ledge of it is but superficial, so that I must pass it by with a brief notice. The

great beds of breccia, so finely exposed on the South Devon coast, are crowded
with fragments, sometimes of large size ; these have clearly been derived from the
older rocks which are stiU in part exposed to the west and south-west, and probably
had once a much greater extension in the latter direction. Fragments of Devonian
limestone, grits, and slate, together probably with other Palseozoic rocks, earlier
and later, are mingled with granites, resembling those of Cornwall and Devon,
and many varieties of more compact igneous rock. The fossiliferous quartzite
pebbles which occur mingled with others in the Trias at Budleigh Salterton, have

been discussed by the late Dr. Davidson in an exhaustive memoir.' He refers the

majority of the fossils obtained from them to the Lower Devonian age, but a few
are Caradoc, and four occiu* in France in beds which are either Llandeilo or
perhaps a little older. As the first two formations are represented, lithologically
and palfeontologically, on the opposite side of the Channel in France, and the
third is at present only known to occur in the Gres Armoricain of that country, he
thinks it probable that these pebbles have been derived from rocks which are now
concealed beneath the waters of the Channel. It may then, I think, be taken for
granted that laud to the west and south-west has supplied the materials of the
Lower Trias of the southern district of England, and I may add that there is every

reason to believe that outliers of the formation itself still exist beneath the sea.

     The so-called dolomitic conglomerates, which occur chiefly in Somersetshire, have
been so fully worked out by INIi". Etheridge and Mr. Ussher as to require but a passing

notice. It is evident that they differ somewhat in date, though probably all may

be referred to the age of the Keuper, and that they are local breccias or con-
glomerates formed around the margin of islands or on a continental coast-line during

a gradual subsidence and in comparatively quiet waters.

   --Jurassic. Coarse detrital material is not very common in the Jurassic series.

The limited Rhsetic beds indicate a transition from the peculiar physical conditions
of the Keuper to the marine conditions of the Lias, and the sediment in them was
probably derived from the same source as the Keuper marls. Great clay beds also
occur, as is well known, throughout the Jurassic series ; and the sandstones, so far
as I have been able to examine them, do not enable me to ofter any suggestions as
to their origin. Probably some of the grains were originally derived from
granitoid rocks, but they may have been directly obtained from other sandstones.

A grit, however, in the estuarine series of the lower oolites of Yorkshire (Mr.

PhUipps's collection) looks as if it might have been partly derived from a schist, but
as this is the only rock from the northern area which I have had the opportunity '
of minutely examining, it would be imprudent to speculate.

   --Neocomian- Cretaceous. I have examined very few specimens from the fresh-

water Neocomians of the South of England, but, so far as I have seen, I should

think it probable that the quartz had been derived from old crystalline rocks,
though perhaps not immediately. The same remark applies to the sands of the
upper and marine series, which, in one instance at least, exhibit exceptionally

rounded contours.'- Among these, however, conglomeratic beds occur which

have already attracted some attention. It is obvious that no small part of the

materials, as at Farringdon, Potton, and Upware, has been derived from fossiliferous

secondary rocks of earlier date. There are also pebbles of vein-quartz and quartzite

which, however, may have been obtained by the denudation of Triassic rocks. The

* Lydian stone,' which is abundant in angular or subangular fragments at Potton
and Upware, is for the most part chert from the Carboniferous Limestone, or in

some cases from Jurassic rocks, but a few specimens may be flinty argillites, and thus
of greater antiquity. One or two pebbles of older Palaeozoic rock have been found,
and a hard quartz grit has occiu-red, containing among its grains minute acicular
crystals, probably of tourmaline. Potton has furnished one or two pebbles which

appear to be a devitrified pitchstone, and a large pebble of porphyritic quartz-

felsite has been sent to me by Mr, Willet from Henfield (Sussex). These conglo-

though I am well aware that the subject is by no means exhausted.
     For a like reason I may pass briefly over the remarkable erratics found in the

Cambridge greensand.'- They occasionally slightly exceed a cubic foot in volume,

but are generally smaller. Among them are diverse sandstones and giits, probably

PalEeozoic, granite, gneiss, various schists, quartzites and slates, besides greenstone,,
a very coarse gabbro or hypersthenite, and a compact felstone. I think it highly

probable that many of these erratics came from the north, in some cases almost
certainlj^ from Scotland, and were transported by ice, though I am not satisfied
that any exhibit true glacial striae. In the South of England a boulder of old

quartzose rock, perhaps a piece of a coarse quartz-vein, crushed and recemented,

has been found by Mr. J. S. Gardner in the gault, and in the chalk we have the

well-known cases of the granitic rock and other boulders at Penley, near Croydon,
and of coal (Wealden or Jurassic) in Kent.' Mr. Godwin-Austen describes other
instances of pebbles in chalk, and I have received two or three small specimens-

from Mr. W. Hill, from about the horizon of the Melbourne rock, which, however,

--have not yet thrown any light on the subject.
      Eoceyie. Previous writers have called attention to the fact that the sand of the-
Thanet, Oldhaven, and Bagshot beds is mainly composed of quartz. This is

abimdantly confirmed by my own observations. So far as I have seen, in all these

the grains are not, as a rule, conspicuously rounded. It can hardly be doubted that
older sandstones or granitoid rocks Ijing to the west have furnished the materials
of the Bagshot series, which still has so wide an extension in that direction ; their
lithological similarity would lead us to look towards the same quarter for the
materials of the more limited Oldhaven and Thanet l)eds. The well-rolled fiint
pebbles in the Oldhaven series, and in occasional layers in the Bagshot, suggest the
proximity of a shore-line of Upper Cretaceous rocks.

     I have had no opportunity of adding to what has been written on the lithology
of the limited Pliocene deposits in England, and, as stated at the outset, have
excluded from the scope of this address all beds of later date, which have been so-
ably discussed by Mr. Mackintosh, Dr. Crosskey, and many other geologists.

                                              Principles of Interpi'etation.

     In attempting to interpret the facts which I have enumerated we must bear in-
mind the following principles :

      (1) Pebbles indicate the action either of waves of the sea,'' or of strong currents,
 marine or fiuviatUe.

      (2) The zone in the sea over which the manufacture of pebbles can be can-ied
on is generally a very narrow one. It extends from the high-tide line to the depth
usually of a few feet below low-water mark. It is estimated that, as a rule, there
is no disturbance of shingle at a greater depth than 20 feet below the latter. It is
therefore probable that a thick and very widely extended pebble bed is not the
result of wave action.

     (3) The movement of the deeper waters of the sea as a rule is so slight that

only the very finest sediment can be affected b)^ it. Now and then great currents
like the Gulf Stream, or more locally ' races,' may have sufficient power to transfer

pebbles and sand, but instances of this will be exceptional, and confined to rather

shallow water. The larger coast currents, however, may transport mud to con-

siderable distances, but in directions parallel with the main trend of the shores.
      (4) Except where verj- large rivers discharge their water into the ocean, or \n

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  615

some special case of (3), sediment is deposited comparatively near tlie shores of
continents. Even in the case of very large rivers only the finer sediment is carried
far from land. The Challenger soundings have shown that 150 miles is about the

maximum distance from land within which any important quantity of detrital
materials is deposited.^ As a rule (so far as I can ascertain), the coarser sediments

are generally deposited within a few miles of the coast. Hence this is fringed by a

zone of sediment, which, after passing a maximum thickness within a short distance

from the shore, gradually thins away. I doubt whether this detrital ft-inge is often
more than 70 or 80 miles wide : probably the coarser sands do not usually extend

for so much as a quarter of this distance. The inertia of the mass of the ocean

water quickly arrests the flow of even the mightiest river, or reduces it to a mere
superficial current. Hence the great ocean basins are regions where rock-building
is carried on slowly and chiefly by organic agency. Their borders bear the

burden, and the load taken off the continent is laid down on the bed of the

adjacent sea.

      (5) Thus rain and rivers are generally more important agents of denudation
and transportation than the sea, because unless the land be rising or sinking the
zone over which the latter can operate is limited both vertically and horizontally.

     (6) The coarser materials of rock are capable of being transported by streams to

considerable distances, without serious diminution of volume. Professor Daubr(5e has
proved experimentally that a stream flowing at the rate of about two miles per hour
would roll angular fragments of quartz or hard granite into perfectly smooth

pebbles after a transit of 25 kilometres (15f miles). During this process the frag-
ments lost about four-tenths of their weight. Further transport reduced the volume
of the pebbles very slowly. The loss afterwards varied from ~j^ to ----^ per kilo-

--metre. To reduce a pebble of 2 inches diameter to 1 inch diameter that is, to

--diminish its volume by seven-eighths would require a journey of from about 219 to

875 kilometres (approximately from 1-37 to 548 miles). This approximation, rough as
it is, becomes still less exact as the pebbles decrease in size ; the rate of diminution
in volume (cceteris j^nribus) bearing a relation to the area of the surface. Thus the

smaller the pebble, the further it will travel without material diminution of size.

iSand grains are even rounded with extreme slowness. According to the same

author a quartz grain inch in diameter requires to be transported by water action
some 3,000 miles before losing its angles. On this accoimt the presence in a sand-
stone of numerous well-rounded grains is taken to indicate the action of wind, for,
as is well known, blown sands are much more quickly rounded.^

      (7) Thus deposits of gravel and coarse sand, of considerable vertical thickness
and great extension, are more likely to indicate the immediate action of a river than

of a marine current. If limited in extent they may have been formed at the

embouchure of a river into a lake or sea. If, however, they can be traced for long
distances, they are more probably in the main sub-aerial deposits from rivers.

     The following examples may convey some idea of the kind of river which would

be required to transport the more important deposits of grits and stones mentioned

in the first section of this address :

      The old river gravels of the Sierra Nevada are ' in some places 300 or 400 feet
thick and almost homogeneous from top to bottom,' sometimes they even obtain a
thickness of 600 feet. Mr. Whitney is of opinion that the fall in these old river

channels was probably from 100 to 130 feet per mile. Apparently, however, we

need not invoke so large a fall as this. The total fall of the Danube is 3,600 feet,
and its length 1,750 miles. From Passau to Vienna the fall is 1 in 2,200, from
Vienna to Old Moldova 1 in 10,000. Yet the velocity of the current from Vienna
to Basias (15 miles above Old Moldova) is ' from 2 to 3 knots an hour,' depending
on the amount of water. This would suffice to transport pebbles of the average
size of the English Bunter. Below the Iron-gates the fall is still less rapid, but
sand is carried down for a very considerable distance. If then the rivers of the old

continental land resemUed the larger streams of Europe they would suffice for the

transport of the materials with which we have dealt, especially if aided hy coast

currents after the debris had reached the sea.

(8) If boulders occur in a matrix consisting^ of fine mud, or mainly of organic

material, they must (unless they are volcanic bombs) have floated thither either

attached to large seaweeds or entangled in the roots of trees, or supported by ice.

If they are rather numerous and a foot or more in diameter, in a marine deposit,

Athe last is the most probable mode of transport.        cubic yard of ice will more

than sufiice to float a cubic foot of average rock.

                                   Conclxision.

The facts already mentioned, regarded in the light of the above principles,

myjustify, in  opinion,  the  following  inferences  as  to the past physical geography

of our country. At the commencement of the Cambrian period great masses of

Archaean rock, granites, gneisses, aind schists must have existed, not only on the

western side of Britain, but also over a considerable tract of land now covered by

the sea. Detritus from this continent became an important constituent in the Cam-

brian rocks, and in many cases, as at St. David's, in Anglesey, Carnarvonshire,

&c., the .shore-line must have been very near at hand. "With the Cambrian period

commences a long-continued subsidence, so that its basement beds at different

places are very probably not all of quite the same age. The land surface was

from the first irregular, and it is very probable that waves of the sea were fretting

away some parts, while rain and river, heat and cold, were still sculpturing others.

But among the materials of the ancient land were not only granitoid rocks,

gneisses, and schists, but also newer strata more distinctly of clastic origin,
memorials of past denudation quartzites and grits, phyllites and slates, not to

-- --mention others and these, by their intimate structure, sometimes indicate that

gi'eat earth-movements must have already occurred.' In many localities, perhaps

--as a result of these disturbances, there occurred, towards the conclusion of the

Archaean period, great volcanic outbursts by which, no doubt, numerous cones
were built up, and many of the materials of the so-called Pebidian Group

were supplied. It is, I think, at present hardly safe to attempt to trace the

exact laud boundaries of the Cambrian ocean, but the enormous masses of

Archaean material which are entombed in the earlier Palaeozoic strata of Wales

and of North-west Scotland can, I think, only be explained by the proximity

--of a great continental land an extension of the present Scandinavian Peninsula
--which not improbably had a general slope towards the south-east, the main

watershed of which may have lain some distance to the west of the Outer

Hebrides.'^ But even over the more central parts of Britain there cannot have

Webeen deep or open ocean.         are constantly coming upon the traces of pre-

Cambrian and early Cambrian land some of our Mid-England Archtean masses,
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

like the Malverns, appear to have risen above the water, and to have undergone

denudation after the great earth-movements which ushered in the Silurian period.

Prior to this, after a time of repose in the Cambrian, at more than one epoch, and

in more than one place, there were great volcanic outbursts, which appear to have

studded the sea with volcanic islands, and to have added to the heterogeneous

materials from which the .sediments were now formed. It is evident that in

Silurian times the coast-line had extended southward and eastward. The coarse

deposits of this age, in Wales, the Lake district, and Southern Scotland, compared

with the finer mudstones and limestones of the Welsh border and of England, seem

fully to bear out this assumption, which is in accordance with a well-known law

of mountain-making. The Old Pied Sandstone of Scotland and of Wales indicates

' It is evident, for instance, that the north-west strike, and other effects of

folding, had been produced in the Hebridean series of N.W. Scotland before the

Torridon sandstone was deposited.                        ·

Aa yet further continental extension towards the south-east.   great epoch of

mountain-making in the Scotch Highlands, which had perhaps heen going on at
intervals from the beginning to the close of the Silurian period, had now come to

an end ; the southern uplands had risen up, like a Jura to the Alps. But probably

their elevation did not terminate the earth-movements, for the post-Silurian

cleavage of the Lake district, and the absence of Old lied Sandstone both here and in

Central England, indicate that the Palteozoic land mass continued to extend on

its south-eastern flank. The Devonian period introduces us in the greater part of

Great Britain to an epoch of limited and exceptional deposits, and of widely preva-

lent terrestrial conditions. It seems almost certain that the Old Red Sandstones

--of Scotland and Wales are of fresh-water origin the deltas of rivers, formed

either in lakes or possibly in part as sub-aerial deposits. Streams of considerable

volume and of some strength are indicated by the materials. In one case, the Old

Red Sandstone of North-east Scotland, we may perhaps discern in the Great Glen

some indication of the old river-course. It is easy to ascertain the source of the
materials of the Scottish Old Red Sandstones. They are as obviously the detritus

-- --of the Highland mountains then probably a far grander and loftier chain as

the nagelflue and the molasse of Switzerland are of the Alps.

At this time marine conditions prevailed in the south of England. The sea

appears to have deepened towards the south, but I suspect that a region of

crystalline rocks still existed at no great distance in that direction and in the west.

Probably the Brito-Scandinavian Peninsula curved round to the east so as to

include some part of Brittany.* Another great epoch of subsidence now com-

menced, commemorated by the formation of the Carboniferous limestone. At this

I need hardly glance, as it has been so fully discussed by Professor Hull and other

writers. The land sank both in the north and in the south of England. There was

deep sea over Derbyshire and Southern Wales, but the ground beneath our feet

probably remained above water, forming either a continental promontory or a

large island.

There were other well-known interruptions to the sea, which also overflowed a

considerable part of Ireland and districts far to the east of England. The Scotch

Highlands, however, probably remained above water, for, as is well known, the

Carboniferous limestone of Central Scotland overlies a fresh-water formation, and is

itself not wholly marine, since it contains coal, and like conditions prevailed in

Northumberland

      Gradually, however, the sea shallowed, and terrestrial conditions returned. In

the later part of the Carboniferous series we have clear indications of two, or

perhaps three, important currents, almost certainly those of rivers, bringing

materials, in the southern district from the west ; in the northern, from the north-

west and probably the north-east. These materials may have been in part derived

from older Palaeozoic rocks, but the facts when carefully considered seem to indicate

that there was also an extensive denudation of crystalline and not improbably
Archaean rocks, unless we suppose that great areas of eruptive Palaeozoic granite

have now disappeared beneath the waters. At any rate, we may perhaps regard

the open water between Ireland and Scotland on the one hand, and to the east

of the latter country on the other, as significant of a denudation earlier than that of

the sea which has in later times divided the British Isles. Another epoch of earth-

-- --movements closed as was to be expected the Carboniferous subsidence and
Wedeposition.
                   trace one line of flexures and of intense compression along a

broad zone, including the south of England, from Germany to Ireland ; another less

intense over the northern part of our country ; the axes of the former flexure

striking a little N. of W., of the latter about W.S.W. The one appears to me to

indicate a thrust from a great mass of hard, more or less crystalline rock in the S.,

which probably led to the formation of a mountain chain extending fi-om North-

central Europe over the Channel to the southern margin of England. The latter

may be explained by the presence of the above-named north-western continent.

618 KEPORT-- 1886.

In the Permian time terrestrial conditions probably prevailed over a large part

of Britain. It is extremel}- difficult to ascertain the exact circumstances under

which the Permian beds of Central England were deposited, but I should think thev

imply a return to physical conditions not unlike those of the Old Red Sandstone,

though perhaps the marine fossils which have been found in Warwickshire may

indicate that the water there had some imperfect connection with the sea. I

must not discuss the vexed question of the age of the Pennine chain, but must

content myself with expressing my opinion that, at most, it can only, as yet, have

very partially interrupted the continuity of the water in Northern England. The

beds there appear to indicate a supply of materials from the north and north-west,

as if the old rivers had not been wholly diverted by the great earth-movements

which closed the Carboniferous period. Sir A. Ramsay's view, that the water in

which the dolomitic limestone was deposited was more or less cut off from the

open sea, seems to me by no means improbable ; in any case, it is a rather excep-

tional formation, and over the greater part of Britain, probably, land sculpture

continued, and deposition was on the whole local.
    With the Trias a new era commences physical features had been now pro-

                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

duced, which, in all probability, endured through a considerable part of Mesozoic

times. The facts which I have laid before you, regarded in the light of the general

principles indicated above, compel us to look away from the immediate vicinity for

the bulk of the materials, coarse and fine, of which the northern Trias is com-

posed, though neighbouring hills may have furnished occasional contributions,

especially to the earlier deposits. Tlie analogy of the Old Red Sandstone, the

Calciferous Sandstone of Scotland, and the Nagelflue and Molasse of Switzerland,

together with other peculiarities too well known to need repetition, make it in the

highest degi-ee probable that the Bunter beds were not deposited in the ocean.*

Hence they must be either deltas formed in an inland sea or in a lake or true fluviatile

deposits. Neither lake nor inland sea appears likelj' to have been sufficiently large

to admit of waves or currents capable of either rounding the pebbles or trans-

Weporting the materials.  are therefore compelled to fall back upon the action ot

rivers. The sandy beds of the Bunter indicate a stream flowing i'rom one-third to

half a mile an hour, the pebbles one from two to three miles ; that is to say, the

Upper and Lower Bunter sandstones would require the former rate of movement,

the Pebble Beds the latter. Now, we must remember that, in the West Central

district, the Lower Trias consists of three wedge-like masses, about 100 miles in

length, of which the coarser is probably the more extensive. The comparative

uniformity of the deposits in each case indicates a uniformity of flow, and suggests

either a large and broad stream, not liable to much variation, or one which, when

flooded, quickly made a channel of its valley and deposited mainly at such season.

I have the gi-eatest difficulty in understanding how a current of the requisite

velocity could be maintained by the water of a river or rivers flowing into a lake

or an inland sea, or in explaining the tripartite arrangement of the beds on the

hypothesis that a basin was gradually filled up from the northward by a stream

which, like the Rhone at the upper end of the Lake of Geneva, gradually advanced

its delta by flowing over the materials which it had previously deposited in the-

basin. Hence I believe that we must regard the Bunter beds as sub-aerial

deltas, analogous to the conglomerates in the Siwalik deposits of India,^ and to the

sandstone and nagelflue on the outer zone of the Alps, deposits in all respects

Wevery similar to the English Bunter.  may suppose, then, that rivers emerging

on each side of the Pennine chain from a mountain land first formed the Lower Bunter

sandstones, then, owing to increasing upheaval in the mountain district, and corre-

sponding depression in the lowlands, flowed more swiftly so as to cover this deposit

with the Pebble Bed, and lastly, as its former conditions returned, laid upon.

were perfectly distinct formations, but it "would by no means follow that some
part of the finer beds to the south-east might not be contemporaneous with a
portion of the coarser beds to the north-west, as the velocity first increased, and then
diminished. As 1 have already said, the materials of the pebbles and of the sand

make it impossible to refer the main constituents to local sources. Many of the

rocks do not exist in the Midland ; there is no reason to suppose that at that time

there were in this region masses of laud of sufficient area and height to feed

important rivers.^ From currents of any other kind we are precluded, so that I
believe we may safely turn our eyes northward and look for the ultimate source
of the Triassic sandstones and conglomerates among the older rocks of the Scotch

Highlands, and their extension to east and to west, though very probably the

materials may have been more directly supplied from Old Red Sandstone and
early Carboniferous strata, in remnants of which identical fragments may still
be seen. In like way we may regard the Trias of the south of England as the
detritus of at least one great river, which flowed from the west or south-west. The

materials of the Keuper came from the same directions in each case, but here, I

think, we have indications of deposition in an inland sea.. Breccias formed on

its coasts, and sands were at first deposited in it ; but presently the area of water
iocreased, and the coarser materials must have been arrested in the uplands,

while the fine sediment which forms the marls may have been carried out into the
salt lake and slowly settled down in its calm waters.- Its shoies may have been

hardly more favourable to a vigorous development of life than were its salt-
saturated waters ; during this period and the preceding Bunter the lowland border

of the mountains, like some of the northern districts of India, may have been arid

and barren regions of shifting sands.
     The Trias of Northern Scotland very probably indicates a repetition on a more

restricted scale of the physical conditions of the Old Red Sandstone, but after this
we observe signs of an encroachment of the Atlantic on the above-named old area

of continental land.

     The Jurassic series is represented in Northern Scotland on both the western and

the eastern coasts by marine or estuarine beds. This probably indicates important

modifications in the river channels, subsidence on the west altering the slopes,

reducing the length, and cutting away some of the feeding ground. Traces may

still be discerned in England of the two northern rivers, but that which in Triassic
times was the larger contributor, appears in Jurassic to have been gradually enfeebled
the other one and the south-western stream seem to have still flowed with some
strength. Sands, however, now become comparatively local. Probably the coarser
materials, as a rule, did not reach the sea. This appears at all times to have

been comparatively shallow and enclosed by land on every side but the south-east.

    ' It may be iiseful to give a rough idea of the quantity of rock which must have

been denuded in order to obtain materials for the Bunter beds. Suppose, for
purposes of calculation, we consider the Bunter beds, which cover the district from
the Chesliire coast to the Midland counties, as forming the section of a cone con-
tained by two planes drawn througli the axis so as to include an angle of 30
degrees. If h be the height of this axis, and r the radius of the base, the volume of

mound, in section an isosceles triangle 1 mile high, with a base of 4 miles. The
length would be over 65 miles. Thus the materials buried in the Bunter beds of the
above-named district represent a chain of hills unfurrowed by valleys 5,000 feet
high, 4 miles wide, and 65 miles long. Suppose the Pebble Bed, a like slice of a
cone, axis one-tenth of a mile, base 70 miles ; the volume is more than 40 cubic miles.
Suppose the quartz and quartzite pebbles one-tenth of its volume ; tliese represent
a mass of four cubic miles, or a line of hills like the above 1,000 feet high, 2 miles
wide, and 20 long.

suggests that a narrow strait running in a northerly direction may have insulated

the Palaeozoic rocks beneath the Loudon district. The clays of the Lias, Oxfordian,

and Kimmeridgian probably indicate a direct discharge of sediment into the sea/ the

limestones, depression sufficing to convert valleys into fjords, in the upper parts of

vrhich sediment was deposited so that the waters of the sea were clear. The

deposits of the Purbeck and Weald indicate that the western river stiU drained an

extensive area, and a gradual rise of land in later Jurassic times, especiaUj' towards

the south, appears to have advanced the river delta eastwards, and to have limited

the area of the Jurassic sea on the north.

Towards the end of the Xeocomian, owing to a widespread subsidence, the sea

once more returned to South-eastern England, and a communication appears to have

been opened between it and the Speeton basin. This comparatively narrow strait

was a region of considerable denudation and of strong and shifting coast currents.-

The Cretaceous subsidence at first brought back physical conditions not very different

from those prevalent in Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian times, but later on a very

considerable depression must have so far submerged the northern continental land

as either to break up the parts adjacent to Britain into groups of islands, or at

least to flood the valleys so completely as to prevent any discharge of sediment into

the sea. The erratics of the Cambridge Greensand suggest that a free communica-

tion into the northern ocean was establi.shed, anterior to the formation of the Chalk

marl, through some part of the present interval between Scotland and Scandinavia,

so as to set up a coast current with a southerly drift of shore ice near the eastern

part of England: to this also may be due the erosion of the Cambridgeshire

Gault.

The larger part of Britain was dry land during the Eocene, though the sea after

retreating appears to have again encroached over the southern and eastern districts

of England. The sands may indicate that the western river again resumed its

course ^                                the extension of the London Clay up our eastern  coast suggests  that  the
                                     ;

nurthern river still flowed. But with the important disturbances which closed the

--Eocene and ushered in the continental conditions of the Miocene new flexures

--along the old east and west lines the earlier physical features appear to have been

finally obliterated, and the sculpture of the English lowlands began. The tale of

the volcanic outbursts of Western Scotland has been so well told by my friend and

predecessor Professor Judd that I need do no more than recall it to your minds.

The Pliocene deposits of Eastern England indicate a new encroachment of the

Eranco-Belgian Tertiary sea.

  --Thus ends my sketch too lengthy, I fear, for your patience, yet too brief to

allow of a complete treatment of the subject. It may, however, suffice to indicate

that in geology the ' task of the least ' is by no means despicable, and that great

results may be hoped from apparently small means; that in this search for

' Atlantis through the microscope ' we may find it very near at hand, and may

discover analogies, as has been indicated in our President's address, between the

two borders of the ocean which severs Europe from America. An enlarged study

of the materials of our Palfeozoic and later detrital rocks may indicate tbat from

very early times there has been a reciu-rence of similar physical conditions, and that

     ' The considerable distance to which the clays extend in a southerly direction

may possibly indicate that, to the east of Scotland, a communication had now been

opened with the northern ocean, which had set up a current along the coast east of
the Pennine chain.

     ^ As the Speeton beds continue to be clays one would infer a drift from the
south, but a current to the opposite direction would be more probable, and it is the
opinion of Dr. Sorby that this was the case. His papers ' On the Direction of the
Currents indicated by the Coarse Sediments in our British Rocks ' are most valuable

( Yorks. Geol. Pol. Soc. v. 220, kc.) A pebble bed sometimes occurs at the base of

the Portland series, apparently resembling, though on a very small scale, those in the
Neocomian.

     ^ The occasional beds of flint pebbles indicate a neighbouring shore line of Cre-
taceous rocks rather than the denudation of beds of Cretaceous age, which had been
deposited on parts of the western land during the period of depression.

in geology also a recurrence of effects indicates a recurrence of the same causes.

The facts which I have brought before you have justified, I trust, my opening

remarks as to the rich harvest which yet awaits investigations into the structure

of the fragmental rocks. To resume the simile then used, I see the land of

mypromise, stretching far away from beneath                                                                                                          feet, till it seems to melt into the

dim and as yet unknown distance. Not speedily will its riches be exhausted. Our

hands will long have vanished, our voices will long have been still, before the

work of discovery is ended and men have reached the shore of that circumfluent

ocean which, at least in this life, limits their finite powers.

                                                             By Professor C. Lapwokth, LL.D., F.G.8.

The town of Birmingham lies exactly in the geographical centre of England,,

midway between sea and sea. This, too, is its geological position, for it is built

upon and surrounded on all sides by strata belonging to the New Red Sandstone,,

the place of which is exactly in the middle of the accepted series of geological

formations. To the east of the town lie the gently incline! Neozoic strata of the

Jurassic and Cretaceous, &c., dipping in regular order, sheet below sheet, till they

become wholly horizontal in the neighbourhood of London. To the west of the

town lie the bent, broken, and more or less altered Palaeozoic foi-mations, stretching

onwards through Shropshire and North Wales, until they attain their greatest amount

of wiinkling and metamorphism in the slaty districts of Snowdon and Anglesea.

AVithin the limits of the Birmingham district itself we find almost every stage of

transition between these extreme geological types. In some localities, as in the mid-

Warwickshire plain, we find the strata as fiat and almost as unaltered as in the day

in which they were originally laid down. In others, as at the Lickey, they are

folded into steep arches, shattered and faulted ; and iu others, as in Charnwood

Forest, they are crushed into slates. "Within a radius of thirty miles of Birming-

ham we find representatives of all the geological formations, from the so-called

Laurentian and Cambrian up to the base of the Cretaceous. The Carboniferous

rocks of the Birmingham district have long formed the accepted model of those

British rock formations which are remarkable fi-om the economic point of view. Its-

' Black Country ' is Dickens' classical type of a land given over body and soul to

mining and manufacture. The local Triassic formation is the British agricultural

system ])a}- excellence, and the Midland plain of Warwick, Stratford, and Worcester

is the heart of sylvan England-- the Arden of Shakespeare, and the Loamshire

immortalised in the works of George Eliot.

Among those who studied the geology offlie Birmingham district before the

days of the Geological Survey, we find the names of many of those most famous in
the annals of British geology :--Professor Playfair, William Smith, Dean Buckland,

AVilliam Yates, and Sir Roderick Murchison. To Murchison, indeed, the neigh-
bourhood was always a favourite one. Its strata afforded him some of the most

striking types of the formations and fossils illustrated in his gi-eat work, the

' Silurian System.' The district was mapped about thirty years ago by the officers
of the Geological Survey--by Professor J. B. Jukes (a native of Birmingham),

Professor Hull (Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland), and Mr. Howell

(Director of the Scottish Survey). Jukes's ' South Staffordshire Coalfield ' is one

has been a great revival of interest. Mr. Samuel Allporfs investigation of the

microscopical characters of the Midland volcanic rocks inaugurated the recent

revival and brilliant advancement of petrography in Britain. Dr. HoU worked

geologists themselves have quite recently made several startling discoveries of large
areas of Cambrian rocks in much closer proximity to the town ; and the interest

thus aroused in local geology seems likely to continue.

     The most interesting geological strata in the Birmingham district are the sup-
posed Archaean rocks of the Malverns, Charnwood, and the Wrekin, the Cambrian
strata of Nuneaton and the Lickey, the highly fossiliferous Silurian of Dudley, the
rich coal- and iron-bearing rocks of the South Staffordshire coalfield, the enigma-
tical Permian breccias of the Clent Hills, and the remarkable 'Pebble Beds' of the
local Trias. To the north-west of Birmingham the area around Wolverhampton is
crowded with innumerable boulders brought down from the Lake District and the
south of Scotland. To the south-west of the town, erratics equally abundant are
met with, which have travelled from the high ground of the Arenig in North.
Wales ; while relics of the mammoth and other prehistoric animals have been ob-
tained from the area east of the town in the excavations of Shustoke.

2. On the Discovery of Bochs of Cambrian Age at Dostliill in Warwichsliire}
                          By "W. Jerome Harkisox, F.G.S.

Tlie little eminence of Dosthill forms part of the western boundary of the

Warwickshire Coalfield. It lies close to the Midland Railway (Birmingham and

Burton branch), between the stations of Kingsbury and  VVilnecote                                                  it is two miles
                                                                                                                ;

south of Tamworth, and twelve miles north-east of Birmingham. On the Geological

Survey Map Dosthill is coloured as a mass of greenstone intrusive in the Coal-

measures, and bounded on its western side only by a line of fault.

    On May 29, 1882, the author visited the district for the first time. He found

the fault on the west side of the hill very sharply defined, the Keuper Red Marls

forming a level plain through which the Tame meanders, and from which the camel-

backed ridge of Dosthill rises precipitously. The lowest rock seen near this west

fault is a hard grit. Above this we find Cambrian grey shales traversed by innu-

merable worm-borings and invaded by igneous rocks. The latter are of two kinds

a tough dioritic rock, and narrow dykes of a grey, much decomposed rock. One

section at the south end of the ridge shows a dyke rising through grey Cambrian

shales and spreading out above them. The eastern boundary of Dosthill is also a

line of fault by which the Coal-measures have been thrown on end and shattered

But there is no evidence that the coal-seams have been ' burnt,' as alleged in the

Survey Memoir (' Geol. Warwickshire Coalfield,' p. 49). The whole succession of

the strata is very similar to that at Nuneaton and Hartshill, on the eastern side of

the coalfield, eight miles to the south-east.

                     By Professor C. Lapworth, LL.D., F.G.S.

  --Upper Cambrian rocks occur in several localities within the limits of the

Birmingham district at the Malverns, the Lower Lickey Hills, Nmieaton, the
neighbourhood of the Wrekin and Shineton, at Caer Caradoc, and Cardington.
The core of the Lickey HiUs, near Birmingham, is formed of quartzite, formerly
believed to be of Llandovery age. This has been shown by the author and Mr.
F. Houghton to be actually of pre-Silurian age, rising unconformably from below
the basement beds of the local Silurian, and apparently underlain by volcanic
rocks of vmknown geological age. The supposed Lower Carboniferous rocks of
Nuneaton and Atherston have also been demonstrated by the author and Mr.
Harrison to be of Upper Cambrian age, containing the characteristic Agnostidae
and Olenidse. Detailed descriptions, illustrated by maps, and sections and cha-
racteristic fossils, were given of the Cambrian areas of the Lickey and Nuneaton,
together with a detailed account of their underlying and intrusive volcanic

Tocks. The recognisable sequence of the component strata in the several higher
Cambrian areas was shown, their physical relations to the underlying and overlying
formations pointed out, and evidences adduced in proof of the conclusion that
these rocks are fragments of what was originally a single continuous Upper
Cambrian formation, composed of corresponding members, admitting of fairly
satisfactory correlation with the Upper Cambrian rocks of other districts, and
everywhere reposing upon a great volcanic formation, of much earlier date.

     The coarse ashes of the more northern exposures near Hartshill are made up

primarily of broken up quartz felsite, the minerals and fragments being cemented

in many places by thin fihns of a green, apparently serpentinous, mineral.
     The finer-bedded ashes by the 'Tunnel' near Caldecote contain broken felspar

crystals, in some cases plagioclase, in others orthoclase ; but here the dust seems
to have been very fine, especially at times, as some beds appear almost perfectly

compact.

   A little further south still, in a disused quarry, a rock exactly similar in external

appearance, and differing microscopically mainly in the appearing of irregular angular
flakes of a green serpentinous mineral, is seen in intimate admixture with a rock

having much of the appearance of a quartz felsite.

      This latter rock, however, has quite abnormal characters except in very few
places. Elsewhere the crystals are broken and angular in the majority of cases,

and are packed together with a very dirty-looking groundmass among them.
The quartz grains are in many cases crowded with very minute fluid cavities, and
are indented with the usual bays into which the groundmass runs, in many cases

connecting with almost isolated masses within the crystal.

     The felspar is to a large extent plagioclase, but is much clouded with decom-
position products. Some of the greenish flakes have the appearance of decomposed
mica. The groundmass where well developed shows good flow structure.

      Careful examination, both in the field and microscopically, suggests that the
andesitic rock mentioned in the next paragraph has flowed oper a broken and

partly disintegrated surface of quartz felsite.

     With these rocks is associated a dark rock, which on examination proves to

be composed of plagioclase felspar, and the decomposition products of apparently

augite, since a few grains of the latter still remain unchanged. Some of these
latter show the twinning that is usual, and also the cleavage parallel to the basal
pinacoid which has been described by Mr. Teall in the augite of the Whin SUl close

to the junction with the quartz felsite ; the rock is distinctly porphyritic, the
larger crystals of felspar being set in a mass of very minute felspar crystals, which
frequently exhibit the flow of rock in a very marked manner. The porphyritic

felspars give extinctions corresponding to Labradorite, or even incline to Anorthite,

and have many inclusions which frequently are arranged in lines parallel to the

length of the crystal, and are elongated in the same direction.

    At the base of the quartzite occur beds of conglomerate containing inasses

of ashes somewhat coarser in texture than those from the ' Tunnel ' above men-
tioned, and of the quartz felsite. Passing upwards, the felspathic constituent
gradually disappears except in one or two bands, and in the typical quartzite but
few grains are visible except of quartz. These show by the similarity of the
strings of cavities, and, in the lower beds, by the fact that the rounding to which
they have been subjected has not been sufficient to entirely smooth away the
finger-like indentations of outline, that they were derived from a quartz felsite very
similar to, if not actually a part of, the same mass as that previously described.

     The diorites which are associated with the quartzites are much decomposed,
with the development locally of a good deal of calcite.

5. Gil the Bochs surrounding the Wanvickshire Coalfield, and on the Base

    of the Goal-measures} By Aubrbt Strahan, M.A., F.G.S. With an

     Afpendix on the Igneous Rocks of the Neighbourhood, by P. Rutley,

      F.G.S.

          (By permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.)

The discovery by Professor Lapworth of fossils of Lower Silurian age (Cambrian,

Sedg.) in some shales underlying the productive coal-measures of Warwickshire has

proved that the determination by the Survey of these shales and of some underlying

quartzite as Lower Coal-measures and Millstone Grit respectively was erroneous. The

beds had been (previous to the Survey) described by the Rev. J. Yates (' Trans. Geol.

Soc' Ser. 2, vol. ii. p. 237) as Silurian, but in consequence of their apparent con-

formity to the productive measures, and in the absence of fossil evidence, were

subsequently identified as above, in spite of a correct view as to their age being

Aheld by Professor Jukes.            re-examination of the district has proved that (1) the

conformability of the Coal-measures with the underlying shales is apparent only,

and not real (2) the Coal-measures are based by an impersisteut sandstone con-
                                                                     ;

taining pebbles, and resting on the denuded surface of the Lower Silurian rocks

(3) the intrusion of certain igneous rocks (diorites, &c.) in the older series was

entirely pre-Carboniferous.

The oldest rocks seen are the Caldecote Igneous Series, which rise from beneath

the quartzite between Nuneaton and Hartshill. This series consists of a finely

laminated rock, probably a tuff", with intrusions of diabase and quartz-porphyry.

Upon this series rests the Hartshill quartzite, with a well-bedded conglomerate

at its base, containing fragments of the Caldecote Series. Upwards this quartzite

passes conformably into a thick mass of shales, red in the lower, and grey or black

in the upper part. In these shales (the Stockingford Shales of Professor Lapworth)

have been found fossils, proving them to be of Lingula Flag, and perhaps in part

of Tremadoc age. The shales and quartzite are traversed by sheets of diorite, &c.,

which generally follow the bedding very closely, but are known to be intrusive by

the alteration they have eflPected upon the shales above, as well as below them, and

by their occasionally breaking across the beds.

The base of the Coal-measures has been proved in a colliery at Hawkesbury,

and is seen in the railway-cutting at Chih-ers Cotou, where a fire-clay, based by a

few inches of sandstone, is seen resting on the Stockingford Shales. Further north

the workable seams rest almost directly on these shales, but near Oldbury a thick

pebbly sandstone, resting with a marked unconformity on shales and diorites,

forms the base of the Coal-measures. Fm-ther on this sandstone thins out again,

Abut reappears with its former character north of Merevale.     similar relation is

found at Dosthill, where, however, the want of parallelism between the Carboni-

ferous and Silurian strata is very conspicuous. The impersistent sandstone, forming

the base of the Coal-measures here, is coarsely conglomeratic. The descriptions of

the base of the Coal-measures of South Staifordshire (Jukes, ' Geol. Survey Memoir')

is applicable almost word for word to the Warwickshire localities.

    Towards the east the Lower Silurian rocks are overlain by the New Red Marl

and Waterstones, the actual boundary being formed for a large part of the distance

by a fault, which has been proved in coal-workings at Polesworth, and is seen in

Merevale Park. This has been wrongly described (' Coal Commission Report,' 1879,

vol. ii.  p. 494)  as ' one  of the  grandest  lines  of fault  that can be seen anywhere
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 '

it is, on the contrary, a fault of very small importance, especially towards the

south. Tlie Trias is seen in four instances to rest naturally on the old rocks, while

the same relation has been proved in several borings made in the plain of New Red

Marl of West Leicestershire. The result of these observations is to show that it

would be useless to search for Coal-measures beneath the Trias over the part of this

plain lying south of Market Bosworth, the Carboniferous rocks having either never

containing Augite), and Basalts (or Diorites containing Olivine), these three

occurring as intrusions in the Lower Silurian rocks, and appearing to graduate

into one another. The Croft series includes quartz-syenite and a rock intermediate

between quartz-syenite and quartz-diorite. The Caldecote Series includes (1) a

finely laminated greenish-brown rock, resembling a sandy mudstone, probably

an altered andesitic tuff; (2) a rock composed of rounded or corroded crystals of

triclinic felspar and quartz-grains in a dark felsitic matrix, and appearing to be a

purplish-grey rock (the diabase previously referred to), consisting of crystals of

triclinic felspar and magnetite in a felsitic ground-mass, which contains minute

crystals, believed to be hornblende, in which case the rock would probably be a

hornblendic andesite.

The rocks intrusive in the Lower Silurian Shales consist of diorite at Marston

Jabet, Griff Farm, Chilvers Coton, Stockingford Cutting, Oldbury, and Dosthill.

Others, as at Nuneaton Midland Station and in the Stockingford Cutting, are akin

to basalt in their composition.

The breccia at the base of the Hartshill Quartzite is composed of fragments of

eruptive rocks and of slate in a purplish matrix. Quartz-grains constitute a large

proportion of the rock. The Hartshill Quartzite consists of irregular crystalline

grains of quartz with numerous fluid lacunae, with a few grains of felspar. Rarely

microcrystalline siliceous matter occupies small spaces between the quartz-grains.

aggregate, compose the thick coal show in that district a marked tendency to
separate as they extend southwards, and at the same time to become thinner and
to deteriorate in quality ; that the Coal-measures rest immediately on the Ludlow
Passage beds at Halesowen ]\Ianor and AVassell and on the Cambrian quartzite at
the Lower Lickey. The paper concluded by a reference to the bearing of these
facts on the geological history of the district.

7. Notes on the Mocks hetween the Thich Coal and the Trias North of Bir-

     mingham and the Old South Staffordshire Coalfield. By Fredeeick G.

     Meacham, M.E., and H. Inslet.

     The most complete sections of these rocks can be seen only in deep sinkings for

coal. All other sections in the district expose but little of the rocks overlying the
Thick Coal Seams.

   --Taking the rocks in order, we find the following : Lying upon the Thick Coal

is a set of black, greasy unfossiliferous shales, to 11 inches, followed first by
grey shales with ironstone nodules and then by alternations of shales and thin flags
coated with carbonaceous hlms and containing a few fossils of the usual Coal
Measure types. These are succeeded by some thin seams of fireclay, and then by
the Brooch Coal, which is in turn covered by grey earthy shales with * Unios,' and
this, again, by the well-known Stigmaria beds. Grey and blue shales variegated
with irregular brown bands overlie the last, and are succeeded by an earthy con-
glomerate locally known as the Espley rock. At Hamstead a few seams of fireclay
are followed by a representative of the Foot Seam, there only 4k inches thick.
This is succeeded by nine feet of black earthy shale, very fissile, and containing a
Lingvla in abundance, as well as what we take to be casts of Orthoceras, E^wm-
phalus, Productus, and Spirifer. Casts of Productus occur also in the associated
Ironstone. Fireclays and black bituminous shales succeed, followed by purple and

red sandstones. This is at 72 yards above the Thick Coal. Two feet of blue-

grey shale containing Calamites, Lejiidodendron, and impressions of sedge-like vege-
tation succeed, and are followed by six feet of fireclay. Seven hundred and thirty-
two feet of unfossiliferous, variegated marls, with occasional bands of conglomerate,
succeed, and are followed by 9 feet of fireclay containing Asterophyllites, Calamites,
 Cyclopteris, and Keuropteris in abundance. About four hundred feet of variegated
marls succeed, and are generally followed by a thin band of limestone containing
Spirorbis. More marls, interstratified with hard calcareous bands, rain-pitted and
ripple-marked, succeed. These yield Asterophyllites, Lepidodendron, Siyillaria,
Neuropteris, Pecopteris, &c., and various sedge-like impressions.

     At 380 yards above the Thick Coal is a bed of red and brown marl, about a
hundred feet thick, exhibing circular markings, which are nearly white on the outer

part and dark towards the centre. This zone forms an excellent and constant land-
mark in searching for coal here, as it has been met with in the same relative posi-

tion in the Sandwell, Hamstead, and Perry trial sinkings. From their horizon to

 the surface the rocks consist of marls and sandstones of various colours, with
 occasional conglomerates of well-rounded pebbles.

      Disturbances, periodical and varying in force, are evidenced in the marls and

Werock-bands dipping to the east at angles from 5i to 20 and even to 30 degrees.

 have met with no fossils nearer the surface than 209 yards, then a Cyclopteris-Hke
 leaf, and impressions of reeds occur sparingly.

      The question has often arisen in our minds regarding the red rocks of the

 district we are reviewing. They are set down as Permian by the last Survey,

 whilst the finding of the fossils enumerated above indicates that they are Upper
 Coal Measures. If not, then the Coal Measures pass imperceptibly into the over-
 lying Permian, for the lower marls containing Coal Measure fossils differ in no
respect from the beds which come to the surface and which are classed as Permian
by the Survey.

     At Wednesfield some years ago a trial sinking was made on the ground marked
Permian. The measures passed through were principally red and yellow marls,

and at 100 yards coal, broken, was found, but dipping headlong to the west, in a
similar manner to the sinking at Wigmore. The place was abandoned, and some
more trials have been made, but not successfully ; but still we are of Opinion that
the coal will be found under Upper and Lower Penn, Tettenhall, Codsall, Hilton,
and at depths varying to 800 yards, running away to join the Cannock Chase and
Hednesford Coalfields in the same manner that the coal wiU probably be found to
run from SandweU and Hamstead right away under Birmingham, &c., and join-

ing the Warwickshire Coalfield, where the Thick Coal, as in the Cannock district,

is divided into many seams.
    Practical geology has akeady achieved many triumphs, and we venture to

think the finding of the Thick Coal at SandweU and Hamstead is not among the
least of them, so far as the Midlands are concerned, and we may look upon the
future of this district in the mining world as assured, and especially when coal is

found, as above mentioned, on the west side of the old coalfield.

                             FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 3.

     The following Report and Papers were read :

                                   Ireland. See Reports, p. 223.

               2. On the Glacial Phenomena of the Midland District.
            By Dr. H. W. Ceossket, F.G.S.--See Reports, p. 224.

        3. On the Glacial Erratics of Leicestershire and Warwickshire.
                              By the Rev. W. Tuckwell.

  --As evidence of a south-western dispersion from Charnwood ; in Stockton, a

village midway between Leamington and Rugby, a mass of boulder clay containing
abundance of Mount Sorrel granite, of so-called gneiss from Charnwood Forest,

large decomposed ' pockets ' of red sandstone, blocks of grey sandstone highly
glaciated, Bunter pebbles, flints, carboniferous limestone, lias rock of a difierent
texture from that native to the district ; also lying loose in the village street, re-
cently enclosed and inscribed, a fine boulder from Mount Sorrel, glaciated, of nearly
two tons weight were referred to.

     Mount Sorrel and the unmistakable character of its hornblendic granite were

described.

     The author noted extraordinary profusion of Mount Sorrel erratics as far as

Leicester ; at Rothley, Thurcaston, Anstey. ' Stone ' or ' Ston ' is a suffix of
nearly all the villages along the line.

   A notice was given of a special stone, the largest found in Leicestershire, near

Humberston, estimated at twenty tons, partly embedded in boulder clay which is
filled with Bunter pebbles and rolled slate from Charnwood. Its enclosure and
preservation were suggested.

     Attention was called to the reappearance of Charnwood stones from Leicester
to Coventry, from Coventry to Stockton, completing the evidence of a south-west
stream from the Charnwood elevation throughout the two counties.

with fragments of silurian limestone, carboniferous chert, carboniferous sandstone,
and Llandovery flags ; also a few fragments of flint, granite, basalt, quartz, con-

glomerate, and a smaller quantity of intensely hard pieces of black siliceous rock.
All the ahove-mentioned fragments are few in number compared with the quartzite
pebbles. The pebbles vary in size from half an inch to over a foot in diameter.

The fossils contained in the drift-pebbles are exceedingly rare, especially perfect
specimens ; about one fossiliferous pebble occurs in two or three thousand stones,
and this perhaps contains fragments only.

     Perfect fossils are seldom met with ; when a complete specimen is found it is
generally in a good state of preservation. The pebbles contain brachiopods,
lamellibranchs, cephalopods, gasteropods, annelids, plants, crinoidal stems, and

fragments of trilobites of different species.

                   By Professor W. E. Benton, Assoc. B.8.M.

     The author showed that a large amount of coal is annually sacrificed in British
coal-mining for the lateral support of neighbouring and disinterested surface pro-
prietaries : and pointed out the results of this sacrifice, together with the considera-
tions which should govern the extent of this support.

7. Notes on the Discovery of a large Fossil Tree in the Lower Coal-measures

            at Clayton, near Bradford. By S. A. Adamson, F.G.S.

     The author described the discovery of a huge Sigillarian stump, with eight
forked Stigmarian roots attached, at Murgatroyd's Fall Top Quarry, Clayton, near

Bradford. It was discovered about 12 feet below the surface in the measures
between the Better Bed Coal and the Elland Flagstone. The stump of the tree
was embedded in soft sandy shale, locally termed ' yellow loam,' the roots resting
on a bed of soft blue shale, which some of them penetrate. The following

dimensions of the fossil were given :--

          Height of stump . . · . . . .                     . 3 ft. 9 in.
          Diameter of stump (longest axis)                    4 ft. 6 in.

     This neighbourhood appears to he prolific in grand examples of the Carboniferous
flora, for another fine specimen of Stigmaria is to be observed in the same quarry,

and in the railway cutting close by a good but much smaller specimen of
SigiUaria with roots attached was obtained.'

8. On the Discovery of Fossil Fish in the New Bed Sandstone (Tipper
    Keuper) in Warwickshire. By the Rev. P. B. Beodie, M.A., F.G.8.

    The author observed that, considering the thickness and extent of the New Red

Sandstone in Great Britain, the paucity and rarity of fossils were remarkable,

especially when compared with the abundant fauna and flora of the Trias in

Europe. In a field so comparatively barren any addition, therefore, to either is
interesting to the palaeontologist. JNlauy years ago the author discovered a ganoid

-- --fis]i thelast apparently of the genus Palceoniscus superstes figured and described by

the late Sir Philip Egerton (' Journ. Geol. Soc' xiv. p. 164) in the Upper Keuper at
Rowington (six miles north-west of Warwick) ; and he now records another discovery
of several small fish near there, shortly to be figured and described by Mr. E. T.
Newton, and named by him Semionotus Brodiei, which is the iirst time this genus
has been recorded from the British Trias. The remains of small Cestracionts are

not unfrequent in one particular band of sandstone in AVarwicksbire and Wor-

cestershire, with occasional footprints in the former county of Labyrinthodon.
Ganoid fish are so rare that these above named are, as far as the author is aware,
the only ones known, with one exception, which cannot be secured, in the Upper

Keuper ; the curious Dipteronotus having been found in the Lower Keuper (water-
stones) at Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire, and two new species discovered by Mr.
Wilson in the Lower Keuper, near Nottingham. The author gave a section of the
quarry containing the fossils above referred to, and stated that he considered that

the New Red Sandstone in Warwickshire, as the Rev. J. Mello has adopted in

Cheshire, might fairly and advantageously be divided into Upper and Lower
Keuper, the two series of sandstones being difierent lithologically, and being
separated by a considerable thickness of red marl, the lower sandstones being

especially characterised by remains of Labyrinthodon and other peculiar reptiles, a

fine and unique collection being preserved in the Warwick Museum,

9. On the Bange, Extent, and Fossils of the Bhcetic Formation in
        WarwicJcshire. By the Rev. P. B. Brodie, M.A., F.G.8.

     The author in this paper first gives an account of the range, thickness, and

--fossils of the upper portion of the Rhaetic formation viz. the ' white Lias,' sup-

posing that it really belongs to this, but to which it is now generally assigned,

showing that it is very rarely seen in conjunction with the underlying shales, and

that where they occur in one or two important sections the white Lias is absent.

A list of the fossils is given, which are few and iU-preserved, Ostrea intusstriata
Aand a species of Avicula (Monotis) being the most characteristic.
                                                                    full account

is given of the succeeding grey and black Rhaetic shales, with occasional interca-

lated shelly limestone and sandstone ; and though, as a rule, good sections are rare,
there were certain railway cuttings which laid open several very interesting and

instructive ones, and enabled the author to obtain a series of characteristic fossils,

including the Radiate, by no means common and local, the Ophiolepis Damesii, It

was stated that these occupied a considerable area in the southern division of the

county, appearing again on the north-east, near Rugby, and as a rule succeeded by

the basement beds (insect and saurian beds) of the Lower Lias, which were in places

seen in conjunction with these shales. It was further observed that they probably

underlie the Lias in its coirrse through the county; and the author concluded by

showing the general range of the Rhaetics from the coast of Devon to the coast of

Yorkshire; which, although not comparable either in thickness or abundance and

variety of fossils with the rich, varied, and peculiar Continental series, is still
sufficiently marked and important in this county and elsewhere to make it a
distinctive and independent formation.

10. On a Deep Boring for Water in the New Bed Marls (Keuper Marls)
         near Birmingham.^ By W. Jerome Harrison, F.G.S.

In the district round Birmingham the Keuper sandstone is divided from the

Keuper marls hy a line of fault running from north-east to south-west (Erdington

--to Rubery) roughly along the line of the river Rea.

West of this fault the Keuper sandstone and Bunter pehble-heds occupy the

surface, and yield an enormous and unfailing supply of pure water, the Birmingham

Coi-poration alone pumping about eight million gallons daily from three deep wells

in this formation. East of the line of fault the Keuper red marls form an un-

dulating band from five to twelve miles in width, the towns and villages on

which depend wholly on surface waters, or shallow wells in surface gravels, for

their water-supply. As the Keuper sandstone imdoubtedly underlies the Keuper

marls throughout the whole or the greater part of this tract of East Warwick-

shire, it is not surprising that attempts have recently been made to reach its

locked-up waters by means of deep borings. Some seven or eight years ago the

Birmingham Corporation bored in Smallheath Park (the southern suburb of

Birmingham) to a depth of 440 feet, entirely in Keuper marls. The object of this

paper is to describe a boring made during the present year at King's Heath, three

miles south, of Birmingham, at the brewery of Messrs. Bates, in search of water.

The following rocks have been passed through :

    At present the boring is temporarily delayed, owing to the breaking of a tool

at the bottom of the bore-hole.

    From comparisons with the Keuper marls of Staffordshire, &c., the thickness of
the Keuper marls at King's Heath can hardly be more than 700 feet. It is to be

hoped that the Keuper sandstone will be reached almost immediately, and that
its water-bearing properties will be such as to satisfy the requirements of the

district.

11. Notes on a Smoothed and Striated Boulder (^exhibited) from a Pre-

    tertiary Deposit in the Punjab Salt Bange. By W. T. Bi.anford,

     LL.V., F.B.S., Sec.G.S.

    The block of stone in question, like another exhibited by Mr. A. B. Wynne,
was obtained by Dr. Warth, at Chel Hill, in the Punjab Salt Range. This speci-
men was sent by Dr. Warth to Mr. H. B. Medlicott, Director of the Geological
Survey of India, who forwarded it to the present writer, in the hope of learning
the views of those who have most experience of similarly marked boulders, and of

ascertaining whether the peculiar characters of the present specimen are due to
any particular form of ice action or to any other agency.

     The stone consists of a purplish-brown porphyry, apparently an altered felsite-
porphyry. This rock is known to occur in Rajputana, near Jodhpui-, between 300

and 400 miles south of the Salt Range, and belongs to a gi'oup of beds supposed to

be Archaean, and known by the name of Malani. These rocks may occur nearer to
the Salt Range, but the intervening country is imperfectly known, and is much

covered with river alluvium and blown sand.
     The boulder exhibited measures 7^" x 6" x 3;^". It is subangular, the two

principal surfaces are plane, smooth, finely striated, opposite to each other, and
nearly but not quite parallel. Each of these surfaces is bevelled off on one edge
by a number of smaller facets, meeting the principal surface and each other at very
obtuse angles. Besides the larger plane surface there are on one side five
smaller smoothed facets, and on the other two, but one in each case is ill-marked,
the angle at which it meets the next siu'face being so obtuse as to be with difficulty
recognised. All the smoothed surfaces on one side are striated in the same direc-

tion ; those on the other side are striated similarly to each other, but diversely to
those on the opposite surface of the block. Those surfaces of the block that are

not smoothed are somewhat rounded.
     The bed from which the block was obtained is said to abound in similar

boulders, but they are not in general smoothed or striated. They are found in an
olive-coloured matrix of fine silt. The bed has been described by Mr. Wynne,

Dr. Waagen, and Mr. R. Oldham, and a general resume of its geological relations
was given in the ' Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. ' for the present year, p. 254. The
strata immediately overlying are marine, and contain fossils that are either

Palseocene or very high Cretaceous, but the age of the boulder-bed itself is some-

what doubtful. The occurrence of large boulders in a fine silt appears to indicate
glacial conditions, as in the Talchir beds of India, of which there is a possibility
that this Salt Range bed may be a representative, although most of those who
have examined the ground think it to belong to a much later geological period, and
associate it with the overlying Upper Cretaceous or Palseoceue strata.

Palceozoic), smoothed, polished, and striated on twelve different surfaces, giving it
at first sight the appearance of an imperfect crystal. Of these surfaces about six
are perfectly flat, others somewhat curved.

     On the largest surface the striation is fine, nearly in the direction of the longest

axis ; on other surfaces the strife cross this direction at various acute angles, ranging

from 23° to 80° or 85° from the more axial direction. On some of the faces,

making most obtuse angles with each other, the direction of the striae varies

least.

     The specimen is slightly marked superficially by the tin-box in which it
travelled; its planes show small cavities, once apparently occupied by pyrites
crystals, which being dislodged have initiated and caused striation as though they
had been used as engraving tools.

     From the positions of a large number of the facets (6), all upon one side of the

specimen, all contiguous and of unequal size, together with the slight variation in
direction of their striation, it would appear that this pebble, with whatever it was
embedded in, made about a half-revolution almost around its major axis by six
separate stages, and underwent severe grinding and polishing at each stage, to a
degree almost artificially perfect.

have been grasped and held by a resisting matrix of ice, whatever its bulk, effec-

2. On the Pleistocene Deposits of the Vale of Clwijd.
    By Professor T. M'Kennt Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.

The author cautions observers again? t inferring too hastilj'- the glacial origin of

beds from their containing glaciated boulders. He describes the older drifts of the

western part of North AVales, grouping them under two heads :--

1. The Arenig Drift, or that in which boulders were transported from Snowdon

and Arenig into the Vale of Clwyd and
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

2. The St. Asaph Drift, or that due to the destruction of tlie older glacial

deposits by marine action, during which boulders, which originally were carried on

ice from the north, and flints travelled in the shingle round the coast. Most of

Athe shells found in it are of species still living on the adjoining coast.                                                                                                                               larger

proportion of the shells found in what he considers part of the same series of

deposits in neighbouring districts are of a Scandinavian or arctic type, and may

belong to an earlier part of the same age.

He then gives an account of the principal caves explored about the Vale of

Clwyd, and explains their relation in each case to the drifts of the district ; inferring

that, while some of the caves themselves may be older than the marine Clwydian

drift, and some may possibly be even preglacial, yet that none of the bone-deposits

so far found in any of them can be referred to so early a date.

3. Comparative Studies upon the Glaciation of North America, Great

  Britain, and Ireland. By Professor H. Carvill Lewis, M.A., F.G.S.

     Observations extending over several years upon glacial phenomena on both sides
of the Atlantic had convinced the author of the essential identity of these phe-
nomena; and the object of this paper was to show that the glacial deposits of

Great_ Britain and Ireland, like those of America, may be interpreted most satis-

factorily by considering them with reference to a series of great terminal moraines,
which both define confluent lobes of ice and often mark the line separating the
glaciated from the non-glaciated areas.

     The paper began with a sketch of recent investigations upon the glaciation of
North America, with special reference to the significance of the terminal moraines
discovered within the last few years. The principal characters of these moraines
were given, and a map was exhibited showing the extent of the glaciated areas
of North America, the course of the interlobate and terminal moraines, and the
direction of striation and glacial movement.

     It was shown that, apart from the great ice-sheet of North-eastern America,
an immense lobe of ice descended from Alaska to Vancouver's Island on the
                                                                                           TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                         633

western side of the Rocky Mountains, and that from various separate centres in
the Cascade, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains there radiated smaller local

glaciers.

    The mountains encircling the depression of Hudson Bay seemed to he the prin-
cipal source of the glaciers, wbich became confluent to form the great ice-sheet. In
its advance this ice-sheet probably met and amalgamated with a number of already
existing local glacial systems, and it was suggested that there was no necessity for

assuming either an extraordinary thickness of ice at the pole or great and unequal

elevations and depressions of land.
     Detailed studies made by the author in Ireland, in 1885, had shown remarkably

similar glacial phenomena.
     The large ice-sheet which covered the greater part of Ireland was composed of

confluent glaciers, while distinct and local glacial systems occurred in the non-
glaciated area. The principal ice-sheet resembled that of America in having for its

centre a great inland depression surrounded by a rim of mountains.

      These appear to have given rise to the first glaciers, which, after uniting,
poured outwards in all directions. Great lobes from this ice-sheet flowed westward
out of the Shannon, and out of Galway, Clew, Sligo, and Donegal Bays, northward
out of Loughs Swilly and Foyle, and south-eastward out of Duudalk and Dublin
Bays ; while to the south the ice-sheet abutted against the Mullaghareirk, Galty,

and Wicklow Mountains, or died out in the plains.
     Whether it stopped among the mountains or in the lowlands, its edge was

approximately outlined by unusual accumulations of drift and boulders, representing

the terminal moraines. As in America, this outer moraine was least distinct in
the lowlands, and was often bordered by an outer fringe of drift several miles in

width.

     South of an east and west line extending from Tralee to Wexford is a non-glaciated
zone, free from drift. Several local systems of glaciers occur in the south of Ireland,
of which by far the most important is that radiating from the Killarney Moun-

tains, covering an area of 2,000 square miles, and entitled to be called a local ice-

sheet. Great glaciers from this Killarney ice-sheet flowed out of the fiord-like

parallel bays which indent the south-western coast of Ireland. At the same time

the Dingle Mountains, the Knockmealdown, and Comeragh Mountains, and those

of Wexford and Wicklow furnished small separate glaciers, each sharply defined

by its own moraine.

No evidence of any great marine submergence was discovered, although the

author had explored the greater part of Ireland, and the eskers were held to be.

phenomena due to the melting of the ice and the circulation of subglacial waters.

The Irish ice-sheet seemed to have been joined at its north-eastern corner by ice

coming from Scotland across the North Channel. All the evidence collected

indicates that a mass of Scotch ice, reinforced by that of Ireland and England,

filled the Irish Sea, overriding the Isle of Man and Anglesey, and extending at
Aleast as far south as Bray Head, south of Dublin.
                                                                                                                              map of the glaciation of

Ireland was exhibited, in which the observations of the Irish geologists and of the

author were combined, in which was shown the central sheet, the five local glacial

systems, all the known striae, and the probable lines of movement as indicated by

moraines, striae, and the transport of erratics.

The glaciation of AVales was then considered. Wales was shown to have

supported three distinct and disconnected local systems of glaciers, while at the

same time its extreme northern border was touched by the great ice-lobe of the

Irish Sea. The most extensive local glaciers were those radiating from the Snowdon

and Arenig region                                                                          while  another  set  of  glaciers  radiated  from  the Plinlimmon
                                                                                        ;

district and the mountains of Cardiganshire ; and a third system originated among

the Brecnockshire Beacons. The glaciers from each of these centres transported

purely local boulders, and formed well-defined terminal moraines. The northern

ice-lobe, bearing granite boulders from Scotland and shells and flints from the bed

of the Irish Sea, invaded the northern coast, but did not mingle with the Welsh

glaciers. It smothered Anglesey and part of Carnarvonshire on the one side, and

part of Flintshire on the other, and heaped up a terminal moraine on the outer
634 EEroRT-- 1886.

flanks of the North Welsh mountains. This great moraine, filled with far-travelled

northern erratics, is heaped up in hummocks and irregular ridges, and is in many

places as characteristically developed as anywhere in America. It has none of

the characters of a sea-beach, although often containing broken shells brought

from the Irish Sea. It may be followed from the extreme end of the

Lleyn Peninsula (where it is full of Scotch granite erratics"), in a north-easterly

direction, through Carnarvonshire, past Moel Tryfan, and along the foot of the

mountains east of Menai Strait to Bangor, where it goes out to sea, reappearing

further east at Conway and Colwyn. It turns south-eastward at Denbighshire,

going past St. Asaph and Ilalkin Mountain. In Flintshire it turns southward, and

is magnificently developed on the eastern side of the mountains, at an elevation of

over 1,000 feet between Minera and Llangollen, south-west of which place it enters

England. There is evidence that where the ice-sheet abutted against Wales it was

about 1,350 feet in thickness. This is analogous to the thickness of the ice-sheet

in Pennsylvania, where the author had previously shown that it was about 1,000

feet in thickness at its extreme edge and 2,000 feet thick at points some eight

miles back from its edge. The transport of erratics coincides with the direction

of strife in Wales as elsewhere, and is at right angles to the terminal moraines.

The complicated phenomena of the glaciation of England, the subject of a

voluminous literature and discordant views, had been of high interest to the author,

and had led him to redouble his efl'orts toward its solution. He had found that it

was possible to accurately map the glaciated areas, to separate the deposits made

by land-ice from those due to icebergs or to torrential rivers, and to trace out a

series of terminal moraines both at the edge of the ice-sheet and at the edge of its

confluent lobes. Perhaps the finest exhibition of a terminal moraine in England

Ais in the vicinity of Ellesmere, in Shropshire.       great mass of drift several

miles in width, and full of erratics from Scotland and from Wales, is here heaped

into conical hills which enclose ' kettleholes ' and lakes, and have all the characters

of the ' kettle moraine ' of Wisconsin. Like the latter, the Ellesmere moraine

here divides two great lobes of ice, one coming from Scotland, the other from

Wales. This moraine may be traced continuously from Ellesmere eastward,

through Madeley, Macclesfield, to and along the western flank of the Pennine

chain, marking throughout the southern edge of the ice-sheet of Northern

England. From Macclesfield the same moraine was traced northward past

Stockport and Staleybridge to Burnley, and thence to Skipton, in Yorkshire.

North-east of Burnley it is banked against the Boulsworth Hills up to a height of

1,300 feet, in the form of mounds and hummocks. South and east of this long

moraine no signs of glaciation were discovered, while north and west of it there

is every evidence of a continuous ice-sheet covering land and sea alike. The strife

and the transport of boulders agree in proving a southerly and south-easterly

direction of ice-movement in Lancashire and Cheshire.

AFrom Skipton northward tbe phenomena are more complicated.  tongue of

ice surmounted the watershed near Skipton and protruded down the valley of the

Aire as far as Bingley, where its terminal moraine is throvni across the valley like

a great dam, reminding one of similar moraine dams in several Pennsylvanian

Avalleys.  continuous moraine was traced around this Aire glacier. Another

greater glacier, much larger than this, descended AVensleydale and reached the

plain of York. The most complex glacial movements in Eugland occurred in the

mountain region about the Nine Standards, where local glaciers met and were

overpowered by the greater ice-sheet coming down from Cumberland. The ice-

sheet itself was here divided, one portion going southward, the other, in company

with local glaciers and laden with the well-known boulders of the ' Shap granite,'

being forced eastward across Stainmoor Forest into Durham and Yorkshire, finally

reaching the North Sea at the mouth of the Tees. The terminal moraine runs

eastward through Kirkby Ravensworth toward Whitby, keeping north of the

Cleveland Hills, and all eastern England south of Whitby appears to be non-

glaciated. On the other hand, all England north of Stainmoor Forest and the

river Tees, except the very highest points, was smothered in a sea of solid ice.

There is abundant evidence to prove that the ice-lobe filling the Irish Sea was
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  635

thicker towards its axis than at its edges, and at the north than at its southern
terminus, and that it was reinforced by smaller tributary ice-streams from both

England and Ireland. It may be compared with the glacier of the Hudson River
VaUey in New York, each having a maximum thickness of something more than
8,000 feet. The erosive power of the ice-sheet was found to be extremely slight
at its edge, but more powerful farther north, where its action was continued for a
longer period. Towards its edge its ftmction was to fill up inequalities rather than
to level them down. It was held that most glacial lakes are due to an irregular
dumping of drift, rather than to any scooping action ; observations in England and

in Switzerland coinciding with those in America to confirm this conclusion.
Numerous facts on both sides of the Atlantic indicate that the upper portion of

the ice-sheet may move in a different direction from its lower portion. It was also
shown that a glacier in its advance had the power of raising stones from the

bottom to the top of the ice, a fact due to the retardation by friction of its lower
layers. The author had observed the gradual upward passage of sand and stones
in the Grindelwald glacier, and he applied the same explanation to the broken
shells and flint raised from the bed of the Irish Sea to the top of Moel Tryfan, to
Macclesfield, and to the Dublin Mountains, The occurrence of stratified deposits

in connection with undoubted moraines was shown to be a common phenomenon,
and instances of stratified moraines in Switzerland, Italy, America, and Wales

were given. The stratification is due to waters derived from the melting ice, and

is not proof of submergence.

      It was held that, notwithstanding a general opinion to the contrary, there is
no evidence in Great Britain of any marine submergence greater than about
450 feet. It was expected that an ice-sheet advancing across a sea should deposit

 shell-fragments in its terminal moraine.

      The broad principle was enunciated that, wherever in Great Britain marine
 shells occur in glacial deposits at high levels, it can be proved, both by striae and

 the transport of erratics, that the ice advanced on to the land from out of the
 sea. The shells on Three Rock Mountain, near Dublin, and in North Wales and
 Macclesfield, all from the Irish Sea ; the shells in Cumberland, transported from
 Solway Firth ; those on the coast of Northumberland, brought out of the North
 Sea ; those at Airdree, in Scotland, carried eastward from the bottom of the

--Clyde ; and those in Caithness, from Moray Firth were among examples adduced

 in proof of this principle. The improbability of a great submergence not leaving
 corresponding deposits in other parts of England was dwelt upon.

      It was also held that there was insuflicient evidence of more than one advance
 in the ice-sheet, although halts occurred in its retreat. The idea of successive
 elevations and submergences with advances and retreats of the ice was disputed,
 and the author held that much of the supposed interglacial drift was due to sub-

 glacial water from the melting ice.

      The last portion of the paper discussed the distribution of boulders, gravels,
 and clays south of the glacial area. Much the greater part of England was
 believed to have been not covered by land-ice. The di-ift deposits in this area were
 shown to be the result in part of great freshwater streams issuing Irom the melting
 ice-sheet, and in part of marine currents bearing icebergs during a submergence of
 some 450 feet. The supposed glacial drift about Birmingham and the concen-
 tration of boulders at Wolverhampton were regarded as due to the former agent,
 while the deposits at Cromer and the distribution of Lincolnshire chalk across
 southern England was due to the latter. The supposed esker at Hunstanton was
 held to be simply a sea-beach, and the London drift deposits to be of aqueous
 origin. Thus the rival theories of floating icebergs and of land glaciers were both
 true, the former for middle and southern England, the latter for Scotland, Wales,
 and the north of England ; and the line of demarcation was fixed by great

 terminal moraines. The paper closed with an acknowledgment of indebtedness to

 the many geologists of England and Ireland who had uniformly rendered most

 generous assistance to the author during his investigations.

4. On tlie Extension and prolalle Duration of tJie South Staffordshire
                   Coalfield. JBtj Henry Johnson, F.G.S.

After giving an historical sketch of the progress of coal-mining iu South

Staffordshire, with special reference to the trials in search of coal beneath the Red

Rocks, the writer went on to describe in detail the results of some borings put down

by the Sandwell Park Colliery Company. After passing through 16 yards of

surface drift, containing rounded pieces of coal, limestone, and other rocks, the

Permians were entered, having a uniform dip of one in three to the east. The

sinking then continued through red rocks until a depth of 80 yards was reached,

·when red and purple marls set iu and continued to a depth of 200 yards,

at which point the base of the Permians was reached, and the Upper Coal Measiu-es

entered. These Upper Coal Measures (unknown iu the parent portion of the coal-

field, and composed of blue shales and white sandstones, containing irregularly

deposited thin bands of coaly matter) continued uutil a depth of 287 yards was

reached, and after passing thi-ough 131 yards of Lower Coal Measures (comprising

purple marls, conglomerates, and blue binds) the Thick Coal was reached, at a

depth of 418 yards, on May 28, 1874, and proved to be about nine yards in thick-
ness. At 123 yards, and in the red aud purple marls, a band of limestone, about

12 inches thick, and containing Spirorbis carbonarius, was passed through, this being

the first instance in South Staffordshire. The sinking of the 10-feet diameter trial

shaft occupied about four years, and the maximum quantity of water encountered

in the sinking was about 750 gallons per minute, which, however (after the water-

bearmg strata to the rise had been drained), diminished to about 40 gallons. It

was met with principally in the red rocks ot the Permians and in the sandstones of

the Upper Coal Measures.

     Beautiful and rare plant-remains of Coal Measure types were met with in the

--Permians, and many others were found in piercing the Coal Measures proper the

former circumstance seeming to suggest that the Permians would perhaps be more

correctly named Upper Coal Measures ; and if they were coloured on the Geo-

logical Survey maps as Coal Measures it would put a different complexion on our

geological maps of the country. It would, in any case, be interesting and

valuable information to know where the Permians end and the Coal Measures

begin.

The whole of the fossils found during sinking operations are now in the able

hands of Dr. Henry Woodward, of the British Museum, and they will, no doubt,
form an interesting study when thoroughly investigated and described, as they no

doubt will be. Since the discovery of the coal in 1874, explorations to the north

for upwards of a mile and a quarter, and to the south for about a quarter of a

mile, have been made, and the Thick Seam was fouud to be of average quality and

about nine yards thick. It has also been explored for about a quarter of a mile to

the east towards Birmingham, and found to first dip rapidly, then slowly^, and then

almost level, until a small upthrow fault is reached, beyond which it rises gently

towards Birmingham. The underground explorations to the west or towards the

parent coalfield, together with explorations from the Spon Lane Colliery to the

east, have undoubtedly proved Sir Roderick Murchison's theory of the existence of

an underground Silurian bank, for, whilst the Spon Lane explorations have

extended to where the seam is found partially removed by denudation and in a

fragmentary condition on the western slope of the bank, the Sandwell explorations

have extended to a point where the seam is lost by a sudden thinning out on the

eastern slope, after having been subjected to numerous slight dislocations.

I should mention that the information relating to the Spon Lane side of the

bank is from notes kindly supplied by Messrs. Cooksey and Son, who conducted the

Sandwell explorations, and took a considerable period to drain off.

     Benefiting by the discovery at Sandwell, the Perry and Hamstead sinkings
were commenced about two-and-a-half miles to the north-east and considerably to

the deep of Sandwell, the former being more than two miles and the latter about

  a mile and a quarter beyond the eastern boundary fault, and botli sinkino-s

  being confined within the exposed area of Permian, as at Sandwell. The Perry
  sinking was abandoned after sinking and boring to a total depth of 560 yards,
  wholly in the Permian Measures, and without any indications whatever of Coal
  Measures. The Hamstead sinking, after about five years' hard work, ulti-
  mately succeeded in winning the Thick Coal at a depth of 615 yards.' The

  failure to discover Coal Measures at the great depth bored to at Perry, and the
  inclination of the Thick Coal as proved at Hamstead, suggests the existence of a
  large dovrathrow fault between the two sinkings. The thickness of Permian
  passed through at Hamstead is 490 yards, and Coal Measures 125 yards, as ao-ainst

  218 yards of Coal Measures at Sandwell, or 93 yards less. This reduced thickness

  of Coal Measures may perhaps be accounted for by the presence of 87 yards of
  Upper Coal Measures at Sandwell, which we do not get at Hamstead. The two
 sinkings may be said to have proved coal for about one-and-a-quarter miles beyond
 the previously known coalfield, and to have increased the area several square
 miles, and it may also be said that they have to a very considerable extent proved
 the continuity of the coalfield underneath Birmingham, rightaway to the Warwick-

 shire coalfield, and I venture to think that the results should give encouragement

 to searchin other parts of the coalfield for coal below the Permians. The suc-
  cessful winnings next in importance, since the Association's last visit, are those
 underneath the basalt of the Rowley Hills. It has been clearly demonstrated that
 thebasalt forms only a comparatively thin capping over the Coal Measures, which
 he in regular order beneath and are for the most part unaltered by the close con-
 tiguity to the igneous rock, the latter apparently having been forced up throuo-h a
 small opening or openings and spread itself over what was at that period dry Tand
 or the bottom of a shallow sea. The Earl of Dudley and others are now raising

 large quantities of good Thick Coal from underneath this extensive range of hills,
 which at present form the only remaining maiden portion of the old coalfield

 from which a supply may be expected for any length of time. It may be of

 interest to state, as showing the disturbance to which the coalfield has been sub-
jected, that the Thick Coal at the Earl of Dudley's Lye Cross Pits on the Ptowley

 Hills is relatively about 1,000 feet above the Thick Coal at Sandwell, and about

 1,800 feet above the Thick Coal at Hamstead. The proximity of the New Red Sand-
 stone to the present confines of the coalfield may perhaps for a time hmit future

 sinkings to the narrow areas of exposed Permians on the east and west flanks ·

but ultimately the New Red ground will have to be sunk through. The necessity

 or otherwise of developing further new ground, in order to make up the reduced
output which must inevitably soon take place in consequence of the now rapid

 total exhaustion of the old coalfield, is a question well worth the serious considera-

tion of the district. When we see that no extensions are being made to the west,

 that the profitable limits in the south are k-nown, that the penetration of the con-
glomerate beds overlying the Cannock Chase or northern portion is one of o-reat

risk and expense (as evidenced by the signal failures of the Fair Oak Colliery and
the Cannock and Huntingdon Colliery), and that the parent portion of the coalfield

IS nearly all gone (and that the only points of future supplies will be the Sandwell

and Hamstead district, Cannock Chase, and the Rowley Hills), may not the time

have arrived for further search, especially taking into consideration the time that

must be occupied before any new undertaking can be fully developed and ready
for trading.? As showiug the capacity of production I would mention that durin<r

the last twenty years, 1866-1885 (or the period between this and the previous
visit of the Association), the gross quantity of coal raised from the coalfield was
191,277,309 tons, and during the same period the ironstone raised was 8,073,964
tons. The lowest annual output of coal during the twenty years was 8 389'.343

tons in 1874, and the highest was 10,550,000 tons in 1872. The output' in 1885
was 9,862,497 tons, and the average annual output for the twenty yenrs was

9,663,865 tons. It, therefore, appears that whilst the annual output of coal has
been maintained there has been a very remarkable falling-oft' in ironstone. I find

that in 1866 we raised 599,000 tons of ironstone, and that this quantity was in-
creased until in 1875 it reached 715,451 tons, since when it has decreased every

   --The following Papers were read :

    1. On tlie Relations of the Geology of the Arctic and Atlantic Basins.
                     By Sir J. William Dawson, O.M.G., F.B.8.

     The paper was hased on examinations of Arctic collections in England, made
with reference to a paper now in preparation by Dr. G. M. Dawson.

     The conclusions stated were principally as follows: The older crystalline rocks
in the Arctic collections correspond with the Laurentian and Huronian of Canada,
and there are also specimens which seem to represent the Animike series and the
Cambrian coastal series of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. There is a close
correspondence in the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian facies of the Arctic basin
with those of the eastern plateaus of North America, and the specimens are large and
well-developed. This would seem to apply also to the Carboniferous. There is a
deficiency in Permian and Triassic remains. The Jurassic seems to be represented,
and the Cretaceous flora is similar to that of the western territories of Canada. The
beds hitherto considered as Miocene in Greenland are apparently equivalent to the
Laramie Cretaceo-Eocene of Canada ; and the Miocene and Pliocene are absent, or
little represented, as is also the case in eastern Canada. The Pleistocene presents
features akin to that of Canada, more especially iu the occurrence of marine shells
of modern boreal species at great heights on the coast terraces.

     It appears that the elevations and subsidences corres])ond with those of the
American land to the southward; that there is remarkable evidence of temperate
climates from the Palaeozoic downwards, and an absence of glacial deposits except
in the Pleistocene and Modern. In the colder periods, however, the Arctic basin

may have been buried under permanent snow, or may have been an area of denuda-

tion rather than of deposition.

2. 0)1 the Roclcy Mountains, ivith special reference to that part of the

    Range between the 4:9th parallel and the headwaters of the Bed Deer
    Biver. By George M. Dawson, D.Sc, F.O.S.

    The term ' Rocky Mountains ' is frequently applied in a loose way to the whole

mountainous belt which borders the west side of the North American continent.
This mountainous belt is, however, preferably called the Cordillera region, and
includes a great number of mountain systems or ranges, which on the 40th parallel
have a breadth of not less than 700 miles. Nearly coincident with the 49th parallel,
however, a change in the general character of the Cordillera region occurs. It be-
comes comparatively strait and narrow, and runs to the 56th parallel or beyond with an
average width of about 400 miles only. This portion of the western mountain region
comprises the greater part of the province of British Columbia. It consists of four
main ranges, or, more correctly, systems of mountains, each including a number of

--component ranges. These mountain systems are, from east to west : (1) The

Rocky Mountains proper. (2) Mountains which may be classed together as the
Gold Ranges. (3) The system of the Coast Ranges of British Columbia, sometimes

Aimproperly named the Cascade Range. (4) mountain system which in its unsub-

merged portions constitutes Vancouver and the Queen Charlotte Islands.
     The present paper refers to the Rocky Mountains proper. This system, between

the 49th and 53rd parallels, has an average width of about 60 miles, which, in the
vicinity of the Peace River, on the 56th parallel, decreases to about 40 miles. It is
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  639

bounded to the east by the Great Plains, which break into a series of foot-hills
along its base ; to the west by a remarkably straight and definite valley occupied
by portions of the Columbia, Kootanie, and other rivers.

      Since the early part of the century the trade of the fur companies has traversed
this range, chiefly by the Athabasca and Peace River Passes, but till the explorations

effected by the expedition under Capt. Palliser in 1858-59 nothing was known in
detail of the structure of the range. At the inception of explorations for the
Canadian Pacific Railway, Palliser's map was stiU the only one on which any reliance

could be placed, and it applied merely to the portion of the range south of the
Athabasca Pass. Diuing the progress of the railway explorations a number of
passes were examined, and in 1883 and 1884 that part of the range between the
49th parallel and latitude 51° 30" was explored and mapped in some detaU in
connection with the work of the Canadian Geological Survey by myself and

assistants.

     Access to this, the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains within Canadian
territory, being now readily obtained by the railway, its mineral and other resources

are receiving attention, while the magnificent alpine scenery which it affords is
beginning to attract the attention of tourists and other travellers.

     The results of the reconnaissance work so far accompUshed are here presented in
the form of a preliminary map, accompanied by descriptions of routes and passes,
and remarks on the main orographic features of the range.

                       3. On the Coal-hearing BocJcs of Canada.
              By Frank D. Adams, Geological Surveyor of Canada.

    As the coalfields of the Dominion are very extensive, the coal-bearing rocks

occupying in those portions of the country which have been examined geologically

an area of not less than 97,200 square miles, it will be best to consider the fuel

supply of each province separately. Nova Scotia, the most easterly of all the

provinces, contains probably the most important and certainly the most extensively
worked coal deposits in the Dominion, This coal is all bituminous, no anthracite
having yet been found. The measures are of Carboniferous age, and although they
occupy an area only amounting to about 685 square miles, yet the seams which
they enclose are so numerous and so thick that the quantity of coal contained in
this area is enormous. There are three important coal-basins in this province,
situated respectively in Cape Breton, Pictoii, and Cumberland Counties ; as well as
several others which are of less importance, or as yet undeveloped. The Cape
Breton coalfields form the edge of an extensive basin, the greater part of which is
bidden beneath the Atlantic Ocean, and rights have been taken out, covering about
100 square miles of submarine coal. The strata are so impervious to water that at
a moderate depth the submarine workings are perfectly dry. It has been estimated

by the Geological Survey of Canada that the seams now opened in this dis-
trict contain, in the areas leased for the purpose of workmg them, over
212,000,000 tons of coal. In composition and general characteristics the Cape

Breton coal is very similar to Newcastle coal, and is largely used for domestic pur-

poses and for gas-making. At one time it was shipped very largely to New York and

Boston for the latter purpose. It is also largely used as a steam coal. The Pictou
basin is remarkable for the great thickness of the coal-seams which occur in it, the
main seam in the Dalhousie pit of the Albion mines being as much as 36| feet
thick. The coal of the Pictou and Cumberland basins is, as a general rule, less
bituminous than that of Cape Breton, and belongs rather to the free-burning type.
In 1885 there were in operation in Nova Scotia 28 collieries, employing 4,446

men and boys, the total output for the year being 1,352,205 tons. The aggregate
sales of Nova Scotia coal for the 100 years ending 1884 was 22,290,937 tons. Of

late years, owing to the development of the American coalfields and the increased
facilities for transportation, the quantity of Nova Scotia coal sent to the United
States has been steadily diminishing. This loss, however, is more than compen-
sated by the greatly increased market in Nova Scotia itself, as well as in the
640 REPORT-- 1886.

proyinces of Quebec aud Ontario. Even with the present protective duty of
60 cents a ton, however, this coal from Nova Scotia cannot be profitably carried
further west in Canada than Ottawa or Brockville.

    In the neighbouring province of New Brunswick the coal-bearing rocks are

much thinner and the coal-seams smaller. They are, however, near the surface,
and are worked at one or two places in a small way, principally for local use.
The coal is easily worked, and will at some future time probably be burned

extensively.

     Unfortunately no coal is found in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, which
at present contain the greater part of the population of the Dominion ; and what
is still more imfortunate is the fact that it never will be discovered in either of
these provinces in workable quantities, seeing that the formations which underlie

them are older than the Carboniferous. Passing, however, still further to the

west, immense deposits of coal and lignite are found in the North-west Territo-

ries, recently opened up by the Canadian Pacific Railroad. Their occurring in this

part of Canada is especially a subject for congratulation, as much of the country is

Abut scantily supplied with wood.  line drawn on the 97th meridian separates in a
--general way the coal-bearing rocks of America into two classes those on the east

of this line being of Carboniferous age, while those on the west belong to the
Tertiary or Cretaceous formation. The rocks, therefore, in which the coals and

lignites of the North-west Territories and of P>ritish Columbia are formed belong

to the latter class. The mineral fuels of the North-west may be divided into four

--classes, which, however, pass gradually into one another:

(a) True lignites, holding from 10 to 22 per cent, of hygroscopic water.

(b) Lignitic coals,  ,,            5 to 9   ,,  ,,
                     ,,            li to 5  ,,  ,,
(c) True coals,

(d) Anthracite,

     The true lignites are foimd in the eastern part of the territory, none but true lig-
nites, for example, occurring in the district of Assiuiboia. As we go west towards

the Ilocky Mountains the lignite gradually improves in quality, being firmer and
holding less water, until in the disturbed and folded strata toward the base of the

mountains it becomes a true coal, while in one of the basins of coal-bearing rocks which
occur in the mountains themselves, and which are very much disturbed, anthracite is
found. This gradual change from lignite to anthracite is one of the most remark-
able examples of the results of pressure and disturbance to be found anywhere.

The coal deposits of this great tract of country are situated so that they can be
easily mined ; many of them can be worked by simple levels run in from the deep
river valleys. The only locality where much coal is taken out at present is near
Lethbridge, in the Belly River, where the North-western Coal and Navigation
Company work a seam of very good lignite coal 5 feet 4 inches in thickness. The
mine is connected with the line of the Canadian Pacific Railroad by a branch line
107 miles in length, and large quantities of the coal are shipped east to Manitoba
and used by the railway for their locomotives. Taking the minimum thickness of
the seam at different points along an outcrop of G6 miles, and assuming a workable
width of only one mile, the seam alone would contain 8.30,000,000 tons of coal.
It is now ascertained from the known outcrop that a large part of the plains is
underlain by coal at a workable depth, but this one seam will serve to show the
immense quantity of coal which can readily be obtained. Preparations are now
beino- made for working the anthracite mentioned above as occurring in the Rocky
Ivlountains on an extensive scale. The deposit is near Banff", on the line of

the Canadian Pacific, and the anthracite will probably be largely used not only
by the railway, but also in Winnipeg, where it will compete with the American

hard coal now used in that city. In British Columbia, the most westerly province

of the Dominion, there are also very extensive coal deposits, which are especially
valuable owing to the absence of good coal elsewhere on the Pacific coast of North
America. The only known deposit of anthracite on the Pacific coast occurs on

the Queen Charlotte Islands.
     Bituminous coal is largely mined on Vancouver Island, four colheries being at

work during the past year, with a total output of 365,000 tons. The largest colliery,
known as the Wellington, works a seam 9 feet in thickness, while the Nanaimo,
which has heen in operation nearly thirty years, works two seams, the upper being
from 6 to 10 feet thick, while the lower has a thickness of 7 feet. Most of the
coal raised is shipped to San Francisco, but some is sent to Alaska and some to the
Sandwich Islands.

     Blocks of almost every coal mentioned in this paper were to be seen in the
Canadian Court of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. The author desires to
acknowledge his indebtedness to the Reports of the Geological Survey of Canada,

to the Reports of the Departments of Mines of Nova Scotia and of British Columbia,
as well as to several gentlemen who have kindly given him information on certain

points connected with the subject.

     In 1885, 1,717,205 tons of coal were raised in Canada, being nearly double the
amount raised in 1875,

           4. On the Coal Deposits of South Africa.^
       By Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.It.8., F.G.S.

     In Cape Colony native coal is chiefly obtained from the Stormberg range, near
Cypher-gat and Molteno, not far from Burgersdorp. The geological arrangement

of the strata is   --Upper Stormberg Beds (with Coal).
Karoo Formation,   --Middle Beaufort Beds (with Dicynodon, &c.).

                  ---| Lower Kimberley Shales and Conglomerates (equivalent to

                  the Ecca  Beds, according  to Mr. Dunn)                                                         Ecca Beds with
                                                                                                               ;

                  V the great Ecca or Dwyka Conglomerates.

   --77(6 Stormberg Coal. In the southern part of the Stormbergen, at and near

Molteno, the coal, worked in numerous adits and pits, seems to belong to one main
'seam,' made up of several layers, of which 34 J inches are coal and 15| inches
shale. Another seam, with about 50 inches of coal and 9 inches of shale, coming

out at the foot of Bushman's Hoek, not far from Molteno, is probably at a some-

what different level. Faults may have disarranged the stratification here and
there. On the Indwe River, in the Dordrecht district (about fifty miles eastward),
a seam of coal with shale partings (7' 6" of coal and 6' 7" of shale) occurs at a

different level from that of the foregoing ; but the workings on all the seams in the

two districts are said to be within 300 or 400 feet above the level of the Karoo

....sandstone lying below (Dunn, ' Report,' 1878, p, 20; and Green, ' Report,' 1883,

P-24)-
                                                            .
     The coal is very laminar, with impressions of ferns and cycadaceous leaves, and

flattened carbonaceous tree-trunks, without any ' seat-earth.' In these composite
coal-seams some of the 'laminje are made up of a large number of alternations of thin

plates of coal and very thin films of black mud,' which give rise to the large percent-
age of ash. One seam gives coal of different value at two diggings, at Molteno and

Van Zyls, a mile distant. In the latter case the microscope shows that 'the

carbonaceous portion seems to be intermingled, and, as it were, wrapped up, in the
most intimate way, with the mineral matter of the ash.'

     The several exposures, natural and artificial, of these Stormberg coals (near
Burghersdorf, on the Indwe and on the Kraii River) are described in detail by

Mr. E. J. Dunn, Mr. F. W. North, and Professor A. II. Green in their respective
reports. Outcrops of coal may be looked for on the slopes of the Stormberg and

adjacent hills in strata at or about the same level as those at Bushman's Hoek in

the Stormberg.

     Some large examples of the coals themselves were shown in the Colonial and

Indian Exhibition, and are described in the official catalogues.

     The geological age of the great Karoo series of strata, as shown by the fossils,

and by their relative position to the Palaeozoic rocks of the Witteberg and Zuur-
berg, is probably Permi-triassic or Lower Triassic. Their possible relationship

to certain Mesozoic beds near the eastern coast of the colony, and their possible
eqimvaleney to some Indian and Australian formations, has been ably discussed

by Dr. Blanford, F.E.S. Some Palaeozoic plant remains of real old Carboniferous
age have before now been sent to England from the neighbourhood of the Storm-

berg, but it is very doubtful if they were really found there.

   --Coal in the Free State and Transvaal. North of Burghersdorp occasional ex-

posures of grey and black shales, with thin layers of coal, occur south and north of
the Orange River, and then, with wider intervals, in the Orange Free State up to
the Sand River, north of Winburg, but without any valuable yield of coal ; and so
on to the Vaal valley, where the Walsch runs into it, and further on, particularly

at the junction of the Wilge and the Vaal. Hereabouts the late G. W. Stow

found useful coal exposed for some distance along the river and its tributaries.

The ' black band,' as he called it, is thicker here than at the Sand River. At the
latter place he found this band to contain about 18 inches altogether of coal. At
the Taaibosch sprint, however, near the mouth of the Wilge, he exposed, under

superficial debris, black shales with 15 feet of coal.
     Still further north and north-east the same horizontal Stormberg sandstones

and shales extend in force (2,.300 feet thick, according to Mr. Penning, * Quart.
Journ. Geol. Soc' vol. xl. p. 663) through the Orange Free State into the Trans-

vaal. Here it occupies an area of about 56,000 square miles. Were the coal-seams

continuous this would be a grand coalfield ; but the same remarks apply here as in
the Stormberg.

   --The Natal Coal. The Klip River Coalfield is about forty by twenty miles in

area, and there are other,but inferior, fields. The seams vary from two or three inches
to three or four feet in thickness. In Natal, as in the Cape Colony, the coal-seams
are compound, being divided by thin shales ; but this deterioration of the fossil fuel
is not so general in Natal. In one case (main coal, near Umraki) ' in a total thick-
ness of 10 feet 9 inches there is only about 3 inches of parting and many others

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

. . . show good workable sections free from earthy matter ' (North's Report, 1881,
p. 13). ' The whole of the deposits are of very lentiform nature, especially the
coal-seams themselves ' Qoc. cit.). As in Cape Colony numerous trap-dykes tra-
verse the Karoo strata, and occasionally the coal-seams have been afiected by these

igneous rocks.

   --The Ecca Beds. The Ecca beds (including the Koonap beds, ' Quart. Journ.

Geol. Soc' vol. xxiii. 1867, p. 172), underlying the Reptiliferous Karoo sandstones
 and shales, contain fossil wood and plant remains (ferns, &c.) in both the western
and the eastern districts of Cape Colony ; also some traces of coal here and there.
The diamantiferous and carbonaceous shales of Kimberley are regarded by Mr.

Dunn as their northern equivalent. About 1878 Mr. Dunn found an inlier of

 highly inclined and faulted coal-bearing strata in the Ecca beds at Bufiel's Kloof,

 and again at Brandewyn's Gat, by the Leeuwe River, on a spur of the Nieuweldt,

 36 miles south-west of Beaufort-West and 100 miles west of Bufiel's Kloof. He

 has described also the anthracite and highly carbonaceous Umestone found in the

 same Ecca beds near Bufiel's River, on the Beaufort and Cape Town line of railway

 (see his ' Report on the Camdeboo and Nieuweldt Coal,' 4to, 1879 ; and ' Geol.

 Mag.,' 1879, pp. 551-4).

     Mr. Dunn has suggested that coal may be found, by boring into the Ecca beds

 under the Karoo sandstones and shales, over some hundreds of square miles of a
 great central basin in Cape Colony (' Report on a Supposed Extensive Deposit
 of Coal underlying the Central Districts of the Colony,' 4to, 1886). Around the
 edges of the basin thin leaves of coal have been found in these black shales ; at

 Bufiel's River with the black limestone ; at Kimberley and De Beer's mines as thin

 layers and seams of impure coal up to an inch in tliickness. In Natal in these same

 rocks (well represented at the Foot of the Town Hill, Pietermaritzburg, Dunn,

 'Report,' 1886, p. 11). These are the ' Pietermaritzburg shales' of Dr. Sutherland.

A coal-seam fifteen inches thick occurs at Compensation Flats ; and probably

 boring near Ladysmith Flats, where these same rocks underlie, would bring to light
 the thicker seams at a lower horizon than the Newcastle and Dundee coal-seams

beds in the interior of this great central basin of the Cape Colony region, and has
recommended that borings be made at certain places south of Hope Town.

5. 0)1 the Kerosine Shale of Mount Victoria, New South Wales.
              By Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, F.B.S.

The kerosene or paraffin shale of New South Wales, so valuable for its laro-e

yield of good hydrocarbons, occurs in the area of the Blue Mountains, where I ex-

amined it in 1875 iu the Carboniferous strata under very much the same conditions

as seams of coal ; it passes on the one hand into a ' bituminous ' shale, and on the
other insensibly into coal. The Mount Victoria seam, ranging from twelve to

eighteen inches in thickness, and with a shale roof and floor, passes westwards into

a valuable deposit at Hartley Vale, thirty-eight inches in thickness, and still

further to the west, at Piper's Flat Creek, is represented by a layer eight inches in
thickness embedded in a coal seam, twenty-four inches of splint coal beino- above

and sixteen inches of dull coal below. Ic is therefore lenticular, like the cannel

coal of the Lancashire coalfield.

Under the microscope it presents a finely granular mass of fossil resins embedded

in a meshwork of clayey material, the former being composed in part of obscure

broken-down spores, and the latter apparently of a mud deposited from muddy

water at the time of the deposition of the former.

The two are so intimately associated that the ash maintains the same shape and

almost the same size as the shale before burning ; the resinous element has probably

been deposited by muddy water in basins existing in the Carboniferous forests, and

its association with the coals can only be accounted for on that hypothesis, which

also will account for its gradual passage into shale. In the associated blue shales
Glossojjteris and Vertebraria are the two predominant forms, but there are also

forms undistinguishable from Calamites and Lepidodendron, both of which, as well

as Si(/illaria and Stiffmaria, have been obtained from the New South AVales coal-

               By Sir Julius von Haast, K.C.M.G., F.B.S. , F.G.S.

    The coal of New Zealand is of Cretaceous or Tertiary age. Recent researches

by von Ettingshausen on the fossil flora lead to the conclusion that the coals of
the Grey, BuUer, Pakawau, and Wangapeka Beds should be classed with the

-- --Cretaceous; the rest Shag Point, Malvern Hills, &c. as true Tertiary. The

Cretaceous coals are bituminous and of excellent quality; they occur in beds

varying from 8 to 50 feet in thickness. The rocks have been much disturbed and

faulted, and the coals range from 600 feet below the sea to nearly 4,000 feet above
it. The Tertiary coals vary in character. In the Malvern Hills are found all
varieties, from brown coal to good anthracite. In some cases, of thick seams capped
by basalt, the upper part is anthracite, the lower part brown coal.

     The development of the coal resources is proceeding rapidly, the output having
increased from 162,218 tons iu 1878 to 480,831 tons in 1884, whilst the amount
imported has decreased.

  7. On, the Geysers of the Botorua District, North Island of New Zealand.
                                  By E. W. BucKE.

    The author of this paper has recently returned from the Lake district of New

Zealand, where he spent eighteen months, and had exceptional opportunities for
making ohservations upon the volcanic phenomena of the district. The largest

geyser in New Zealand, that of the White Terrace of Eotomahana, is now de-

stroyed ; the three next in size are those of Pehutu, Waikiti, and Wairoa, all of
which are situated close together at the hack of the native village named
Whakarewarewa, about three miles to the south of the Rotorua township, and these
are particularly described in the present communication. The author was able to
determine by soundings the depth of the tubes of several geysers of this district,

and in the ease of an extinct one, that of Te Waro, he Avas let down the tube.
He found that this tube, at a depth of 13 feet from the surface, opened into a
chamber 15 feet long, 8 feet broad, and 9 feet high, and that from one end of this
chamber another tube led downwards to an undetermined depth.

     Living entirely among the natives fur many months, and speaking their
language, the author was able to test the power claimed by the natives of being
able to predict the outbursts of the geysers. He is convinced that by constant
observations on the direction of the wind and the condition of the atmosphere the
natives have learnt to prognosticate the movements in all these hot springs with
wonderful accuracy. He was also able to prove that during the whole time of
his residence in the district certain of the geysers were only in eruption when the

wind blew from a particular quarter.

8. Note accompanying a Series of PhotograpJis prepared by Josiah Martin

      Esq., F.G.S., to illustrate the Scene of the recent Volcanic Eniption in,

    New Zealand. By Professor J. W. Jijdd, F.B.S., Fres.G.S.

     Owing to the great enterprise and energy shown by the managers of the local

newspaper-press in New Zealand, very full and graphic accounts of the volcanic

outburst of June 10 have already reached this country, and have been copied into

the English papers. On the day of the eruption Dr. James Hector, C.M.G., F.R.S.,
Director of the Geological Survey of New Zealand, started for the locality, and
his preliminary report, accompanied by maps and plans, has been published.
Dr. Hector concludes that the eruption was a purely hydrothermal phenomenon on
a gigantic scale, and that it was unaccompanied by any ejection of freshly molten

lava either in the form of fragmental matter or of lava-streams. I have been
favoured by Mr. J. E. Clark, E.G. S., with specimens of the material ejected during
the eruption, and the microscopic examination of these seems to support Dr.

 Hector's conclusions.

      It is a most unfortunate circumstance that the beautiful sinter-terraces of
 Rotomahana appear either to be blown to fragments or covered up under the

 enormous masses of mud thrown out in that localitj^ It luckily happens that a

 number of most excellent photographs, which illustrate very beautifully the
 characters of the wonderful sinter-formations, have been obtained. Mr. Josiah
 Martin, F.G.S., has especially devoted himself to the study of the district, and
 the series of photographs now exhibited constitute an invaluable record of the
 characters of the district destroyed by the eruption. These photographs show the
 points at which the volcanic cones were formed upon Tarawera, and the beautiful
 characters of the White Terrace (Te Terata), and of the Pink Terrace (Otukapua-
 ran"-i), and the other wonders which surround the now destroyed lake of

 Rotomahana.

     Now that the European settlement has been formed at Rotorua, a great service

 would be rendered to science if a meteorological station could be established there,
 and by simultaneous observations of the atmospheric conditions and of the state
 of activity of the numerous hot springs, the question of the exact relations between

 these two sets of phenomena clearly established. When we remember that a fall

9. On the Geology of the neiohj discovered Goldjields in Kimherley, Western
                 Australia. By Edward T. Hardman, F.B.G.S.I.

During the past few months attention has been drawn to Western Australia

by announcements in the public press, both British and colonial, of the discovery

of a payable goldfield in that colony.

The first paragraph was a telegram from Perth, AV.A., to the Colonial Office,

stating that 400 ounces  had  been  brought  dowu                           shortly after  620 ounces  were
                                                                         ;

reported, as well as a nugget of 19 ounces, and also one of 29 ounces. Great

excitement was caused in Australia by these announcements, and a ' rush ' greater

than that of 1851 was predicted. Later accounts show that this ' rush ' is taking

place. Miners are flocking to the new El Dorado in numbers from South Australia,

--Victoria, New South Wales, from the great mining colony of Queensland, and even

from New Zealand two men fi-om which obtained 1,100 and 300 ounces of gold

respectively, as stated in a private letter dated July 5, 1886.^ According to a letter

from the Surveyor-General there must be now nearly 3,000 men on the fields.
The goldfield is therefore an accomplished fact. It had long been a disappoint-
ment and reproach to Western Australia that it was not gold-producing, and this
idea was almost confirmed when Mr. E. Hammond llargraves visited a portion of

it and reported adversely ; and it came to be believed that further search was

almost hopeless. In 1883, however, a large surveying expedition was sent up to

the Kimherley district, and to this party Mr. Hardman was attached as geologist.
During the first year the author saw many indications pointing to the existence of

gold, but was unable to test it practically, owing to adverse circumstances. In the

next year he was more fortunate, and discovered gold along the rivers Slargaret,
Elvire, and Ord for 140 miles. The announcement telegraphed to Perth was

received with gi-eat enthusiasm, and several parties of prospectors went up to the

country, the results of their labours verifying the author's prediction as to the

capabilities of the gold-field, and justifying the rush now taking place.

   --The importance of the discovery could hardly be exaggerated. It supplied a

want long ielt in Western Australia namely, an attraction for emigrants, which

the most glowing accounts of the really fine pasture, abundance of water, and

healthy climate had failed to produce. The author was confident it would have a

very teneficial eifect in drawing a large population to this at present most thinly
peopled colony, which with an area of more than one million square miles contains
but 35,186 whites.

     Kimberley is the extreme northern part of the colony, extending between

-- --lat. 13° S. and 19° 30' S., and its area 134,000 square miles exceeds that of the

British Isles by 18,000 square miles.
     The author described the geology of the district, which is in part composed of

low flat ground, while in places it is very mountainous, the Leopold Ranges having

an area of probably 20,000 square miles. There are many large rivers. The rocks
comprise Archaean granites, gneiss, and schists ; Lower Palasozoic sandstones and
limestones. Carboniferous sandstones and limestones. Upper Tertiary beds, and Post

Pliocene and Recent deposits. There were extensive outbursts of granite and a
great jloetz deposit of Basaltic and other trap rocks, forming a vast plateau, the

known area of which is at least 3,000 square miles, and is called the Great Antrim
Plateau. These rocks are undoubtedly of Lower Paleeozoic age, and in extent are

therefore probably unique.

     The known area of the gold-bearing country (schists, &c., with quartz veins) is
not less than 2,000 square miles. Quartz reefs are very numerous, and will no
doubt be extensively worked in the future. At present the mining is alluvial.

   A map was exhibited showing the geology of over 20,000 square miles of the

district.

   11. The Relations of the Middle and Lower Devonian in West Somerset.

                           By W. A. E. UssHEK, F.G.S.

     This paper deals with the relations of the Foreland grits to the Lynton beds

and Hangman grits with which they are successively brought into juxtaposition by

fault.

   A patch of Lynton beds on the north of the fault at Oare dipping conformably

to the subjacent Foreland grits in the vicinity seemed to the author sufficient to
prove the position of the Foreland series at the base of the Devonian strata of
North Devon according to the generally accepted view; but he found on the east
of Luccot Hill, where the Foreland and "Hangman grits were in juxtaposition, it was
impossible to fix upon any definite line of demarcation, either by lithological charac-
ters or dip ; although beyond a zone of debatable ground the general distinctive
characters of each grit series were perfectly apparent.

     This difficulty caused the author to lend a willing ear to a suggestion of Mr.

Champernowne that the Foreland and Hangman grits might really be the same

series, the appearance of conformable superposition of Lynton upon Foreland beds
at Oare being ascribed to inversion. According to this view the downthrow of the
fault at Oare would be to the north.

     The object of the paper is to discuss the evidence in favour of and against this
suggestion, its important bearing on the mapping of the area entitling it to this

consideration.

     The author advances five points in favour of the hypothesis ; the relative merits
of these he then discusses briefly seriatim, and points out three considerations

adverse to the hypothesis, and some reasons why such difficulties as are experienced
in drawing boundaries between the Foreland grits and Hangman beds might
reasonably be expected to occur. He considers the arguments against the hypo-
thesis of the identity of the Foreland and Hangman groups, more especially those
derived from the typical characters and mode of succession of the rocks composing

each group, to be too strong to be entertained without positive evidence in its

favour. The author then briefly disposes of the possibility of the absence of the

Lynton beds east of Luccot Hill being due to unconformable overlap of Hangman

upon Foreland rocks, pointing out that if such were the case conglomerates ought

to be found in the Hangman series, and the j unction should also be marked by dis-

cordant relations of dip and strike.

            12. Supplementary Note on Two Deep Borings in Kent.

                By W. Whitakee, B.A., F.G.S. , Assoc.Inst.G.E.

     The paper ' On Deep Borings at Chatham,' communicated in abstract to the
last meeting of the Association, was afterwards read, with various additions, to

the Geological Society. Since then, however, further information has been got,
some of which is of importance, especially in view of the fact that the South

Eastern Railway Company is about to make a deep trial-boring at Dover.
     The boring at Chattenden Barracks, near Chatham, has been finished, being

taken to a depth of over 1,160 feet, the bottom of the Gault being reached at

1,162 feet, where sand (Lower Greensand) was found and water got. In my

account of the section it was left, in Gault, at 1,103 feet, and I ventured to say
that ' some 60 feet more would reach the bottom of that formation ' : this happened
in 59 feet. 1 did not venture, however, to predict the finding of Lower Greensand,
as, from the thinness of that series at Chatham, a little southward, it was quite
possible that it might soon disappear northward.

     The almost exact correspondence of the combined thickness of Chalk and Gault
here, 872 feet, with the same total at Chatham (875 and 878 feet in two borings)
is noteworthy. Of course there is no Upper Greensand, which formation is absent
at the outcrop on the south.

     The Dover boring has been carried a few feet deeper and abandoned. I have
visited the site, and procured a good set of specimens of the bottom clays, of
which we had but a few small pieces before.
650 REPORT-- 1886.

These specimens have heen carefully examined, and the result of this examina-

mytion is, I think, worthy of notice. As regards fossils it is simply negative,  col-

leagues, Mr. G. Sharman and Mr. E. T. Newton, after washing and sifting pieces of

many specimens, were unable to detect any organism, with a solitary exception,

and that was a single example of a species of Rotalia, which, struggling into exist-

ance in Silurian times, has managed to survive to the present day ! I have some

doubt, too, whether this one fossil may not have fallen down the bore. Anyway
it proves nothing. As regards the character of the beds, however, I think that a
reasonable conclusion may be inferred from the specimens.

    In my published account certain beds are referred, with some doubt, to the

Lower Greensand. The reference is wrong and the doubt right. The top five

feet, of the forty-nine credited to Lower Greensand, really belong to the base of

the Gault, and the bottom thirteen feet to the Wealden, as I believe. The Lower

Greensand is left, therefore, with only thirty-one feet of clayey sand. It is curious

that specimens from the bottom part (838 to 848 feet) are exactly like the corre-

sponding specimens from the bottom part of the Lower Greensand in the Chatham

boring (932 to 943 feet), the two sets having about the same vertical extent

(10 or 11 feet).

    These specimens remind one of the division known as the Sandgate Beds, and

I am inclined to think that this division alone occurs at Dover, the Folkestone

Beds above and the Hythe Beds below having thinned out, although both those

divisions are thicker than the Sandgate Beds at ttie outcrop.

     The clayey beds beneath have been proved to a thickness of some 80 feet, the boring

ending at about 930 feet. In my paper I spoke of chalky matter occurring in them,

but in this I was wrong. The white specks in the small specimens first seen cer-

tainly looked calcareous, but the examination of better specimens has shown that

they are anything but that. Indeed, the prevailing character is the absence of

any effervescence when the clays are treated with hydrochloric acid ; in many

cases peculiarly fine-grained whitish beds simply absorb the acid, without any effer-

vescent action.

    On comparing the specimens with other clays they were found to be unlike any
of the marine Cretaceous and Jurassic clays, and it seemed to me that their affi-

nities lay rather with the Wealden series, and probably with the lower, or Hastings

division, than with the Weald Clay.

     I have only lately been able to test this by the help of a set of specimens that

Mr. G. Maw has been kind enough to send me. On examining them I found

that three specimens of Weald Clay, from Surrey, effervesced readily, which is per-

haps not surprising, as they came in two cases from close to Horsham stone and in

the other from near a Paludina bed. Nine specimens from a more distant district,

Dorsetshire, did not efl'ervesce ; but one can hardly give the exact position of these

in the Wealden Series. Ten specimens from the Ashdown Series, the lowest divi-

sion of the Hastings Beds, not only, in some cases, resembled Dover specimens in

character (I speak from memory, not having had the two sets side by side), but in

every case refused to notice the presence of hydrochloric acid.

Should this classification be right it serves to strengthen very much the conclu-

mysion, in  paper, that Dover is on all grounds a good site for a deep trial -boring,'

for it looks as if the bottom part of the great Wealden Series came there within 600

feet of the surface in the low ground, the boring described being on a site 280 feet

above the sea.

  13. On tlie Westward Extension of the Coal-measures into South-eastern

            England. By Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, F.B.S.

    Geological evidence is conclusive that the valuable coalfields of South Wales
and of Somerset are connected with the equally valuable coalfields of North France
and of Belgium, some 1,200 square miles in extent, by a series of isolated fields or
basins concealed by the newer rocks. The coal-bearing rocks of Northern France

pass westward, in the direction of Calais, and plunge under the newer rocks near
Cond^, from which point to Theroiiaune they extend, and are worked over two
Departments, their discovery being due to borings carried on at the expense of the
French Government. Therouanne is the furthest point to the west, where they

have been worked. At Calais, about thirty miles still further to the west, they

have been proved in a deep boring for water, at a depth of 1,092 feet below

the sea. From this point westward they have not been struck until we reach

Somersetshire.

     The borings for water, however, made in the London area show that the water-
worn Primary rocks which come to the surface in the West of England, and in
Northern France and Belgium occur under London at a depth of less than 1,200
feet below ordnance datum, and that they are highly inclined, as in those regions.
These rocks are of the Silurian and Devonian ages, and their high inclination implies
that the strata are thrown into a series of folds which, in some neighbouring area,

must bring in the Carboniferous rocks.
     The strata of the North French and Belgian Carboniferous rocks, if carried

westwards into South-eastern England, as Mr. Godwin-Austen has shown, would
bring them in the district between Hythe and Sandwich. These circumstances have

aflbrded me sufficient reasons for choosing Dover as a good site for a deep boring,

which has been undertaken by tlie directors of the South-Eastern Railway, with
the intention of proving the westward extension of the Calais measures, which are

only twenty-seven miles distant to the east in the line of strike. It starts at the
foot of Shakespeare's Cliff', about thirty feet above ordnance datum, and in the lower

chalk at a point about 160 feet above the Gault. The older rocks will probably be

--struck at that point at a depth of less than 1,000 feet probably very much less. It

must be noted that if the Calais section be repeated at Dover, and the chalk main-

tains its uniform thickness on both sides of the Channel, the latter boring starts at

a point 851 feet below the former in the rocks. On the other hand, the Gault at
Dover will probably be found thicker than at Calais, and the Wealden beds, absent
from Calais, may be expected at Dover. These, however, in Mr. Whitaker's

opinion, are of no considerable thickness.

     The probability that the coal measures will be struck in this district is rendered

--greater by the discovery of a mass of bituminous mineral in a fissure in the chalk

north of Dover, that has probably as Mr. Godwin Austen pointed out in his

--evidence before the Coal Commission been derived from the Coal-measures below.

By the kindness of the Council of the Geological Society, I have been allowed to

make a minute examination of Mr. Austen's specimens, and I find that the mineral

properly is a pitch, which has resulted from the distillation of coal.

     The interest attaching to this experimental boring is very great. If the Coal-
measures are proved, a discovery of vast importance will be made. If, on the other

hand, rocks older than the Carboniferous are struck, they will offer a basis for

further borings, which will ultimately result in the discovery of the hidden coal-

fields of South-eastern England, and cause as great an economic revolution in that
region as that which has been caused in France and Belgium by the discovery of

the coalfields underneath the Chalk.

                   By Sir J. William Dawson, C.M.G., F.B.S.

     Markings of various kinds on the surfaces of stratified rocks have been loosely-

referred to Algse or Fucoids under a great variety of names ; and when recently
652 BEPORT-- 1886.

the attempt was made in Europe more critically to define and classify these objects,
a great divergence of opinion developed itself, of which the recent memoirs of
Nathorst, Williamson, Saporta, and Delgado may be taken as examples.

     The author, acting on a suggestion of Sir 11. Owen, was enabled in 1862 and
1864, by the study of the footprints of the recent Limulus jiolyphemus, to show
that not merely the impressions known as Protichnites and Climactichnites, but also
the supposed fucoids of the genera Rusophycus, Arthrophycus, and Cruziana are

really tracks of Crustacea, and not improbably of Trilobites and Limuloids.' He

had subsequently applied similar explanations to a variety of other impressions
found on Palaeozoic rocks.' The object of the present paper was to illustrate by
a number of additional examples the same conclusions, and especially to support
the recent results of Nathorst and Williamson.

     Rusichniles, Arthi-ichniies, Chrossochorda, and Cruziana, with other forms of
so-called JBilobites, are closely allied to each other, and are explicable by reference
to the impressions left by the swimming and walking feet of Limulus, and by the
burrows of that animal. They pass into Protichnites by such forms as the P.
Davisii of Williamson, and Saerichnites of Billings, and Diplichnites of the author.
They are connected with the worm-tracks of the genus Nereites by specimens of
Arthrichnites, in which the central furrow becomes obsolete, and by the genus
Gyrichnites of "^^^liteaves.*

     The tuberculated impressions known as Phymatoderma and Caulet-pites may, as
Zeiller has shown, be made by the burrowing of the mole-cricket, and fine examples
occurring in the Clinton formation of Canada are probably the work of Crustacea.
It is probable, however, that some of the later forms referred to these genera are

really algae related to Cauleiya, or even branches of Conifers of the genus Brachy-
phyllum.

     Nereites and Planvlites are tracks and burrows of worms, with or without
marks of setae, and some of the markings referred to P(dccochorda, Palceophycus,

and Scolithus have their places here. Many examples highly illustrative of the
manner of formation of these impressions are afforded by tJanadian rocks.

     Branching forms referred to Licrophycus of Billings, and some of those referred
to Buthotrephis, Hall, as well as radiating markings referable to Scotolithus,
Gyrophyllites and Asterophycus, are explained by the branching burrows of worms
illustrated by Nathorst and the author. Astropolithon,oi \h& Canadian Cambrian,
seems to be something organic, but of what nature is uncertain.

     Rhabdichnites and JEophyton belong to impressions explicable by the trails of
drifting seaweeds, the tail-markings of Crustacea, and the ruts ploughed by bivalve

mollusks.

     Dendrophycus, Dictyolites, some species of Delesserites, Arisfophycus, and other
branching and frond-like forms, were shown to be referable to riil-marks, of which

many fine forms occur in the Carboniferous of Nova Scotia, and also on the recent
mud-fiata of the Bay of Fundj'.

     The genus Spirophyton, properly so called, is certainly of vegetable origin, but
many markings of water action, fin-marks, &c. have been confounded with these

so-called ' Cauda-galli fucoids.'

     On the other hand some species of Palceophycus, ButJioirephis and Spheno-
thallus were shown to be true algaj, by their forms and the evidence of organic
matter, and Haliserites, Barrandeina, and Nematojihycus were shown to include
plants of much higher organisation than the algae. With reference to the latter,
it was held that the form to which the name Prototaxites had been given was really

a land plant growing on the borders of the sea, and producing seeds fitted for

flotation. On the other hand, certain forms to which he had given the name
Nematoxylon were allied to algae in their structure, and may have been of aquatic

habit ; verj- perfectly preserved specimens of these last had been recently found, and
had thrown new light on their structure.

     The author proposed to apply to all these problematical plants, having a tissue
of vertical and horizontal tubes, the general name Nematophytece or Nematophyton.

     The paper referred to the history of opinion on these objects and the biblio-
graphy of the subject; but this, as well as detailed descriptions, are omitted in this

abstract.

     3. On BiloUtes. 5// Professor T. McKennt Hughes, ilf.^., jP.G.S.

     The author pointed out that the views of previous writers on this subject might
be grouped generally under two heads :

     1. One was that the fossils in question represent a solid organism, which had
been buried in the sand or mud, and had left only the cast of its body ; that the
organic matter had all disappeared and the form had been modified hj the various
changes which the rock had since undergone. Some believed that nereites, for
instance, was the actual cast of the body of a marine annelid allied to nereis, while
others considered that all such bilobites as Cruziana were the impressions of
portions of marine algae.

     2. Another view was that all the fossils such as those above mentioned were
tracks left by animals on 'the surface of the sand or mud, and filled by the next
flood with sand, which took the east of the depression.

     It had been observed by various previous authors that the bilobites were some-
times in relief on the upper side of the slab as it lay in place, and this was urged
as evidence that in some cases, at any rate, they represent solid cylindrical bodies
like the stems of some well-known sea-weeds.

    He had examined the typical sections in Nantffrancon, where the Ci-uziuna

semiplicata was the characteristic fossil, and found that it was always in relief on
the upper side of the slab (except where so compressed that the upper and lower
sides of the cylindrical body were both driven in, so as to give a double down-
curved surface). The side ornamented with the herring-bone pattern was the
upper side ; the lower was a smooth longitudinally furrowed groove.

    He had found somewhat similar tracks in beds of sandstone in the mountain

limestone in Westmoreland, where the tracks were in high relief on the upper side
of the slabs, and when this compressed cylindrical body was removed a smooth
shallow track was seen in what had been the surface of tbe sand. The ornamented
side was uppermost. The layers of sand, instead of thinning out against this ridge-
like body, were lifted over it without any appreciable diminution of thickness, so

as to appear, not so much as if they had been laid down over this cylindrical body,
when it was lying on a sandy surface, but rather as if they had been lifted so as

to form an arched tunnel by the protrusion of some solid body, such as a burrowing
animal, between the layers of previously deposited sand. There were different
patterns on successively overlying layers, as if the effect of continuous scooping
work was more apparent on the lower, and the periodic lift-forward of the animal's
body chiefly affected the upper layers. There were also holes at regular intervals
from the median groove of the bilobite passing up through two or three of the
superincumbent layers.

    He observed further that in the same beds there were plants with the car-

bonaceous matter still preserved : and from this he inferred that, had there been

any vegetable tissue around the bilobites, there was no reason why it should have

disappeared in that case only.

     On the whole, he arrived at the conclusion that the bilobites he exhibited were
neither vegetable remains nor the surface tracks of animals, but were the burrows
of animals which bored between the layers of sand, packing their tunnels behind
them with the sand excavated in front, and that at regular intervals they com-
municated with the surface by means of the holes observed passing throuo-h the

overlying layers. He considered that the observations of Albany Hancock on the

burrowing Crustacea at the mouth of the Tyne offered the best explanation of the
phenomena, and would extend his inferences.

4. Oil recent Researches amongst the Garhoniferous Plants of Halifax.

            By Professor W. C. Williamson, LL.I)., F.E.S.

At the Southport meeting of the British Association a small grant was made to

my friend, Mr. Cash, of Halifax, and myself, in aid of our exploration of the fossil

flora of the Lower Carboniferous strata of Halifax and the surrounding districts.

Circumstances over which we had no control prevented our reporting upon the
results of that grant ; but since there are important reasons why those results

should be recorded, I now bring them before the Association in the shape of a

communication instead of a Report.

The plants of the Halifax beds are much more exquisitely preserved than are

those of the Oldham beds of the same age. This fact has enabled us to throw

additional light upon the organisation of several of the plants obtained from the

Oldham deposits and previously described. Structures hitherto unobserved have

been detected, and others seen but obscurely have been made clear.

In the dominant group of the Lycopodiacese nothing has been discovered

requiring us to modify our previous views respecting these plants ; and it is grati-

fying to know that many of our co-workers on the European Continent have now
materially mitigated their opposition to those views. Thus, our French fjiends, who

have hitherto so determinately insisted upon the Gymnospermous character of all the

Sigillarise, have now advanced so far as to admit the Cryptogamic and Lycopodi-

--aceous character of the vertically grooved forms of that genus which really means
--most of our British forms of Sigillaria and we have not the slightest doubt but

Wethat the remaining forms will have to be surrendered to us in like manner.

now have under investigation three or four Lepidodendroid branches, which appear
to be new, and which are awaiting their turn of publication ; we have also obtained

much additional information respecting the Stigmarian roots of these arborescent

Lycopods, which will be embodied in a monograph about to appear in the forth-

coming volume of the Palreontographical Society.

Many new specimens of Calamite have been obtained, in each of which the

woody zone is invested by the characteristic bark previously described. They all,

without exception, confirm conclusions already announced, viz., that the longitudinal

and transverse grooves and constrictions seen in the common casts of the medullary

cavity of the Calamite, are entirely absent from the exterior of the cortex. Here

again some of our Continental friends, who have hitherto insisted upon the Gymno-

spermous affinities of some of the Calamites, have made an important concession to
our interpretation of these objects. M. Grand-Eury has now announced bis con-

viction that the plants which the French Palteo-botanists have hitherto included in

the genus Arthro2ntus are really the vascular zones of true Cryptogamic Calamites.

     Since this genus Arthropitus includes all our British specimens of which the

internal organisation is preserved, and since also the hypothesis of the Gymno-

spermous nature of the genus Arthropitus was chiefly based upon the discoveries

of M. Grand-Eury himself, his change of view seriously weakens the influence of

those who still cling to what we regard as erroneous opinions. All honour to M.

Grand-Eury for his courage in acting otherwise.

Closely associated with the Calamite is the strobilus known as Calamostachys

Binneana, upon which our researches have thrown fresh light. In the examples

previously figured from the Oldham beds tbe central axis of the spike of fructifica-

tion appeared to consist entirely of a mass of barred vessels. But our Halifax

specimens have enabled us to determine that this axis consists of a solid central

medulla composed of parenchyma, the cells of which are somewhat elongated

vertically, and which is enclosed more or less completely in a thin cylinder of

barred and spiral vessels ; the bands of these vessels are certainly much thicker
Wealong certain vertical lines than in the intermediate spaces.
                                                                    have also

obtained a fresh example of the remarkable heterosporous form of Calamostachys

published in Part XII. of the 'Organisation of the Fossil Plants of tlie Coal-

measures,' and which latter example previously constituted the only known speci-

men of a Calamitinean plant with the bisexual fructification. This second

example seems to establish clearly the distinctness of this fructification from that
                                                                                                     TE.U^SACTIONS OF SECTION C.  655

of the allied Calamostacbys Binneana ; and I now propose that it should he

known as Oalamostachys Casheana, after my energetic colleague, Mr. William

Cash, of Halifax.

We have also ohtained some additional knowledge respecting the elegant little
Westem known as Kaloxylon Hookeri.
                                                                                                     have now not only obtained specimens in

which each of the six radiating wedges of vascular tissue has a distinct crescent of

phloem on its periphery, hut we also find that the curious cortex enclosed within

the well-defined and thick epiderm -was abundantly intermingled with small verti-

cally elongated canals or lacunoe. Besides this, Plalifax has furnished numerous

specimens which we were at first inclined to regard as a distinct species of Kaloxylon,
since, in it, the radial vascular exogenous wedges were much less fully developed
than is the case with the numerous examples previously figured from the Oldham
coals. But we have now got reason for thinking that most of these new specimens,

at least, are roots of Kaloxylon Hookeri, with zylem bundles, externally to which
a centrifugal exogenous zone was developed in some examples, though more feebly
than was the case in the aerial stems. Some of these specimens of roots are

abundantly surrounded by smaller rootlets.

   A still more valuable discovery will be laid before the Botanical Section at tbis

meeting of the Association. It is a new species of Heterangium, closely resembling

in many respects the Heterangium Grievi, from Burntisland, described in one of

the earlier parts of ' The Organisation of the Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures.'

But it is clearly distinguished from that plant, not only by the possession of a mar-

vellously developed phloem or bast zone traversed by magnificent phloem-rays, but

by other peculiarities in the structure of its true cortex. To this important plant

the name of Heterangium Tiliteoides will be given.
    Besides the objects to which we have thus specially called your attention, we

have obtained numerous fragments of plants, which, as stray leaves, stems, and

fruits found floating upon the wide ocean, tell of an unknown flora hidden in some

uninvestigated corner of the earth and suggest that there are yet unknown plants con-

cealed within the coal-mines of Yorkshire and Lancashire. In former years similar

fragments have guided our researches, and in several instances we have been

rewarded by the discovery of their true affinities ; but many remain respecting
which we know nothing beyond their existence. They show us, however, that we
must continue our labours until we have unearthed their history, whilst the fact
that similar waifs and strays of former years now possess recognised names and

habitations stimulates us to perseverance.

   A word or two in conclusion about the fine specimens of Stigmaria, a notice

of which was brought before this Section by Mr. Adamson on Friday last,^

and which will be described in my memoir on Stigmaria ficoides now passing

through the press. This specimen settles, most conclusively, several questions of

fact respecting which even some of our German friends appear to be still in doubt,

whilst it is equally conclusive against some most extraordinary views respecting

Stigmaria promulgated by M. Renault, of Paris. The specimen itself is the finest

of its kind hitherto obtained in any part of the world. It demonstrates that

Stigmaria is a root, and not a rhizome that four primary roots radiate from the
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

divisions take place ; thenceforth the undivided roots extend to considerable though

to by some Continental authors as being something wholly difierent from the ordinary

Stigmarian roots.

 5. Note on the recent Earthquake in the United States, inchiding a tele-
       graphic dispatch from Major Poivell, Director of the United States

      Geological Survey} By "W. Topley, F.G.S., Assoc. Inst. C.E., Geological

       Survey of England.

       This paper described the effects of the earthquake at Charleston, which took
 place on the evening of August 31, so far as they could be gathered from telegrams
 received to date. The most important of these was one kindly sent by Major
 Powell, the Director of the United States Geological Survey, in reply to inquiries
 cabled by the author : this telegram is printed in full below, and the information
 therein contained need not he given here.

       Mr. Topley observed that during the last ten days there had been earthquake

 disturbances over a very wide area of the earth's surface. On the night of Friday,
 August 27, there were shocks all over Greece and in a smaller degree all over the
 east Mediterranean area. This earthquake wave apparently travelled from west to

 east. It was felt at Malta, Calabria, and Naples, and thence it travelled eastwards
 as far as Alexandria. It did not appear to have been felt west of southern Italy,
 probably because its westward area of propagation was there beneath the sea.
 Possibly it was only a coincidence, but if so a very curious one, that the earliest
 important earthquake disturbauces in the United States were on Thursday, the 27th,
 and Friday, the 28th, but there had been slight premonitory shocks for two or three
 days before. The principal shock was that of Tuesday night, August 31. This had,
 however, been succeeded by shocks, fortunately of less intensity, which had been felt
 over a still wider area. As late as Sunday night there were shocks at Charleston.

An important point in Major Powell's despatch was the evidence of the rapid trans-

 mission of the main earthquake wave. According to the telegram it travelled over
 the 900,000 square miles at from 2.5 to 65 miles per minute ; but there might be
 some error in the telegram here, as by comparing the times given in the telegram

with the distances on a map he (Mr. Toplej-) found that the velocity varied from

--36 to 140 miles per minute. [The greatest velocities since ascertained are : To

 Toronto, 170 miles per minute to Washington, 148 miles.] There did not seem
                                                                                                                                                                            ;

to be any relation between the intensity and time and the surface distance from the
area of origin. This last, indeed, they would not have expected to find. They would
rather have looked for rapid transmission along certain lines or through certain
rock masses. The last important earthquake in the eastern United States, that on
August 10, 1884, was carefully investigated by Professor Carvill Lewis. This was
found to range along the eastern side of the Appalachian Mountains, nearly along
the line where the old earth-movements had been greatest. The area most affected
by the recent earthquake was a vast plain of Tertiary and Cretaceous rocks. The

older rocks underlay these at unknown depths. [At least 2,000 feet, and may be
as much as one mile,] It might perhaps be fouud that the transmission of the

shock to distant points had depended in part upon the range of the harder and
older rocks beneath. This was very evidently the case with the East Anglian earth-
quake. In this earthquake the great structural damage was confined to a small
area. The distant points at which it was felt were in most cases upon or near to
the exposure of the Palaeozoic rocks, and Birmingham was one of these distant points.
In other cases earthquakes were known to be related to lines of fault. Mr. M'Gee
had been sent by Major Powell to investigate the effects of the earthquake at
Charleston, and he found the local evidence, such as the direction of the fissures,
contradictory and difficult of explanation. They need uot wonder, therefore, at
being yet unable to understand the wider question connected with its range and trans'-
mission. The local phenomena were in part described in Major Powell's telegram.
Fissures had been opened in the ground, some of which ranged north and south,

others east and west. From these fissures mud and sand were ejected. Several

telegrams spoke of stones falling from the air, and, although there was plainly
much exaggeration in these accounts, it was possible that some stones were ejected

the United States Geological Survey) are inserted within brackets.

far into the air and subsequently fell to the o^round. One interesting point in con-

nection with earthquakes was the influence they had on wells and springs, and in

these respects the American earthquake had haci important results. Water now

stood where none occurred before, and in certain places springs had been dried.

The gas wells at Pittsburg were affected. It was too early yet to theorise on this

side of the Atlantic, but at present the earthquake seemed best explained by

referring it to some widely acting seismic disturbance, indications of which were

previously given by the geysers of the Yellowstone and by premonitory earthquakes

in South Carolina. It would probably be found, however, that its range and local

intensity had been controlled by the distribution of the rock masses, or by old lines

of earth movement and earth weakness.

particular Professors Green and Prestwich, draws attention to two physical con-
siderations of some importance, which appear to have been overlooked in the

discussion of the subject.

      1. In the case of a homogeneous sphere of uniform conductivity throughout, a
little consideration of the geometry of the sphere shows us that heat proceeding hj
conduction from the centre to the circumference must distribute itself through
spaces which increase in area by the square of the distance from the centre, that
the ' law of inverse squares ' in fact applies here to the intensity (temperature) of

heat so transmitted. It follows from this that if we take r = the radius of such a
sphere, and d = the distance of any point within the sphere from the centre, the

gradients of the curve for the increase of temperature with depth will be according
to the formula

                                                     ir-d)^

the temperature increasing as the squares of the depths.

    of course in tlie case of the earth's sphere there are many modifying circum-

stances, each aflecting the value of one or other of the factors of the formula

                      n'

which represents the quantity (Q) of heat which passes through a homogeneous

plate of an area =A, a thickness =n, with opposite faces at constant temperatures

V.-, and ijj in the time (t), the coefficient of conductivity of the material being

represented by K.

   --Among such modifying circumstances may be mentioned :

(1) Variations in the material of rock-bodies, variations in the actual

temperatures of the same rock, variations in the orientation of' the

crystalline architecture of many rocks, occurrence of mineral-veins and

lodes as good conductors, all affecting the value of K.

(2) Variations in the capacity for heat of different rock-materials.

(3) The unequal distribution of underground water.
(4) The presence, in places, of air in the cavernous spaces of many rocks.
(5) The mean temperature of the superficial strata as determined by latitude,

together with surface-conditions (such as extensive forests, sandy

deserts, snowfields and glaciers, dry land or ocean bed), all aflecting the

value of the term v^ in the formula, in every case influencing, and in

            some preventing altogether, radiation at the surface.

When all these conditions are considered there would still, however, appear to

be a considerable margin for increase, as deduced from the hypothetical case, even
though in the case of the earth the problem is still more complicated by the vary-

ing heat-producing causes in operation (pressure, crushing, friction, chemical action)

throughout the mass.

2. The physical value which we attach to the terms ' weight ' and ' gravity

leads, with a little reflection, to the recognition of the fact that the same mass of

matter is not as heavy (and therefore exerts less pressure) within the mass of the

earth as at the exterior, since it is acted upon by the two opposite attractions of
the mass ' above ' and the mass ' below ' it. The latter diminishing, and the former

increasing with depth, the weight of the same mass of matter diminishes as it is

m_ade_ to approach the centre of gravity of the earth ; and when that coincides

with its own centre of gTa^ity the body is evidently altogether without weight.

_ The determination of the curves which shall accurately represent the above two

principles requires the application of advanced mathematics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                but it  is not difficult
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

to see that the curve of temperatures would have steep gradients for increase, and

the curve of pressures a less steep gradient for decrease, so that the two curves

(starting from the same origin) would intersect, and, in so doing, indicate realisable

conditions necessary for liquefaction at varying depths.

                         Bij the Rev. A. Ieving, B.Sc, B.A., F.G.S.

     The main object of this paper is to draw more attention than is usually given
to the physical and chemical side of metamorphic phenomena. As a step towards
the possible fixing of a more definite nomenclature for metamorphism, it is pro-
posed to exclude from it all such phenomena as the alterations which may arise
in the character of a rock from the removal in solution (as in dolomitisation of some
limestones), or the addition by infiltration (as in amygdaloids) of a mineral.

     All cases of true metamorphism may be included under the two heads of (i.)

Metatropy, (ii.) Paramorphism.

  --(i.) Metatropy. This term has been suggested by its sister-word ' allotropy,' which

is applied in chemistry to those modifications which one and the same chemical

(elementary) body may assume by changes in its jjhysical properties. Using

the word ' metatropy ' with rather more latitude, it is proposed to include under
this head such rock-changes as («) the conversion of a limestone into a crystalUne

marble, (6) the conversion of grauwacke into hornstone or porcellanite, (c) the
conversion of seam-coal into anthracite, and that into graphite, (d) the conversion

of anhydrite into gypsum, together with some other cases in which minerals con-

stituting rock-masses (a) acquire a crystalline form by taking up water, or (/3) have
their crystalline form altered (polymorphism) by a change in their proportion of

water of crystallisation or by crj-stallisation at different temperatures {e.ff., car-

bonates of lime and magnesia). ' Devitrification ' of glassy rocks (e.ff., tachylite,

--obsidian) at once the most interesting and most obscure of metatropic changes

is believed by the author, from the consideration of a large number of chemical facts

known in connection vdth the modifications of such bodies as sulphur, phosphorus,

arsenic, silica, borax, metaphosphoric acid, sodium metaphosphate (all of which

occur in the glassy or vitreous modification) to consist essentially of a chmiffe in

molecular structure. Further this change appears to proceed, in all cases, by the

gradual building-up of more stable and more complex molecules out of the less

stable and less complex molecules, of which the body appears to be made up in

the vitreous condition ; and this change the author conceives to be connected with
the loss of latent heat of vitrification, to which a large number of facts connected

with the behaviour of ithe above-named bodies, as well as those arrived at from

recent researches into the properties of artificial glasses, seem to point. M.
Daubree's researches are referred to as showing how heat and pressure combined

may, by increasing enormously the solvent action of water, aid in the process.
--A(ii.) Paramorphism.
                              term to include all those instances of metamorphism

which consist essentially of the decomposition to any extent of the original mineral-

constituents of a rock with the production of new minerals of a difl'erent chemical

composition within the rock.  Such  changes may take place  in two ways                                                                (1) in
                                                                                                                                    ;

the dry way, when reactions between contiguous minerals are set up by their being

brought into a state of fusion ·, (2) in the wet way (probably by far the more
common) from the presence of interstitial water, acting, at high temperatures and

pressures (a) as a direct solvent, (6) indirectly by the transfer of mineral matter

by percolation through the rock-mass, a process immensely facilitated by crushing,

and favoured by the easy access of water along junction-planes ; the true explana-

tion, perhaps, of many of the known instances of («) the development of new

minerals in ' contact metamorphism ' {e.y., in the hornstones of the Hartz and in

the Triassic limestones of the Predazzo region), {b) the apparent transition of true

crystalline schists into granite. Such a theory is a very diflerent thing from the

' hydvochemical theory ' of Bischof and of those who have followed him.

Chemistry, and especially thermal chemistry, enables us to make such dediic-

tions from tlie nebular hypothesis as to throw great light upon the order of succession

in the kinds of deposits of which the earth's crust has been built up, and points to

the first oxidation of hydrogen at very high temperatures, but under an enormous

atmospheric pressure, as a fact which must have occurred at a very early stage
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and this the author regards as the main factor in the development of those primary

characters of the Archsean gneisses and schists (though other characters have been

subsequently induced) which distinguish them, on the one hand from the highly

siliceous materials which were previously concentrated in a state of dry fusion, and

on the other from all the later formations, beginning with the Silurian, which have

the character of ordinary aqueous deposits (though often subsequently metamor-

phosed in various ways and degrees) in true aqueous basins, and under atmospheric

conditions approximating to those which prevail at the present time. The occur-

rence within the crust of conditions, effectively the same as those which are regarded

as having been universal at the earth's surface in Archaean times, as the result of the

combined action of pressure, crushing, friction (shearing and sliding), and super-

heated water, is fully recognised ; but these are regarded as exceptional local develop-

ments of the conditions necessary to produce the highest degrees of metamorphism.

Tangential pressure, arising from contraction of the crust, is regarded as the

primary cause of these local developments, as well as of less marked phases of

* regional metamorphism' of later periods. The frequent and extensive unconformity

observable between the Archaean and the Silurian (and younger) formations, as

well as the occurrence in them (down even to the Cambrian) of rolled and worn

rocks impressed upon theiu prior to their deposition in their present habitat, are

10. On the Influence of Axial Rotation of the Earth on the Interior of its
                          Crust. By Johx Gunn, F.G.S.

The autlior stated that the effect produced by axial rotation upon the exterior

surface of the earth in its primitive heated condition was well known, but the effect

upon    the  interior  crust  had  been  overlooked                                                      that  it is incumbent upon him to
                                                                                                      ;

prove that the condition of the earth beneath the exterior crust is such as to render

axial rotation not merely a probable, but an indisputable agent of pressure upon

the surrounding crust.

    He proves that the crust is pliable, and that fluids exist beneath it at a depth

of a few miles, not exceeding twenty, by the opinions of the most eminent scientists,

and especially of Professor Prestwich, whom he quotes freely from, and refers to

his able treatise, published in the * Proceedings of the Royal Society,' on the Agency

of "Water in Volcanic Eruptions, with Observations on the Thickness of the Earth's

Crust.

The author states that an abundance of facts prove the existence of such a fluid

as would be subject to axial rotation, which, being 7iil at the centre of the globe,

increases in power and velocity as it approaches the surface.
     The question arises as to whether the power of rotation, which he humbly sub-

mits must exist, is not modified, and perhaps overcome, bj' centripetal gravitation.

He refers, as a proof of the reality of its agency, to its coincidence with seismology.

Dim-nal rotation answers to the mildest form of seismology observed at Japan

annual and more extended rotations answer to the intermittent rumbling and

shocks of earthquakes throughout the world precessional perihelionic and the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

most extended revolutions allowed by astronomers answer to the changes induced

by the inclination of the axis of the earth.
    The author alluded to the tendency to revolve noticed by Mr. White and

others in some buildings at Colchester during the shock lately experienced there

as indicative of rotating power ; also to the sequence and succession of earthquakes

observed by Professor Sedgwick as travelling generally from east to west, and
expressed his extreme diffidence in his own opinions, which nevertheless he was

desirous to publish, as possibly there might be some reality in the effect he attri-

buted to the axial rotation of the earth, notwithstanding it had been overlooked by

writers on the subject.

    Mr. Gunn is of opinion that the force of internal rotation, combined with that

of earthquakes, has a bearing upon the ingenious theory of Dr. I. Evans, that the

shiftily of portions of the earth's crust may be due to it ; also that many of the

contortions of the Drift seen at Cromer, in Norfolk, and in the Eifel district, and

at Corfu and many other places, are due to the same cause.

1. Notes on some of the Problems now being investigated hy the Officers of
      the Geological S^irvey in the North of Ireland, chiefly in Co. Donegal.

    By Professor E. Hull, LL.B., F.B.8.

     The author stated that the investigations of the Survey were confined to the
counties of Antrim and Donegal ; and, restricting his observations to the latter, he
said the chief problem was whether or not there were two great series of meta-
morphic rocks unconformable to each other, the older referable to the Archaean
age, the newer to the Lower Silurian.

     Some reference was made to the great faults and foldings of these beds, which
               ----

were stated to range generally in N.N.E. and S.S.W. lines. It was considered that

--the granites might belong to at least two periods the intrusiye being distinct both

in age and structure from the metamorphic granite and gneiss. Other points
noticed were the occurrence of numerous basaltic dykes, probably of Tertiary age,
traversing the gneissose rocks ; and the mai-ginal representatives of the Lo'Nyer

Carboniferous period.

               2. Notes on the Crystalline Schists of Ireland.

                   By C. Callaway, I).8c., M.A., F.G.S.

    The author gives a summary of results obtained by a preliminary survey of the

--principal areas of Irish metamorphic rocks, viz.

1. Donegal, including parts of the adjacent counties of Londonderry and

Tyrone.

2. Connemara, extending the term to cover the region lying between Westport,

CO. Mayo, and the granitic mass west of the town of Galwaj-.

3. The south-eastern corner of the county of Wexford.

In each of these areas the following facts were observed :

A(«) series of hypometamorphic rocks, consisting typically of fine-grained

Aschists, altered grits, and quartzites.  clastic structure is more or less distinct

in the three areas, but is least evident in Connemara.

   A(b) group of highly crystalline schists, displaying no trace of an original

sedimentary origin, dipping as if it passed below the hypometamorphic rocks. At

Wexford there are true gneisses. In Connemara the rocks are less felspathic, the

chief types being quartzose gneiss, quartz-schist, mica-schist, hornblende-schist,

quartzite, and crystalline limestone. This description will also apply to Donegal.

(c) Granite, underlying {b), and in Connemara and Donegal clearly intrusive.

The author urges that this analogy is not due to the metamorphic action of the

granite ; for

1. The mineral characters apparent in the scliists adjacent to the granite are

uniformly distributed through the lower series from bottom to top.

2. The evidence collected is hostile to the view that this lower series ever

graduates into the upper.

It is concluded that the balance of proof is in favour of the Archaean age of the

bulk of the Irish schists.

1. In the AVexford district the schists are thrown against Cambrian and

Ordovician rocks by faults, and do not pass into them in the localities alleged by

the Irish Survey.

2. In Connemara conglomerates of Llandovery age contain large rounded frag-

ments, not only of the older schistose series, but also of its intrusive igneous rocks.

3. In the Ulster region the metamorphic area is separated from the Ordovician

rocks of Pomeroy by a ridge of granite and diorite three miles in breadth.

The lithological analogies between the Irish schists and the Archsean rocks

of Anglesey and other British metamorphic districts are also of weight in the

argument.

                             3. The Ordovician Kochs of Shropshire.

                     By Professor C. Lapworth, LL.D., F.G.S.

     In this paper the author gave a brief review of the history of discovery and
opinion respecting the Lower Palteozoic rocks of Wales and the west of England,
and pointed out that the results developed of late years by British and foreign
geologists made it clearly evident that Murchison's Silurian system, as defined in
the later editions of ' Siluria,' was in reality composed of three distinct geological
systems, and that of these three the only one which belonged to him by right of
discovery and correct description was the so-called Upper Silurian, which was
therefore the only true Silurian System. The lowest known fossiliferous system
(the Primordial Silurian of Barrande) was not discovered by Murchison, but by

Sedgwick, who regarded it as the lower half of his own Cambrian System, and it
                     --
                          ·

662 EEPORT-- 1886.

ouglit, as a matter of justice and convenience, to retain that name only. The inter-

mediate system (claimed as Lower iSilurian by jMurcliison, and as Upper Cambrian

by Sedgwick) belonged to neither, for its life-types are wholly distinct from those

of the true Cambrian below and of the true Silurian above. This distinction must

be recognised by a distinct title. The Silurian was named by Murchison after the
ancient British tribe of the Silm-es, who inhabited South Wales and Central Shrop-

shire, where its rocks attain their fullest development. The rocks of the disputed

--intermediate system, however, are most fully developed in North Wales the land

of the equally ancient tribe of the Ordovices. The author had proposed, in 1879,

that this middle system should be entitled the Ordovician System, after this old

tribe, and the name is gradually coming into use among geologists.

During the last few years the sequence and fossils of the Ordovician strata of

Shropshire have been studied in detail by the author ; and their igneous rocks, both

Ainterbedded and intrusive, have been worked out by Mr. W. Watts.  general

summary of his own conclusions was communicated by the author, and illustrated

by maps, sections, and lists of characteristic fossils.

Ordovician strata occur in two distinct districts in Shropshire, in the district of

Shelve and Corndon, to the west of the Longmynd, and in the Caradoc district, to

the east of that range. In both districts these strata are overlain imcouformably

by the basement beds of the Silurian, which rest trau.sgressively upon every zone

of the Ordovician i]i turn.

     In the Shelve and Corndon district, the Ordovician rocks repose at once upon the
highest known strata of the local Cambrian, and are arranged in the foUowiDg

--(ascending) order :

  --Shelve Seeies

(«) Stiper Groiij), consisting of tlie well-known Stiper quartzites and their

associated strata.

     (6) Ladyivell Group, composed of the dark shales and flagstones of Mytton,
Ladywell, and Hyssington, with Dk-Jwyi-frptida and Otjyyia Selwynii, Sec.

  --(c) Stapeley Volcanic Group Andesitic lavas, ashes, and interbedded shales.
  --Meadowtown Sekies

(a) Weston Group of Grits, flagstones, and dark .shales.

(b) Middleton Group, composed of dark shales with Didy. Murchisoni, and cal-

careous flagstones with Oyyyia Buchii and Ascipkus tyrannus.

(e) Sorrinyton Group of intensely black shales with Ccmoyrdptus and Lepto-

graptus.

  --Chirbtjet Seeies

(«) Aldress Group, composed of the Spy If'ood calcareous yrit, and the Aldress

Graptolithic shale.

(h) Marrinyton Group, including the Hayley volcanic ashes and shales, and the

Whittery ashes and overlying shales.

The only Ordovician roclis occurring east of the Longmynd are those forming

the local Caradoc Series of the author (the Caradoc formation of geologists). The

basement beds of this series rest unconformably upon all the older rocks of the district
- -upon the so-called Uriconian, Longmyndian, Wrekin quartzite, and Shineton shales

--and its component zones are each covered up unconformably in turn by the

basement beds of the Silurian. This isolated Ordovician series is composed of the

following members :

  --C.VR.iDoc Series

(a) Hoar lidye conglomerate, grits, and limestone.

(6) Harnaye Shales.

(e) Cliatuall Sandstone.

(d) Lonydlle Flays.

(e) Onny, or Trinucleus Shales.

     The Shelve series answers generally io the strata commonly designated Arenig;
the Meadowtown series includes the typical members of Murchison's Llandeilo; and

the Chirburv and Caradoc series correspond broadly to Sedgwick's Bala formation

of North Wales.

and zones were given, and it was shown how naturally the physical and palreonto-

logical sequence agrees with that of the corresponding Ordovician rocks of Britain
and Europe. The peculiar physical conditions of the Shropsliire area in Ordovician
times, as indicated by the very different lithological characters of the strata upon

the opposite sides of the Longmynd, was pointed out; the evidences for the geo-
logical horizons and relationships of the volcanic rocks indicated in outline, and the
known facts respecting the folding and faulting, and pre-Silurian erosion of the

Ordovician rocks briefly referred to. In conclusion, it was pointed out that the
clearness and simplicity of the sequence, and the highly fossiliferous nature of its

strata, render it tolerably certain that this Shropshire succession will form the
general standard to which all other British Ordovician strata must ultimately be

referred,

               By Professor T. M'Kexnt Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.

     The author begins by describing some sections in the Silurian rocks of North

Wales. Some of them are in the lower part, some in higher beds. He gives lists
of fossils from the various horizons in each. He then, by means of these and by

what he calls syntelism, that is, the occurrence of similar sequences of beds of
the same characters, lithological or other, points out the corresponding parts of the

various sections described.

    He then does the same for the Silurian of the eastern borders of the Lake

district, and, having in this manner constructed a vertical section of each, compares
the two districts and shows that there is an identical series in each, with all the
important zones of one represented in the other, except that in the part of North
Wales which he has worked out he has not yet detected beds as high as the
newer part of the series in the Lake district.

5. Notes on some Sections in the Arenig Series of Nortli Wales and the Lal-e

          District. By Professor T. M'Kennt HriGHES, M.A., F.G.S.

In this paper the author describes a number of sections across the Arenio-

series in different parts of England and Wales, and endeavours to explain some

apparent discrepancies in what is generally a remarkably constant set of beds.

lie starts with the Portmadoc section, where he considers that the chief differ-

ences of opinion have arisen from mistakes in the explanation of the geological

structure of the district, especially from the wrong identification of some grit bands

on opposite sides of important faults.

Following the series to the north he shows that, although they vary in thick-

ness, the pruicipal zones are still represented  near  Carnarvon                                             and, discussing  the
                                                                                                          ;

question of the unconformity of these beds on the Lower Cambrian, he points out

that the Lower Cambrian rocks are seen to vary so much both in character and

thickness within short distances in the neighbourhood of the existing outcrop of the

Archrean that any argument founded upon their thinning-out or their different

texture must be received with distrust in an area where thej are known to have

been deposited on the flanks of mountain ranges of Pre-Cambrian age.

    He then describes some localities in the Lake district where the occurrence of

the same zones has been determined, and explains by overlap, rather than un-

conformity, the difficulties, palreontological and stratigraphical, which have arisen

in the interpretation of those areas.

     The following gives the results of further work, the beds being enumerated in

ascending order :

     1 Bala beds = zone of Dicellograptus anceps (Nich.), containing besides this fossil
T)iplograptus cf. pristis (His.), Trinucleus seticornis (His.), Dindymene ornata

(Linn. ?), Cylele Loveni, (Linn.), &c.

     These beds show resemblances to Swedish Trinucleus shales.
     2. Stockdale Shales. Beds of this age are a conglomerate, succeeded by a few
inches of leaden blue shales, and four inches of calcareous rock with Phacojis
elegans, &c. The supposed pale shales formerly described are weathered beds of

the next series.

    3. Lower Coniston Flags, zone of Monogrnjytus priodo7i, with M. personatus

(Tullb. ?), and Retiolites Geinitzianus (Barr.)
      4. Austzvick Pits, apparently unfossiliferous.
     5. Upper Coniston Flags, seen at Studrigg, and in Arco wood. Combes, and

Dryrigg quarries. Zone of Monograptus colomis (Barr.) contains also M. bohemicus,
(Barr.) and M. Rwmeri (Barr.), with numerous other fossils.

    The succession is quite similar to that in the Lake District and elsewhere, but
the Birkhill graptolitic fauna is entirely absent, and the conglomerate and Phacops

elegans zone perhaps represent only the upper part of the Stockdale shales (Pale

slates).

         7. Note on a Bed of Bed Chalk in the Lower Chalk of Suffolk.^
                       Bg A. J. Jukes-Bkowne, B.A., F.G.S.

     The section exposing this stratum was discovered during an excursion made

last June by Mr. W. Hill, F.G.S. , and the author. It occurs in a quarry near
West Bow Ferr}-, about two miles west of Mildenliall ; here a band of red marly

chalk is seen near the entrance, dipping westward at a low angle, but soon
becoming horizontal and running along the whole face of the quarry.

     As seen in the centre of the quarry, the band consists of marly chalk, which is

brick red at the top, pink in the middle, with a base of grey marly chalk containing
bard lumps or nodules ; the whole being about 5 feet thick, and resting on a bed of
hard nodular grey chalk, below which alternating beds of hard and softer grey
chalk are seen for 14 feet.

     The quarry lies between the outcrops of the Totternhoe Stone and the Melbourn
Bock, and is opened in a shallow synclinal trough, so that there must be a second
outcrop with an easterly dip along a line nearer to Mildenhall, but of this no
indication was found. The horizon of the red band is considered to be about the
centre of the zone of Holaster subglubosus, and to be at least 100 feet above the base
of the chalk marl. It is clear, therefore, that it has no connection whatever with
the red rock which forms the base of the chalk at Hunstanton and in Lincolnshire.

     It is well known, however, that the Lower Chalk of Lincolnshire contains two
 other bands of red chalk, and the author's examination of this district for the
Geological Survey enables him to compare the Suflblk and Lincolnshire sections in

detail. The West Bow bed closely resembles the lower of the two red bands which

are seen in the quarries near Louth, and as this occurs very nearly on the same
horizon, ho has little hesitation in correlating them with one another as homotaxial

beds, though they may not be identical, because they do not appear to be con-

tinuous across the intervening space in Norfolk and Lincolnshire.

     No other exposure of this red chalk was found in Suffolk, and in the north of

that county the whole of the Lower Chalk lies beneath the Fens. It is brought up
 again by a fault on the north side of the Brandon Biver, and the outcrop of the
same red chalk was seen in tiie bank of a dry pond at Feltwell St. Mary, in
 Norfolk, so that the band is in all probabilitv continuous between Mildenhall and

 Feltwell.

                              By C. Le Neye Foster, B.Sc.

     Manganese ore is now being worked in tlie Cambrian rocks at several places
near Barmouth and Harlech. It occurs in the form of a bed varying from a few
inches to 4 feet in thickness ; the average thickness is 18 inches to 2 feet. The

undecomposed ore contains the manganese in the form of carbonate, with a small
proportion of silicate ; but at the outcrop it is changed into a hydrated black oxide.
Some of the outcrops of the manganese bed are erroneously marked on the geological

survey maps as mineral veins, though Sir Andrew Ramsay was of opinion that
the deposits were not true lodes. Recent workings show plainly that the deposits

are truly stratified beds, or possibly various outcrops of one and the same bed,
extending over a considerable area.

     The ore contains from 20 to 35 per cent, of metallic manganese, and is de-
spatched to Flintshire and Lancashire for the manufacture of ferro-manganese.
The new Merionethshire mines are the first instance of workings for carbonate of
manganese in the British Isles.

The basalt of Rowley Regis appears at the surface as an irregular, roughly trian-

gular mass, having the base (rather more than one mUe and a half wide) towards

the north, and with a length of about two miles and a quarter. Its thickness varies

Colliery it was about 300 feet thick. The rock also varies much in structure ; it is

divided by layers of ' rotch,' or decomposed basalt ; the lower beds of the solid rock

are fine-grained, those above are often more coarsely crystalline.

                               2. On the Mineral District of Western Shropshire.
                                              By C. J. Woodward, B.Sc.

The minerals of Western Shropshire occur in the Llandeilo Flags, which, as

will be seen by reference to the ordnance map, occupy a patch of country, of a

somewhat pear-shaped section, the base of which is to the south-west, and the

narrow portion to the north-east. In the flags occur patches of the so-called green-

stone of the survey, and there are numerous bands of felspathic ash, the outcrop

of which has a general direction of north-east and south-west. The mineral lodes

run generally east and west, in many cases crossing the felspathic bands.
    Many mines have been opened in the district, but at the present time only three

are worked, viz.. Roman Gravels,                         Snailbeach, and  Wotherton                                               the last named  is a
                                                                                                                               ;

barytes mine, and the two former are lead mines. Some years ago, in one of the

levels of Snailbeach mine, were found extremely fine rhombs of violet and pink calcite,

with brilliant crystals of quartz, blende, galena, and pyrites. These fine showy crys-

tals are now scarce, but some examples are preserved in the office of the mine. The

galena commonly shows faces of the octahedron and cube, and occurs, or did occur, in

masses of some hundredweights. The Roman Gravels mine yields galena and

blende, but principally in the massive form. At some of the disused mines are to

be found fine crystals of blende, not only of the usual dark colour, but also in
666 BEPOET-- 1886.

small crystals of an orange Yed, and still more rarely of a light yellow colour,

Barytes occurs somewhat plentifully at Snailbeach, and AMtlierite is also met with.

     The vein of barytes at Wotherton has been worked for sixty years. Mr. \V.

--Yelland, who had charge of the mine a few j-ears ago, has supplied me with the

following particulars : The lode is in some places upwards of twenty feet wide,

and is divided into two parts by a vein of greenstone, technically termed a ' horse '

or rider. The rider is traversed by narrow bands of barytes. In some parts of the
Alode the rider disappears altogether, or is very narrow.
                                                           boss of greenstone pro-

jects from the foot wall, and from this issue bands of stone traversing the lode in

an oblique direction, until they come in contact with the hanging wall.

Cavities containing crystals occur in the lode, the cavities being filled with fine

clay of a bluish tint. Proceeding from one of the cavities, which was carefully

examined, were two thin fissures, also containing clay, and fi'om which on tapping

water ran out. The crystals j nst referred to by Mr. Yelland are particularly clear,
and exhibit many crystallographie forms, Mr. H. p. Miers, of the British

Museum, has examined these crystals (' Nature,' xxix. p. 29), and notes the follow-

ing forms : 101, 012, 110, 014, Oil, 100, 010, 001, 412, 212, 111, 232, 4-32, 214, 112,

034, besides two doubtful planes of the complicated symbols 15.1.15 and 19.1.18.

Specimens illustrating the author's remarks were lent by Messrs. Waters and

Son, of Shrewsbury, by jMr. Dennis, Managing Director of the Snailbeach Mine,

and also by Mr. Job, of the same mine. These, together with others sent by Mr.

Jasper Moore, M.P., have been placed in the Natural History Room of the Exhi-

bition for examination.

           3. The Anorthosite EocJcs of Canada. Bij Frank D. Adams.

     This series of rocks has also been called the Upper Laurentian or Norian series.
The name anorthosite is perhaps preferable, as it refers to their distinguishing
characteristic as compared with the orthoclase rocks of tlie Lower Laurentian, viz,
the predominance in them of plagioclase or anorthose felspar. These rocks form
detached areas in the great Laurentian districts, and bear a strong resemblance in
part to the gabros and gabrodiorites of Scandinavia, and in part to the labradorite
rock of the same country. It is, however, by no means certain that the rocks of

the two countries are of the same age. At least nine of these areas are now
known to exist in Canada, and there is also one in the State of New York. In

addition to plagioclase, which generally predominates largely, these rocks contain
rhombic and monoclinic pyroxenes (including augite, diallage, hypersthene, and
probably enstatite), olivine, magnesia, mica, spinel (including both pleonaste and
picotite), garnet, iron ores, pyrite, and apatite. Orthoclase is seldom or never
found, except in veins cutting the anorthosite. Tlie hornblende, mica, and py-
roxenes are intimately associated and often intergrown, all of them sometimes
being found in the same thin section. Garnet occurs sparingly, and generally near

the contact of the anorthosite with the gneiss. When the olivine comes against

plagioclase it is always bounded by a double concentric zone, the outer zone con-
sisting of hornblende, and the inner, or that next to the olivine, consisting of a
pyroxene. While the iron ores associated with the Lower Laurentian gneisses are
g'enerally free from titanium, those associated with the anorthosite rocks are always
highly titaniferous ; a fact which makes the study of these rocks a matter of con-
siderable economic interest. The anorthosite varies a good deal in composition,
some areas, for instance, beuig rich in olivine, while others are destitute of that
mineral, and diflferent portions of even the same area often showing wide differ-
ences in this respect. The rock also shows a good deal of variation in structure.

It is rarely quite massive, frequently well foliated, but usually consists of a rather

coarsely crystalline ground mass through which are scattered irregular strings and
masses composed ot iron ore, bisilicates, and mica, as well as larger porphyritic
crystals of plagioclase. Even when it is tolerably constant in composition there is
generally a great variation in size of grain, coarse and fine alternating in rude
bands or rounded masses. In the case of some of the areas there can be but little
doubt that the anorthosite is eruptive ; in others, however, it seems to be inter-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  667

stratified -with the Laurentian gneiss, and in one of them to merge imperceptibly
into it. The original relations of the rocks are, of course, much obscured by the
effects of subsequent heat and pressure. The evidence at present, however, seems
to indicate that these anorthosites are the result of some kind of extravasation,
which in those early times corresponded to what in modern times we call volcanic

eruption.

      4. On a Diamantiferous Peridotiie and the Genesis of tJie Diamond.
                   By Professor H. Carvill Lewis, M.A., F.G.8.

      The discovery of diamonds at Kimberley, South Africa, has proved to be a
 matter, not only of commercial, but of much geological interest. The conditions
 under which diamonds here occur are unlike those of any other known locality, and
 are worthy of special attention.

     The first diamond found in South Africa was in 1867, when a large diamond
was picked out of a lot of rolled pebbles gathered in the Orange Kiver. This led to
the ' river diggings ' on the Orange and Vaal Rivers, which continue to the present
 time. In 1870, at which time some ten thousand persons had gathered along the
banks of the Vaal, the news came of the discovery of diamonds at a point some fifteen
miles away from the river, where the town of Kimberley now stands. These were
the so-called ' dry diggings,' at first thought to be alluvial deposits, but now proved
to be volcanic pipes of a highly interesting character. Four of these pipes or necks,

 all ricli in diamonds and of similar geological structure, were found close together.

They go down vertically to an unknown depth, penetrating the surrounding strata.
The diamond-bearing material at first excavated was a crumbling yellowish
earth, which at a depth of about fifty feet became harder and darker, finally
 acquiring a slaty blue or dark gi-een colour and a greasy feel, resembling certain

varieties of serpentine. This is the well-known ' blue ground ' of the diamond
miners. It is exposed to the sun for a short time, when it readily disintegrates,
and is then washed for iis diamonds. This ' blue ground ' has now been penetrated
to a depth of 600 feet, and is found to become harder and more rock-like as the
depth increases.

     Quite recently, both in the Kimberley and De Beers mines, the remarkable rock
has been reached which forms the subject of the present paper.

     The geological structure of the district and the mode of occurrence of the dia-
mond has been well described by several observers. As Griesbach, Stow, Shaw,
Rupert Jones, and others have shown, the diamond-bearing pipes penetrate strata of
Carboniferous and Triassic age, the latter being known as the Karoo formation.
The Karoo beds contain numerous interstratified sheets of dolerite and melaphyr,
also of Triassic age, the whole reposing upon ancient mica schists and granites.
The careful investigations of Mr. E. J. Dunn demonstrate that the diamond-bearing
pipes enclose fragments of all these rocks, which fragments show signs of alteration
by heat. Where the pipes adjoin the Karoo shales, the latter are bent sharply
upwards, and the evidence is complete that the diamond-bearing rock is of volcanic

origin aud of post-Triassic age.

     The diamonds in each of the four pipes have distinctive characters of their own,
and are remarkable for the sharpness of their crystalline form (octahedrons and
dodecahedrons), and for the absence of any signs of attrition. These facts taken
in connection with the character of the 'blue ground' indicate, as Mr. Dunn has
pointed out, that the latter is the original matri.x: of the diamond.

      Maskelyne and Flight have studied the microscopical and chemical characters
of the ' blue ground,' and have shown that it is a serpentinic substance containing
bronzite, ilmenite, garnet, diallage, aud ' vaalite ' (an altered mica), and is probably
an altered igneous rock, the decomposed character of the material examined pre-
venting exact determinations of its nature. They showed that the diamonds were
marked by etch figures analogous to those which Professor Gustav Rose had pro-
duced by the incipient combustion of diamonds, and that the ' blue ground ' was
essentially a silicate of magnesium impregnated with carbonates.

     The 'blue ground' often contains such numerous fragments of carbonaceous
668 REPORT-- 1886.

shale as to resemble a breccia. Recent excavatious have shown that large quan-

tities of this shale surround the mines, and that they are so highly carbonaceous

as to be combustible, smouldering for long periods when accidentally fired. Mr.

Paterson states that it is at the outer portions of the pipes, where the ' blue

ground ' is most heavily charged with carbonaceous shale, that there is the richest

yield of diamonds.

Mr. Dunn regards the ' blue ground ' as a decomposed gabbro, while Mr.

Hudleston, Professor Rupert Jones, and Mr. Davies regard it as a sort of volcanic

mud. Mr. Hudleston considers that the action was hydrothermal rather than

igneous, the diamonds being the result of- the contact of steam and magnesian mud

under pressure upon the carbonaceous shales, and likens the rock to a * boiled plum-

pudding.'

The earlier theories as to the origin of the diamond have, in the light of new

facts, quite given way to the theory that the diamonds were formed in the matrix

in which they lie, and that that matrix is in some way of volcanic origin, either in

the form of mud, ashes, or lava.

The exact nature of this matrix becomes, therefore, a matter of great interest.

The rocks now to be described are from the deeper portions of the De Beers mine,

and were obtained through the courtesy of Mr. Hedley. They are quite fresh and

less decomposed than any previously examined. Two varieties occui", the one dia-

mantiferous, the other free from diamonds, and the lithological distinction between

them is suggestive. The diamantiferous variety is crowded with included frag-

ments of carbonaceous shale, while the non-diamantiferous variety is apparently

free from all inclusions, and is a typical volcanic rock.

Both are dark, heavy, basic rocks, composed essentially of olivine, and belong to

the group of peridotites. Both are of similar structure and composition, diflering

only in the presence or absence of inclusions. The rock consists mainly of olivine

crystals lying porphyritically in a serpentinic ground-mass. The olivine is remark-

ably fresh, and occurs in crystals which are generally rounded by subsequent corro-

sion. The principal accessory minerals are biotite and enstatite. The biotite is in

crystals, often more or less rounded, and sometimes surrounded by a thin black rim,

due to corrosion. Similar black rims surround biotite in many basalts. The bio-

tite crystals are usually twinned according to the base. The enstatite is clear and

non-pleochroic. Garnet and ilmenite also occur, the latter often partly altered to

AUleucoxene.  these minerals lie in the serpentinic base, originally olivine.

This rock appears to difler from any heretofore known, and may be described as

a dunite porphyry or saxonite porphyry. The diamond-bearing portions often con-

tain so many inclusions of shale as to resemble a breccia, and thus the lava passes

by degrees into tuff or volcanic ash, which is also rich in diamonds, and is more

readily decomposable than the denser lava.

It seems evident that the diamond-bearing pipes are true volcanic necks, com-

posed of a very basic lava associated with a volcanic breccia and with tuff, and that

the diamonds are secondary minerals produced by the reaction of this lava, with

heat and pressure, on the carbonaceous shales in contact with and enveloped by it.

The researches of Zirkel, Bonney, Judd, and others, have brought to light many

eruptive peridotites, and Daubree has produced artificially one variety (Iherzolite)

by dry fusion. But this appears to be the first clear case of a peridotite volcano

with peridotite ash.

Perhaps an analogous case is in Elliot County, Kentucky, where Mr. J. S.

Diller has recently described an eruptive peridotite which contains the same acces-

sor}' minerals as the peridotite of Kimberley, and also penetrates and encloses frag-

ments of carboniferous shale, thus suggesting interesting possibilities.

out that these gabhros differ from those of the Tertiary volcanic district of the

west of Scotland in being largely composed of saussurite and hornblende, and in

frequently exhibiting a foliated structure. He described certain types of foliated

gabbro under the ievmsflaser-c/ahbro, angen-cjahhi o, and gabbro-schist, and discussed

Hethe origin of the foliation.  concluded that it (the foliation) was the result of

the deformation of the solid rock-masses by the intense mechanical forces that have

acted upon the district, and he attributed the replacement of felspar and diallage

by saussurite and hornblende in a great measure to the same agency.

                     6. Introduction to the Monian System of BocJcs.
                       By Professor J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.

     It has already been recognised by various authors that there are in several parts
of Wales a group of rocks which are older than the Cambrian system. Certain of
them have received names such as Dimetian, Arvonian, Pebidian, but as a whole
they have only been recognised as Pre-Cambrian or Archaean. They are best deve-
loped in the island of Anglesey, and a study of them in that region shows that
they form a well-defined system, of quite equal importance to the Cambrian or
Ordovician, and presenting very well marked and peculiar characters. It is pro-
posed, therefore, to create for them a new ' system,' the ' Monian,' after the place of
their development, which shall take its place below the Cambrian as the oldest
series of stratified rocks, without being a full member of the great group known as
Archaean. The system is divisible into two parts ; the Lower is remarkable as pre-
senting a transition from true crystalline gneisses into earthy slates, the Upper for
the development of vast masses of volcanic debris, with infusions of quartz and cal-

cite, and containing also as intrusive masses rocks of peculiar character which may
be called ' Dimetite.' The rocks of St. David's belong exclusively to the Upper

Monian.

        7. On the Igneous Rocks of Llyn Fadarn, Yr Eifl, and Boduan.
                       By Professor J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.

      These masses have been claimed as Pre-Cambrian, but the evidence obtainable
on the north side of Llyn Padarn does not warrant this conclusion. Cambrian
rocks are found to the west ; no remarkable conglomerate lies between them and
the quartz-felsite mass, but on the eastern side is one with enormous blocks of
the felsite and of other, probably Cambrian, rocks. This is conterminous with the
igneous mass rising into crags at Clegyr and Moel Tryfan. The felsite of Moel

Gronw is a distinct and later outburst. The mass north of Llyn Padarn consists in

 ascending order of felsite, brecciated felsite, agglomerate, felsite of different charac-
 ter, agglomerate and ash, indicating an outburst to a level above the earlier de-
 posited rocks, and therefore immediately exposed to denuding influences. It is

believed, therefore, that this mass may be best interpreted as a submarine eruption

 in the middle of Cambrian times, i.e., younger than the Cambrian rocks to the
 west, and older than the conglomerate which is locally derived from it, and also
 older than those slates which lie to the east. There is no other conglomerate com-

 parable with this, and the outburst of Moel Gronw has no conglomerate on its

 western side.

     The igneous rocks of Yr Eifl and Boduan come up in irregular masses and
 clearly overlie the Ordovician slates, after the manner of intrusive igneous rocks.
 They show a rather remarkable system of horizontal (columnar ?) jointing, which
 gives them a very bedded aspect as seen from a distance, disappearing on closer
 examination and only affecting some part of the massif. The Boduan mass may be

 possibly contemporaneous, as the overlying slates are somewhat conglomeratic, but
 there is not the slightest evidence of either of these being either Cambrian or
 Pre-Oambrian in age. The case is different with the ' Rhos Hirwain syenite.'

                        10. On Concretions. By H. B. Stocks.

    A concretion may be defined as a more or less spherical mass of rock-matter

collected around some organic substance, or upon itself, to form a nodule.

     Concretions occur in many rocks, and vary very much in their composition.
     The follovs'ing are examples :

      Hydraulic Limestones occur as concretions in the Lias and other formations
they are of a grey colour and very hard. They are used for the preparation of
hydraidic cement.

    Baum Pots are nodules occurring in the shale of the coal-measures'; they are
very much like hydraulic limestone in appearance, being hard and of a grey

 colour.

      Coal Balls are thus named because they occur in the coal ; they are of a brownish
colour and nearly spherical.

      Acrespire is a form of concretion occurring in the Millstone Grit. These acre-
spires are greyish or brownish in colour and very hard ; some are of immense size.

      Dolomite occurs as concretions in the compact maguesian limestone.
      Flint occurs as concretions in a variety of shapes in the chalk.
      Imatra Stones occur in a marly formation in Finland.
      Sphcerosiderite occurs as spherical masses on various iron ores.
       Clay Ironstone occurs as concretions in the sliales of the coal-measures ; these
concretions are round but flattened, and of a grey colour. This form of ironstone

is the ore used at Lowmoor in the smelting for iron.

     Limonite occurs in concretions in the chalk; some are formed by the oxidation
of nodules of iron pyrites.

     Iron Pyrites occiu' as concretions in the challc ; most of the concretions show a

radiated structure.
      O.iide of Manyane.se occurs as concretions on the bed of the Pacific. These

nodules are forming at the presejit time. The}' generally enclose some fragment of a
shell or bit of pumice as a nucleus.

      C'o;j/-oZj!:es are concretions occurring in the greensand and other formations; some
of them are the fossil dung of reptiles, but most of them are concretions.

      Pseudocojn-olites occur in the (Jrag ; they resemble coprolites in composition.

    As to the formation of these concretions little is at present known, and I wish
to draw attention to the manganese nodules which are at present forming, and
which, if examined, I am sure would throw light upon the subject.

        1. The Gorndon Laccolites. By "W. W. Watts, M.A., F.G.S.

    The paper began with an account of two groups of ashes and lavas, of andesitic
composition, which had been mapped by the author and Professor Lapworth in
the neighbourhood of the Corndon Mountain, in Montgomeryshire. The lower of
the two groups is of Upper Arenig, while the upper is of Llandeilo-Bala age. Each

set strikes N.N.E. and S.S.W., and forms an important escarpment, while the
upper set is folded over the central anticline of the district, and thrown again into
a syncline between Mucklewick Hill and Pell Rhadley HUl. The major part of
the paper was occupied by a description of the stratigraphy of the intrusive doler-

ites or diabases of the region, in which some new and striking features had been

discovered.

      These intrusive masses show, on the map, as large or small patches or as long
dikes striking in the same direction as the sedimentary rocks. Quarry and other
sections described clearly showed that these masses were not simple dikes or bosses
of the kind usually depicted in the published sections of the district, but had altered
sedimentary rocks resting conformably above and beloiv them, so that in appearance
they were lenticles bearing some resemblance to the Henry Mountain Laccolites
described by Gilbert. Instead, however, of owing their position to conditions of
simple hydrostatic equilibrium, these intrusions were shown to be intimately con-
nected with the folding which the district had suffered, and to stand to it in the
relation of effect rather than of cause. The Corndon and neighbouring Laccolites
have been forced, by hydraulic pressure, into spaces formed in the summit of the

main anticline, and were dammed down by the resisting mass of the rigid ash-beds
above them, so that the rock was intruded into soft shales between the hard rocks

of the Grit mine below, and the Stapeley (Upper Arenig) ash-beds above. In the
Linley Laccolite the intrusion was partly defined by the same ash-beds, but, where
the arch was broken, by the lower beds of the Silurian, while the Wilmington
Laccolite was entirely defined by the Silurian beds, the diabase resting on the
upturned edges of various members of the Ordovician sequence. These and the
other examples displayed clearly that the whole of the intrusive rocks of the
district might be reduced to one single system, being everywhere due to the effects
of lateral pressure operating upon alternating beds of rigid and soft rocks, between
and amongst which spaces, due principally to folding and secondarily to faulting,
were produced, and into these hydraulic pressure forced the molten rock. Intru-
sion can no longer be regarded as a mere sporadic and meaningless phenomenon,
but constitutes another volume of facts to speak for the extreme importance of

lateral pressure in giving to a rock region many of its structures and phenomena
and when this is once clearly understood, it will acquire a new meaning in unravel-

ling those portions of earth history of which the records are found in the present

structure of the rocks.

    In conclusion, the author thanked Professor Lapworth for suggesting many of

these ideas to him, and for help in understanding the precise meaning of the evi-

dence gathered. He also expressed his gi-atitude for a grant from the Royal Society

in aid of the petrographical work.

3. On the Discovery of Diprotodon Anstralis in Tropical Western Australia
          {Kimberleij District). By Edwakd T. Hardman, F.B.G.S.I.

     To explain the extreme interest of this discovery it is necessary to recapitulate

briefly the history of the animal.

     Its remains, plentifully found in the south-eastern and eastern parts of Aus-
tralia, prove that it was a gigantic marsupial, probably belonging to the Macropo-
didas, or existing kangaroo family. Of immense size, its bulk was equal to that of
a rhinoceros, or even of an elephant ; the skull alone, as indicated by a specimen in
the Natural History Department of the British Museum, being 3 feet long.

     The head of the largest existing kangaroo is about 9 inches long, and his height,
sitting erect, about 6 feet 6 inches. Arguing from proportions, therefore, it might

be supposed that the diprotodon would in a similar posture be 18 feet high. How-

ever, though resembling in its dentition the living kangaroos, and, like them, herbi-
vorous in its habits, its anatomy shows important differences. The hind legs were

shorter and very thick, tlie fore limbs longer and capable of rotation. The ana-
tomy of the foot differs from that of existing leaping Ijangaroos, and combines the
character of that of the wombat -with those of the Mylodon and Mastodon.* It is
therefore apparently a connecting link between Macropus and Phascoiomys.

    Its characteristics have been fully described by Sir Richard Owen in many well-
known works, and the chief interest attached to the present relic lies in its being

the only one discorered in Western Australia, and, besides, further north, within the
tropics, than any hitherto known of.

   -- --The first discovery oi Diprotodon was made by Major afterwards Sir Thomas

Mitchell (then Surveyor-General), in 18^6, on the Bell River, a tributary of the

Macquarie, and some 200 miles south-west of Sydney.^ It was associated with
other extinct marsupials in a breccia cave in the limestone, and was named by Owen

Diprotodon optatum, since altered to australis.

The associated fossils were Dasyurus Uiniarius (or Thylacoles), Macropus

atlas, M. Titan, Phascoiomys Mitchelli, and other indeterminate species.

    Diprotodon was subsequently found in many other parts of Ea.stern Australia
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

in the southern districts of New South Wales, at Munnimbidgee River, lat.

34° 30' S., and many other places ;  in Queensland it was obtained in King's Creek
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

in the Darling Downs, and on the great dividing range of that district, in the Con-

damine River; and finally in Maryvale Creek, lat. 19° 30' S ; where it occurs in

alluvial breccia, associated with other extinct marsupials and crocodiles' teeth.

This was its furthest point north untU the present discovery.

In Victoria its remains are found in many localities, one of the chief being near

Mount Macedon, about forty miles from 3Ielbourne.

Similar remains have been met with in South Australia, as at Welcome Springs,

and at Hergott's Springs, 500 miles north of Adelaide.
     This so far had been the known range of Diprotodon. It had never been heard

of in Western Australia xmtU in 1883 the author, then attached to an exploring and
surveying expedition in Kimberley as Government Geologist, was fortunate enough
to find a single bone, which has been pronounced by eminent palaeontologists* to be

the head of the femur of the extinct kangaroo.
     The specimen was found in the bed of the Lennard River, in lat. 17° 20' S., and

long. 125° E., and about 80 mUes from King Sound. This river cuts a deep canon
through a 'barrier range ' of limestone, at this point two miles wide ; and the cliflTs
above the river-bed rise to a height of 300 to 400 feet. The range is named
Napier Range, and the gorge, from the difficulties to passage it presents, was called
the ' Devil's Pass.' Just below the western entrance of the gorge the bone was
picked up (a large coloured photograph was exhibited showing the scene). The
rocks are Carboniferous limestone, honeycombed by caves, and the author considers

that the bone may have been washed during heavy floods out of one of these.
Owing to want of provisions and the bad condition of his horses, the author could

not remain to examine these caves, but was reluctantly compelled to turn back.
     The discovery shows that the animal had an immense range, both of geographi-

cal and climatal habitat, being equally able to sustain the severe cold at times of
the southern and mountainous districts and the intense heat of the western tropical

region.

     Photographs of the bone were exhibited ; the bone itself was in the Colonial

and Indian Exhibition.

5. On the Stratigrapliical Position of the Salt Measures of South Burhajti.
                     By Professor G. A. Lebour, M.A., F.G.S.

    The beds above the main mass of the magnesian limestone in Durham are

seldom exposed at the surface, as the south of the country is covered by a thick
spread of drift. The presence of salt deposits havinfr, however, been proved some
years ago in the adjoining part of Yorkshire near Middlesbrough, several borings

for working them in the form of brine were soon put down in the flat country
between the Tees and the coast south of Seaton Carew. There are now altogether

some fifteen or sixteen such borings, most of which have reached beds of salt at
depths varying from 600 feet to over 1,200 feet. These have thrown much light

upon the rocks, hitherto scarcely known in this part of England, which lie between
the Rhsetic and the great Permian magnesian limestone of Durham. The author
exhibited sections of these beds, and gave reasons for suggesting that much of the
salt-measures of this district is probably the representative of the Upper or Rauch-

toacke Permian of Germany.
     The following table summarises fairly the classification tentatively suggested

by the author :

6. On the Carboniferov^ Limestone of the North of Flintshire.^
                       By G. H. Morton, F.G.S.

In the year 1870 I described before the Association the subdivisions into which

the carboniferous limestone of North Wales is naturally divided by clear lithological

characters, and in 1877 more fully described the subdivisions of the formation aa

they occur in the Eglwyseg ridge, near Llangollen. Since then the whole of Flint-

shire has been examined, and the original classification found to extend to the sea-

coast at the north of the county. Although the subdivisions are not piled up, one
over the other, in a precipitous outcrop, the succession is as clearly shown between

Prestatyn and Meliden as at Llanymynech and Llangollen, and the uniform

character of each subdivision along the intervening forty-four miles of country

is remarkable.

     The following four subdivisions of the carboniferous limestone are all well

exposed in a fine mural section three and a-quarter miles in length, from Castell

Prestatyn on the north to the end of Moel Hiraddug on the south, and occur in the

following descending order :
--AUpper Black Limestone.
                                  black, fine-grained, thin-bedded limestone, contain-

ing very few fossils, but including Posidomya Becheri and the remains of many

plants. Thickness, 200 feet.
--AUpper Grey Limestone.
                                  dark-grey thin-bedded limestone with thin seams

of interstratified shale, containing numerous fossils, including Produeliis giganteus

--Aand corals. Thickness, 500 feet.
Middle White Limestone.                                               wlilte or light-grey thick-bedded limestone, con-

--Ataining very few fossils. Thickness, 600 feet.
Lower Broion Limestone.                                               brown or dark-grey irregularly-bedded limestone,

containing few fossils, but with interstratified shales at the base of the subdivision,

which contain the remams of plants. Thickness, 400 feet.

The total thickness of these four subdivisions, forming the carboniferous lime-

stone of the north of Flintsbire, is 1,700 feet, which is much greater than anywhere

else in North Wales.

Although the line of the section is nearly north and south, the average dip of

the strata is about 14° to the E.N.E. at Coed-yr-Esgob, N.W. at Bryniau, and

N.E.N, at Moel Hiraddug, so that it is greater than it appears to be in the section.

The highest subdivision, the Upper Black Limestone, occurs at the north end, and

the Upper Grey Limestone crops out from under it and extends to Nant-yr-Ogof,

where there is a considerable fault, which brings up the top of the Lower Brown

and the base of the Middle White Limestone. From the fault the Middle White

extends three-quarters of a mile, when the Lower Brown Limestone crops out,

continues some distance and forms the conspicuous hill, Moel Hiraddug, on the top

of which the lower beds of the Middle White Limestone are again exposed.

Along the west and parallel with the section there are two great faults, known

as the Prestatyn fault and the Vale of Clwyd fault, and on the western side of the

former a bare limestone liill, Graig-fawr, rises to an elevation of 500 feet and

presents a grand exposure of the Middle Wliite Limestone, which is 600 feet in

thickness. Numerous fossils occur at the north end of Graig-fawi", and a greater

number has been obtained there than from the MiddleWhite Limestone anywhere else.

On the west of the carboniferous limestone shown along the hue of section

several faults, including the two already referred to, have thrown down the lime-

stone beneath the level of the sea, and the Lower Coal-measures have been proved

to occur at Meliden and Dyserth, beneath a covering of drift. In one of the recent

'Memoirs of the Geological Survey,' by Mr. A. Strahan, M.A., F.G.S., a full

--description of the geology Explmiation of Quarter-sheet 79 N. W. will be found,

with all the details of the drift and underlying strata.

7. On tlie Classification of the Carhoniferous Limestone Series
                 brian Type. By Hugh Miller, F.E.8.E., F.O.S.

    It is now twenty years since the late George Tate, of Alnwick, published a

completed classification for the Carboniferous Limestone Series of North North-
umberland. For more than half that period this classification has been set aside
as of a merely local value. It will be the endeavour of this paper to claim for it

its true place.

    Tate's classification may be summarised as in the following table :

of the Tuedian group. Marked by the number, thickness, and quality of its

coal seams                                                     limestones thin and generally impure ;                                                     marine organisms in fewer

     In 1875, Tate's classification of the upper divisions of the series was set aside
fcy Professor Lebour in favour of an arrangement more ' natural and convenient.'
Professor Lehour abolished the distinction between the Calcareous and Carbona-

--ceous groups, and threw them together along with the Tuedian grits of some parta

not applicable to North Northumberland. It is now, as a result of the labours of the
Geological Survey, found to be equally applicable to South Northumberland, and

      In conclusion, Tate's admirable classification presents us with well-defined
types, generally recognisable almost at a glance by the practised eye, and bounded
by lines as good probably as from the complications of the structure (faults,
obscurities, &c.) could be expected. His names, if not high-sounding, are at

least sufficiently expressive.

8. Tlie Culm Measures of Devonshire} By W. A. E. Usshee, F.G.S.

The late Professor Phillips contributed the most considerable and important

part of the literature of this subject in ' The Palaeozoic Fossils of Somerset, Devon,

and Cornwall,' a work from which  several            quotations       are    given                              Mr. T. M. Hall
                                                                                                             ;

and other writers are cited as to the occurrence of anthracite in the neighbourhood

of Bideford, &c.

After having observed the Culm Measures on the borders of the Triassic area

for some years, the author was enabled to study them in detail during the years

1876 and 1877, his researches being confined to the area east of a line between

Hartland Point and Okehampton. In this area he discovered that the Culm

Measures were broadly divisible into three groups, which, however, owing to the

passage of one group into another, to local intercalations, and to the innumerable

flexures and disturbances by which the main synclinal structure is obscured,

--cannot be separated by hard and fast lines at least, on the one-inch scale.

The following is the general classification given :

 g                                              grits, associated with marly splitting shales in
                                               places ; irregular grits, slates, and shales.
o
                 {Dark grey shales with grit-beds, generally thin and even, slaty
                       and splintery shales (St. David's, Exeter, type), even-bedded
                      cherty shales and grits (Coddon Hill type), limestones and

                       dark grey shales.

     Some leading characters in each group are then pointed out. The Lower
Culm Measures are assigned a breadth of from two to three miles on their northern

outcrop, and of about fifteen miles in the southern area on each side of Dartmoor.
The impersistent character of the limestones of this series, and the frequent
absence of their most marked characters from the beds on the (Joddon Hill

horizon, is also mentioned. The apparent passage of the Cukn Measures into

Devonian in the north is contrasted with the seeming unconformity between these

strata in the south.

    The Middle Culm Measures attain a breadth of about four miles in their
northern, and from four to five in their southern outcrop. Some structural pecu-
liarities in this series, and a part of the coast section between Portledge Mouth
and Westward Ho, are briefly described.

     Tlie Upper Culm Measures are said to form a band of from six to seven miles
in wirlth. The even character of the bedding and the iuterstratificatious of dark
grey shales render the contortions of this series on the coast between Portledge
Mouth and CloveUy very apparent.

  --9. Denudation and Deposition by tlie Agency of Waves experimentally
                         considered. By A. R. Hunt, F.0.8.

     The author, after referring to the importance of waves as agents of denudation,
said that endless cases might be cited in proof of the conflict of authority as to
the depth at which wave-action practically afiected the sea-bottom. Until this

                 ' Printed in full in the Geol. Mag. Dec. 3, vol. iv. p. 10, 1887.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  677

 tjuestion he settled, no progress can he made in assigning to waves their proper
 position among agents of denudation and deposition.

      The author said that much of the prevailing uncertainty arose from the fact
 that waves of oscillation have not heen studied experimentally, and that Mr.

 Scott Russell's waves of translation, created by admitting a fresh volume of water
 into a tank, are not analogous to sea waves in any part of the passage of the latter
 from deep water to the shore. One proof of this is that the ordinary sea wave of
 oscillation is always preceded by a depression, and plunges seaward of the margin
 of repose of the water ; whereas one characteristic of J\ii\ Paissell's wave of trans-
 lation is that its surface is wholly raised above the level of repose of the fluid.

      The author showed by diagrams that experimental oscillating waves plunged
 further and further from the margin of repose as the incline of the beach was
 reduced, and that they showed no tendency to turn into waves of translation.

      The subject was then considered from four points of view, viz., observation,

--direct and indirect ; experiment ; and theory.
      (1) Direct Observation. As one of innumerable instances of bottom disturb-

 ance, the author referred to slate shingle di-edged 2,600 yards east of Hope's Nose
 in Torbay (in 14 fathoms), together with a specimen of the sluggish and helpless
 mollusc Pleurobranchus 7nembranaceus. The shingle was derived from the northern
 shores of Torbay, and proved that in heavy weather the shingle occasionally tra-
velled into deep water. The mollusc proved that in ordinary weather the tidal

--currents exerted no appreciable disturbing action.
      (2) Indirect Observation, The forms of marine faima exposed to wave currents

--are specially adapted to withstand such action.
     (3) Experimental. Artificial oscillating waves made to roll over glass plates
disturb flocculent matter on the plates at a depth approaching half the wave-

length.

   --(4) Theoretical. According to theory the disturbance in deep water is very

slight at half the wave-length, but rapidly increases on approaching the curface. The
evidence of rolling action at forty fathoms on the bottom of the English Channel,
based on the condition of a soda-water bottle and its contents (exhibited to Section

C at Southampton, 'Eep. B. A.,' 1883, p. 535), was afterwards fully confirmed on

mathematical grounds by Professor G. G. Stokes, Pres.R.S. (' Journal Linnean

Soc. Zoology,' vol. xviii. p. 263).

      After describing the complexity of the currents set up in front of plunging
waves, the author pointed out that behind the plunging point the waves stir up the
sand by symmetrical oscillating currents, which keep it in motion and place it at the
disposal of any passing continuous current, whether derived from tide, wind, or
even earthquake. Of these currents perhaps those raised by wind are of most
importance, as they are most intense when the waves themselves are highest. The
water propelled by the wind shorewards (independently of any wave motion)
escapes seaward as an under-current, or side-current along shore. Thus in wind

--and wave combined we have a most eflicient excavating tool a tool which not

only cuts well, but which clears itself well.
     The waves cut the land, the wind-raised currents remove the dibris, and

this frequently in tlie teeth of both wind and wave.
     If waves can disturb sand and shingle at a depth of forty fathoms, as the triple

cord of evidence relied on seems to prove, and if these waves are accompanied by
wind-formed currents, as they often are, then waves supplemented by wind-
currents are agenta of denudation and deposition, which no geologist can atford to
neglect, except at the risk of seriously misinterpreting the records of the sedimentary

rocks.

                               and J. S. Grant Wilson, F.0.8.

     This newly discovered deposit occurs in several places in the north-east part of
the island, and, in all, extends over an area of about 58 square miles. The tw&
places especially described are : (a) Loch Ouithir, where the diatomite lies under

3 feet 8 inches of turf and peat. It has been proved in 19 bore-holes to a depth of
8 feet 4 inches, the bottom not reached. It probably extends to a depth of at
least 14 feet. This deposit is very piure, containing' in a calcined sample 99-20 per
cent, of diatomaceous matter, (b) Loch Moukstadt. Here the deposit is some-
what irregular in its thickness and in the thickness of the overlying peat, &c.
The diatomite is rather less pure than in Loch Cuithir, but it contains 93*55 per
cent, of diatomaceous matter.

Peesident of the Section.--WILLIAM CARRUTHERS, Pres.L.S., F.R.S., F.G.S.

                            THURSBA Y, SEPTEMBER 2.

      The President delivered the following Address :

In detaining you a few minutes from the proper work of the Section, I propose to
ask your attention to what is known of the past history of the species of plants which
still forma portion of the existing flora. The relation of our existing vegetation
to preceding floras is beyond the scope of our present inquiry : it has been fre-
quently made the subject of exposition, but to handle it requires a more lively
imagination than T can lay claim to, or, perhaps, than it is desirable to employ in
any strictly scientific investigation.

      The literature of science is of little, if any, value in tracing the history of
species, and in determining the modification or the persistency of characters which

may be essential or accidental to them. If help could be obtained from this quarter,

botanical inquiry would be specially favoured, for the literature of botany is earlier
and its terms have all along been more exact than in any of her sister sciences.
But even the latest descriptions, incorporating as they do the most advanced
observations of science, and expressed in the most exact terminology, fail to supply

the data on which a minute comparison of plants can be instituted. Any attempt

to compare the descriptions of Linnaeus and the earlier systematists who, under
his influence, introduced greater precision into their language, with the standard

authors of our own day, would be of no value. The short, vague, and insufficient

descriptions of the still earlier botanists cannot even be taken into consideration.
      Greater precision might be expected from the illustrations that have been in

use in botanical literature from the earliest times; but these really supply no
better help in the minute study of species than the descriptions which they are

intended to aid. The earliest illustrations are extremely rude : many of them are
misplaced ; some are made to do duty for several species, and not a few are piu-ely
fictitious. The careful and minutely exact illustrations which are to be found iu
many modern systematic works are too recent to supply materials for detecting
any changes that may have taken place in the elements of a flora.

     But the means of comparison which we look for in vain in the published litera-
ture of science may be found in the collections of dried plants which botanists
have formed for several generations. The local herbaria of our own day represent

not only the different species found in a country, but the various forms which
occur, together with their distribution . They must supply the most certam materials
for the minute comparison at any future epoch of the then existing vegetation with

that of our own day.
     The preservation of dried plants as a help in the study of systematic botany

was first employed in the middle of the sixteenth century. The earliest herbarium
of which we have any record is that of John Falconer, an Englishman who
travelled in Italy between 1540 and 1547, and who brought with him to England
a collection of dried plants fastened in a book. This was seen by William Turner,
680 REPORT-- 1886.

our first British botanist, who refers to it in his ' Herbal,' published iu 1551. Turner
may have been already acquainted with this method of preserving plants, for in his

enforced absence from England he studied at Bologna under Luca Ghini, the first

professor of Botany in Europe, who, there is reason to believe, originated the prac-

tice of maldng herbaria. Ghini's pupils, Aldrovandus and Csesalpinus, formed

extensive collections. Caspar Bauhin, whose ' Prodromus ' was the first attempt to

digest the literature of botany, left a considerable herbarium, still preserved at

Basle. No collection of English plants is known to exist older than the middle of

the seventeenth  century                                  a  volume  containing  some  British  and  many exotic
                                                       ;

plants collected in the year 1647 was some years ago acquired by the British

Museum. Towards the end of that century great activity was manifested in the

collection of plants, not only in our own country, but in every district of the

globe visited by travellers. The labours of Ray and Sloaue, of Petiver and

Plukenet are manifest not only in the works which they published, but in the

collections that they made, which were purchased by the country in 1759 when
the museum of Sir Hans Sloane became the nucleus of the now extensive collec-

tions of the British Museum. The most important of these collections in regard to

British plants is the herbarium of Adam Buddie, collected nearly two hundred

years ago, and containing an extensive series which formed the basis of a British

Flora, that unhappily for science was never published, though it still exists in

manuscript. Other collections of British plants of the same age, but less complete,

supplement those of Buddie : these various materials are in such a state of preser-

vation as to permit of the most careful comparison with living plants, and they
show that the two centuries which have elapsed since their collection have not

modified in any particular the species contained in them. The early collectors

contemplated merely the preservation of a single specimen of each species ; conse-

quently the data for an exhaustive comparison of the indigenous flora of Britain

at the beginning of last century with that of the present are very imperfect as com-
pared with those which we shall hand down to our successors for their use.

     The collections made in other regions of the world in the seventeenth century,
and included in the extensive herbarium of Sir Hans Sloane, are frequently being
examined side by side with plants of our own daj', but they do not show any

peculiarities that distinguish them from recent collections. If any changes are

taking place in plants, it is certain that the three hundred years during which their

dried remains have been preserved in herbaria have been too short to exhibit

them.

    Beyond the time of those early herbaria the materials which we owe in any
way to the intervention of man have been preserved without any regard to their
scientific interest. They consist mainly of materials used iu building or for sepul-
ture. The woods employed in mediaeval buildings present no peculiarities by which

they can be distinguished from existing woods ; neither do tlie woods met with in

Roman and British villages and burying-places. From a large series collected by

General Pitt-Rivers in extensive explorations carried on by him on the site of a vil-
lage which had been occupied by the British before and after the appearance of the

Romans, we find that the woods chiefly used by them were oak, birch, hazel, and

willow, and at the latter period of occupation of the village the wood of the

Spanish chestnut (Castanea vulgaris, Lamk.) was so extensively employed that it

must have been introduced and grown in the district. The gravel beds in the

north of London, explored by Mr. W. G. Smith for the palajolithic implements

in them, contained also fragments of willow and birch, and the rhizomes of
Osmunda regalis, L.

     The most important materials, however, for the comparison of former vegeta-
tion of a known age with that of our own day have been supplied by the specimens
which have been obtained from the tombs of the ancient Egyptians." Until recently .

these consisted mainly of fruits and seeds. These were all more or less carbonised,

because the former rifling of the tombs had exposed them to the air. Ehrenberg,
who accompanied Yon Minutoli in his Egyptian expedition, determined the seeds
which he had collected, but as he himself doubted the antiquity of some of the

materials on which he reported, the scientific value of his enumeration is destroyed.

Passalacqua in 1823 made considerable collections from tombs at Thebes, and
these were carefully examined and described by the distinguished botanist Kunth.

He pointed out, in a paper published sixty years ago, that these ancient seeds

possessed the minute and apparently accidental peculiarities of their existing repre-

sentatives. Unger, who visited Egypt, published in several papers identifications of

the plant-remains from the tombs ; and one of the latest labours of Alexander

Braun was an examination of the vegetable remains in the Egyptian Museum at
Berlin, which was published, after his death, from his manuscript, under the

careful editorship of Ascherson and Magnus. In this, twenty-four species were
determined, some from imperfect materials, and necessarily with some hesitation

as to the accuracy of their determination.

     The recent exploration of unopened tombs belonging to an early period in the
history of the Egyptian people has permitted tlie examination of the plants in a

condition which could not have been anticipated. And happily, the examination
-of these materials has been made by a botanist who is thoroughly acquainted with

the existing flora of Egypt, for Dr. Schweinfurth has for a quarter of a century been

exploring the plants of the Nile valley. The plant-remains were included within
the mimimy-wrappings, and being thus hermetically sealed, have been preserved

with scarcely any change. By placing the plants in warm water. Dr. Schwein-

furth has succeeded in preparing a series of specimens gathered four thousand years
ago, which are as satisfactory for the purposes of science as any collected at the
present day. These specimens consequently supply means for the closest examina-
tion and comparison with their living representatives. The colours of the flowers
are still present, even the most evanescent, such as the violet of the larkspur and
knapweed, and the scarlet of the poppy ; the chlorophjdl remains in the leaves, and
the sugar in the pulp of the raisins. Dr. Schweinfurth has determined no less than
fifty-nine species,' some of which are represented by the fi'uits employed as offer-

ings to the dead, others by the flowers and leaves made into garlands, and the
remainder by branches on which the body was placed, and which were enclosed

within the wrappings.

     The votive offerings consist of the fruits, seeds, or stems, of twenty-nine
species of plants. Three palm fruits are common ; the Medemia Argun, Wiirt., of
the Nubian Desert, and the Hyphcene tJiebaica, Mart., of Upper Egypt, agreeing
exactly with the fruits of these plants in our own day ; also dates of different
forms resembling exactly the varieties of dried dates found now in the markets of

Egypt. Two figs are met with, Ficus cnrica, L., and Ficus Syconiorus, L., the

latter exhibiting the incisions still employed by the inhabitants for the destruction
of the Neuropterous insects which feed on them. The sycomore was one of the

Bacred trees of Egypt, and the branches used for the bier of a mummy found at

Abd-el-Qurna, of the twentieth dynasty (a thousand years before the Christian era),

were moistened and laid out by Dr. Schweinfurth, equalling, he says, the best

specimens of this plant in our herbaria, and consequently permitting the most

exact comparison with living sycomores, fi'om which they ditfer in no respect.

The fruit of the vine is common, and presents, besides some forms familiar to the

modern grower, others which have been lost to cultivation. The leaves which

have been obtained entire exactly agree in form with those cultivated at the

present day, but the under surface is clothed with white hairs, a peculiarity Dr.

ASchweinfurth has not observed in any Egyptian vines of our time.  very large

quantity of hnseed was found in a tomb at Thebes of the twentieth dynasty, now

three thousand years old, and a smaller quantity in a vase in another tomb of the

twelfth dynasty, that is, one thousand years older. This belongs certainly to

Linmn humile, Mill., the species still cultivated in Egypt, from which the capsule*

do not differ in any respect. Braun had already determined this species preserved

thus in the tombs, though he was not aware of its continued cultivation in Egypt.

The berries of Juniperus phcBnicea, L., are foimd in a perfect state of preservation,

and present a somewhat larger average size than those obtained from this juniper

at the present day. Grains of barley and wheat are of frequent occurrence in the

tombs M. Mariette has found barley in a grave at Sakhara of the fifth dynasty^
                               ;

five thousand four hundred years old.

The impurities found with the seeds of these cultivated plants show that the

weeds which trouble the tillers of the soil at the present day in Egypt were

equally the pests of their ancestors in those early ages. The barley fields were

infested with the same spiny medick {Meclicago denticulata, Willd.) which is still

found in the grain crops of Egypt. The presence of the pods of Sinapis arvensis,

L., among the flax seed testifies to the presence of this weed in the flax crops of

the days of Pharaoh, as of our own time. There is not a single field of flax in

Egypt where this charlock does not abound ; and often in such quantity that its

yellow flowers, just before the flax comes into bloom, present the appearance of a

crop of mustard. The charlock is Sinajns m-vei^sis, L., var. Allionii, Jacq., and is

distinguished from the ordinary form by its globidar and inflated silicules, which

are as characteristically present in the ancient specimens from the tombs as in the

living plants. Rumex denfatus, L., the dock of the Egyptian fields of to-day, baa

been foimd in graves of the Greek period at Dra-Abu-Negga.

It is difficult without the actual inspection of the specimens of plants employed

as garlands, which have been prepared by Dr. Schweinfurth, to realise the wonderful

condition of preservation in which they are. The colour of the petals of Papaver

Rhoeas, L., and the occasional presence of the dark patch at their bases, present the

same peculiarities as are still found in this species growing in Egyptian fields. Th&

petals of the larkspur {DelpJiinium orientale, Gay) not only retain their reddish-

violet colour, but present the pecidiar markings which are still found in the living

Aplant.  garland composed of wild celery (Apiuni groveolens, L.) and small

flowers of the blue lotus {Nympihcea cctrulea, Sav.), fastened together by fibres of

papyrus, was found on a mummy of the twentieth dynasty, about three thousand

years old. The leaves, flowers, and ii'uit of the wild celery have been examined
with the greatest care by Dr. Schweinfurth, who has demonstrated in the clearest

manner their absolute identity with the indigenous form of thi.'j species now

abundant in moist places in Egypt. The same may be said of the other plants

used for garlands, including two species of lichens.

It appears to have been a practice to lay out the dead bodies on a bier of fresh

branches, and these were inclosed within the linen wrappings which enveloped the-

mummy. In this way there have been preserved branches of considerable size of

Ficus Sycomorus, L., Olea europan, L., Mimusops Sckimperi, H., and Tamarix

nilotica, Ehrb. The Mimusops is oi^ frequent occurrence in the mural decorations

of the ancient temples ; its fruit had been detected amongst the ofi'erings to the

dead, and detached leaves had been found made up into garlands, but the discovery

of branches with their leaves still attached, and in one case with the fruit adhering,

has established that this plant is the Abyssinian species to which Schimper's nam&

has been given, and which is characterised by the long and slender petiole of the leaf.
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                                       683

    In none of the species, except the vine to which I have referred, which Dr.
Schweinfurth has discovered, and of which he has made a careful study, has he

heen able to detect any peculiarities in the living plants which are absent in those

obtained from the tombs.
     Before passing from these Egyptian plants I would draw attention to the quality

of the cereals. They are good specimens of the cereals still cultivated. This ob-
servation is true also of the crdtivated grains which I have examined, belonging to

prehistoric times. The wheat found in the purely British portion of the ancient

village explored by General Pitt-Eivers is equal to the average of wheat culti-
vated at the present day. This is the more remarkable, because the two samples-

from the later Romano-British period obtained by General Pitt-Rivers are very

much smaller, though they are not unlike the small hard grains of wheat still culti-

vated on thin chalk soils. The wheat-grains from lake dwellings in Switzerland, for

Mywhich I am indebted to J. T. Lee, Esq., F.G.S., are fair samples.  colleague,

Mr. W. Fawcett, has recently brought me from America grains of maize from the

prehistoric mounds in the valley of the Mississippi, and from the tombs of the lucas

of Peru, which represent also fair samples of this great food-substance of the New

World. The early peoples of both worlds had then under cultivation productive
varieties of these important food-plants, and it is remarkable that in our own coimtiy,
with all the appliances of scientific cultivation and intelligent farming, we have not

been able to appreciably surpass the grains which were harvested by our rude

ancestors of two thousand years ago.

     In taking a further step into the past, and tracing the remains of existing

species of plants preserved in the strata of the earth's crust, we must necessarily

leave behind all certain chronology. Without an intelligent observer and recorder

Wethere can be no definite determination of time.  can only speculate as to the

period required for efifecting the changes represented by the various deposits.

The peat-bogs are composed entirely of plant-remains belonging to the floras

existing in the regions where they occur. They are mainly surface accimiulations

still being formed and going back to an unknown antiquity. They are subsequent

to the last changes in the surface of the country, and represent the physical

conditions still prevailing.

     The period of great cold during which arctic ice extended far into temperate
regions was not favourable to vegetable life. But in some localities we have

stratified clays with plant-remains later than the Glacial Epoch, yet indicating

that the great cold had not then entirely disappeared. In the lacustrine beds at

Holdemess is found a small birch {Betvla nana, L.), now limited in Great Britain

to some of the mountains of Scotland, but found in the Arctic regions of the

Old and New World and on Alpine districts in Europe, and with it Prunus

Padus, L., Quercus Rohur, L,, Corylus Avellann, L., Alnus glutinosa, L., and

Pinus syhesti'is, L. In the white clay beds at Bovey Tracey of the same age there

occur the leaves of Arctostaphylos Uva-Ursi, L., three species of willow, viz.,

Salix cinerea, L., S. myrtilloides, L., and S. polaris, VVahl., and in addition to
our alpine Betula nana, L., the more familiar B. alba, L. In beds of the same

age in Sweden, Nathorst has found the leaves of Th-yas octopetala, L., and Salix

herbacea, L., this being associated with S. polaris, Wahl. Two of these plants

have been lost to oui- flora from the change of climate that has taken place, viz.,

Salix myrtilloides, L., and S. polaris, Wahl. ; and Betula nana, L., has retreated to
the mountains of Scotland. Three others {Dryas octopetala, L., ArctostapJiylos

Uva-Ursi, L., and Salix herbacea, L.) have withdrawn to the mountains of

northern England, Wales, and Scotland, while the remainder are still found

scattered over the country. Notwithstanding the diverse physical conditions to

which these plants have been subjected, the remains preserved in these beds

present no characters by which they can be distinguished from the living repre-

sentatives of the species.

    We meet with no further materials for careful comparison with existing species

until we get beyond the great period of intense cold which immediately preceded

the present order of things. The Glacial Epoch includes four periods during which

the cold was intense, separated by intervals of somewhat higher temperature which
84 KEPORT-- 1886.

are represented by the intervening sedimentary deposits. During these alterations

of temperature, extensive changes in the configuration of the land vsrere taking

place. The first great upheaval occurred in the early glacial period, and was

Afollowed by a considerable subsidence.  second upheaval took place late in the

glacial epoch. Various estimates have been formed of the time required for this

succession of climatic conditions and earth-movements. The moderate computa-

tion of Ramsay and Lyell gives to the boulder clay of the first glacial period an

age of 250,000 years, estimating the time of the first upheaval as 200,000 years

ago, while the subsidence took place 50,000 years later, and the second upheaval

92,000 years ago.

The sedimentai'y deposits later than the Pliocene strata, but older than the

glacial drift, indicate an increasing severity in the climate, which reached its

height in the first glacial period.

At Cromer, on the Norfolk coast, the newest of these deposits has supplied the

remains of Salix polaris, Wahl., S. cinerea, L., and Hypnuni turf/escens, Schimp.

This small group of plants is of great interest in connection with the history of

existing species ; their remains are preserved in such a manner as to permit the

closest comparison with living plants. Such an examination shows that they

differ fi'om each other in no particular. Tn the post-glacial deposits in Sweden,

Saliv fierbacea, Ti., is iiSSOcia,ted with S. poltifis, Wa,h.\., na I have already stated.

These two willows are very closely related, having indeed been treated as the

same species until Wahlenberg pointed out the characters which separated them

when he established .SaZi'r joo/arw as a distinct species in 1812. One of the most

obvious of the specific distinctions is the form and venation of the leaf, a character

which is, however, easily overlooked, but when once detected is found to be so con-

stant that it enables one to distinguish without hesitation the one species from the

other. The leaves of the two willows in the Swedish bed present all the pecu-

liarities which they possess at the present day, and the venation and form of the

leaves of S. polaris, Wahl., from the preglacial beds of Cromer present no

approach towards the peculiarities of its ally S. herhace.a, L., but exhibit them

exactly as they appear in the lining plant. This is the more noteworthy as the

vegetative organs supply, as a rule, the least stable of the characters employed in

the diagnosis of species. The single moss (Hypnum turgescens, Schimp.) is no

longer included in the British flora, but is still found as an arctic and alpine species

in Europe, and the pre-glacial specimens of this cellular plant differ in no respect

from their living representatives.

The older beds containing the remains of existing species, which are found also

at Cromer, have recently been explored with unwearied diligence and great success

by Mr. Clement Reid, F.Gr.S., an officer of the Geological Survey of England. To
him 1 am indebted for the opportunity of examining the specimens which he has

found, and I have been able to assist him in some of his determinations, and to

accept all of them. His collections contain sixty-one species of plants belonging

to forty-six different genera, and of these forty-seven species have been identified.

Slabs of clay-ironstone from the beach at Happisburgh contain leaves of beech,

elm, oak, and willow. The materials, however, which have enabled Mr. Reid to

record so large a number of species are the fruits or seeds which occur chiefly in

mud or clay, or in the peat of the forest-bed itself. The species consist mainly of

water or marsh plants, and represent a somewhat colder temperature than we have

in our own day, belonging as they do to the arctic facies of our existing flora.

Only one species {Trapa nntans, 1j.) has disappeared from our islands; its

fruits, which Mr. Reid found abundantly in one locality, agree with those of the

plants found until recently in the lakes of Sweden. Four species (Prunics spinosa,

L., CEnanthe Lachenulii, Gmel., Fotamogeton heterophyllxis, Schreb., and Finns

Abies, L.) are found at present only in Europe, and a fifth {Potamoyeton trichoides,

Cham.) extends also to North America ; two species {Peucedanutn palustre,

Moench, and Pinus sylvestris, L.) are found also in Siberia, whilst six more

{Sangtiisorba officinalis, L., Rubus fruticosus, L., Cornus sanguinea, L., Euphoi-hia

mnygdaloides, L., Quercits Robur, L., and Potamogeton crispus, L.) extend into

Western Asia, and two (Fagus sylvaticn, L., and Alnus glutinosa, L.) are included
--

in the Japanese flora. Seven species, while found with the others, enter also into

the Mediterranean flora, extending to North Africa: these are Thalictrum minus,

L., TJialictrum flavuni, L., Ranunculus rejiens, L., SteUaria aquatica, Scop., Corylus

Avellana, L., Zcmnichellia palustris, L., and Cladium Mariscus, Br. With a similar

distribution in the Old World, eight species {Bidens tripartita, L., Myosotis

caspitosa, Schultz, Suceda maritima, Dum., Ceratophyllum demersum, L., Spar-
ganium ramosum, Huds., Potamogeton pectinatus, L., Carex paludosa, Good., and
 Osmunda regalis, L.) are found also in North America. Of the remainder, ten
species {Nuphar luteutn, Sm., Memjanthes trifoliata, L., Stachys palustris, L.,

Rumex maritimus, L., Rumex Acetosella, L., Betula alba, L., Scirpus paudflonis,

Lightf., Taxus baccata, L., and Isoetes lacustris, L.) extend round the north
temperate zone, while three {Lynopus europceus, L., Alisma Plantago, L., and
Phragmites communis, Trin.), having the same distribution in the north, are found
also in Austraha, and one {Hippuris vulgaris, L.) in the south of South America.
The list is completed by Ranunculus aquatilis, L., distributed over all the

temperate regions of the globe, and Scirpus lacustris, L., which is found in many

tropical regions as well.

     The various physical conditions which necessarily affected these species in their

difiiision over such large areas of the earth's surface in the course of, say, 250,000

years, should have led to the production of many varieties, but the uniform

testimony of the remains of this considerable pre-glacial flora, as far aa the
materials admit of a comparison, is that no appreciable change has taken place.

    I am unable to carry the history of any existing species of plant beyond the
Cromer deposits. Some of the plant-remains from Tertiary strata have been referred

to still living species, but the examination of the materials, as far as they have

come before me, convince me that this has been done without suflicient evidence.
The physical conditions existing during even the colder of the Tertiary periods were

not suitable to a flora fitted to persist in these lands in our day, even if the period

of great cold had not intervened to destroy them. And in no warmer region of the
earth dp these Tertiary species now exist, though floras of the same facies occur,

containing closely allied species. The sedimentary beds at the base of the Glacial
Epoch contain, as far as we at present know, the earliest remains of any existing

species of plant.

    It is not my purpose to point out the bearing of these facts on any theoretical

views entertained at the present day : I wish merely to place them before the
members of this Section as data which must be taken into account in constructing
such theories, and as confirming the long-established axiom that by us, at least^
as workers, species must be dealt with as fixed quantities.

                            By F. T. MoTT, F.B.G.8.

Provincial museums are at present very unsatisfactory institutions, but there is

an undeveloped capacity in them which, once recognised, would put them on a new

Afooting.  provincial museum should be a complete monograph of its own parti-

cular district, illustrated throughout with actual specimens, and the preparation of

it should be set about in a systematic manner and completed as rapidly as possible.

The natural history, botany, and geology of the district should be lirst undertaken

then the antiquities, the agriculture, the manufactures, arts, and political history

in succession as distinct departments, each worked out in the most complete

manner.

  --The advantages would be (1) that this is work wliich can never be done
                                   museum unique                                                                                  work  which
elsewhere, and  would render  the                                                                             ;  (2)  that it is               can

be made complete, whereas anything else will be fragmentary and imperfect

(3) that it will furnish information especially interesting to the inhabitants and

of real value to science.

The staff required for the natural history will be two curators, one workman,

and four paid collectors, and the expense wiU be about 1,000^. a year for two years,

--the buUding being otherwise provided. No reliance must be placed on amateur

collectino- it is too slow and desultory. Every living creature, vertebrate and in-

vertebrate, indigenous to the district must have its whole life-history illustrated.
ALabels must be plentiful with the English and local names prominent.
                                                                                                                                        room

70 feet by 40 will take the whole of the local vertebrates in wall-cases, and the

invertebrates in table-cases.

    When the natural history is completed the annual expense for the botany and

geology may be reduced to 700Z. a year for two years more.
     Each of the other departments may be completed in a single year, at the same

     The curators' attention must then be continually directed to devising and carry-
ing out plans for making the museum available in every possible way for reference

and for education.
     There is no town in England in which the inhabitants would grudge the half-

penny or penny rate for a museum so constructed and so worked.

                                By Professor Howes, F.L.8.

    T he author shows that the importance of a third centre of ossification of the

mam malian shoulder-girdle has been overlooked. He claims that it is homologous

with the true coracoid bone of the lower vertebrata, basing his determination upon

a stu dy of the facts as they stand in the common rabbit ; the coracoid process he
hold s to be the morphological equivalent of the monotreme epicoracoid. He further
upholds the view that the mammalian coracoid has been derived from a primarily
expanded sheet-like type ; fenestration thereof, the rule among the lower amniota,
bein g the exception among mammals. He describes the shoulder-girdle of the

  1i. On the Connection between Molecular Structure and Biological Action.
                      By James Blake, M.D., F.B.C.S., F.C.S.

      The paper contained the results of the author's researches on the connection
"between the molecular constitution of inorganic substances and their biological
 action, and is, in fact, a continuation of previous communications to the Associa-
tion, the first of which was made at the meeting at Newcastle in 1838, followed by
 others in 1843, 1844, and 1846.

      The author showed that these biological reactions are determined, in the case
of compounds of all the more electro-positive elements, by the electro -positive
element of the compound, and that they are closely connected with its isomorphous
relations and atomic weight, and that when an element forms two classes of
compounds which are members of two different isomorphous groups, as with the
ferrous and ferric salts, the biological action of the salts in each class differs, and
is analogous to that of the other members of the group to which it belongs, the
salts in which the electro-positive element has the highest molecular weight being
 by far the most active.

      In cases where an element forms a connecting link between two isomorphous
groups its biological reactions are such as connect it with each group. Between
 the metals and metalloids differences exist as regards the connection of biological
action with their atomic weights, although the general reaction is still determined
by their isomorphous relations. In investigating the biological reactions of com-
pounds of forty-two of the elements but two exceptions have been met with to the
 conclusions above stated connecting molecular constitution with biological action.
One of these exceptions (beryllium) is associated with other anomalous molecular
reactions of the element. The connection of these facts with the normal reactions
of living matter will be considered, and also their bearing on investigations on the

molecular structure of bodies.
      In conclusion, the author shows that the objections that have been brought

forward to his results have been founded either on imperfect methods of research
or a false interpretation of facts.

3. Supplement to the Paper ' On the Causes and Resxdts of assumed Cycloidal
   Rotation in Arterial Bed Discs' ^ By Snrg.-Major R. W. Woollcombe.

     The author wishes to record further, that although he then for illustration
cited the fact of rotation about the shortest diameter being manifested by ' the
rolling on their edges of irregularly shaped leaves, or of scraps of paper on the
ground before the wind,' yet he has since found that the above law of rotation
obtains even further than he supposed, and to such a degree that he considers it
disposes of the objection that certain discs, as those of the ' Camelidae ' and ' Aves '

having peripheries not circular but more or less elliptical, would not be likely to
rotate. The author has found that flat chips of wood, of even rhomboidal
periphery, roU freely on the edge when impelled by sufficient wind along such a
surface as the horizontal woodwork of a pier, the difference between the move-
ment of such a departure from the circular, and that of a circular periphery, being
less visible iu the rotation than in the translation, the latter being of a proportionally
interrupted kind. The difference between a rhomboidal and a circular periphery
being so much greater than that between a circular and an elliptical, it appears to
the author the objection referred to vanishes, viz. that the latter (in the ' Aves '
and ' Camelidse ') would not be likely to have rotation. The author would suggest
the possibility that in the ' Aves ' and ' Camelidse ' a less continuous and more inter-
rupted impingement of the red disc on the nervous and muscular tissue, for their

due stimulation, may be in request. Referring again to the paper in the ' B. A.

Report of 1881,' where the author points out that, if there be rotation of red

discs it must be wholly suppressed when the capillaries are reached, and then and
there appear as heat, he would venture to ask if this supposition does not offer
a reasonable view that may account for the missing link in the otherwise accepted
theory of animal heat ? The imaccounted portion is alleged to be but small, and
such only would probably be the increment from the suppression of the rotation

--by the capillaries the locality where the wanting increment has to be looked for.

     By Professor Windle, M.A., M.D., and John Humphreys, L.D.S.L
    Teeth beyond the ordinary number may occur in the incisive portion of the

--dental series. Such teeth may fall into one of two categories viz., supplemental,

that is, incisiform though generally smaller than the ordinary incisors ; and super-

numerary, which are conical and do not conform to any human dental type. Similar

teeth have been observed in other parts of the dental series also. Eustachius,

Hunter, Meckel, Owen, and others have mentioned the occurrence of these extra-

numerary teeth. Wedl (' Pathologic der Zahne ') gives a good description of them,
stating that wliilst six incisors are very rare, five ai-e of more common occurrence,
the additional tooth, when of the supplemental group, being generally a lateral

incisor. "When supernumerary they are placed either amongst the permanent teeth

or behind them within the alveolar arch. Their eruption takes place during the

first or second dentition, or in the interval between the two generally, however,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

they belong to the permanent series. Baume (' Odontologische Forschungen ') states
his belief that the archaic incisor dentition of man was In and that the missing

teeth are the median lUj in each case. This theory he bases upon the facts (1)

that a separation may exist between the median incisors in man and the higher
apes^ and (2) that in this position superfluous teeth may exist. Dr. Edwards, of

Madrid, shares his opinion for somewhat similar reasons. Professor Turner, from

a study of a number of cases of alevolar cleft palate, believes the missing incisor to

be the second, that is, In,,. This view is shared hj Albrecht and Andrew Wilson.

    The groups which we describe are as foUows :

  --(Series i.) Su])plemental teeth. In this group we have one case of six separate

incisors (sup. max.), and one of six, the two central being geminous, and seven

in which there were five teeth. Of these seven three were on the right, four on the
left side. In all the cases save one they were situated behind the true lateral,

generally occasioning some displacement. In one case, however, the intruder was
placed between the lateral and central. One case only belonged to the milk denti-

--Wetion, and all but one were found in the upper jaw.
(Series ii.) Svjjernumerary teeth.                             have four casts in which there are two of

these teeth :  in two they were situated behind the median incisors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   in another one

was posterior to the left lateral, and a second between the right median and lateral

and in the fourth one was posterior to the right central, and the second between
the two median. In fifteen cases there was one supernumerary. These teeth were

situated inside the alveolar arch posterior to the left median incisor in seven cases,

the right in five, and in the middle line in three instances. They generally caused

more or less displacement of the remaining teeth. All were found in the superior

maxilla, and all belonged to the permanent series.

  --(Series iii.) Coexistence of suppletnenf.al and supernumerary with the normal

number of incisors. Of this we have one specimen, in which a properly formed

though small incisor is placed behind the right lateral, and in series with it, and a

blunt tooth posterior to the left median, which it displaces forward. This was in

superior maxilla and permanent series.

  --(Series iv.) Substitution of a siipernumerary tooth for a nonnal incisor, the

nu7nber of teeth remaining four. Of this we have four specimens. The substitu-

tion was once each for the right and left median, and twice for the left lateral.

All the cases belonged to the superior maxilla and to the permanent series.

  --(Series v.) Substitution of tico superyvumerary teeth for normal incisors, the

number of teeth remaining four. Of this we have six cases, the two lateral superior

incisors of the permanent series being those always to suffer.

  --(Series vi.) Absence of one incisor, the number being three. In two cases the

right lateral (superior) incisor was wanting, and in one the same tooth in the in-
ferior maxilla. All three were of the permanent series.

      (Series vii.) Absence of one incisor, diminution or malformation of another, the

number being three.--Oi this we have three cases. In two the right lateral was
absent. The left lateral was conical in one of these, small but incisiform in the
other. In the third case the left lateral was absent and the right lateral small

though incisiform. All were of the superior maxilla and permanent series.

   --(Series viii.) Absence of tivo incisors, the number being reduced to two. Of this

we have seven cases, all belonging to the superior maxilla and pfrmanen*^. series.

690 REPOBT-- 1886.

In all the laterals are the missing teeth. The jaws are generally well formed, and

there are often gaps between the teeth in the incisor region. The ages of four of

these patients were 21, 22, 22, and 17 respectively ; of the others we have no

exact information, but they were adults.

The points which these cases illustrate are as follows :

--(i.) Mmi's original dentition included six incisors. This thesis is already fairly

generally admitted by odontologists. If supplemental and supernumerary teeth are

to be regarded as reversions to the primitive dentition, then in two cases we have,

so far as the superior maxilla is concerned, the complete series. Galton, Wilson,

Flower, and Edwards also quote cases of six incisors in the upper jaw. Kirk de-

scribes one which occurred in the inferior maxilla and in the milk series. As Wedl

remarks, however, the occurrence of six incisors is rare. That of five is, on the
contrary, fairly common. "What has just been said relates to supplemental teeth,

but, as will be seen by a reference to the digest of the series above, a supple-

mental and supernumerary may coexist to increase the number of the dentition to
six, or two or one supernumeraries may coexist with the normal four incisors.

That a milk supplemental may be followed by a permanent successor is proved by
a case for which we are indebted to Mr. Amoore. This is interesting as bearing on

the development of these teeth. We may sum up by saying that man seldom

attains to the archaic dentition of In | in the upper jaw, still more rarely in the

lower, never, so far as we are aware, in both simultaneously. On the other hand,

in fairly numerous cases, he regains one of his lost teeth, either ill- or well-formed,

or both, in an imperfectlj^ formed condition.

  --(ii.) Man's lost incisor is the lateral or In^. Baume and Edwards consider the

lost tooth to be In,, mainly on account of a supposed separation existing between

the two median. This separation is, in our experience at least, by no means

common. Again, in all our cases, whatever teeth are added or suppressed, the

Wemedians remain typical in shape.  have also casts showing that the ordinary

laterals may take up a position behind the median. This shows that teeth found

in this position need not necessarily be abortive medians. These facts, we be-

lieve, dispose of the median theory. Two other arguments, shortly to be men-

tioned, also make against it. Turner and Wilson's theory, that the niissing incisor
Weis In.-,, is much more tenable.
                                   are unable at present to explain the facts quoted

by the former authority, but would venture to put forward the following arguments

in support of our position :

    1. Tomes bases his theory that the dentition of man was In | on the fact that

Homalodontotherium possessed that nimiber of teeth, and that the transition from

incisors to canine was thus rendered more gradual. Upon these grounds he be-
lieves that lug is the lost tooth. Now, if we suppose that luj or In^ is missing

the force of this argument falls to the groimd, unless we believe that, pari passu

with their suppression, the others became modified in shape, which there are not

facts to prove.

  -- --2. It has long been held and we have fresh facts to show its truth that the

present lateral incisor is now being suppressed. This being so, it seems more reason-

able to suppose that the tooth already lost is that which lay behind the present

lateral in the original series.

  -- --3. Finally and this is the most important argument wherever the dentition

is increased by two or one incisors, the superadded teeth are behind the laterals, that
is, are lUg. This is shown in the case where six are present, and still better in
one case of five, where the superadded tooth is obviously In,, has no fellow on the

opposite side, and affords a perfect example of a tooth bridging over the gap
between incisors and canine.

-- (iii.) The loss of incisors is due to the contraction of the anterior parts of the jaw.
   It is well known that the jaws of civilised races are less well developed than those

of uucivihsed, and that amongst the former the lower have better shaped alveolar

arches than the upper classes. These facts are dealt with by Darwin, Herbert

WeSpencer, Oakley Coles, Cartwright, Coleman, Mummery, and Mcholls.  have

not had an opportunity of working out the poii:t satisfactorily, but believe this

contraction to take place most markedly in the incisive region. Topinard states

that of the various shapes of alveolar arch the elliptical is most commonly met with
amongst inferior, the parabolic amongst superior races ; and the former appears to
us to afford a far more roomy incisive region than the lattei". Callender, in a paper
on the ' So-called Serpent Teeth,' has shown how the contraction of the incisive

region may occur by arrested growth of the incisive process of the superior maxilla.

"We suggest that the diminished necessity for the incisors when food is eaten after

having been cooked carefully may account for this suppression.                  Cope pre-

Ini C| P§ M|,

and this view is shared by other authorities quoted above.
     Our series iv.-viii. inclusive bear out this theory very strikingly. In iv. there

are cases in which three well- and one ill-formed incisors are present. In v. two
well- and two ill-formed coexist. In vi. one tooth has disappeared. In vii. one is
missing, a second malformed, and finally, in viii., two are missing. It will be
noticed that of twenty-three cases in these series two only affect the median incisors.
Three of the cases are interesting as forming a family group : the eldest, F., set. 22,
has only the two medians ; the second, F., aet. 20, has lost the right lateral ; and
the third, I., ret. 17, like the eldest, has no laterals.

   --(v.) The conical teeth frequently observed are a reversion to the pi-imitive type of

tooth. It is interesting to note that in the cases of reversion to the archetype or

of gradual suppression, a tooth unable to reach full development may remain of the

conical form characteristic of lower dentitions than the human. This reversion is

not peculiar to man, as we have a skull of a Midas Rosalia in which an additional

premolar of a conical shape exists on one side.
     To sum up, our conclusions are as follows:

      1. Man's original dentition included six incisors.

      2. Man's lost incisor is the lateral or lUg.
     8. The loss of these incisors is due to the contraction of the incisive region of

the alveolar arch.

     4. Suppression of the two present lateral incisors, in the upper jaw at least, is

at present taking place.

but rather towards one most nearly represented in the adult males of the living

                              By Professor Howes, F.L.S.

    Two case.s were described. In one a supernumerary (Xtli) vertebra was de-

veloped, wliicli had usurped the function of the true sacral one ; the latter had
established its custoruary connections on one side only, and the accessory processes
to be accounted for were shown to be the residtants of an attempt to make good
the loss by failure to do so on the other. In the second case the urostyle had
' slipped ' and w^as displaced dorsally. Instead of becoming buried in the adjacent

soft tissues, or ankylosed to the neighbouring bony ones, it had entered into a new

--connection with the sacrum the body of which was prolonged upwardly into two

new articular facets. The process was held to be tantamount to that of reproduc-
tion of a lost part so familiar among invertebrates.

Observations on this subject were brought before the notice of the British

Association in 1883, the complete account being published in ' Nature ' for

November 1 in that year (p. 20). The abnormality had been then traced through
six generations, and the stock in which it appeared through two earlier generations.

The observations have been continued from 1883 until the present time, resulting

in a large addition to the eighth generation, which now contains five families, and in
Athe appearance of one family in a ninth generation.
                                                      very high proportion of

abnormality continues in the recent families, and in the latest of all there are two

kittens with seven toes on the forepaws and six on the hind ; while in the last

family of the eighth generation one kitten possessed seven toes on each forefoot

--and seven on one hind foot, with six on the other the greatest abnormality which

has come under my observation, although an even larger amount (seven on botU

hind feet) is on record in the same stock.

3. On the Artificial Prorhiction of a Gilded Appearance in certain Lepi-

   A few years ago Mr. T. W. Wood brought before the notice of the Entomo-

logical Society of London some proofs that certain pupte resemble the colour of the
surface upon which pupation takes place. This conclusion was received with some
incredulity by many leading entomologists, but without sufficient reason. For the
last few years I have been working upon the colour of larvfe in relation to the

colour of their surroundings, and I have shown that the colour may be modified

in one generation (in certain species) by an appropriate alteration of the surround-
ings. It seemed very probable from these experiments that the larvse were affected
by their surroundings through some sensory surface, and that by means of a nervous
circle a corresponding colour effect was wrought. It appeared to be very likely
that Mr. Wood's observations were but a special case of those general methods of

protection which I had been investigating. Mr. Wood explained his observations

by supposing that the moist surface of a freshly exposed pupa was photographically

sensitive to the colour of surrounding surfaces. Such an explanation appears to be
merely a metaphor borrowed from photography, and it is furthermore unsupported
by any proofs. There is, in fact, much a priori exception to be talien to it, inasmuch
as it implies that all those pupas which throw off the larval skin on a dark night

must lose the advantages of this form of protective resemblance. It is much more

probable that the effect is produced by the action of surrounding colours upon the

larva during the time (long enough to include many liours of daylight) in which

the latter rests upon the surface where pupation will take place. In the first place,

I made many experiments in order to test the accuracy of Mr. "Wood's observations,
resulting, as I had anticipated, in the most complete confirmation. Among the
pupae experimented upon was that of the common tor'toiseshell butterfly ( Vanessa
urticce). It was found that by causing pupation to take place upon a white or
black screen very different results could be produced. The pupse upon the white

screen were often brilliantly golden, and quite unlike all the ordinary forms assumed
by this species, and well known to entomologists. (Juriously enough, however, the
pupse of this and other species, which are full of parasitic larvre of ichneumons,
and which can never produce butterflies, are often as brightly gilded as those upon

which I experimented. But my pupte were perfectly healthy and produced normal

butterflies. Considering the effects of ray first experiments, it appeared probable

that an artificially gilded surface would produce even stronger results than a white
screen, and experiment soon confirmed this prediction. Such a result seems to

imply that the metallic lustre of many e.xposed pupse harmonised with equally
brilliant objects among the vegetal oV, more probably, the mineral surroundings.

     The next point was to ascertain the period during which the larva was sensitive,

and incidentally to confirm in the mOist complete way my suggestion that these

effects are due to the larva itself, and^ not to the freshly formed pupa. These

objects were achieved by transplanting the larva at various periods before pupation
from one surface to another, which wasXknown to produce an opposite effect.

--It was thus found that the larvae are sensitive for many hours even more than a
--day before pupation takes place. It was then necessary to ascertain if possible

the nature of the larval sensory surface whichis affected by surrounding colours
and, first of all, the ocelli were eliminated by covering them with an opaque varnish
(renewed if necessary), but this treatment did no\ afliect the result. Equally in-
effectual was the result of snipping oft' the larval Ijristles, which it was thought
might possibly contain the desired sense-organ. Then another method was adopted :
as soon as the larvae suspended themselves head downwards (many hours before

the change takes place), they were surrounded bj' tubes so constructed that the
head and anterior part of the larva were contained in a gilt chamber, while the
rest of the body was surrounded by black walls, tending to produce an opposite
eflect, the two compartments being separated by a perforated disc which just
allowed the larval body to pass through. The head in the lower chamber was
always turned on one side, so that the colour of the upper compartment could not
possibly affect it. In other cases the colours of the compartments were reversed.

When I first looked at the pupse in these tubes I fully believed that the colours

followed those of the chamber in which the larval bead had been, and I was much

-- --puzzled by this, inasmuch as the only likely sense-organ the ocelli had been

already eliminated by previous experiments. But when the pupjp were taken out

of the tubes, and placed side by side upon white paper, I found that the efiects I
have described were entirelj^ tnisleadiug, being due to reflection from the walls of

the lower chamber when gilt, and to a dark appearance due to the surrounding
black surface in the other cases. The negative result obtained seems to indicate
that the sense organ exists in the skiu, or that possibly the light acts in a more
direct way upon the larval skin without the intervention of the nervous system.
The full results of the investigation will not, however, be obtained until an
immense amount of work has been bestowed upon the notes made during these
experiments, in which many hundreds of individuals have been employed.^

 4. Some Experiments iipon the Protection of Insects from their Unemics by
       means of an- tmpleasant taste or smell. By E. B. Poulton, AI.A.

     When working up the historical side of this question my attention was directed

 towards the necessity for further experiments. Wallace had predicted that bril-

--liantly coloured aud conspicuous insects would be refused by the ordinary verte-

 brate enemies of their class that, in fact, the gaudy colouring acts as a warning

 of the existence of something unpleasant about its possessor. Conversely, Wallace
 argued that insects which were protectively coloured, resembling their surround-
 ings, would be eaten when detected. It appeared that experiments (conducted by
 Mr. Jeuner Weir aud others) yielded the most complete proof of the existence of

these sharp distinctions. But on thinking the whole subject over it seemed to me

 that the acquisition of an unpleasant taste or smeU, together with a conspicuous
 appearance, was so simple a mode of protection and yet, ej: hypothesi, so absolutely
 complete, that it is remarkable that more species have not availed themselves of

this means of defence. What could be the principle which worked in antagonism
to this mode of protection? For in Wallace's theory no suggestion of a true

 counterbalancing limit appeared, i.e., one which increased with the increasing
application of this method of defence until the latter was checked, or for the time
being rendered of no avail, or even turned into an absolute danger. But if a very

common insect, constituting the chief food of one or more vertebrates, gained an

unpleasant taste, the latter animals might be forced to devour the disagreeable

 objects in order To avoid starvation. And the same thing might readily happen if

 a scarce and hard-pressed form adopted the same line and so became dominant,

after ousting many species which were much eaten by vertebrates. If once the

 vertebrate enemies were driven to eat such an insect in spite of the unpleasant
taste, they would certainly soon acquire a relish for what was previously disagree-
 able, and then the insects would be in great danger of extermination if in the mean-
 time they had become conspicuous by gaining warning colours. If this reasoning be

 correct it follows that this mode of defence is not necessarily perfect, and that it
 depends for its apparently complete success upon the existence of relatively abundant
palatable forms. In other words, its employment must be strictly limited. In order

to test my argument I determined to experiment with a view to ascertain whether

hunger would drive a vertebrate to eat an insect which was evidently unpleasant to it.
 I obtained a few different species of Italian lizards and some tree-frogs, and very soon
found that I had reasoned correctly. The lizards would often refuse a conspicuous
insect at first, with all the signs of repugnance, but would afterwards make the
best of it, when they were not supplied with other food which they liked better.
 I sometimes found this to be the case with species (e.g., larva P. iiiicephnlus) to
 which other observers have ascribed the most complete immunitv. I should add

that it has been always recognised that an insect may be distasteful to one
vertebrate enemy but palatable to another, and to this extent Wallace admits a
limit to the application of his principle of defence. But the limit which I have
proved is of course entirely different, for I have shown that the vertebrate may be

forced to eat the insect, although tinpalatable to it. Although the latter limit is
thus quite distinct, it would certainly in time become identical with the former, for,
as I have argued above, the unpalatable forms when eaten would soon become

palatable. I have, in fact, shown how the limit which Wallace himself admits has
g» rown up, and how it may become a counterbalancing principle, working against

and perhaps reversing the principle which he was the first to point out as of
general application in insects. Some quite new modes of defence came out during
the inquiry. Thus size alone seems to act as a protection : a large moth (»S'. ligustri),
evidently palatable and quite harmless, was untouched by small lizards, but eaten

by larger ones. Again, it is probable that a species may acquire protection by

causing digestive troubles after being eaten, rather than by having an unpleasant

taste, and it may be that the former effect would leave an even more indelible
effect than the latter upon the memory of the captor. Some experiments with the

frogs rendered this conclusion probable (E. Jacohmm imago being used).

    Another result at first surprised me very much ; it was a limitation to the
                                                                                                                       :

universal application of Wallace's second prediction. I found tliat certain species
which are well protected by resembling their surroundings, were nevertheless also

protected by an unpleasant taste (e.g., larva of M. Ttjpica, imago of P. Bucephalus)

and were only eaten with reluctance in the absence of other food.

myI have given a brief abstract of the results of               experiments, which on the

whole confirm the general principles which Wallace laid down, but show that

there are other principles which may work in antagonism and prevent the applica-

tion of the former, or may even reverse their action. I have also shown that these

two methods of protection are not always sharply demarcated or mutually exclusive,

as was previously believed to be the case.

5. On the Nature and Causes of Variation in Plants.^ 5// Patrick Geddes.

In this paper (a preliminary outline of a more extended analysis underlying

the waiter's essay on ' "Variation and Selection,' in preparation for a forthcoming

volume of the ' Encyclopfedia Britannica') it was first pointed out that while the

fact of the origin of species by evolution was no longer disputed, nor the operation

of natural selection upon organic forms any longer denied, the absence of any

general theory or rationale of variation in either the animal or the vegetable world

was not only generally admitted, but often regarded as inevitable or even hopeless

variation to some writers being  simply  '  spontaneous  '  or  '                                            ;  '  to  others, if

                                                                   accidental

not fortuitous, at least dependent upon causes lying beyond our present powers of

analysis.

   A theory of variation must deal alike with the origin of specific distinctions or

those vaster differences which characterise the larger groups. To commence, then,
-- Howwith the latter, we may propose such questions as, e.c/. (1)
                                                                    comes an axis to be

Howarrested to form a flower ? "(2)      is the evolution of the forms of inflorescence

Howto be accounted for ? (3)     does perigyny or epigyny arise from hypogyny ?

How(4) is the reduction of the oophore and differentiation of the sporophore to be
explained among cryptogams and phanerogams, and why should the moss type be

Howso abeiTant and so comparatively arrested ? (5)          do angiosperms arise frora

Howgymnosperms ? (6)  are the forms of fungi, algae, &c., to be accounted for P

and so on. The explanation was shown to lie not in the operation of natural selection

upon accidental variation, requiring separate explanation in every case, but upon

that general and familiar antagonism between reproduction and vegetative growth

further analysed (in the wi-iter's subsequent paper ' On the Theory of Sex and Re-

production,' and ' Encyclopaedia Britannica ' article Sex) to its basis in the con-

structive and destructive metabolism of protoplasm. It was shown by the aid of

diagrams that in all such cases as those above mentioned, the reproductive axis,

organ, tissue, &c., in every case tended to become more and more shortened,

depressed, or hollowed in proportion to the vegetative. This conception was

further developed, and shown to apply alike to the construction of the general

genealogical tree, and in particular to the affinities of the flowering plants ; and

very frequently to the interpretation of minute details of floral structure usually

regarded as the product of natural selection on spontaneous local variations, the

common Geranium sylvaticum being selected as a case in point.

11. Points in the Development of the Pectoral Fin and Girdle in Teleosteans.

                                 By Edward E. Pkince.

At a Tery early stage, and long before liberation from the ovum, the pectoral

fins can be distinguished in Osseous Fishes as a pair of flattened pads projecting

horizontally from the trunk, some distance behind the otocysts. Their position

seems to vary in different species,^ but a considerable interval always separates the

early fins from the auditory organs, or rather from the true pectoral region. They

are differentiations of a continuous lateral expansion of epiblast passing along each

side of the trunk, and are formed by the folding of this epiblastic layer upon itself

at the point where the fins appear. Each fin consists therefore of two epiblastic

lamellcB (separated by a fissure) lying flat upon the vitellus, and continuous with

the extra-embryonic blastodermic membrane. The fins soon assume a denser

appearance as mesoblastic cells push their way into the median fissure, separating

the upper from the lower lamella of the fin. These mesoblastic cells are certainly

not splanchnopleuric, but as no well-marked somatopleuric crest has been recognised

in fishes comparable to the Wolffian ridge of higher forms, they seem to be derived

from the intermediate cell-mass in close proximity to the Wolffian ducts.

As the fin becomes stouter its position alters, its lengthy lateral attachment to

the trunk diminishes, while it becomes pedunculate and stands erect, though not

quite vertically. The distal portion of the fin is very thin and transparent, save at

the periphery, where, at the junction of the upper and lower lamella, the epiblast

cells are approximated so as to form a marginal ridge probably connected with

the subsequent development of dermal fin-rays.

Meanwhile the fin progresses over the interval before mentioned to a point

immediately behind the auditory organs, and the well-known rotation of the fin is

accomplished, so that it now projects obliquely in a dorso-ventral direction almost

parallel to the plane of the branchial arches in front.

The gradual shifting of the fin from its original place brings it into close relation

with a band of mesoblastic cells, which passes obliquely behind the otocysts, and is

called by Ryder the ' oblique or vertical pectoral fold.' In this fold cartilage-cells

appear, and extend dorsally and ventrally. To the cartilaginous pectoral bar, thus

formed, the fin-plate becomes attached, and simultaneously a median stratum of

mesoblast in the latter is converted into cartilage, which, by its basal portion,

articulates with the girdle. It is noteworthy that each half of the pectoral arch

.originates independently, nor do' they approach each other in the middle ventral

Aline until a much later stage.  strong plate of translucent ectochondral bone,

like a curved bar of chitin, develops and becomes attached to the scapulo-coracoid

rod, and the subsequent reduction of the latter (the primary cartilaginous girdle)

produces much complication in the adult structure.

Without desiring to lay undue stress upon the suggestions afforded by the

development of the anterior limb and its girdle in forms so highly specialised as

the Osseous Fishes, it is still of interest to note their bearing upon accepted theories

as to the true nature of the fin and its related arch.

Support is thus certainly given to the continuous lateral-fin theory of Balfour,

for the fins arise in connection with longitudinal epiblastic ridges extending in a

horizontal plane ^ fi-om the trunk of the embryo, while their independent origin is

adverse to Gegenbaur's view that they spring from a branchial arch and are

modified gill-arch elements. Owen, more than a quarter of a century ago, com-

pared the branchiostegal rays springing from the hyoid arch to the ' pectoral fin

aiverging from the htemal arch ' {i.e., the pectoral girdle) ; but Balfour's view (which
is also that of Dohrn and Mivart) receives more countenance from Teleostean

embryology. Dohrn, however, not only regards the fins as aggregations of a long

lateral fin ; but supposes that the coalesced fins became connected with underlying
gill-arches which ancestrally extended beyond their present limits. Gegenbaur

     ' The forms especially referred to by the writer are certain species of Gadvs,
Pleuronectes, Cottus, &c., studied at the Marine Laboratory, St. Andrews.

     - This position is, according to Gegenbaur's view, secondary, whereas in Teleo-
steans it seems to be primary, and the vertical position is assumed secondarily.
698 KEPOET-- 1886.

also derives the pectoral girdle from a branchial arch, and, according to both
authorities, this arch must have shifted to the surface from a deeper plane of
origin, for the girdle is essentially a superficially placed structure. The visceral
cleft system arises more deeply, and is hypohlastic, the gill-arches being developed
in the splanchnopleure, whereas the cartilaginous pectoral girdle is somatopleuric,
if the cells, from which it originates, are to be distinguished from the adjacent

intermediate-cell mass. There are many difficulties in deriving the fin from

branchial arch appendages, even so primitive a girdle as that of Ceratodus having
no directly articulating rays, comparable to branchiostegal elements, and there are

difficulties no less in assigning a branchial origin to the shoulder-girdle itself. The
girdle arises as two separate rods, external to the heart and the alimentary tube,
and passing dorso-ventrally. Its two elements originate, indeed, precisely like a

pair of strongly developed ribs, for the ribs begin as ossifications at independent
centres in the intermuscular septa, and grow both ways, dorsally to unite with the

vertebral bodies, and ventrally to meet or remain separate, as the case may be. In

--exactly the same way the scapular and coracoidal halves of the pectoral bars

develop to subserve the same function viz., that of providing a support in connec-
tion with the movements of the body.

     The attachment of the pectoral girdle to the skull recalls the connection of un-
doubted rib-elements with the skull in Carps and Siluroids. Can we not refer the
two halves of the pectoral girdle to the axial skeleton as strengthened and modified
costal rods,' possibly equivalent to many coalesced ribs, to which the fins, originating
independently, become secondarily attached ? It is significant that the Cyclostomes
are destitute of ribs, and they possess no limbs and this accords with the above

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

suggestion, for if no ribs exist, no limb-girdle could be developed from them. In
the Selachians it is noteworthy that the ribs seem to have sufiered great degenera-
tion. Whether a costal or branchial origin be attributed to the pectoral girdle, the
appended limbs are wholly separate structures, and only become related to it after
changes in shape, position, and function of the most remarkable character.

           12. Some Remarks on the Egg-Memhranes of Osseous Fishes.

                          By Robert Scharff, Ph.D., B.Sc.

      It is no doubt due to the transparence and the extreme smallness of the objects

that so many difierent opinions prevail on the structure of the Teleostean ovum.
All authors, however, agree that a membrane surrounds the egg, which in many
if not in all cases, is pierced \>j minute canals or pores. The name most generally
adopted by zoologists for this membrane is ' zonaradiata,' which I think is a much
more suitable one than ' vitelline membrane,' or ' yolk sac,' for reasons which I shall

 give presently.

     In the ovum of the gurnard {Trigla gurnardus) I could distinctly see with a
high power a very delicate homogeneous membrane internally to the ' zona radiata.'

In the ripe egg, or rather in the fully-grown intra-ovarian egg, it covers the proto-

plasmic layer known as the ' Eindenschicht,' or * periblast,' which is one of the
later modifications of the yolk. Ransom was the first observer who not only saw
a similar membrane in various Teleostean eggs, but also isolated it. Some of the
later observers failed to make it out ; others, again, confirm Ransom's observations.
As long as any doubts exist as to presence or absence of this inner ' yolk sac ' of
Ransom, the ' zona radiata ' should not be called a vitelline membrane. The latter
term, however, might veiy well be applied to the inner membrane which I have
just mentioned. It corresponds to a cell-membrane, and is, therefore to be con-
 sidered as a vitelline membrane.

      In the gurnard as well as in the cat-fish {Anarrhichas lupus) the zona radiata
showed an external portion which stained darker, and through which the pores
piercing the inner part were apparently continued. This outer part was sometimes

      ' Prof. Humphry, of Cambridge, hinted at a connection of certain elements in
 the coalesced lateral fins (that is to saj, the median longitudinal fins) and the ribs,

separated from the inner in cross-sections, and the pores were frequently obliterated
by numerous very fine granules contained in it. In the ripe egg of the cod ( Gadus
morrhua) only one thin membrane is visible, which, as far as I could ascertain,

is not porous. I am not quite convinced that the pores are really absent in this
case, as I only examined spirit specimens, but it occurred to me that what we see

here is really only the outer denser part of the zona radiata, the inner portion
having become absorbed during development. That such a thing might happen
has been fully demonstrated by Balfour in the e^^ of Scyllium. Balfour's vitelUue

membrane is equivalent to the outer part of the zona just mentioned. Both of
these seem to become absorbed in some of the Elasmobranch eggs during later

development.

    With regard to the Teleosteans I might mention that, in case the presence of a
true vitelline membrane should be definitely established in all intra-ovarian eggs,

the zona radiata is to be regarded as a cuticxdar formation of the ovum.
     Every intra-ovarian egg is surrounded by the follicle or granulosa, which is a

cellular layer. In a paper which I propose to publish shortl}^, the formation of
the yolk will be I'uUy considered along with some remarkable changes which take
place in the nucleus of the growing egg.

The following Papers were read :

           1. On Humboldtia laurifolia as a Myrinehopliilous Plant.
                              By Professor F. O. Bower.

It is already well known that the hollowed and swollen internodes of Hum-

boldtia laurifolia are inhabited by smaD black ants. The questions which present
-- Howthemselves with regard to this symbiosis are 1st,
                                                         do the hollows originate ?

2nd, Is the presence of the ants of any advantage to the plant ? An investigation

of young shoots shows that the opening, through which the ants enter, is formed

by rupture of the superficial tissues, owing apparently to pressure from within,

and that the ants thus gain access to and hollow out the pith which had previously
begun to decay. Thus the plants take the initiative, and the ants are not slow to

avail themselves of the opportunitj^ oti'ered. Further, from the numerous glands

on the leaves it is probable that they derive food, and are thus supplied with both

nourishment and lodging. No evidence is forthcoming, however, that the symbiosis
is of any advantage to the plant. The stipules in this plant are of a peculiar form

a study of their development shows that a peculiar auricle-like outgrowth is formed
at the base of the simple, young stipule, subsequently to the origin of the latter.
Though this assumes a peculiar, almost sagittate form, still in its real nature it is
similar to those auricles which are formed at the base of the stipules of Fiola

tricolor.

            2. On Positively Geotropic Shoots in Cordyline australis.
                                By Professor F. O. Bower.

     It was noticed in Peradeniya Gardens that when, by reason of the weight of
the head of leaves, stems of Cordyline australis assumed an oblique or horizontal
position, shoots were formed from the lower side pointing directly downwards. It

was ascertained that these were in their origin axillary. By hanging pots of soil

in such a position as to immerse the tips of these shoots, an elaborate root system
was soon formed, the roots arising in the usual manner. In the cases observed the
apex of the shoots remained covered with scale leaves, and the ultimate fate of it

is uncertain. It is clear that here we have a special adaptation for mechanical
and physiological support of a weakly axis, and in this respect we may compare

that in CWdyline shoots are the members employed, while roots are used in the
other cases named.

        G. Two Fungous Diseases of Plants. By W. B. Grove, B.A.

     The first was the ' Eucharis disease,' which has been shown by the author to
be due to the fundus, Sacc/uiromi/ces f/lutinis. It attacks other bulbs besides
Eucharis, and may be known by producing reddish spots. It can be killed by
growing the bulbs in a considerable heat, or by sulphide of potassium.

     The second was a 'Viola disease,' attacking cultivattd species of Viola. It is
due to an QEcidium and its accompanying Puccinia, known respectively aa
(Ecidium depauperans and Puccinia ayru. It has only been observed in two or
three districts, as yet; and does considerably more harm to its hosts than the
similar disease which is common on Yiota canina.

          7. Preliminary Notes on the Autumnal Fall of Leaves.

                By Professor W. Hillhouse, M.A., F.L.S.

  --So far as these experimental investigations commenced in the autumn of 1882
--and stiU in progress are concerned, the question of the autumnal fall of leaves has

been approached from two standpoints.

(1) The mechanism of leaf-fall.

--(2) The transfer of the cell-contents from the leaf.

(1) The Mechanism of Laf-fidl. It appears to be certain that the dissociation

of leaf and branch takes place by the formation, by means of renewed cell-division

in the basal plane of the leaf-stalk, of a layer of cells, which the author proposes to

call the ahscies-layer. The absciss-layer is produced by new dividing walls being

formed across the cellular tissue of the base of the leaf-stalk. It is clearly recog-

nisable, not merely by means of these walls, but also by its marked quantity of pro-

toplasm, and the presence usually of numerous small grains of starch. The exact

position of the absciss-layer slightly varies, always outside the periderm line of the

branch, and usually sloping inwards and upwards. It is formed usually very shortly

before the fall of the leaf. In some cases no absciss-layer is formed, and the leaf

does not fall normally. The formation of the absciss-layer may be either preceded,

sometimes by a fair interval of time, or succeeded by "the formation, on the stem

side of it, of a periderm                                                                                        this likewise by new dividing cells being formed in a pre-
                                                                                                              ;

existing cellular tissue. This periderm lies usually more or less in the line of that

of the branch, and becomes continuous with it. The cells outside the periderm

shrivel.

     The author's experiments tend to show that the fall of the leaf arises from
the increased turgescence of the cells of the abscis.s-layer, owing to their osmotic
activity. These become strongly rounded ; their adhesion equally diminishes.
                                                               ;

TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                     701

 This turgescfince appears to aris§ from root-activity continuing, after the transpira-
 tion, or rather conducting, power of the leaf, for reasons hereafter noted, has been
in the main lost. The presence of water in the living cells of the absciss-layer is

so much the greater from their being bounded by cells which are practically dead
 and whereas the rounding of two living cells in contact need not destroy their power
 of cohesion, the rounding of a living cell in contact with one which is dead would

 probably cause complete separation.

      The soft elements of the vascular bundles are eitherpinched, or else cell-division
takes place in them also. The lignified elements undergo changes, the nature of

which I am not yet able to explain satisfactorily, and then rupture with the strain.

   --(2) The transfer of the cell-cordents from the leaf. In leaves about to fall,

 starch is always found in the sieve-tubes, mainly collected in cloudy, granular-

looking masses in the neighbourhood of the sieve-plates. With iodine these grains
do not stain violet, but brown or reddish-brown. The accumulation is commonly
'greatest on the leaf side of the sieve-plate. To be devoid of starch is usually the

first sign of a leaf being ready to fall. In all cases where tannin is present in the
 leaf, it is present, and with the same distribution, in the fallen leaf. Tannin and
starch are especially abundant in what I will call the food-layer at the base of the
leaf-stalk, in which the absciss-layer and cork-layer are formed. In naturally fallen

leaves starch is rarely found, except right at the very base of the stalk, and then in
very small grains. Taking in all cases precautions against prematurely fallen

 leaves, perfect nuclei are comparatively rare in fallen leaves, though in some cases
 (e.g., Salishuria adiantifolia, Acer j^latanoides, Catalpa bignonioides, Quercus pedun-
culata, and Ficus Carica) perfect nuclei are general in blade and petiole. Cells
containing no nuclei have, however, very commonly a number of larger or smaller
irregidar fragments of proteid matter, staining deeply with ammonia-carmine or

methyl-green. In many cases, where the nuclei are apparently perfect, they show
manifest granularity, and often irregularity of outline. The evidence tends thus to
show that the nucleus, or at least the chromatin, is left behind in the empty cell,
the nucleus tending to what we will call ' disintegration,' as distinguished from
' fragmentation ' or direct division, this latter being by no means a sign of the death
of the cell. Nor does disintegration bear any relation with the fragments of
nuclear substance found in many pollen-tubey which show no nucleus, nor with the
scattered small grains, which perhaps replace the nucleus in many Chroococcacese,
Nostocacese, &c. Perhaps a strict classification would require to divide the terms

* direct division ' from ' fragmentation,' botli possible in living cells.

      It is interesting to note in this connection that from the leaves of the few ever-
greens that I have thoroughly studied, starch is likewise usually absent in winter,
being transferred to the stem, the tannin, on the other hand, remaining behind.

                  By Professor W. Hillhouse, M.A., F.L.S.

     This bacteriad is especially foimd on decaying algse, &c., in sulphur springs and
waters receiving the refuse of factories. It is comparatively large, the threads
varying in thickness from 0-001 to 0-005 mm., and hence is very suited for labora-
tory purposes in teaching. Though normally in the form of segmented threads,
attached to a substratum, it illustrates the most modern conceptions of bacteriolo-
gists (Cohn, Zopf ), showing, in various stages of its existence, coccus forms, rodlets,

spirals, swarming movements, and even creeping movements, which much resemble
those of the oscillarians. For laboratory work it can be kept growing continuously
aiid with certainty upon fragments of india-rubber tubing in water, upon which it

will usually appear spontaneously after the lapse of a few months.

                              10. On Heterangmm Tilioides.

                By Professor W. C. Williamson, LL.D., F.B.S.

    In part iv. of my series of memoirs in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' I pub-

lished a description of a remarkable stem from Burntisland, to which I gave the

name of Heterangium Grievii. More recently we have obtained a second and yet
more interesting species of the same genus from Halifax. In many respects it
agrees closely with H. Grievii, especially in the structure of its central axis and its

exogenous zylem-zone. Its distinctive features are chiefly confined to the bark and
phloem-zone. In H. Grievii I found no traces of a true phloem, but such a zone

is fully developed in the new species, to which I propose to give the name of
Pleterangium Tilioides. The vascular zone is abundantly furnished with medul-
lary rays of various sizes. The largest primary ones are not only prolonged

into the bark as phloem-rays, but as they pass outwards their section assumes the

trumpet shape seen in those of the common Lime, the large square, parenchyma-

tous cells of which they are composed being arranged in irregularly parallel, arched
lines, the concavities of which face the zylem. Between each pair of these primary
phloem-rays is a mass of true phloem, through which the numerous narrow
secondary medullary rays are also prolonged outwards to the cortex. Longitudinal

sections show the phloem to consist of much parenchyma, through which numerous

elongated, thin-walled, narrow tubes pass vertically. In tangential sections these

tubes are seen to foUow an irregular, wavy course, reminding us of the bands of

hard bast in the lime. I detect no evidence of the presence of true sieve-tubes in

this phloem, though some of the numerous thin-walled tubes may represent those

tissues.

     External to the pbloem-zone are two very distinct zones of cortical parenchyma,
in which we discover twin pairs of large vascular bundles passing outwards to

what I presume have been foliar organs ; and in the outermost cortical zone we dis-

cover large, defined masses of sclerous parenchyma. The plant also exhibits proofa
that it also gave off true branches of larger size than mere foliar appendages.

     The vessels vary, from small ones with reticulated semi-scalariform walls in the
young foliar (?) bundles, to others of intermediate size in the exogenous zone;
whilst the latter conduct to the very much larger ones, which, intermixed with
the medullary parenchyma, constitute the medullary axis of the plant. Those

of the exogenous medullary regions are unquestionably vessels exhibiting modified
conditions of bordered pits. The zylem, phloem, and cortical zones of this plant
unquestionably suggest Gymnospermous relationships ; but the structure of the

centre or medullary axis has nothing analogous to it among known Gymnospermous
plants, recent or fossil. It approaches much more nearly to what we find in the

corresponding axis of Lepidodendron selaginoides.

11. The Multi'plication and Vitality of certain Micro-organisms, Pathogenic

        and othenvise. By Percy F. Feankland, Ph.D., B.Sc, F.O.S.

     In this paper the author records a number of experiments which he has carried
out on the multiplication of the micro-organisms present in natural waters, and
also on the vitality of certain pathogenic organisms when purposely introduced into

similar media.

     These phenomena have been studied by aid of the method of gelatine-plate
cultivation, originally devised by Koch. The first part of the paper treats of the
influence of storage in steriUsed vessels, upon the number of micro-organisms
present in the unfiltered water of the rivers Thames and Lea, in the waters of these
rivers after sand-filtration by the companies supplying the metropolis, and in deep-
well water obtained from the chalk. Of these three difierent kinds of water, at the

time of collection the unfiltered river-waters are the richest in micro-organisms,
containing, as they do, several thousand microbes, capable of being revealed by
plate-cultivation, in one cubic centimetre of water, whilst the filtered river-water

have this number generally reduced by about 95 percent., and the number present
in the deep-well water rarely exceeds 10 per cubic centimetre.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    '

TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  703

    On storage in sterilised vessels at 20° C, however, a great change in the rela-
tionship of these numbers soon takes place, for whilst the number of organisms in

the crude river-water undergoes but little change or even suifers diminution, that
in the filtered river-water exhibits very rapid multiplication, and this increase is
even still more marked in the case of the deep-weU water. The author suggests
that the ditferences in the rate of multiplication exhibited by these three kinds of
water is dependent upon the number of different varieties of micro-organisms which
they contain. Thus in the unfiltered river-waters the organisms belong to a number

of different kinds ; the filtered river-waters exhibit fewer varieties ; whilst in the

deep-well water the number of varieties is still more limited, the gelatine-plates
having generally the appearance of almost pure cultivations. The microbes in the
deep-well water will thus be less hampered in their multiplication by hostile com-
petitors than those in the filtered river-waters, and these again less than those in
the crude river-waters, in which an equilibrium must have already been established

between the various competitors.

    When the waters were exposed to a temperature of 35° C. the multiplication

was in all cases very much more rapid, but both at 20° 0. as well as at 35° C. the
multipUcation was, on prolonged storage, followed by reduction.

     The pathogenic forms which have been studied by the author are (1) Koch's

' Cotnma ' spirillum of Asiatic cholera, (2) Finkler-Prior'a ' Comma ' spirillum of

European cholera, and (3) the Bacillits pyocyaneus, which produces the greenish-
blue colouring-matter frequently present in abscesses. The vitality of these

organisms has been studied by introducing minute quantities of their cultivations
into sterilised distilled water, deep-well water, filtered Thames water, and London
sewage. In these media they present some very striking differences. Thus the
Bacillus pyocyaneus was found to flourish in all ; even in distilled water it was

present in largely midtiplied numbers after fifty-three days. Koch's ' Comma

spirOlum, on the other hand, when introduced into deep-well water was no longer
demonstrable after the ninth day, whilst in sewage it was still found in enormously

multiplied numbers after twenty-nine days.

    Finkler-Prior's ' Comma ' spirillum, although showing such far greater vital

activity than Koch's in gelatine cultures, possesses far less vitality than the latter

when introduced into water. Thus in the above-mentioned media it was in no

case demonstrable after the first day.

   A curious phenomenon was observed in the case of the Bacillus pyocyaneus and

Koch's ' Comma ' spirillum, viz. that when introduced into water a large propor-

tion of these organisms at first perish, the numbers often becoming greatly reduced,

the survivors subsequently, having apparently adapted themselves to the new

medium, multiplying to a greater or less extent.

     The author points out how necessary it is that each pathogenic organism should
be made the subject of separate investigation, and how fallacious must be any

generalisations concerning the vitaUty of pathogenic microbes which are based upon

the study of a single form.

     The more important results referred to above are summarised in the following

     The number of organisms falling on a given area has been determined by expos-

ing for a definite time small glass dishes filled with sterile nutrient gelatine.

     The greater part of the experiments have been made on the roof of the Science
Schools, South Kensington, whilst comparative determinations have been made in
various places both in town and country.

   A number of experiments were made with a view to determining the eff'ect of

altitude upon the abundance of microbes in the air. These experiments were
carried out at various stages on the dome of St. Paul's and on the spire of Norwich
Cathedi-al. The air in buildings has also been submitted to examination, and the

fact established that, whilst in enclosed spaces in which the air is at rest the num-
ber of microbes in suspension may be very small, yet when aerial disturbance is
occasioned, e.g., by persons moving about, the number is enormously increased.

                         By Dr. Maxwell T. Masters, F.B.S.

    In this note the author adverted to so much of the normal structure of Orchid.'?

in general, and of Cypripedium in particular, as is necessary for the elucidation of
his subject, and proceeded to describe a case of regular peloria in Cypripedium
caudatum, which shows a reversion to the typical form of Orchids, and goes to
prove that the so-called genus Uropedium was only a pelorian form of Cypripedium.

     The construction of the androecium in these plants is then alluded to, and
illustrations given of all intermediate stages from monandry to hexandry.

     The frequently observed tendencies to a dimerous condition, and to the develop-
ment of the inner row of stamens, was alluded to, and the significance of these

changes pointed out.

     The morphological changes consequent upon hybridisation, and the inferences
to be derived from them, were passed under review. The paper concluded with a
general summary of the teratological changes observed in the tribe Cypripedieae.

 14. On the Gulttire of usually aerobic Bacteria under anaerobic conditions.
              By Professor Marcus M. Hartog and Allan P. Swan.

     Bacillus suhtilis, regarded as a most typically aerobic bacterium, will germinate

in appropriate nutritive solutions, form its ' Kahmhaut ' and spores, when oxygen is
excluded from the space not occupied by the liquid and replaced by carbon dioxide.
Under these circumstances pressure rises in the closed apparatus employed, and
bubbles of CO.^ raise the Kahmhaut in parts, leading to the inference that the

vital energy of B. suhtilis is, under these conditions, derived from true fermentation,

not oxidation.

     The lactic organism of Pasteur, usually aerobic, will develope and grow in
suitable solutions during or after alcoholic fermentation induced by Saccharomyces,
as in Kephir and other forms of Koumiss, and after the oxygen rtiust be used up
and replaced by carbon dioxide.

15. On Gortical Fibrovascular Bundles in some species of Lecythidese and
                Barringtoniese. By Professor Marcus M. Haetog.

Accessory fibrovascular bundles are usually connected with abnormalities of

vegetation ; and probably serve chiefly to assure continuity of the phloem under

pressure ; hence it is interesting to note their occurrence where this explanation is
inadmissible. In Gustavia and Lecythis, belonging to the sub-order Lecythideae of

Myi'tacese, there is a complete system of cortical bundles, external to the pericycle,

anastomosing with the leaf-tracks at the nodes. These bundles have often a com-

plete circle of exogenous wood, without pith, and a crescent of phloem on the outer

side ;  they are all  but concentric                                                                     in the  petiole it is  impossible to distinguish the
                                                                                                      ;

bundles belonging to the common bundles from the cortical set, owing to the anas-

tomoses in the nodes. The section of the petiole with its scattered bundles recalls

that of a monocotyledonous stem, but there is no pericycle.

In Stravadium racemosum, belonging to the closely allied Barringtoniece, there

are similar bundles, but the orientation of the liber is reversed, and the common

bundle retains its distinctness in the petiole.

The explanation seems suggested by the following facts. The cataphyllary first

leaves of the seedlings of Gustavia are decurrent to the node below, so that the stem

is winged and the wings contain one or two pairs of accessory common bundles.

Higher up the wings are lost, but their vascular bundles remain to give rise to this

system of accessory bundles.

Napoleona has a similar system of cortical bundles.

       16. On the Grotuing Point of Flianerogams} By Percy Groom.

   These investigations were undertaken to test the accuracy of those of Dingier and

Korschelt, who had found that phanerogams grow by means of a single apical cell.
The author investigated many rapidly growing buds, and invariably found no apical

cell, but an apical meristem.

     In Gymnosperms a companion type is a growing point in which there is no
distinct dermatogen, periblem, or plerome. In Angiosperms there is invariably
a distinct and regular dermatogen, which covers tissue the fate of which the author
did not follow out, but which in some cases appeared to be only indistinctly, if at all,
differentiated into periblem and plerome. The author finally endeavoured to trace
roughly the evolution of the growing point from the typical vascular Cryptogam,
with one apical cell, to the Angiosperm, with a distinct dermatogen. lie regards
the Gymnosperms as intermediate types.

      17. On the Cultivation of Fern prothallia for Laboratory purposes.
                                        By J. MORLET.

    In botanical studies it is now the custom to examine fully the life-history of

specially selected plants, and as far as possible to cultivate them under conditions

in which they can be at aU times available for examination. It may not be un-

interesting to teaching botanists therefore to bring together the ways in which
the spores of ferns can be grown, or at least such ways as are applicable to the

laboratory.

     Amongst British ferns spores of Osmunda and Lastrea Filix-mas are the most
easy to grow, rather less easy Polystichums and AthjTiums; the most difficult I
have found to be Blechnum and Polypodium.

     If ferns are to be grown from spores, the spores must be obtained in a condition
fit for growing. If the sori are examined by the aid of a magnifying-glass and the
sporangia are found to be of a dark-brown colour, and some of them have already
split, a frond or part of a frond should be wrapped in unglazed paper and kept in a
dry place until required. If any one of the pinnae or the apex of any one of the
fronds is forked or in any way abnormal, the spores obtained from those parts of
the fronds will A'ery likely reproduce the abnormality on every frond of some of the
young plants.

     I generally grow them in a 12-inch fern-pan covered with a round, flat-topped
glass (confectioner's cake-glass). This pan mil hold eight tree-pots, called sixties,
seven round the edge and one in the centre : the pots are prepared for the reception
of the spores in the following way : first a quantity of waste pots, bricks, or sand-
stone are broken up into different sized pieces from three-quarters of an inch to a
quarter; with these the pots are filled to within one inch of the top, beginning with
the largest pieces and finishing off with the smallest ; this ensures perfect drainage,
and at the same time prevents the soil from being washed down amongst the crocks.
The pots with the drainage should now be placed in a vessel and covered with

boiling water ; this will kill all germs of animal or vegetable life that may be

adhering to them. Next pass some cocoa-fibre refuse through a riddle -with a
quarter-iach mesh, and add" one-third silver sand. This also must be covered with
boiling water, and after the water is poured off the sand and fibre must be well
mixed. For spores of the strong-growing ferns, such as the Lastreas, Polystichums,
Osmundas, &c., the pots must be nearly filled, rather firmly, with the mixture ; but for
wall or rock ferns, such as the Aspleniums, Woodsias, Cj'stopteris, &c., merely
sprinkle on about a quarter of an inch thick, and for these it will be better to fill up
the pots with drainage nearer to the top. They are now ready to receive the spores,
which can be sown by first unwrapping the paper in which the fronds have been
placed to dry, when it wUl be found to contain thousands of dark-brown dust-like
spores far too numerous for sowing. To obviate this the paper should be held at an
.angle of about 45° and gently shaken over another piece of paper, when all the super-

tluous spores will roll off, still leaving hundreds in the interstices of the first unglazed

paper. This should now be turned over on to the top of a pot, and rapped two or
three times with the end of a lead-pencil or the thumb-nail, when the spores will

be shaken off on to the fibre. The pot is now ready to be placed in the pan, and
when all the others have been prepared in the same way with the sanie or different
kinds of spores, the pan can be placed on a level shelf in a window facing the south,

and water that has been boiled poured in to the depth of half an ipch ; if the pots
contain spores of rock ferns only a quarter of an inch will do, but if there are pots
in the same pan some of which contain spores of the strong-growing kinds, and
some of the rock-growing kinds, place tbe pots containing the latter on pieces of

slate. This will prevent them from getting too wet. If the cover-glass is now put
on, all that will be requii-ed for the next three weeks or a mouth will be to place a

sheet of tissue paper before the glass during the midday sun, and if the bottom of

the pan becomes dry by evaporation add more water ; the water need not be boiled
after the spores have "germinated. After the spores have been sown from six to

twelve days, if the weather should be warm and bright, each pot can be examined

with a mao-nifying-glass, and in those containing spores of Osmunda, or Lastrea
Filix-mas, hundreds of small green specks will probably be seen, which from day to

day will increase in size until they meet and cover the surface with green leaf-like

prothalli. If they come in contactbefore each one has attained at least a quarter of

an inch in diameter the spores have been too thicldy sewn and must be thinned
out. Fronds will soon begin to appear, and will increase in number and size, each

successive frond larger and perhaps more complex than its predecessor.
     Sometimes a fungus attacks the prothalli in a pot. It first appears as a dark

spot, and gradually spreads until they are all destroyed. If seen in time it can be
stopped by heating some sand in an iron spoon and pouring some on tlie part

affected, but should the fungus pass through the soil and kill all the prothalli there

may still be some spores left that were unable to germinate in the first instance
on account of being too thickly sown ; these will soon make their appearance, and

the fungus will not attack the pot a second time.

At any time in their development the prothalli can be lifted for examination,,

for this purpose preference being given to a fine ivory paper-knife.

     The necessary conditions for the growth of spores are light and heat without

direct smishine, moisture without stagnation, and the absence of competition from

plants of a  stronger  growth                                       provided these  conditions be present, ferns and other
                                                                 ;

spores can be grown in various ways for laboratory purposes.

They can be grown on a thin piece of sandstone, a piece of slate, a lump of

peat, or a piece of glass.

1. On the Theory of Sex, Heredity, and Reproduction. By Patrick Geddes.

     In dealing with a subject naturally so obscure and so confused by conflicting
hypotheses as that of the nature and origin of sex, it is necessary to start with a
clear understanding that the required explanation must be not only in terms of
structure but of function, and must be satisfactory from the point of view of each
school of morphologists and physiologists in turn. Thus in any organism we must
not only note the general outward characters which may distinguish the sexes, and
correlate these with their habits of life, but follow them into the structures and
functions of the internal organs, and thence through the tissues to the egg-cells
and sperm-ceUs which respectively characterise the male and female. Below this,
however, a new problem arises; it does not suffice to observe these characteristic
                                 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  709

forms ; they need explanation in terms of the structural, and yet more of the

functional, properties of protoplasm itself. Were this once done, it would actually
be possible to retrace the progress of the science, and in the same way interpret,

in terms of the functions of protoplasm, the forms and functions of tissues and

-- --organs nay, even the facts of aspect, habit, and temperament themselves thus

reaching the rationale of what, had hitherto been matter of empirical observation

only.

     The functions of protoplasm are essentially two : first that of constructive or
synthetic change or metabolism (assimilation or anahoLisni), contrasted with that
of destructive or analytic change (disassimilation or hatabulisni), and these two
sets of changes never absolutely balance, as all the phenomena of rest and motion,
growth and diminution, nutrition and reproduction clearly show. During life
neither process can completely stop, but their algebraic sum varies within wide

limits. Starting from the undifferentiated amoeboid cell, a surplus of anabolism

over katabolism involves not only a growth in size, but a gain in potential energy,

and a reduction of kinetic, i.e., a diminution of movement. Irregularities thus

tend to disappear ; surface-tension, too, may aid ; and the cell acquires a spheroidal

form. Again, starting from the amoeboid cell, if the katabolic tendency be in
excess, the increasing liberation of kinetic energy thus implied must be expressed

in increased activity with diminished size. The form of the ovum and spermatozoon

are thus explained as the outcome of protoplasmic activities of a respectively pre-

ponderating constructive and destructive kind.

This conception of sex at once leads to the hoped-for abundance of interpre-

tation                           thus the gradual differentiation of the two sexes becomes intelligible, since
                              ;

necessitated by the accumulation of one or other of these two great tendencies with

advancing age, and (passing over the endless application of the theory to such

problems as those of the alternation of generations, hermaphroditism, partheno-
genesis, &c.), it affords us an explanation of the differences and habits, and even of
the determination of the sexes in plants and animals. Thus the degenerate male
rotifer is no mere exceptional curiosity, but the extreme development of a tendency

visible everywhere, for (save among those higher animals where the strain of

reproduction on the female necessitates the doubled activity of the male), females

tend on the average to show better growth or larger size. In plants or tadpoles
alike the determination of sex has been shown to be effected hy nutrition, and to
be female when this is abundant, male when it is checked. The phenomena of
sex, then, are no isolated ones, but express the highest outcome of the whole

--activities of the organism- the literal blossoming of the individual life.

     The preceding argument will also be found somewhat more fully in the writer's

article on Sex in the ' Encyclopredia Britannica,' and in extended form in a paper
of similar title to the present in tlie ' Proceedings of the Roval Society of Edin-

burgh,' 1886.

2. Notes on Australian Coelenterates. By Dr. R. VoN Lendenfeld.

    The author describes the extraordinary mode of development of Phyllorhiza
punctata, a rhizostomous Medusa discovered by him in Port Jackson. The Ephyra

has eight, the next stage twenty-four, the next sixteen, and the adult again eight

marginal bodies. If the umbrella margin is injured and newly formed, marginal

bodies appear between all the newly formed flaps.

Further, the migrations of Crambessa mosaica at the breeding time are described.

This and other species of that genus of rhizostomous MedusEe migrate far up the

rivers, like the salmon, to deposit their young.

   A remarkable change in the colour of Crambessa mosaica which has taken

place in Port Jackson since the observations of Huxley about forty years ago, is

Adescribed.                      new variety, which is brown, seems to have been produced or to have

immigrated and superseded the blue form, which was observed by Huxley and

others in that locality. In Port Phillip the blue variety is still exclusively found.

The author has found, in examining the lower freshwater animals, that the

freshwater Ilydroids and Sponges, as also the freshwater Rhizopoda of Australia,
710 REPOET-- 1886.

are very similar to tlie European, whilst the marine species of these groups differ-

very much in the two localities. He concludes that these freshwater fonns are very
old and conservative, and may be supposed to be the unchanged offspring of old

ancestral forms, as such possessing particular systematic importance.

     The aiithor gives an account of his discoveries on this subject up to date.
Sensitive and ganglia cells have been observed by him in a number of sponges..
Their locality varies, their shape is constant. They are mesodermal, and appear to
preside over the movements of the membranes and pore-sieves, and so regulate the
water-ciuTent. The great difference between sponges and higher ccelenterates is,.
that in the former the most important organs are mesodermal, whilst in the latter

they are ecto- or ento-dermal. He divides the type Ocelenterata accordingly into

Ccelenterata mesodermalia, or sponges, and Ccelenterata epithelaria or Cnidaria, as-
sub- types.

when  the  cnidocil  is  touched                                   but  that  the  animal  can  counteract  this  reflex  action.

by a centrifugally acting nervous irritation, in the same w-ay as reflex actions are

controlled by higher nervous centres in man.

                  By Professor McIntosh, If.D., LL.D., F.E.S.

    When using the large net (with the fine mesh) attached to the triangle of wood,,

as described in the Eeport of the Marine Laboratory, presented to the Association,
one of the earliest sweeps (August 9), north of the' pier at the depth of 3 fathoms,,
in 5 fathoms' water, brought iu a Medusa hitherto unknown to me. It occurred
amidst swarms of Thaumantias, Bougainvillea, Oceania, Turris, Cyanea, Aurelia,
Plewobrachia and Beroe, but was readily distinguished by the presence of a simple
pale cross on the translucent hyaline disc. The same form was again met with
about a fortnight later off the East Rocks.

      It is of considerable size, its disc measuring about five inches in diameter. It
has the ordinary shape, viz., moderately convex dorsally, somewhat flattened
venti-ally, and presents no novelty in the microscopic structure of its hyaline tissue.
The margin is surrounded by a closely arranged series of tentacles of considerable
length. These taper from base to apex, each moreover having a single small black

pigment-speck at the base. The latter shows no special differentiation, only a
group of simple pigment-granules. Within the bases of the tentacles is a narrow
trilled membrane, apparently the velum, and this is especially distinct during the

contractions of the disc.

     The reproductive bands begin a short distance within the margin, and extend

along the representatives of the radiating tubes right across the disc in each case,

thus forming a conspicuous cross. These bands are somewhat regularly folded
or lobulated at the margin, and have a pale grey or dull whitish colour. The
elements do not seem to be much developed, the minute cells which distend the

i'rills being finely granular.
                                                                                             ;

     The reproductive bands join each other in the middle of the disc, which
presents no trace of a mouth or of a manubrium, and in this respect it diifers from

any ordinary form.
     It is premature to speak decisively as to the precise nature of the form, which

has certain resemblances to an abnormal example of Forbes's Thaumantias melanops,
from Shetland. The latter, however, was only half an inch in diameter, and had
the usual manubrium.

                                                    By Henry Teimen, M.B., F.L.S.

I have brought for exhibition some specimens of this species of plant-bug, in

consequence of its having attracted a good deal of attention in the East, as a pest
of tropical agriculture, and also because there has been some confusion as to its

identification.

    Two or three years ago some of the growers of cacao {Theobroma Cacao) in

Ceylon became alarmed at the prevalence of a ' disease ' in their trees affecting
especially the young twigs and young fruits ; the former were spotted, then began
to shrivel, and finally died off, and the latter became black and dry, and failed to

arrive at maturity.

     At the request of the Government of the Colony I made an investigation of,
and reported upon, this state of things, and satisfied myself that the main cause of

the damage to the trees was due to the effects of the punctures and suction of the

juices effected by the insect now shown. As I am, however, not enough of an

entomologist to be acquainted with the insects of Ceylon specifically, I should have
been unable to determine the present one further than to refer it to its group, had I

not possessed specimens from Java of the bug there identified as Helopeltis Antonii,

with which our insect apparently agreed. In Java this insect has been very

destructive to the cinchona plantations, affecting the young shoots of the trees in a

very similar way to that noticed in cacao in Ceylon ; and it was always a matter

of surprise to me that our cinchona was not attacked also.

Since my A'isit to England I have had the advantage of submitting specimens

of the Ceylon insect to Mr. Waterhouse, of the British Museum. The collection

there, though it possessed specimens of the Java Helopeltis, had not any from

Ceylon                                     and the result of comparison has convinced Mr. Waterhouse that the two
                                        ;

are not identical. The Ceylon insect agrees completely with Signoret's original

description of H. Antonii, which was made (in 1858) from Ceylon specimens

whilst the Java insect, which has hitherto passed under the same name, differs in

several particulars, and is, perhaps, undescribed.'

     There remains another closely-allied Helopeltis which is most destructive to the

tea-plantations in Assam, where it is known under the name of ' Mosquito-blight.'
This has been named H. theivorn, and has recently formed the subject of an illus-

trated memoir by Mr. Wood-Mason, of Calcutta. I had hitherto supposed that
this also was identical with the H. Antonii of Ceylon, but the tea-plants there have

scarcely been touched (if at all) by that insect, and in view of the above facts

with regard to the Java Helopeltis, it is quite possible that the Assam one may

also be a distinct species and restricted to different plants.

It is remarkable that species of one genus of Heteropterous insects should be

serious pests to three of the most important products of planters in the East.

    The President delivered tlie following Address :

However diffident I may feel in undertaking the duties of President of the very im-

portant Section of Geography at this anniversary, I have no right to take shelter

myunder that diffidence for any shortcoming in the fulfilment of                                                                                                                                                     task.  All I

would seek at your hands is indulgence for one whose training and antecedents

have scarcely fitted him for appearing before you in a quasi-professorial capacity,

and whose brief tenure of a Presidential chair at a meeting such as this must be

regarded as rather an incidental passage in the annals of the British Association

than a fair illustration of its modus operandi, or principle of selection in respect to

its officers.

    As to the subject of my opening address, I know none more befitting the occa-

sion than the means of popularising the branch of science to which the meetings

in this Section will be devoted, and thus attracting towards it that attention which

--it merits nay which, in this our country if anywhere, it demands and necessi-

tates.

    The question is a wide one, but I will endeavour to narrow the field of its dis-

Acussion to suit our purpose of to-day, and keep within reasonable limits.                                                                                                                                                  few

words will suffice to lay before you the programme. It embraces : first, the uses

of geography, an exposition of which should prove, and a due apprehension of

which should admit, the necessity of its inclusion among the special studies of

public schools                                                        secondly, the  mode of  imparting                                                                                             a knowledge  of  geography so  as
                                                                   ;

to  render it  at once practical and engaging                                                                                                                                                       and  finally, such illustrations of
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

modern travel and research as may serve to demonstrate how urgent is the study

of geography to all classes in this country.

     Before closing the subject, I shall endeavour to draw your attention directly, if
somewhat cursorily, to the progress made by travellers and geographers in further-
ing what I may for the nonce describe as tlie objects of their profession during the

past year, or since the last Annual Meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen.
But I shall only dwell upon such instances of geographical progress as from their

character and locality come within the range of my personal experience, and serve

to illustrate the main argument of this address.

    To begin then with the uses of geography. There are doubtless many who

will say demonstration here is superfluous, and that if its use was not admitted it
would find no place in school studies, which is contrary to fact in many instances

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

there would be no primers or elementary works on the subject, whereas they may

be reckoned bj' the score ; books of travel would be rather entertaining than in-

structive, a charge which many recently published volumes would disprove ; and

so forth.

     Some again will argue that its uses, such as they are, must be restricted to the
few specialists who aspire to be geographers, and that for the million it is enough

and capitals in them, and a sufficient amount of preliminary instruction to under-
Astand Bradshaw and Baedeker.
                                                                          third, and perhaps the largest category among

educated people, consists of those who are indifferent to the whole question, and

are content to find in geography either an honoured branch of science, or a mere

nominal study, according to the views of the latest speaker, or most plausible

reasoner. If it be allowable to apply things holy to things profane, no truer illus-

tration of this class can be given than the Scriptural definition of men who receive

seed ' in stony places.'

To the first of the above I would say that the place which geography holds

among school studies is not that which it ought to hold if its uses were understood

and appreciated. Primers and elementary books already published are good

enough in their way, but the instruction they contain is not seriously imparted

and it may be that something titter and more attractive to the beginner could be

produced. At present all school-books on geography may be said, as a rule, to be

consigned to the shelf of secondary subjects                                                                                                                                                                         and this is not the treatment  which
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

should be reserved for a study of such real magnitude. By-and-by it will be my

endeavour to establish by argument aud example the indisputable character of its

importance.

     For those who look upon geography as a profession which needs rather separate

training than general education, and would prefer to leave its acquirement to

travellers aiming at distinction, specialists in Government employ, and the more
zealous aud scientific Fellows of the Royal or any other geographical society, I

can only express my regret that the delusion under which they lie unfits them so

thoroughly to understand and much less satisfy the wants of a rising generation.
By denying the universal character of the study they clearly misapprehend its true

scope, and are dwarfing it to within the narrow limits of a conventional school task,

     As a matter of State or public school education the science of geography should

in truth be elevated, not degraded. In my humble opinion it should be placed on

a par with classics, mathematics, and history, with each and all of which it has

affinity. Undoubtedly there are accomplishments which come, as it were, of them-

selves, or are the outcome of lightly-sown seeds in the home. These for the most

part are rather mechanical than mental, though some may have advocates to claim

for them intellectual honour. But a knowledge of geography is not to be so acquired :
it will not come like handwriting with incidental practice, nor is it to be gained
by mere travelling. To move from place to place, whether across seas or conti-

nents, or both, to go round the globe itself and visit every important country and

capital in the track chosen, even to prefer byways to railways and search into
obscure and hidden spots rather than those which are more generaUv frequented

all this process affords admirable matter for the note-book of the man of the world

and observer, but will not educate in geography, unless the student himself has a

serious purpose to turn his wanderings to the account of science. The cursory

description which would apply to men and women, cattle and conveyances, hotels
and caravansaries, restaurants, coffee-houses, and the like, in a moving panorama,
is not always suited to brmg out in bold relief the physical aspects of a country.

     To the indifferent and wavering, to those who would wish to promote the study
of geography if they could feel persuaded that it needs promotion, but who would

leave to the better judgment and experience of others the decision on the whole

question                                           to those who are content to                    accept the                                                                                                         institution of  a professorial chair

in honour to the science, or to leave geographical study to the primitive teaching

of their own childhood, whichever course be most in accordance with the temper

--or fashion of the times I can perhaps do no better than appeal on the grounds of
--urgency in other words, of the real importance of the cause for which, in common

with abler and worthier advocates, I would now most earnestly plead. The open-

ing verse of the Bible, in imparting to us the first great act of creation, at once

establishes the high position, among the lessons to be taught mankind, of astronomy

and geography                                                             and the description of  the garden of                                                                                                      Eden,  and the river  dividing

illustration of pure geography conspicuous in the second chapter, immediately
following the story of man's formation. To say that there is a special fascination in
Biblical research, whether geographical or archseological, is to say what those alone-

know who have made such studies a labour of love as well as a part of duty. But
those who do know this truth from experience are ready to assert it without

reservation. I have myself heard the assertion from the Hps of one of the most

--zealous and industrious contributors to Smith's ' Dictionary of the Bible ' one

whose versatile talent and comprehensive intelligence have now called him to a
difierent sphere of usefulness, but who is no less a sure and competent witness.
And is there no fascination in contemplating the marvellous fact 1 have just cited?
For assuredly it is a marvel that for nearly 6,000 years, or, so far as we can tell,
from the creation of the world itself in which we live, and the bestowal of names
upon things animate and inanimate up to the present day, we find two ancient

--rivers retaining their names unchanged Euphrates and Hiddekel. There is no

need to speculate here on the Aryan origin attributed to the first, nor upon any
broader meaning implied by the latter. I can myself answer for the local name
' Farat ' or ' Al-farat,' and ' Digla ' or ' Dagla ' (with the article, Al-dagla,
Addagal, Addigal) in use between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf.

  --In touching upon Bibhcal research, I may be told that according to hard
--thinkers at the present hour I am taking a sentimental view of an argument

which should be mainly practical. But the geography of Mesopotamia, as of
Palestine, is to all intents and purposes a practical study, especially in these days
of possible railways and new lines of intercommunication east and west ; now, too,
that Cyprus is ours, and the immense advantages of its occupation have been
demonstrated by time and experience. Moreover, if any geography can be con-

sidered Biblical, it is that of Asiatic Turkey, both as regards the New Testament

and the Old.

    I am not, however, going to dwell upon this highest view of the subject. The

connection of geography with Holy Writ is self-evident, and the twenty-one years'
history of the Palestine Exploration Fund, only just written, affords an admirable

instance how public interest may be aroused to support, and individual energy and
intelligence may be exercised to prosecute, a work hallowed by association. Those
who were present at this year's meeting at the Royal Institution will not soon

forget the cordial manner in which the names of the foremost labourers in this area

of usefulness were received by the crowded audience. And rightly so. They have

been worthy labourers in a worthy cause, and merit the grateful honour of public
recognition and approval.

     Turning to secular things, I almost seem to be treading upon the threshold of

platitudes when seeking to explain why geography should be useful to young men
of ordinary culture, for whatever career they may be destined. In some cases it

is naturally more urgent as a study than in others. The military man, for exam-
ple, should be more or less a scientific geographer. His profession may require-
him to survey and describe new regions ; and a campaign over a beaten track
should find him acquainted with the minute topography and physical aspect of
places, at least the names of which are familiar household words. The sailor
should in like manner bear in mind the configuration and character of sea-coasta

and carry about the landmarks of his own observation as well as those to which,
he may refer in books. To both must geography be eminently a professional

study. But, considering the enormous extent of our Indian Empire and Colonies,

and the many foreign States with which we must have intimate relations, is any
Englishman, I would ask, competent to discuss, much less to serve, the interests of
his country who knows nothing of the physical features, resources, products, popu-
lation, and statistics of these ? It seems to me to be the duty of every loyal sub-

ject and citizen, high or low, rich or poor, to seek information on these heads

wherever it may be obtained.
     But of all men who should realise geography in its broad, comprehensive sense

-- --both as an aid to history, and as a science to which history maybe subordinate

first in order is the statesman in whose province falls the disposal and partitioning

--of countries or regions. What should we say of the judge we may be thankful
                                                                   5

--tbere are none such on the English bench who not only gave his decision without

mastering the merits of the case before him, but who was also ignorant of the law

and precedents which should guide him. in the treatment of those merits ? The

argument might apply with equal force to other callings from the members of
which professional opinions or decrees are required by their fellow-men. Why,

the evil would be so great and ao palpable that its existence would not be tole-

rated for a single day : and the only reason why it is allowed to prevail in matters

goeographical is that, though equally' great in respect of these, it is not equally

palpable. The statesman may not know the situation of this or that particular

place, nor its products and resources, but neither does the public. One is not

taught geography any more than the other ; so that while ignorance and error are

brought to bear on a spurious judgment, the critic is not in a position to point out

the real flaw, and the blunderer escapes the scathing condemnation which would

otherwise await him ia the columns of the morning paper.

  --Let us suppose a case by way of illustration a case which conveys no exagge-
--rated idea of what happens, or may happen in the course of a year a case whicli

without being an actual occurrence has in it the flavour of actual occurrences.

There is a large tract of land in the far West or far East, it matters not which.

All that is known about it is that it is called Laputa or Barataria, and that it ia

situated in the central part of a region or continent so vast that it might be reason-

ably called the largest quarter of the globe. Well : it is encroached upon by a

powerful neighbour, and England requires the preservation of that land's integrity

and independence. Her best instructors on the matter have told her that such is

her interest, and she believes them. Intervention, therefore, becomes necessary
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

--negotiations ensue ; and the whole question resolves itself into a partition of terri-

tory and demarcation of boundary in other words, the question becomes one of

-- --geography what I should call, for reasons to be explained hereafter Political

Geography. Who, if not the ruling statesman, should know the true principle on

--which to deal with a large settlement of this nature one, it may be, involving

ethnological, commercial, humanitarian quite as much as territorial considerations ?

Who, if not the agent on the spot, should know the details to regulate the applica-

tion of the principle ? But the statesman should be in full possession of his agent's

details, and be capable of appreciating them not only from the latest reports

supplied, but from a certain insight into the matter obtamed from early study.

He should have been coached in that comprehensive kind of geography which

would have embraced the particular information required. Under present arrange-

--ments it is not so. The geography taught at schools is too simple or too scientific
   too complex or too superficial ; in any case it is not the geography which would

benefit the cabinet minister in solving a territorial difiiculty any more than would

those ' iugenuse artes ' which have so strong a civilising influence on the natural

man. Experience in classics may forestall the faulty quotation and false quantity,
but fail to suspend the false move on the political board. And it need not be said

that, while the first, in point of fact, aftects the speaker only, the last concerna

the happiness of the million.

   We now reach the second consideration : the mode of imparting a knowledge

of geography so as to render it at once practical and engaging ; and I may be

pardoned if I dwell upon this somewhat lengthily, for it involves the gist of the

whole question before us. It is always easier to detect a flaw than to find a

remedy, and in the present case the flaw is generally admitted by experts. There

may be ditferences of opinion on its character and extent, but apparently there are

none on its existence. I shall have to recur to the first, but would ask leave to

Wedismiss the last as established.  are told on excellent authority that in our

own country the elements of success in geography are wanting, and the conclusion

has been practically accepted by the representative Society for this branch of

knowledge. The remedy has been suggested, and in a certain sense partially

applied, but a great deal more remains to be done, and the many views entertained

and expressed by competent men on the claims and requirements of geography in

England render necessary a short review of what may be called the 'situation,'

including notice of work achieved in the direction of reform.

     In the first place let us examine into the work done and doing by the Royal

<jeographical. Society. What the objects of this Society are, and what have been
its operations for half a century, may be gathered by a perusal of Mr. Clements

Markham's interesting record published on the occasion of its completing the
fiftieth year of its existence on July 16, 1880. I quote two passages which bear
upon our present lines of thought. One recites the propositions, ' unanimously

accepted as sound and true,' which are in truth the basis on which this now

flourishing institution was originally formed. They are thus expressed :
     'That a Society was needed whose sole object should be the promotion and

diffusion of that most important and entertaining branch of knowledge, geography
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and that a useful Society might therefore be formed under the name of the

Geographical                                Society      of  London                                     that  the  interest  excited  by                                                                                                                                                                                                 this depart-

ment of science is universally felt, that its advantages are of the first importance to

mankind in general, and paramount to the welfare of a maritime nation like

Great Britain, with its numerous and extensive foreign possessions ; that its
decided utility in conferring just and distinct notions of the physical and political

relations of our globe must be obvious to everyone, and is the more enhanced by
this species of knowledge being obtainable without much difficulty, while at the

same time it affords a copious source of rational amusement, and finally that,

although there is a vast store of geographical information existing in Great

Britain, yet it is so scattered and dispersed, either in large books that are not

generally accessible, or in the bureaus of public departments, or in the possession

of private individuals, as to be uearly unavailable to the public'

     There is perhaps a quaint boldness discernible in coupling the adjectives
' important and entertaining,' and introducing the word ' amusement,' but these

verbal expressions are unquestionabh' appropriate, and may suggest an explanation

--of much of the Society's popularity at the present time a popularity exemplified

in the large and increasing number of its fellows.
    The second passage from Mr. Markham's report is the author's own estimate

--of geographical work an estimate supported by a wide and varied personal ex-

perience :

'Geography is a progressive science. Every year, with its discoveries and

novelties, also brings forth a large crop of corrections and of information which

modifies preconceived theories and opinions. It is this freshness, this constant sup-

ply of new material, which constitutes one of the many charms of geographical

research.'

     Let us add a hope that when its real scope becomes known and its uses more

patent to our masters in education, eflicient advocates will not be wanting to secure

its acknowledgment in England as a study of absolute necessity.

Of late years the Royal Geographical Society, in pursuance of its originally ex-

pressed aims and objects, and strong in the experience of a long and prosperous

career, has endeavoured to arouse the rising generation to a sense of their short-

comings as regards the particular science in the promotion of which it has its own

raison d'etre. It granted prizes to such public schools as chose to compete for

them, and after sixteen years' trial discontinued the grant, owing to unsatisfactory

results. It opened correspondence with schools and colleges, and made other

j udicious and laudable attempts to evoke sympathy and support. But all its pro-

ceedings have been as it were preliminary, and may be considered rather as foun-

dation-stones of a temple of success than the outer walls or any visible part of the

Abuilding itself.                                  more recent attempt to reach the masses was the Exhibition of

Educational Appliances. Objects used in geographical instruction at home and

abroad were collected and arranged in galleries hired for the occasion, and the

public were invited to inspect them. At the same time appropriate lectures were

periodically delivered, by competent and experienced men, to the visitors, many of

whom were not merely interested amateurs, but persons actually engaged in school

teaching. Attention was called to the fact that the exhibition was purely educa-

  -- --The result of this new departure if the term be allowable was pronounced

very satisfactory, and at the close of the exhibition, or in the spring of the present

year, the council considered what would be the next best step to take in furtherance

of their desire to raise the character of geographical study. At a later date, on the

recommendation of their Educational Committee, they resolved on addressing the

universities to the efi'ect that chairs or readerships be instituted similar to those

which were at that time tilled in Germany by Carl Ritter at Berlin and Professor

Peschel and Richthofen at Leipsic. In carrying out the resolution alternative

schemes were submitted. The council would appoint, under approval of the uni-

versity authorities, a lecturer or reader in geography, paid out of the Society's funds,

he being  accorded  a  fitting  local                                                                                                                          status                           or each university might join with the

Thus far I have referred to the proceedings of the Royal Geogi'aphical Society,

and I think you will allow to those responsible for them the credit of moving in

the right direction, with a genuine desire to promote a good cause. But the new

Geographical Societies have not been idle : Edinburgh and Manchester have

shown an intelligent vigour in seeking to popularise the study of geography, and

much has been done in both places within the past few months only, which is

worthy of permanent record. Of Manchester I can speak with a certain amount

of personal knowledge, having read two papers there, and had the advantage of

making the acquaintance of the more prominent members of the Society. The

movement in a great commercial city such as this may well aid in strengthening

the hands of the London Society                                                                                                                                for  nothing                     could  more                                            faithfully demonstrate

the practical uses of the science under consideration than the fact that it had a

centre in Manchester. As to the nature of the recent work there, I need refer

only to the Exhibition of Geographical Appliances which followed that in London

the published reports that space could not be found for showing all the specimens

sent, but that a selection was made, and that maps were the main feature. These

--were of many countries English, German, Dutch, French, Italian, Norwegian,
--Swedish, Russian, American, and Canadian among the Norwegian being a fine

series presented to the Manchester Society by the Royal Institute of Christiania.

During the exhibition, seventeen addresses were delivered in the building on

subjects connected with geographical education. Every day lectures were given

of about three-quarters of an hour each, on the contents of the rooms, to audiences

ranging from ten to a hundred and fifty persons. The special Education Committee,

appointed with reference to the Exhibition of Geographical Educational Appliances,

were enabled, at the close of their work, to report to the Council that in their

opinion the object of the Society had been accomplished, and expressed a hope

that the impression produced might not be allowed to evaporate, but should rather

be ' fostered to more definite results in this extensive branch of human knowledge.'
From Manchester the London Society's collection of Geographical Appliances was
transferred to Edinburgh, where an address was delivered by Mr. Ravenstein at
the opening meeting in the Museum on June 14.

     It will thus be seen that special efforts have been made and continue to be
made to popularise a science which has never, so far as can be ascertained, held its

must not, however, lose sight of one important consideration. More remains to be

done than to institute a chair, a professorship, a readership. It must be clearly

understood on what general lines of study we are about to proceed. Is geography

to be taught in its full, compreliensive sense as somethiug involving a knowledge,

more or less, of mathematics and astronomy, of ancient and modern history, of
ethnology, zoology, botauy, geology, of men and manners, laws of nations, modes

of government, statistics and politics, something requiring in the disciple a quick

ear, a searching eye, an appreciation of scenery and outer subjects as well as

physical aspects of country, a power of picturesque bat an adherence to accurate

--description ? If so and I believe I have only stated the qualifications of the
--travelled and finished geographer would it not be well to inquire whether the

-component parts of the science should not be reconsidered, and a subdivision

efi;"ected which would make it easier to deal with than geography as now under-

stood, under the terms physical, political, and perhaps commercial ?

     It must be borne in mind that our governments or geographical societies, our

--boards or our Universities whichever distinguished body takes the matter in hand,

--separately, it may be, or in concert will have to cater for a multitude of pupils, and

that, whatever change eventuallj^ takes place in programmes of study, the division

of school teaching into two great representative branches, classics and mathematics,

is a practice which has hitherto, at most public schools, resisted the shock of inno-

vation. The maintenance of this time-honoured custom is not so much, to my
mind, an illustration of conservative principle that, we all know, is powerless

--·against national progress as the assertion of a profound truth, similar to that

which in the region of language separates the Semitic from the Aryan category of

--tongues. It is a recognition of the distinction which exists in the human organi-

sation between mind and mind a distinction apparent in the boy as in the man,

--at school as at college in the battle of life itself as in the period of preparation

for battle. I do not mean to imply that all school studies fall essentially under

one or other of these divisions ; but I do believe that the student's progress will be

in accordance with his idiosyncrasies; that the student's taste should be considered

in the master's system ; and that, in dealing with geography, we ought not to

throw it wholesale into the hands of the professor or reader, but, as a primary

measure, separate it to suit the capacity of the classical as of the mathematical

intelligence, so that the one part comes within the province of history and art, the

other within the limits of unadulterated science. Attention to both sections should

be imperative, so far as attention to classics and mathematics is imperative, but

the standard of competence attained in either must depend on the mind and bent
of the pupil, who might readily excel in one but fall short in the other, not being

-- Weeven distinguished if the subject of study were undivided.
Not six months ago I wrote as follows : '      are authoritatively told that, at

one df our greatest public schools, which may be fairly taken as representative of

its class, there is no systematic teaching of geography at all, but " that in the history

lessons, as well as in the classical lessons, a certain amount of geography is intro-
duced incidentally." Again, if we look at the Universities abroad, it has been

found the custom, until quite lately, both in France and Germany, to combine the

chairs of geography and history under one professor. Now the "incidental" cha-

racter of geographical instruction is a tacit declaration of its unimportance, which

every day's experience shows to be without warrant ; and its combination with

history may be <an expedient to render it less distasteful than it appears as a sepa-
rate study. But a useful hint may be taken from the Continental practice, and a
partial fusion of two departments effected, which would commend itself to common

sense, and, to judge from the recorded opinions of certain of our educational experts,

might not be objected to by head-masters in England collectively. Let us, then,

endeavour to extract from the lessons of conventional geography that part which is

inseparable from the study of nations and people, and place it under a new and

more appropriate head. In this view, so-called " political geography," stripped of
its purely scientific belongings, would be taught in connection with history, and

made an essential ingredient in the early training of British statesmen, whose after-

reputation should be more or less the outcome of a University career, the grounding
of a public or grammar school, or private tuition. It is difficult to reconcile the

amalgamation of what may be considered " scientific " geography with history.
One is as thoroughly apart from the other as geology is from astronomy.'

The meanincT of the vei-hal combination ' political geography ' requires some land

of analysis. Conventionally, and in an educational sense, it is the description of the

political or arbitrary divisions and limits of empires, kingdoms, and states ; their

inhabitants, towns, natural productions, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce,

--as well as laws, modes of government and social organisation everything being

viewed with reference to the artificial divisions and works made by man. Accept-

ing this interpretation of its objects, who can hesitate to admit its palpable and

immediate relation to histoi'y ? The mathematical science which investigates the

physical character of territory and territorial boundaries is in this case but a secon-

dary requirement and can be always fairly disposed of in the recognition of results.

Otherwise, we have simply commercial geographj' with ethnography, and considera-

tions which we may call political in the present but which are undoubtedly

historical in the past. Surely, then, it would be wise and reasonable to combine

--the studies of history and political geography putting a wider interpretation than
the conventional one upon the latter designation in such a manner that the two

together should be just the sort of pabulum dispensed to the rising generation of

statesmen, diplomatists, and all who aspire to the name of politician, in its higher

sense of capability to promote as well as to discuss the national welfare.

    An admirable lecture on ' Geography in its Relation to History ' was delivered

-- --by Mr. James Bryce the late Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs in connection

'with the recent London Exhibition of Geographical Appliances. Those who are ac-

·quainted with it will readily understand why I pause to remark on its enlightened

teaching ; to those who have not that advantage I woidd explain that it seems to

embody the arguments of Modern Thought on the important question we are now

considering, and that a brief allusion to it is therefore no irrelevant introduction

"here. The lecturer, seeking to demonstrate that history and geography touch one

another in certain relations and interests, laid down the proposition that man is, in

history, more or less ' the creature of his environment ; ' that ' on one side, at all

events, he is largely determined and influenced by the envu'onment of nature ;

and that ' it is in discovering the difierent effects produced on the growth of man

as a political and State-forming creature by the geographical surroundings in

w^hich he is placed ' that one point of contact is found. He, moreover, maintained

that man, 'although he may lift himself above his environment, cannot altogether

escape from its power.' Dividing the influences thus exercised into three classes,

he showed that those arising from the configuration of the earth's surface affected

movements of races, intercommunications, and barriers of separation ; that those

belonging to climate affected the occupation or abandonment of particular localities

on the score of health, fertility, or non-fertility of soil, and consequently commerce

and cultivation : and that those which owed their existence to natural products

--unmistakably directed the energies of peasantry and people into certain fixed

channels of enterprise a result which applies to the zoology as well as to the

mineral and agricultm-al resources of a country. He made the very true observa-

tion that the ' animals affect man in his early state in respect to the enemies he has

to face, in respect to his power of living by the chase, in respect to the clothing

which their furs and skins offer to him, and in respect to the use he is enabled to

make of them as beasts of burden or of food ' ; and he, therefore, concluded that

' zoology comes to form a very important part of the environment out of which
Ahistorical man springs.'
                           volume might well be written on this suggestive theme

alone ; and if, as I believe, the proposition of a human being's dependence on

environment be admissible in its entirety, what a field of speculation is open to
Athe inquirer !
                 condition held applicable to the unreckoned millions of to-day

must have had a marvellous effect in giving character to original Man !
    This conception of mans environment supposed heads or branches of geography,

all bearing upon history, which might be distinguished by names such as ethno-

--logical, sanitary, commercial, linguistic, political and military, legal the last lead-

ing to the consideration of the Suez Canal and sea-channels in which several States

have interests. As time, however, will not allow me to quote the lecturer's apt

and well-put illustrations which followed, I may mention that the express object
with which they were introduced was to show how ' the possession of geographical

knowledge, and a full grasp of the geogi'aphical conditions ' with regard to some or

the leadhig countries of the world, ' will enable a person studying their history to

make the history more intelligible and real.' In strict conformity with this

opinion, and in the conviction that the want of geographical knowledge and ' full
grasp ' of geographical conditions will betray men in power to commit dangerous
mistakes, calculated to injure the national prestige and credit, and men out of

power to become their upholders in error, I would express the hope that, in any
future arrangements which maybe perfected for the better education of our country-

men, while physical and scientitic geography are invested with a degree of prominence

and honour to which they have hitherto never attained, that branch of study which

we have been accustomed to call political will be reconsidered and, if necessary,

newly defined by competent men. The conclusion at which I have myself arrived

--one which I am quite ready to abandon before the arguments of sounder reason

is that we have here something which belongs mainly to history, and, in such lisrht,

Aits scientific should be separated from its uou-scientific elements.  partition

should be made which would equally suit the mind of the student whose tendencies
are rather towards metaphysics than mathematics, as of him who is a votary of

practical science only. I do not presume to touch upon the action of Universities^

except to say that I can conceive no better example could be afforded that the in-

tellect of England had due regard for the material interests of England than by

the creation of a chair for scientific geography and the relegation of that which is

non-scientific to the chair of history. I now turn to the third, or illustrative

portion of the subject under discussion.

To illustrate, by instances of modern travel and research, the urgency of geo-

graphical study to young Englishmen, especially those who fi-om adventitious

position, ambition, or ability are likely to hold the helm in any department of

State, I see no fitter way than, by a retrospect of the work done, to come to the

conclusion whether we, as a nation, would have participated more directly in that

work, or derived more legitimate benefit from it, had we been better instructed.

Now this is a delicate question to put, if applied to particular cases, because it involves

matters of policy, and belongs to the domain of pure politics rather than to any

form of political geography ; but I shall not presume to ask whether we could, or

could not, have acted more wisely in this or that diplomatic difficulty, only whether

the solution of such a difficulty does not, in point of fact, depend upon a geogra-

phical experience which we do not always possess, and cannot always command

from others. Having explained upon what particular instances of progress in the

myfield of exploration or discovery I should dwell, at this stage of  address, I

will now speak more definitely. Though my own personal experience of travel

has been obtained, more or less, in the four quarters of the globe, I cannot but feel

that Europe is more familiar to me in its chief cities and highways, and more

--popular social haunts, for the geography of which there is no demand notwith-
--standing abundant and choice material than as a subject for scientific description.

So also with the United States. New York and Philadelphia, and the Hudson
River, with all their recommendations, have certainly no gloss of novelty, and my

personal knowledge is unfortunately restricted to these points. In Asia, I have a

--wider field from the Canton River to the Bosphorus--but for obvious reasons a

--corner of this will suffice for present purposes. In Africa I have made quite recent

acquaintance with the Congo that great river whose introduction into our maps in

Myits entirety is one of the most notable of geographical feats of modern times.  ex-

perience of it was brief and confined to its lower section, but the two months

passed at Vivi and between Banana and Isanghila were not without instructive

use. Plainly, then, after a retrospect of work lately achieved by travellers and ex-
plorers, I will limit such comments as I may have to ofter to the Congo for Africa,

and Eastern Persia for Asia.

proving the Lualaba to be the true head-stream of the Congo ; the travels of the
Baptist missionaries : and Lieutenant Weissman's exploration of the Kasai were
honourably referred to ; and I may here mention that a highly interesting paper by

Sir Francis De Wiuton has been since added to the reports of the officers of the
Belgian International Association. The President further referred to work done

Kerr's hazardous journey from the south across the Zambesi ; Mr. Farini's passage

through the Kalahari desert, and Sir Charles Warren's surveys in Bechuanaland.

Besides Asia and Africa, public attention was drawn to Mr. Forbes' and other

expeditions for the exploration of New Guinea ; to the report of Mr. Simons on the

Goajira Peninsula, and that of Mr. Wyse on the Columbian Isthmus and Panama

Canal. South America, moreover, came in for a share of honour with respect to

the ascent of Mount Roraima.

  --Among less known expeditions of which something, however, has been heard
--in this country through the scientific periodicals may be mentioned one undertaken

by Dr. Bunge and Baron Toll for the Russian Imperial Geographical Society.

These explorers have been occupied during the past year in examining the northern

shores of the frozen sea and islands of New Siberia. The Upper Yana and its sea-

mouth were the points to which the chief attention of one or other of the travellers
was mainly directed, and the Baron explored three other rivers in the same locality.

A highly favourable report of the results obtained has been received, and this last

spring has probably witnessed a renewal of work. From the ' Proceedings of the

French Geographical Society ' we learn that in Eastern Siberia also the explorations
of M. Martin last autumn between the Lena and Amoor were so carefully

conducted that his itinerary has been accepted for adoption and pubhcation

by the Russian staff. Much might be said, too, about a recent scientific mission of

M. Aubry to Shoa and the coimtry of the Gallas ; a journey by one of the missionary

fathers to the plateau of Amboella east of the Portuguese territory of Mossamedes,.
and the active movement of the Government of the Argentine Republic and
individual explorers on the Bolivian frontier and the Vennejo and Pilumayo Rivers:

but time would fail me to repeat the nominal record only. "With one exception I

omit all reference to ·' projected ' expeditions, of which the number is unusually

great.

    The exception will be disposed of in very few words. It relates, perhaps, rather
to a mooted subject than to a new project, the research of the Antarctic Polar
Seas, on which a paper was read last year at the Aberdeen Meeting by Admiral Sir
Erasmus Ommanney. Men's minds are so fully occupied at the present hour with

the thousand and one practical interests which arise like sparks out of the fast-

rolling wheel of Progi-ess, that the theory of an unknown polar region may not
possess the fascination which it exercised in days when steam power had been less
developed, and electricity had not exhibited a tenth part of its now familiar uses

and effects. Nevertheless, there is something to stir the imagination, even of this

unimaginative age, in the theory of a South Polar Sea ; and there is something
practical in the proposition besides, for it tends to give substance and meaning to

the unknown. If the object of exploring that comparatively neglected corner of

the globe commend itself, as I know it does, to many ; assuredly the project opens

a worthy field of enterprise for this nation above all others. The perils may be, as

stated on good authority, far greater than those of the Arctic Seas, but the

conditions of the two poles greatly differ, and it is most desirable to find such a

winter quarter within the Antarctic Circle as has never yet come within the

experience of any human being. Those interested in this important question may

remember that a Committee was appointed to report upon the advantages to be

--derived from further exploration of the immense region referred to near which,

some fifty years ago, James Ross made his famous discoveries. Hitherto, for

reasons which might readily be explained, no report has been issued; and perhaps

the wiser and the better preliminary step towards bringing matters to a successful

issue would be to expand and strengthen the Committee by the accession of

influential members. I now leave the subject iu the hands of experts, who alone

are qualified to deal with it in detail.

To return from this brief digression. There are two regions in which geo-

graphical activity has been evinced in a remarkable degree : both are in that large

--continent which one who knows it as well as any living man has qualified as

' dai-k ' the east and west coasts of Africa. It is really astonishing to trace the

changes in a map of Africa during the last quarter of a century. Large spaces

that were quite blank have been filled up with conspicuous delineations of moun-

--tains fine lines representing rivers, crossed by or connected with finer lines of
--afiluents or feeders with names, circles, and dots for towns or villages. Yet as I

now contemplate that map in its latest form, it seems to me that hundreds of spots

visited have yet to be indicated, and that the coast lines of the Indian Ocean on

the one side and the Atlantic on the other, are teeming with life imported, as it

--were, from Europe. Singly or collectively, emissaries and missionaries would-be
--settlers or mere explorers the number of these now in movement foretells in the

course of time a change in the political divisions of the countiy, whatever the re-

sult for good or evil. For the sake of argument let us take the whole extent from
20° N. to 30° S., leaving out Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, Tripoli, and Egypt, as poh-

tical considerations more or less understood iu England. On the west, Germany

has stepped in to hoist the flag of colonial power, and is to be recognised at the

Cameroons. France has possessions and protectorates between Senegal and the

mouths of the Niger, which promise development and consolidations such as it is

now impossible to estimate. Below the Gold Coast she has just added to the

Gaboon, by agreement with the Belgian-African International Association, an

amount of territory which gives her, in place of a comparatively small settlement,

a continuous coast line of more than 350 miles, touchuig inland a great portion of

the right bank of the Congo. Those who would know how her agents work for

her have only to read the narrative iu the publications of her Government, her

geographical society, or the records of her missionary fathers. They will there

learn that if her soldiers find active service in Senegal, the Peres du Saint Esprit

are not slack in peaceful attempts to educate and civilise the natives of the Gaboon.

Spain and Portugal have also possessions which have been lately extended on the

seaboard of AVest Africa ; and the international partition efiected at Berlin has

confirmed to the latter her right to lands which had been denied on more than one

distinct occasion during the last half-century. As to individual explorers of the

west coast within the last year or two, I need only refer to the names mentioned

in the address of the President of the Royal Geographical Society, and which I

have just repeated. Others might be added were it necessary; but they would

scarcely strengthen the case. For the east coast, again, Germany has annexed

territory in the neighbourhood of tlie Sidtan of Zanzibar ; while the names of in-

dividual explorers and settlers are legion. Of these I will simply recapitulate

some, without further comment. These are Major Serpa Pinto and Lieutenant

Cardozo                                    Herr Colin and Captain Chaders ;                     Messrs. Arnot and Giraud                                                                                                                            Mr. Last,

include, besides our own countrymen, those of one or more representatives from

France, Belgiiim, Germany, Portugal, and America.

     This drawing within the pale of civilisation of semi-barbarous States, this in-

clusion among common things of the imcommon and strange by the independent

or joint action of individual agents, is a matter which cannot fail to arouse a deep
interest in those European Powers whose position is secured or prestige enhanced
by the maintenance of empires, kingdoms, or colonies beyond the seas, over and
above their home possessions. It has been seen that France and Germany have
marked their sense of the situation by fresh annexations. The first, it is true, has

made her West African gains a mere supplement to the more palpable advantages
obtained under treaty with Madagascar and AuuHm ; but M. de Brazza's exertions

--on her behalf have won the important line of the Ogowi river the additional terri-

tory on the seaboard, to which we have referred, being a bargain of comparatively

trivial cost. England, in the meanwhile, has refrained from active interference, fur-

ther than reserving for herself certain rights connected with the Niger and Gold
Coast, and entering into treaty with Portugal in respect to the Lower Congo. The

reservation was a political fact to which we need not do more than allude ; but

the treaty calls for a word of remark. It was never ratified, and fell through in
embryo. I do not say that a knowledge of Africa better and more comprehensive

than that usually taught in English schools would have averted this result ; but I

do say that to treat so important a question a knowledge of geography, such as that

which I would combine with history, would have been the best protective weapon.

   --From West Africa we turn to the East to countries west of the northern

frontier of India.

Three of these merit our serious attention, i.e., Afghanistan, Baluchistan, and

Persia, more particularly their history and geography, and full information on

them is available in books. Nowhere is this to be found in the comprehensive

form that would necessarily be adopted were geography honoured with professional

chairs ; bur, in the absence of the appropriate manual, search must be made in

encyclopfedias, gazetteers, and volumes of history and travel. Afghanistan has

been of late years so much the subject of official correspondence that the blue

book is perhaps as useful a record as anj^ other from which to draw the more im-

portant details on the character of the country and people. Baluchistan has a

divided history. Her eastern half, contiguous to, and immediately connected

with British India, is to all intents and purposes under the protection of that em-

pire ; her western half, till within the last fifteen years, encroached upon by Persia,
is equally amenable to our influence, and should profit from English advice and help.

Persia is never in lack of European travellers who delight to place on record their

experiences of a country which with all its drawbacks has the immense advantages

of grand associations and a charming climate. Nor are its people the effete race

that some would suppose. Many of them, whether in the higher, middle, or

peasant class, are endowed with energy and activity which need but occasion to
draw out ; and if cruelty on the part of governors and extortion and peculation on

the part of high oificials are painfully recognised native qualities, there is great

kindliness and hospitality shown to strangers by the same classes, and, let me add,
the love of poetry is universal. The servant who corrects his master's faulty poetical

quotation from his humble post behind his master's chair can hardly be lost in

VandaUsm. I regret there is no paper to be read in our Section on Persian

geography, but may incidentally mention that one of our latest travellers in that
countiy, Mr. Rees, who will favour us with his impressions of Northern China,

has published a graphic .account of his recent journey, by a direct and little known

route, from Kazvin to Hamadau.

--724 EEPOET 1886.

    It is a subject of much congratulation that Boundary Commissioners aro now
made the means of advancing the cause of Science as well as of political security.

Their proceedings are no longer confined to the little-attractive blue hook, nor
doomed to the disguise and dilution essential to adapt thein to the shelves of a cir-

culating library. The progress of a mission may now be reported stage by stao:e
for the^puhlic information, and fresh descriptions of fresh countries may be read in
the daily prints, recorded with the minute accuracy of a photograph. Nor are the

acts and words of the chief or members to be done and spoken in the interests of
Government alone, registered in official foolscap, and marked confidential. Out-
door diplomacy, especially in Eastern countries, may have its occasional solemn
aspect, but it is, in the main plain-spoken and Bohemian. The appearance of a
Commissioner may be described, his official or general conduct discussed, his opi-
nions and habits criticised, and his remarks, whether sober or facetious, given to-

-- --the world I might almost add the conferences in which he takes part, revealed

without let or hindrance of any kind. All this is a distinct gain to the public, and
can be no cause of distress to the Commissioner, working in an honest and loyal

--spirit thougli it may not always be politically expedient. In any case the in-

formation so imparted may be rendered invaluable, both in a patriotic and educa-
tional sense; for it is eminently calculated to elicit the' views of competent men
 who have no other opportunity of acquii'ing the data on which to form them than
 that aftbrded by the Press. Whether these views would always be held acceptable
 is a separate question which need not here be considered. And now let me ask
 you to accompany me for a few moments to the camp of the Russo-Afghan Boun-
 dary Commission, of which we have telegraphic intelligence up to August 26, or
 only a week ago, and from which a letter in the 'Indian Pioneer' of July 18 brings
 full particulars under date Kham-i-Ab, June 15. For obvious reasons it would be

 out of place here to refer to the political knot which the Commissioners are seeking

 to untie. Had it been otherwise, I should have endeavoured to find a qualified

 exponent to admit us into the diplomatic secret, one which is so closely allied to
 geographical investigation. But the objection does not apply to the geography of

--the country traversed by the mission. ' Kham-i-Ab ' I have written it as printed
--in the ' Pioneer ' is a point near the Oxus, north of Andkiii. I shall not myself

 attempt to travel so far ; but it affords me much pleasure to slate that the actual

 scene of territorial demarcation and its immediate vicinity will be described by a

 gentleman who has made a professional study of this as well as of similar questions

 of political geography. In the meantime let us take a rapid glance at the tract
 between Quetta and the Helmand, a distance estimated at nearly 320 miles, of

 which Nushki is not quite third. I take my figures from Major Holdich's notes,

 in the 'Proceedings of the Geographical Society,' which include the stages and
 distances to Galicha ; and from a letter in the ' Pioneer ' of November 19, 1884,

 giving the distance from Galicha to Khwajah Ali on the Helmand at 53 miles
 checked, moreover, by the above-named officer's statement that a place called Shah
 Ismail is halfway between Nushki and Khwajah Ali.

      The country traversed was for the most part dreary and waste. "Within 40
 miles from Quetta the soil seemed ' poor,' and ' the cultivation scanty,' while it was
 not easy to obtain ' such necessary supplies as wood and chopped straw.' In 45
  miles further it was ' diflicult to describe the general appearance of poverty and
  desolation ' ; while for the next 31 miles water was only procurable at one place
  ' a narrow little oasis.' Then came a trying night march ' of 25 miles over ground
  always rough and stony, and occasionally steep for laden camels.' As for the
  climate, the sim was intensely hot in the daytime, the cold bitter at night, and a
  ' fine white dry dust ' was blown about in constant clouds. The last 10 or 12 miles
  into Nushki was mainly along the bed of a stream. From Nushki to the Helmand
  there were three routes available, of which the Mission chose the most northerly,
  on account of its greater facilities for securing a sufficient supply of water. For

 -- --nearly 80 miles of this distance or to Gazchah the characteristic of the ground

  was a flat, hard surface, commonly known in India and neighbouring countries as
  imt, easy to cross, but monotonous to contemplate, and the writer's description of

sional sun-ridges (or drifts) of a few yards only in width, but deep and shifting, with

an occasional hut or ziyurat (the dwelling of a desert /«/.»·), like an inverted bird's

nest of sticks adorned with quaint deyices, leaves little wanting to complete an intel-

ligible picture. From Gazchah onwards we are told that ' a marked geographical

change occurs,' and that the line of march for about 90 miles further is ' a mere

track, winding and twisting over the successive waves of rolling stone-covered plateau

hills, with the line of distant rugged pealis to the south                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           a few scattered isolated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

hills on the northern horizon, and one or two remarkable conical peaks rising

straight up from the plain, forming a peculiarly definite line of landmarks for the

marching force. The direction at night was indicated by fires kept up at intervals

of a few miles.' The last 50 miles or so to the river is ' a troublesome strip of

waterless desert.' It should be noted that, with one exception, where it was

reached at 25 or 30 feet below surface level, Major Holdich states that five

to six feet is about the average depth at which water is found between Nushki and

the Helmand.

Few can deny that all this is very useful and interesting information. So far

back as the spring of 1808, Capt. Christie had made an adventurous journey to

the left bank of the Great Afghan River, also from Nushki, whither he had pro-

ceeded from Kelat in company with Lieutenant Pottinger. He reckoned the dis-

tance at 191 miles, or somewhat less than the Mission's estimate. AVhen Sir

Charles MacGregor and Captain Lockwood passed through Western Baluchistan

in 1877, they separated at a place called Lai Khan Chah, about 60 miles below

the Helmand, to return, by different routes, to the Sind frontier post of Jacobabad,

Captain Lockwood taking the upper route by Nushki and the Bolan, and Colonel

MacGregor the lower by the Baila country ; but they did not penetrate so far

north as the Helmand itself. Nushki has, however, been more than once visited

of late years by British officers from Kelat.

' Khwajah Ali,' writes Major Holdich, ' where the Boundary Commission first

struck the Helmand, exists only in name.' Neither he nor the correspondents of

the ' Pioneer ' mention its distance from Rudbar, but it may fairly be concluded

that it is not many miles to the eastward of that place. The river appears to

have been forded at Chahar Burjak, whence the party moved up the right bank

to Kala'i-Fath and Kohuk, passing on through Northern Sistan and its reed-beds

to the Afghan territory of Lash Juwain. Having myself visited the locality at
which we have here arrived, it might naturally be inferred that I -should pause to

say something regarding it, but I will not weary you by recurring to narratives and

descriptions published many years ago, reserving all personal experiences to guide

Howme in the general conclusion to be sulDmitted.  the British Commissioners for

delimitation of the Russo-Afghan frontier proceeded from Ivash Juwain to the

immediate vicinity of Herat, and on to the quasi-Mesopotamia of Badkhiz, I leave

to be dealt with by the authoritj' to whom I have already referred.

Time, too, warns me that I have detained you long enough, and that if my

illustrations apply to the argument entrusted to your consideration, the application

Ashould at once be made evident. To my own mind the bearing is clear.

--Boundary Commission represents the three branches of Science, Research, and

Diplomacy in other words, all that comes under scientific geography and political

geography. The first, you will understand, comprises the survey of country, map-

ping, and determination of localities. The second has to do with the definition of

territorial limits, and, in such sense, with history, ethnology, and laws of nations.

That all this has been done, and well done, on the present occasion is not disputed,
any more than that enlightened attention will be given to the due disposal of results.
But are not these matters of sufficient importance to be taught as daily lessons in

our schools, and presided over in university chairs ? Even those barren and desolate
lands of which we have now spoken-- and I have myself traversed many miles of

--such, some, indeed, in the near vicinity of the Perso-Afghan frontier, between Herat

and Farah they may have a meaning which can only be understood by the ini-

tiated, by those who have made them a long and seriously-undertaken study. To
the many they are but miserable deserts displayed in incomplete maps ; to the few
they may have a value far beyond their outer show. Were I asked to sketch out the

kind of manual wliich might be useful in preparing officers for dealing with ques-

tions such as these, I would sohcit reference to a late paper which I contributed

to a quarterly journal, and which I have once before quoted. In it, I stated :

    ' Asia itself is a stupendous study, but the difficulties may be smoothed to the

learner by the judicious employment of method, which, after disposing of essential

generalities, would naturally tend to division and subdivision. The first would

imply a region such as Turkestan ; the second, a group of States or single States

only, such as Bukhara and Khiva. Given, then, a particular area, the next con-

sideration should be to explain its physical geograph}^ This should comprise the

scientidc description of its mountains, rivers, and valleys. Its orography should

be comprehensive in respect of direction, elevation, watersheds, and connection

with plains and plateaux; its hydrography should treat of sources and mouths,

basins, drainage, and connection with lake and swamp. Climate and the more im-

portant forms of animal and vegetable life should succeed in due course ; indeed,

something of geology, zoology, and botany, and it may be more besides, might

reasonably be added to satisfy the requirements of purely scientific teaching.

After science, history would follow, and, joined to history, an account of the re-

ligion, manners, and customs of the people, as affected by the historical narrative

a statement of the artificial lines of separation which have replaced natural boun-

daries in consequence of the wars, revolutions, or arbitrary changes which have

characterised certain reigns or epochs ; an exposition of the form or forms of

government in vogue at different periods ; and, finally, a chapter on trade and

commerce, including a notice of indigenous products and manufactures. Maps,

applicable to relations of  territorial  changes, would be  of  immense value                                                                         and an
                                                                                                                                                   ;

historian's criticism on these relations, if offered in that fair spirit which alone is

justified in composing history, would be an indispensable complement.'

But it is not the preparation of a manual which I have come before you to

advocate. This would be one of the many fruits of a system now sorely needed

for establishing at home the true position of geography as apprehended to a great
extent abroad. I am one of those old-fashioned and perhaps obsolete persons who

believe, not in the infallibility but in the ability of this country as a governing

Power. If that ability is proved in the creation and growth of its colonies, it is

no less distinguished by an unselfish tendency to lead those colonies to govern

themselves. But the unselfishness would be selfish if confined to the action of

Great Britain alone. It should be an example to other States and Powers to ' go

and do likewise.' That example, rendered available in International arrangements

by fitting action at fitting opportunities, can only be carried out by a knowledge of

geography in its widest sense. As to questions of territorial boundary, in Asia or

elsewhere, we may be fortunate in having able officers to decide, and wise Govern-

ments to scrutinise decisions : but one generation may not keep pace with another

generation in the character of its Governments or agents, and the doctrine of

chances is not a safe one in a matter of State urgency.

Plainly, let us not lose the immense advantage given to us by Providence

owing to the want of systematic knowledge in a branch of science in which we are

shown to have been outstripped by Continental nations, but which all historical

precedent warns us that it is our duty to foster to the iittermost.

    Agricultural Capabilities of the Canadian North-west. By Professor

     John Macoun, M.A.

The author describes the geographical and topographical features of the North-

west, and shows that its leading feature is that of a plane sloping to the north.

AFrom this results a nearly uniform climate.  uniform climate gives unity of

natural productions, and cereals or other crops, if successful on one part, will

therefore be equally so under the same conditions in another.

           2. The Canadian Pacific Uailwaij. By Alexander Begg.

     The author explains the circumstances under which the federation of the
British North American provinces was brought about, and gives some account of
the acquisition by Canada of the north-west territories and the admission of

British Columbia into the Dominion. He points out that the Transcontinental

Railway through British territory was the very essence of the agreement between
the diflerent parts of Canada to unite under one system of government, and shows
as a result of this the building of the Intercolonial and Canadian Pacific Railways,

connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. He then proceeds to recount how the

construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as a Government work, proved a
failure, and that therefore the contract was entered into with the present Canadian

Pacific Railway Company for the construction of the road. He next gives an out-

line of the progress of construction from the beginning of the work to its comple-
tion, and following this a description of the country traversed by the railway, at
the same time showing the various sources of traffic upon which the line depends,
and is likely to depend in the future, for its revenue. The condition of the north-
west territories of Canada before and since the year 1881 is then described,
showing that to the railway is due the rapid development which has taken place in
so short a time. The author then goes on to say that a large traffic in cattle and
grain from the Western States of America is certain to flow through the channel
of the Canadian Pacific Railway to the seaboard, and that it will thus be an outlet
for the produce, not only of North-western Canada and British Columbia, but also
for a large portion of the United States.

     Mr. Begg also demonstrates that the trade which has already commenced
between Canada and Australia, China and Japan, via British Columbia, is likely
to assume considerable dimensions, and to prove a very important source of revenue
to the railway, and that the commerce also between Canada and the Australian
Colonies is certain to be largely augmented by the Canadian Pacific connection
with the British Columbia coast. In this respect the author points out that
Canada is likely to prove a powerful rival to the United States. The imperial
aspect of the enterprise is then dealt with, and shows how great an advantage it is
to Great Britain to have an independent route through British territory for the
protection of her possessions in the East. From a commercial standpoint the
author maintains that the mother country cannot but derive very material benefit
from this route in her trade relations with the Australian Colonies, China, and
Japan. The paper concludes with a number of tables showing the mileage of the
Canadian Pacific Railway lines operated by the company, the equipment of the
road on December 31, 1885, comparative statements of the earnings, and a com-
parison of times and distances by the West to the East.

            A3. new Trade Route between America and Europe.

                                 By Hugh Suthekland.

     The settlement and cultivation of the Canadian north-west have directed public
attention in that country to the necessity of a new trade route to Europe. It has
been found that a railway carriage of 1,800 miles before reaching a seaport is a
serious drawback to the prosperity of that region, and places the settler at a great
disadvantage in competing with the other wheat -producing countries of the world.
With the object of getting on at least terms of equality with those rival countries
an agitation was begun a few years ago to open up an outlet through Hudson Bay,
and a railway has been projected from Winnipeg and Regina to Port Nelson, at
the mouth of the Nelson River, which, when completed, will bring the north-west
upwards of 1,000 miles nearer the seaboard than it is at present.

     The Canadian Government, anxious to encourage the enterprise, fitted out an
expedition to explore the strait and bay, with the view primarily of determining
the practicability of the route for commercial purposes. The first expedition was
sent out in 1884, and observing stations were established along the strait. These
                  --

were relieved tlie following year, and the information thus obtained, together with
the evidence of experienced navigators which was collected by a special committee
of the Canadian Parliament, have satisfied the people of that com:try that the

route is entirely feasible.

     It is confidently expected that this new trade route, already in process of

development, will create a revolution in the commercial traffic of the vast interior
of that continent on both sides of the international boundary. Minnesota, Dakota,

Montana, and Wyoming, with their immense productions of wheat and cattle, are

naturally tributary to that route, as well as the whole of the Canadian possessions
west of Ontario.

   A reference to the map will show how far down into the heart of the continent

Hudson Bay extends, and how favourably it is situated for commanding the entire

trade of that vast territory. It would seem as if nature intended that it should be
the outlet, oifering as it does a seaboard within convenient reach of the districts
named, and virtually placing them as near to European markets as Ontario, Western

New York, and Ohio now are.

     The attention which has been given to the bay in consequence of this new

project has resulted in increased Iniowledge of the resources of that great inland
sea. Salmon, seal, whale, and walrus abound in great numbers, while the coast

regions of the bay and strait are rich in minerals. The region of country draining
into James's Bay is covered with valuable timber. Besides offering a new and
advantageous trade route between Europe and America, it is not improbable that
the utilisation of those waters for such a purpose will soon be followed by the
development of fish, timber, and mining industries of great and practically

inexhaustible richness.

4. Proposed new Eoide to the Great Frairie Lands of North-west Canada,
     via Hudsons Strait and Bay. By John Rae, M.B., LL.D., F.B.S.,

      F.B.G.S.

     The project of opening a new route through Hudson's Strait and Bay by
 steamer, and from the west shore of the latter by railway to Manitoba, is being
 undertaken with the most praiseworthy motive of making a shorter and cheaper

 route for transmission of emigrants to, and for carrying grain and other produce
 from, the prairie lands of Canada than the present means of transport by lake and
 railway by the St. Lawrence river and Strait of Belle Isle to England.

      Earnestly desiring that, if practicable, this great work should be carried out
 successfully, I fear, however, that failure is more probable than success, and a
 failure would be an immense misfortune. There are a number of adverse circum-

 stances that have either been entirely overlooked or not taken suflaciently into
 consideration. These difficulties are wholly connected with the navigation of the

 Hudson's Strait, and have nothing whatever to do with the navigation of the Bay
 nor with the construction of the railway from thence to Manitoba, both of which
 are easy enough. This route, if established, would shorten the distance by 400

--or 500 miles more or less, according to the position on the prairies from which
--the measurements began and would give about two days quicker time to a loaded

 steamer of ordinary speed ; an advantage more than counterbalanced by a probable
 average detention by ice of three or four days on each voyage through the strait.
 The disadvantages are

   -- --1. The short time three or three and a half months (?) during which the

  strait is sufficiently open each season to allow a steamer to get through without

 much hindrance by ice, whilst on the other hand the great Canadian lakes are

 perfectly open for fully six months, and the Strait of Belle Isle navigated for at
 least five months by the Allan steamers.

      2. The danger to a large heavily laden steamer, whether of wood or iron, if

  caught in an ice-nip ; also the higher rate of insurance consequent on such danger.
       3. The uncertainty and rapidity of ice movements, which baffle the skill and

  experience of the oldest whaling captains, and are so well described by Lieutenant

 Gordon, who commanded the Neptune in 1884 and the Alert in 1885, on
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  729

voyages of inspection of the intended new route, whose opinion agrees closely with
the far longer experience of the Hudson's Bay Company's captains in sailhu/ ships,

and of my own (much more limited) in the years 1833/ 1847, and 1854. Lieutenant

-- --Gordon says that in the first half of July a steamer would take ten days to pass

through the strait a distance of 500 miles or fifty miles a day !

     If this is correct the new route will occupy longer time, "he more dangerous,
and less favourable in every way than that hy the St. Lawrence.

    Up to the middle of July the ice-pack driving down Davis Strait fills up more

or less closely the eastern entrance of the strait, whilst at its western end the same
thing happens during a part of August or of September by the driving to the south
of the 40,000 square miles of ice-floe from Fox's Channel.

    At one part of Hudson's Strait the compasses used to be, and probably still

are, useless, owing to some local attraction.

               1. On the Place of Geography in National Education.

                  By Douglas W. Freshfield, M.A., F.B.G.S.

           2. Can Europeans become acclimatised in Tropical Africa ? ^

                     By Robert W. Felkin, MZ)., F.B.S.E.

     With the exception of Cape Colony and a small portion of the north-west, the

whole of Africa is in the tropical and sub-tropical zones.
     This immense region is of great importance, and could it be colonised by

Europeans it would be of great advantage to the civilised world.
      Acclimatisation is the process, oftentimes slow, by which persons become

adapted to, and so retain health in countries having a difl'erent climate from those in

which they were born. This acclimatisation may be in part effected by changes

taking place in the individual or in the race, and in part by hereditary modification
of constitution. In some places real acclimatisation is impossible, but in nearly all

a person may accommodate himself for a certain time to almost any cHmate.

      Great changes have taken place in the location of different races, but these
changes have_ taken place gradually. There is a marked difference in the possibility

of withstanding climate in various races, and in each case we must examine the
power of resistance possessed by any given national constitution, in order to decide
whether it may successfully acclimatise itself in a tropical country when perma-
nently colonised there. The difficulties with which Europeans have to contend in

tropical Africa are heat, moisture, malaria, special diseases in special districts, &c.
      It is probable that southern European nations could withstand these obnoxious

influences best. In tropical Africa there are great differences of climate. (These
differences, especially between the coast line and the interior, were next explained.)

The coast line and the banks of rivers for the first 200 miles are most injurious to
Europeans, and the difficulty of reaching the interior is the greatest hindrance to

acclimatisation.

     Next followed a description of the various comparatively healthy inland districts.

     ' In this year both the ships to Hudson's Bay were shut in for about three weeks
in close-packed ice near the east end of the strait in July. The ships were one and
a-half mile apart, yet lady passengers walked easily over the floe from one to the
other._ On. attempting to get home both ships were stopped by the Fox Channel ice
early in October, and had to winter in the bay. Before giving up the attempt to
force a passage through the pack two feet depth of ice was formed on the foredeck,
and the ship was set down more than two feet by the head by the weight.

730 EEPOET-- 1886.

I think it is almost impossible for Europeans to do more than accommodate

themselves to the coast climate for a short time (two or three years), but given some

means of rapid transport, such as a railway, to carry them over the dangerous

belt of malaria on the coast, it would be quite possible for them to thrive in the

mountainous regions and high plateaux of Central Africa, with proper care and

sanitary surroundings. The climate of Central Africa is not necessarily more fatal

Weto life than that of India.  have now the advantage of greatly increased know-

ledge of tropical climates, so that precautious can be taken which were not dreamed

of when India was added to our empire.

     3. Further Explorations in the Baian Basin and the Wadi Moileh.
                                   By Cope "Whitehouse.

     The author exhibited maps, diagrams, and photographs showing the cartography
of Middle Egypt and the Fayoum, from the papyrus map of Boulaq, completed by
the fragments discovered by him, to the map of his expedition in February (1886),
accompanied by a staff of engineers detailed by the Government, and in April with

Gol. Ardagh, C.B., R.E., and an admirable map of the Charaq basin, prepared

expressly for this paper by Monsieur V. Giardini, of the Egyptian Cadastre.
Diagrams of the Nile floods, sections of the Bahr Jousof, and photographs of this
canal and the adjacent desert showed that a large volume of water {circa, a

milliard of cubic metres) could be annually conducted iuto the Wadi Raian. The

line of levels run with the aid of Mr. Stadler proves that there is a depth of from
100 to 250 feet below high Nile throughout an area of at least 400 square miles.

--Photographs and ancient maps show that the ruins in Moileh never visited, with
--one possible exception, prior to the visits this year of Dr. Schweinforth and the

author are identical with Dionysias. Thus the Wadi Raian has been identified
in position, shape, and depth with the Zacus Me7-ich's of the Greeks and Romans.
The project of its restoration is now actively occupying the attention of the proper

authorities.

                    4. Recent Exploration in New Guinea.
                      By Captain Henry Charles Everill.

The author of this paper commanded an expedition to New Guinea organised

by the Geographical Society of Australasia. The expedition left Sydney in the

steam launch Bonito in June 1885. The Hon. John Douglas and the Rev. S.

MacFarliue accompanied it to the entrance of the Fly River. For a long time

nothing was heard of the explorers, but towards the end of October it was

rumoured that they had met with a disaster, and the Rev. S. MacFarline was given

a circumstantial account of their massacres when he visited the Fly River to make

Ainquiries. This alarming news naturally caused much anxiety.  relief party

left Thursday Island three days after its receipt, and the admiral in command of

the station despatched well-found steam launches to the Fly River. However,

three days after the search party had left Thursday Island the Bonito steamed

quietly iuto port.

The expedition had gone up the river Fly for some distance beyond Ellangowane

Island, and discovered a ]iew river, which was named the Satrickland. It ascended

that river as far as lat. 5° 30' S., long. 142° 22' E., a point near the boundary

between British and German New Guinea. The last ninety miles of this voyage

were made in a whale-boat, the Bonito having stranded on a shingle bank, where

she remained high and dry for seven weeks. The journey proved very trying,

owing to the strength of the current and the rapids which had to be surmounted,

but was accomplished without loss of life. Several thousand objects illustrating

the geology, botanj-, zoology, and ethnography of New Guinea were collected, and

after having been exhibited in Sj-dney distributed among the Australian museums.
Complications with the natives were avoided. Many of the party (twelve Euro-

peans and twelve Malays) suH'ered from fever, but only one death was recorded,

namely, that of a Malay, who died of lung disease.

  4. Biver Entrances. By Hugh Robert Mill, B.Sc, F.B.8.E., F.C.S.

     The entrances of rivers have liitlierto been studied almost exclusively from the
* practical ' point of view, and few facts concerning the mixture of sea and river
water, except those ascertained incidentally by engineers, are known. The want of a
proper geographical definition of a river leads to considerable difficulty in some eases,
when it is of importance to know exactly where the river ends and the sea begins.
This definition may be supplied by considering the physical conditions of the water.

A preliminary classification of river entrances divides them into

         1. Those connected with inland seas, e.y., the Caspian.
         2. Those connected with tideless enclosed seas, e.y., the Mediterranean.
         3. Those connected with tidal seas.

     Hiver entrances of the third kind are of most interest in this country, and in
order to class them naturally it is necessary to consider the physical conditions of
the water as well as the topography of the shore.

   A typical river system of the third class comprises a river gradually widening

and deepening as it merges into a funnel-shaped sea-inlet, and such a system may

be clearly divided into three parts:

        1. The river proper, a stream of fresh water with its connected tributaries
                 and feeding lakes.

        2. The estuary, where tidal mixture of fresh and salt water takes place, and
                along which there is a rapid change in salinity and temperature, while

                there are considerable differences between bottom and surface conditions
                 and between those found at high and at low tide.
        3. The firth, where the rate of increase of salinity and of change of tempera-
                 ture, as the sea is approached, is small and proirressively diminishing
                and where there is little dift'erence between bottom and surface con-
                ditions and between the state of matters at high and at low tide.

     Some riyers have no firth, others have neither firth nor estuary ; the size, posi-
tion, and character of each region depending on the ratio between the volume and

velocity of fresh water in the river to the size and configuration of the sea-inlet
into which it falls, and also to some extent on the weather and on tides.

     The only British river-system which has been pretty fully investigated physi-
cally is that of the Forth. ^ The Clyde,- Tay,' and Spey * have been examined in a
preliminary manner, and the Thames^ estuary to a slight extent. Attention may
be specially drawn to the Thames, the Bristol Channel, the Wash, and the mouths
of the Mersey, Kibble, Humber, and Shannon as worthy of special study in this

respect.

     The observations required in such researches as carried on by the Scottish
Marine Station are the following, repeated monthly at intervals of a few miles
along the river channel from fresh water to the sea :

         1. Temperature at surface, bottom, and intermediate depths.
         2. Density of the water as a measure of salinity at the same places.

        3. Amount of susj>ended matter and transparency.

         4. Alkalinity as a measure of dissolved' calcium carbonate.

      Messrs. Negretti and Zambia's patent standard deep-sea thermometer, in the

Scottish frame, and the Scottish slip water-bottle made by Mr. Frazer, Lothian

Street, Edinburgh, are the most convenient and trustworthy instruments for ascer-
taining temperature beneath the surface, and for collecting samples of water in river
entrances where depth is small and currents are rapid.

paratus.)

   5. Configuration of the Clyde Water System.^

By Hugh Robert Mill, D.Sc, F.B.S.E., F.C.S.

The Clyde runs westward for 25 miles from Glasgow, gradually widens to

2 miles at Cloch Point, where it turns abruptly southwards and pursues this course

for 49 miles, rapidly attaining a width of 30 miles, which continues until it merges in

the Irish Channel. The southern and eastern shores are unindented, but the northern

is cut up by inlets averaging about three-quarters of a mile wide, and from 2^ to

'16 miles long. Bute, Arran, and the Cumbraes give rise to narrow cliannels in the

Firth the largest, Kilbrennan Sound, runs up into Loch Fyne, the widest of the
                                ;

sea-lochs, and 40 miles long. This topographical description gives little idea of the

natural divisions of the district or of the true relations in it of laud and water.

The large bathymetrical chart exhibited, which was made for the atithor by

Mr. Bartholomew, Edinburgh, is contoured and coloured to show the depths of water
Aand the heights of land. It plainly indicates the following features.

of Arran to the Ayrshire cost, with a depth of ahout 25 fathoms. The 50-fathom

line runs nearly from the Mull of Cantyre to the Mull of Galloway, and imme-

diately beyond it the 80 fathom contour appears. Arran is smTounded, except on the

south-west side, with water of over 30 fathoms, extending close to shore and deepen-

ing towards the centre to over SO fathoms. The greatest depression runs N.W.

from the Sound of Bute to beyond Tarbert, in Loch Fj'ne, near which the deepest

point, 107 fathoms, occurs. This \-shaped deep area is termed the Arran Basin.

Greenock, and depths of 10 fathoms stop a little further up. Upper Loch Long,

Loch Goil, Loch Strivan, and upper Loch Fyne, although very narrow, form

abrupt troughs from 50 to 80 fathoms deep. These are surrounded by high hills,

the 2,000 feet contour approachuig the water's edge. Where flat land borders the

shore depth, as a rule, is slight and increases gradually ; a good example is seen

along the Ayrshire coast. The occurrence of exceptional heights on land in connec-

tion with unusual depth of water is noticed at the Mull of Cantyre and the north

of Arran.

   A remarkable valley connects the Holy Loch through Loch Eck to Loch Fyne,

and another through Loch Long to Loch Lomond. _Both of these fresh lakes drain

into the Clyde water system, and their configuration is exactly similar to that of

the deep sea-lochs.

                  G. British North Borneo. By W. B. Pkyer.

     The author describes that part of the large island of Borneo recently ceded by
native Sultans to the British North Borneo Company. This portion of the island
he describes as being of about the same size as Scotland, mountainous on the
western side, and with large slopes and flats on the eastern. Amongst the
mountains is the celebrated Kina Balu, over 13,900 feet high. Many rivers have
their sources near the west coast, and, following a very long and winding course,
fall into the sea on the east. The junction of several of these rivers at a place
called Penungah, about the centre of the territory, forms a noble stream, known as
the Kina Bataugan, which is traversable for must of its length bv small steam
laimches, and up which even largish steamers can ascend for 160 miles. At various
places below Penungah the Kina Batangan is joined by other large tributaries, up
one of which, the Quarmote, are the Alexandra Falls, said to be a noble waterfall,
but never yet seen by any European. The other rivers on the east coast are the
Labuk, Sugut, Paitan, Segama, Benguya, Moanna, and others.

     The author says that the non-existence of the Kina Balu Lake, still marked on
many maps, was first proved by him in the year 1880. The theory, still existing,
that the place where this lake was supposed to be is a large flat, subject to inunda-
tion in the wet season, he does not believe in, as he saw many hills and mountains
in the part where this flat is supposed to be.

     The rivers on the east coast, he says, run through uninhabited virgin forest,
the population having been driven away, up to within very recent times, by the
numerous pirates that infested the coast. On the west there is a fair sprinkling of
people. The hills are for the most part sandstone, but here and there limestone
and other formations occur. There are several fine harbours; Guya, on the west,
Kudat, on the north, and Sandakan, on the east, being the principal. The author
goes on to describe Sandakan Harbour, which, he says, is one of the finest in the
world ; easy of access even to steamers of tlie largest size, having behind it the
trade of the two largest rivers in the territory, the Kina Batangan and the Labuk,
almost on the track of the steamers between Australia and China, which some-
times call in, and commandingly situated as regards the trade and commerce of the
surrounding seas and islands, which he thinks must ultimately concentrate there.

He also calls attention to the immense importance in the future of Sandakan as a

coaling station for our men-of-war and for docking purposes generally.

    He then goes on to describe the resources of the country, which, he thinks, from

the healthiness of its climate, the equableness and want of extreme heat of its
734 EEPOET-- 1886.

temperature, tlie absence of ptysical disturbances, such as hurricanes, earthquakes,
volcanoes, and the like ; the fertility of its soil, and the prodigious quantity of
natural wealth with which it abounds, including extremely rich birds'-nests, canes,
beeswax, india-rubber, beche de mer, pearls and pearl shells, fish, gold, &c., will
support a very large population ; and he even thinks that possibly in the future

Europeans might work themselves on some of the higher slopes in the interior.
      There is an absence of ferocious wild animals, though, from the list given,

commencing with elephants, rhinoceroses, buffaloes, deer, &c., there would seem to
be plenty of large game for the sportsman's rifle. To the European capitalist
attraction is held out in the way of valuable timber, which exists in such quantity,
and the facilities for bringing which to a shipping port are so great, that it is ex-
pected Sandakan will in time take rank as one of the largest timber-exporting places
in the East ; and after the wood has been cleared off, the ground will be available
for planting tobacco, pepper, INlanila hemp, Gambler sago, sugar-cane, and many
other things. The lists of fruits and vegetables that thrive in the country are long
ones, but the latter are described as more or less unsatisfactory. Reptiles, with the
exception of crocodiles and a large species of chicken-eating lizard, are not common.
The natives are courteous and pleasant, but lazy, and any real labour is usually

undertaken by Chinese, of whom there are unlimited supplies to be had either in
Hong Kong or Singapore.

                        Bij General F. H. Rundall, G.S.I., E.E.

     The paper commences with an account of the physical features of the peninsula,
describing its several mountain ranges and plateaux, its general meteorological
phenomena, and the effect which its peculiar configuration has on the quantity of

rainfall and its distribution.
     It next proceeds to enumerate the principal river-basins which serve to carry

off' that rainfall, distinguishing them iu their respective types, indicatmo- their re-
lative positions, specifying their respective tributaries, and detailing particulars as
to their areas, length of course, prevailing geological formation, and special charac-

teristics.

      After explaining that the four great delta rivers occupy about five-sixths
of the eastern drainage area the paper enters on a detailed description of those
rivers throughout their respective courses, the phenomena attending their floods,
the measures adopted for keeping them under control iu the lower or deltaic por-
tions, the character of the estuaries, the formation of the delta, and the great systems
of irrigation and navigation which have been constructed therein.

     The paper concludes with a notice of the value of water in India generally, and
in South India particularly, both for irrigation and navigation purposes, and
enumerates the measures which have been adopted by the Indian Government for
the promotion of such works, giving an outline of what has already been accom-
plished, and of what still remains to be done.

     The voyage thence to Chainalpu, in Corea, and a description of that place, and
of Seul, the capital of the peninsula, next occupied his attention. The poverty of
the inhabitants of Corea, and their character, were then referred to, and a contrast
dravrn between the high standard of administration aimed at in China and the
absence of system that characterises the management of Corean affairs. The
curious dress of the people was considered by the author to be worthy of note and

of description.

     The probability of the country being practically annexed by some energetic
neighbour or foreigner was asserted, and the nature of the Chinese suzerainty

discussed.

                                                     By Colonel Sir Lambert Platfaie, K.C.M.G.

     The author started from Beni Saf, the newest and most westerly harbour in the
colony, which has lately been called into existence by the rich deposits of man-
ganetic iron ore in the district. Whole mountains are being blasted and carried
away ; during 1885 more than 300,000 tons were exported, chiefly in British

vessels ; and so perfect are the loading arrangements that 1,600 tons are usually put

on board daily.

     Proceeding westward in an open boat, he visited the island of Rachgoun, the
mouth of the Tafua, and the interesting Arab ruins of Hosn Ilonai. This city was

founded about the middle of the twelfth century by Abd el-Moumen, the first

sovereign of the Moahidin dynasty, whose government extended from Morocco to

Tunis, and embraced the south of Spain, Granada, Cordova, and Murcia. He him-

self was born in the neighbourhood, and, as an act of royal favour, he exempted

the city of his creation from imposts of every description. It became the port of
Tlem^en, and was frequented by galleys from every port of Barbary as well as
from Genoa and Venice. It was finally deserted on the occupation of Oran by the

Spaniards in 1509.

    The /;-we' walls are still standing, and enclose an area of 17 acres; now a

beautiful tangle of fig-trees and flowering shrubs, with abundance of clear running

water.

The author drew particular attention to the extraordinary and hardly for-

tuitous occurrence of Jewish names in the district. Procopius mentions that in his

time two pillars existed at Tangier with the inscription, Wejiee from the robber

MyJoshua, the son of Nun. Here we have Cape Nun, a marabout dedicated to
Lord Nun
                                                  ;  another to  Our Lord  Oucha, a village of  Sidi Aissa, and a tribe called

AOxdad Ichou, the last tkree being different forms of the word Joshua.                             little

further west is the tribe Oulad Haouren, or Children of Aaron, who are said to

possess a distinctly Jewish type.

    He landed at Nemours, the last town on the coast, and thence, proceedino-

south, he arrived at Leila Maghnia, an important frontier post. Close to Nemours

may be seen a rude but interesting monument covering the remains of the column
commanded by Colonel IMontagnac, which was exterminated by Abd el-Kadir in
1845. At 16 kilometres from the sea is the remarkable Berber city of Nedroma

surrounded with frise walls exactly like Honai. Until the last few years it was
inhabited exclusively by natives, but a few Europeans have lately settled there ·

and it will probably soon lose its Berber cbai'acter, wbicli now makes it so

interesting.

     The author gave an account of tlie disturbances wliicb have lately occurred
within the frontier of Morocco and of his journey to Tlem^en by a new route only
just opened to traffic.

     From Tlemfen he visited Sebdou and the mountains of the Beni Snous, where
he was hospitably entertained by The Old Woman, as she is affectionately called,
the widow of Si Mohammed bin Abdulla, Agha of the Beni Snous, who was

murdered by Captain Doineau, chief of the Bureau Arabe of Tlemjen in 1856.
The affair created a great sensation at the time. Doineau was convicted and
sentenced to death, a penalty commuted to perpetual exile from France.

--Pkesident of the Section John Biddtilph Martin, M.A., F.S.S., F.Z.S.

       THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2.

The Peesident delivered the folio-wing Address :

As the years succeed each other, and the roll of past Presidents lengthens, an ever-
increasing hurden of responsibility lies on the occupant of the chair which I am

called upon to fill. For twenty-one years (1835-55) this Section existed as the
"Statistical Section ; for thirty-one years more it has been known as the Economic and
Statistical Section, and for the fourth time its meeting-place is Birmingham. Henry
Hallam presided over this Section at the Birmingham meeting in 1839, the late
Lord Lyttelton in 1849, the Earl of Derby, then Lord Stanley, in 1865; since
the last-mentioned date the chair has been occupied by men distinguished by their

--knowledge and practice of public aflairs such as the late Mr. W. E. Forster, Lord

--Iddesleigh, and Mr. Shaw-Lefevre or by their acquaintance with the theoretic

aspect of economic questions, among whom may be mentioned Professor Ingram,

Professor Jevons, Professor Thorold Rogers, and Professor Sidgwick, while the

names of Mr. Palgrave and of the late Mr. Henry Fawcett recall men who iu

dittierent careers of life have shown themselves conversant with matters theoretical

and matters practical alike. It might have been assumed that under such guidance
the position of this Section of the British Association would have been at all
times amply secured yet it is no secret that but a few years ago its efficiency

                                                                                                      ;

was called in question, and its status as a scientific body was seriously challenged.
The attack called forth an address that has been described by a subsequent Presi-
dent as * the most elaborate and brilliant to which this Section has ever listened,'
and since the delivery of this address at Dublin by Professor Ingram in 1878 the
position of the Economic and Statistical Section has been, if not absolutely defined

as a matter of form, yet practically secure as a matter of fact.

      But it is not only before the followers of rival sciences in this many-sided
British Association that economic research has had to stand on its defence. Almost
at the same time that Professor Ingram was vindicating the proposition that
economic phenomena were 'capable of ' and ' pi-oper subjects for ' scientific treat-

ment. Professor Bonamy Price, addressing a body ^ somewhat similar to our Section

in its constitution, declared that ' political economy is in entire abeyance,' and

concluded that ' political economy is not a science, in any strict sense, but a body of

systematic knowledge gathered from the study of common processes, which have
been practised all down the history of the human race in the production and distri-

bution of wealth. Who,' he exclaims, ' sends for a professional economist in a strike ? '
and in despair at finding that ' in the war of classes political economy is absent,' and
that he was unable to discover ' uniform sequences, general facts which can be de-
scribed as laws because they ever recur in the same form,' decides that until the far-

distant day shall come when the actions of man in his social relations shall be guided
by a supreme governing science of society, ' for sociology we must substitute political
philosophy in its broadest sense ; or, better yet, the legislator himself.' But we

sliould hardly look for siicli a legislator among the ranks of practical men, ' swarm-

ing with theories, with ideas built up with the greatest dogmatic confidence in his

knowledo"e of business. His common sense is the very last authority to which the
decision of what is right political economy ought to be referred.' From the
guidance of such untrained empiricism, as obnoxious to Professor Bonamy Price as

to Mr. Herbert Spencer, no right guidance is to be hoped, nothing but disaster can
be expected. In point of form the controversy was obscured by the difficulty that
exists in deciding the exact limits of art and science respectively, or of defining
either the one or the other of these. It is not for one whose training has been

strictly practical, whose conclusions have been derived rather from observation of
contemporary facts thau from academic teaching, and whose present object is not

to weary you with dialectic subtilties, but to insist that true social science is no-

thing if not practical, to refine on the shades of meaning that attach to words and

terms. It may be left to a more fitting time and place to reconcile or to decide

between the  dictum  of Mill  that ' art necessarily presupposes knowledge                                                                                                                                                                                                         art, in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

any but its infant state, presupposes scientific knowledge,' ' and that of Dr. Guy :

An' art so long as it continues to be a mere aftair of skilful handiwork, remains an

art · but directly it submits itself to the guidance of well-ascertained principles, it

may claim to be a science ; ' - or to reconcile the saying of Sir John Ilerschel, that

' Science is the knowledge of many, orderly and methodically digested and ar-

ranged, so as to become attainable by one,' ^ with that of Professor Sedgwick, who

understood science as ' the consideration of all subjects, whether of a pure or

mixed nature, capable of being reduced to measurement and calculation.''^ Within
the boimds of one or other of these definitions we may arrive at the exclusion from

the domain of science of all but the registration of immutable laws, and lay down

as the 7ie plus ultra of science the statement of the simplest mathematical formula.

In this showing there can be no experimental science, for there can be no science

until the experimental process has evolved the knowledge of a law. Or, on the

other hand, we may easily claim a place among sciences for the objects of this

Section, namely, to investigate the laws which govern the individual and social

life of man, to examine causes which seem to be accountable for exceptions, real

or apparent, to such laws, and, in the words of Dr. George Mayr, ' from milliards of

facts obtam the grand average of the world.'

It is perhaps in the sciences that have their origin in our knowledge of physio-

logical law that we can find the closest parallel to the position of economics as a

science. The sciences of medicine or of surgery are clearly based on our acquaintance

with the growth, the nutrition, and the decay of the body, the structure and pro-
Weperties of its component tissues.
                                     Imow that ' if the brain be out, the man will

die ; that if we open an artery he will certaiidy bleed to death ; that a given
                   '

quantity of a certain drug will inevitably kill. But if medical science were no

more thau this, the physician would be no more than the veterinary, the surgeon

nothinf better than a joiner. In the application of medical knowledge, whether

to a particular case or to an epidemic, previous history, immediate environment,

even psychological considerations must certainly be taken into account. Mistakes

have arisen, and still arise ; we are amazed at the faulty inferences and analogies
that have been drawn by medical experts in the past, and we may doubt whether

finality has been in all cases attained even at the present ; but the phj'sical laws

remain, and are not discredited by the faulty interpretation of them by their

students.

   We need not, then, despair of the future of political economy, and acquiesce in

its relegation to a distant planet, because its teaching, based too often on a 23rion

reasoning, and too little on the experience of history, does not always square with

the actions of men, warped in their judgment of any particular problem of the day

by prejudice or self-interest. May we not claim that pohtical economy has rather

taken vip wider grovmd than, as has been said by a recent writer, that it has aban-

doned many of its outworks : that it does not only concern itself with the produc-
tion and distribution of wealtii, regarding human beings as mere automata, or as

parts of a machine, each fulfilling its assigned function with undeviating and
passionless precision : but that rather

                           Gaudia, discursus,

must be taken into account in that true statecraft to which political economy should
be our guide ? If the parties to an impending civil war between labour and capital,
to an international war of tariffs, or of arms, do not refer their differences to the

arbitrament of a professional economist, is it not less because scientific opinion or
expert common-sense could not be trusted to a sound and right decision, than

because
                               Faciunt homines plerumque cupidine cjeci

                           Et tribuunt ea quae non sunt his commoda vere ? -

     It is no reproach to economic science to have taken up wider ground, to
have recognised as matters within its proper scope considerations that the older

economists, concerning themselves with wealth in its narrow sense as the summum
bonum, and with the desire for its acquisition as the one mainspring of human

action, would have rejected as sentimental or philanthropic. Humanity is many-
sided, its units do not lend themselves to grouping or combination with the preci-
sion of mathematical symbols, and the experiments of the social philosopher are
subject to disturbances unknown in the laboratory of the chemist. The experi-
ments of physical science are difficult enough. ' In the spontaneous operation of
nature there is generally such complication and such obscurity, they are mostly
either on so overwhelmingly large or on so inaccessibly minute a scale, we are so
ignorant of a great part of the facts which really take place, and even those of
which we are not ignorant are so multitudinous, and therefore so seldom exactly
alike in any two cases, that a spontaneous experiment is commonly not to be

found.' *

     But experiment on the body social is a matter of yet greater complexity ; the
very conditions of man's being, and the prerogative of independent action based on
intelligent reasoning power, that form the basis of, and give rise to the study of
social science, render all experiments tentative, and their result rather a calculation

of grand average than an evolution of absolute law. Professor Marshall, in consider-
ing the functions and limits of the historic method, uses language similar to that
applied by Mill to experiment in the physical sciences :

      ' History never repeats itself. In economic or other social problems no event
has ever been an exact precedent for another. The conditions of life are so various

every event is the complex result of so many causes, so closely interwoven that the

past can never throw a simple and direct light on the future.'''
     The attention of more than one ingenious inquirer has been occupied by the

harmonies and antagonisms between economic and natural science, and the former

may be shown to have its physical, its biological, and its psychological side.* It

is no reproach to the latter studies if they, too, depend on the accurate observation
and correct interpretation of facts for the determination of their truths and the
establishment of their general laws. The discovery of a footprint in some primeval

sandstone, of a flint weapon in the drift gravels of the Somme, of a human skull in
the caverns of the Meuse Valley, or in the auriferous drifts of California, may set

back the dial of geological time and revolutionise our conceptions of the duration

of animal or human life on our planet. If, then, our inquiries into the physical phe-
nomena that surround us compel us to admit that no finality has yet been reached,

need the economist hesitate to allow that the bases of his sphere of observation
are not immutably laid down, that his conclusions are not yet absolute ?

     The naturalist or biologist watches the infinite complexity of the opposing
forces of construction and destruction that make up the balance of animal and

vegetable life. All natm-e is incessantly at war with itself, and the tattle is to the

strong, the race to the swift ; a sure instinct guides each individual, or each aggre-

gation of individuals, in the path of unswerving selfishness that leads, in the great

majority of cases, to the maintenance of the species. In the crowded communities

of the lower animals all is order, regularity, and method ; the sustenance of the

community, the ventilation and sanitation of the common dwelling, and the disposal

of its redundant population, all is provided for ; and though pestilences occur, it is

chiefly in the case of animals subject to man that they appear to have any sensible

or permanent effect on the aggregate numbers of the species. With mankind it is

different ; his better and more amiable feelings no less than his self-interests, his

virtues as well as his vices, tend ever towards results that are not in harmony

with those that would ensue from the operation of natural law. The higher the

civilisation of any community, the more does it tend to aggregation and concentra-

tion of its  members                                       in large cities the forces that lead  to the  deterioration as well
                                                        ;

as those that promote the conservation of the race tend no less to destroy than to

maintain the balance of nature. Sanitary science, even though its teaching be

enforced by compulsory legislation, has a hard struggle to keep at bay the diseases

that man, less well taught in this than are the lower animals, seems inevitably to

invite to his crowded cities and insanitary dwellings. The resources of medicine

and surgery ally themselves with the promptings of humanity or natural affection

in promoting the survival of the least fit, and the perpetuation of a race too often

inheriting the vices, no less than the diseases, of their predecessors. Nor is it in

cities only that man's interference with natural forces reacts on the conditions of

his life ; the settlement and clearing of a new country, and in a minor degree even

a change in agricultural methods in one already settled, affects the fauna, the

flora, and even the climate and meteorology of the land, its power of production of

food, and its salubrity for habitation.

It is something if we have learnt by the experience of time that social problems

are not the mere calculation of man's actions as determined by motives of self-

interest, and as measurable in money or its equivalents. Need we abandon all

observation because we cannot conduct experiments with the precision of the

chemist, weighing our ingredients in the balances of the laboratory ? The land, as

delimited by Adam Smith, by Ricardo, and even by Mill and Cairnes, has been

found too narrow for us ; the boundaries have been broken down and overpassed :

is there no alternative between the despairing admission that all is barrenness

before us, and the elaboration of such Utopian schemes of society as have been

imagined by Rousseau, by Robert Owen, or by Comte and his disciples of the

present day ? One lesson at least we may learn and take to heart : whether, on the

one hand, the problems of social science are capable of being stated and solved

by a method towards which we are as yet but groping our way in semi-darkness,

by some new organon yet to be formulated ; or whether, on the other, we must

depend on the promptings of well-balauced and trained common-sense for the ex-

planation of every new combination of conditions : whether political economy consist

in the discovery of truths, or merely in the recognition of facts, it must not be

academic only. No community can be fed on dogma ; an industrious and hard-

working population, such as is that of our country, and of Avhich the great city in

which we are assembled furnishes the most conspicuous example quick to appre-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

ciate the hardness of the struggle by which it maintains itself in existence, and

eager to grasp at any prospect of alleviation, will not be convinced as to the

universal applicability of formulae of supply and demand, of entire freedom of

contract, and unlimited competition in the circumstances of their particular case.

Nor, on the other hand, will any credit accrue to the study of political economy jf

we abandon ourselves for all guidance to the untrained promptings of empiricism

the guidance of so-called common-sense, sometimes called iuto action by generous

instincts, sometimes by mere impulse, is only too frequently misleading.

It is at this point that the statistical method comes in as an inseparable ally of

economic speculation. If the latter has had from time to time, and still has, to

a.ssert its position among the sciences, what place shall be assigned to the method

which is only too often assumed to be the mere massing and grouping of figures ?

--It has been said and tlie saying is not altogether devoid either of truth or humour
--that ' statisticians when they meet together devote half their time to discussing

the status and dignity of their pursuit, and its precedence of, or subservience to,

economics.' 1 The vulgar misuse of the word statistics has no doubt contributed, in

many cases, to ambiguity in its use. The extreme instance need perhaps hardly be

mentioned when ' statistics ' are used simply as equivalent to ' figures ; one may

--stronger. But apart from cases in which false figures do not tell the truth I do

not say false statistics, for to speak of false statistics appears to me to be very nearly

--a contradiction in terms there is the much more frequent class of cases in which

they do not tell the whole truth. Examples of this class wiU readily occur to

everyone ; I may refer to one very happily chosen by the President of this Section
in 1865 (Lord Derby), namely, the error that may be imported into the death-rate

by a year of pestilence, not only by its effect on the mortality of the year of its

occurrence, but by its clearing away feeble lives, and so lightening the death-rate in

years immediately consequent. There is less to be feared from errors arising out

--of this source if we lay to heart the warning uttered by Mr. Goschen on a recent

occasion, ' Beware of totals,' if we recognise more fully than we are usually

apt to do that a table of figures, even if it be absolutely coiTect as a statement of

fact, is merely raw material, not a finished product. The misfortune is that it is

only too frequently treated as the latter. Such a table usually sets forth what in

the dialect of the produce-market is known as the ' statistical position ' of some
article of trade, or, in the language of Mr. Wynnaid Hooper,'^ as the ' primary

statistical quantity.' Jlr. Hooper, while agreeing with Professor Ingram in deny-

ing to statistics any right to be described as a science, defines the Statistical

Method as ' a scientific procedure involving the employment of statistics,' the

intelligent compilation of these primary quantities, and the intelligent use of them
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     .

when so compiled. This definition makes the statistical method applicable to the

solution of the well-known problem, interesting, no doubt, to some in Birming-

ham, ' What becomes of all the pins ? ' no less than to the most complex economic

questions. If the word ' statistics ' were equivalent to ' figures,' there would be

nothing to be said against this ; but the history of the word shows that its

connotation has always been in a condition of imstable equilibrium. The late Dr.

Guy, one of the most ardent champions of the dignity as a science of the method

for which he did so much, has traced for us the evolution of the word,^ from the now

almost extinct form ' statist," as used by Shakespeare, Milton, and the dramatists

of the Restoration, in the sen.'^e of economist, to the invention in 1749 by

Achenwall of the singular form ' Die Statistik,' and the adoption of ' statistics

in this country at the beginning of the present century. Even since that recent

period the wheel has come round full circle. In 1833 statistical inquiry was

introduced to the notice of the British Association as one which should limit itself

strictly to ' matters of fact ' and ' numerical results,' eschewing altogether matters

Aof opinion, even as deduced therefrom.  similar spirit seems to have been in the

founders of the Statistical Society of London in 1834, who adopted as their motto

' aliis exterendum,' a phrase implying that their province was merely the harvesting

of the above-defined primary statistical quantities, to be threshed and winnowed

by the political economist. That this restricted scope was all that could be claimed

by statistics was strongly held by some of its leading members; but the original

motto of the Society has been abandoned, and the narrower view has been by no

one more emphatically repudiated than by Sir Rawson Eawson, late President of

--the Society, in his opening address to its jubilee meeting in 1885: 'I am not

prepared to make statistics the handmaid of social science, to degrade the parent

into the position of a hewer of wood and a drawer of water in the service of its

own offspring.' ' Nor have indications beeii wanting of a desire, still more recently

expressed, to break down the wall of division between statistics as generally under-

stood and political economy, and to treat the two, if not as identical, at least as so

closely allied as to be capable of similar or simultaneous consideration.-

Enough has been said to show how very indeterminate have been the positions

of economics and statistics from the time when they first obtained recognition as

subjects of special study ; how attempts have been made and resisted to restrict

economics to the narrow circle of political arithmetic, or how statistical study has

attempted, and that successfully, to vindicate for itself a more enlarged scope than

the mere tabulation of figures. Dr. V. John of Berne, and Dr. Geo. Mayr of

Strasburg, and among ourselves the late Dr. W. A. Guy, have amply summarised

the history and terminology of this branch of inquiry. It would be superfluous to

add to or to repeat what these and others have written ; it is sufficient to insist--if

indeed it be necessary to dp so-- that as in the debatable etymology of the word

statistics we may find by implication the whole range of political economy, so in

the word economy are included all things that pertain to the due regulation of the

body corporate, whether State or household, and not those only that pass in the

former as laws of the distribution of wealth, and in the latter as the keeping of

accounts. But from whatever standpoint we may regard either economic or

statistical study, whatever maj^ be their mutual connection one with the other,

and whatever afiinities we may trace between either of them and the branches of

knowledge which divide with them the attention of this Association, we must

always bear in mind that we in this Section, though by no means utilitarian only,

are yet pre-eminently liable to be called on to show how far our works have been

of practical advantage to mankind. In other departments of inquiry, as in our

own, science and art go hand in hand ; astronomy depends not only on the inter-

pretation of nature's laws reduced to mathematical formulae, but on the art of the

instrument-maker as taught by the science of optics : the microscope, the spectrum,

the retort, and the blowpipe lend their assistance equally to the chemist, the

geologist, and the physicist. So with us are figures, if not the slave or the

handmaid, yet in any case an indispensable adjunct to and an inseparable com-

panion of economic research. But while the word utilitarianism has an luipleasing

sound to the majority of scientific ears, it is one by which ours need not be

offended. The astronomer will be slow to admit that the knowledge of the

causes that affect the tides and the better guidance of the adventurous navigator

are the highest outcome                                                          of his  science                                    the  chemist or geologist alike will  demur
                                                                                                                                 ;

affected the conditions of man's existence all over the world, and have given rise

to new problems for the economist ; we cannot level at the man of science the

reproach

 scope and object of their political sj-stem the assurance to every man of ' liberty

  and the pursuit of happiness.' If this be so, the 'unorthodox' economist of the

  present day will have to admit to liimself that he has to address himself to the
  problem declared in a well-known passage of Carlyle ^ to be insoluble by ' the
  whole finance ministers and upholsterers and confectioners of modern Europe in
 joint stocli company, to make one shoeblack happy.' Nor will the disciples of the

 school of Humanity go far beyond us in declaring that ' we uphold as the true key-

  note of social reorganisation in the future the insisting on the moral law as supreme
 and paramount to interest.'-

       Our responsibilities are great, if our studies and labours are anything more than
 philosophic speculations, anything better than an Epicurean survey of causes and
 effects, which we are altogether powerless to direct or to influence. As we con-
 template the changes that have taken place in the material conditions of man's life
 all over the civilised world during the past century, or in our own country duriug
 the period of fifty years, whose approaching completion luider the sway of our
 Sovereign is giving a text to so many themes of self-gratulation, this responsibility
 is constantly forced on our attention. Has this vast increase of population, con-
 comitant with a still more astonishing and ample store of the means of sustenance
 and of the collective wealth, been accompanied by an improvement in the

 average well-being of the individual ? And if we are able to answer this

 question in the affirmative, and to justify our answer by figures, so far as figures

 will enable us to do so, can we claim that this general improvement is due

 in any degree to our right appreciation of economic laws, and to the right

 application of human control to them, so far as human agency is competent to
 interfere in their operation ? Or has this progress been brought about by causes
 which we are impotent to control, and which it is therefore useless to examine ?

 Or, on the other hand, is this apparent progress entirely illusory ? is it true that the

type must deteriorate in proportion as the individual multiplies? and must we

admit that our researches have been either labour misapplied, or that they have been
powerless to arrest the movement on the downward slope ? These are questions
to which it is not easy to give any answer that shall be beyond cavil or criticism,

but they are always before us, and we may not decline to face their consideration.

Most notably do they jiress themselves on our attention in such a place as
Birmingham. Our overgrown inorganic metropolis is a thing apart, without

cohesion or entity, not comparable with any other social unit ; our large cities still

have a life and individuality of their own. When we contemplate our busy ports,

our fleets of ships, and the vast mass of foreign materials which a network of rail-

ways distributes to inland centres of manufacture when we view the swarming
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

streets, the splendid buildings, and teeming industrial population of such a city as

Birmingham, we may point to evidence of material prosperity that cannot be gainsaid,
and may challenge comparison in this respect with the world. But we pay a penalty

for all this in a shape which is no less constantly forced on our notice ; crowded lanes,

noisome alleys, insanitary dwellings, stunted and unhealthy men and women,
sickly children, bread hardly won by labour in factories or at occupations that no
legislative interference can render wholly innoxious. ' The evils and the diminished
vitality that are caused by poverty, crime, personal uncleanliness, drink, and excess
of all kinds, as also by the close agglomeration of human beings in places that ofier

the best chance of lucrative employment, and especially by the unhealthiness of

certain occupations, are such as can at best be mitigated by the sanitary authorities,
and often lie entirely outside their power of interference.' ^ Hence arise misery and
poverty, and thence discontent, contrasts between luxury or ease, and poverty or

--want. Hence, again, conflicts between capital and labour a worse than civil, a
--fratricidal strife between forces whose co-operation is essential to success, and

an inclination to apply legislative remedies at every turn to each evil that strikes

the imagination or the eye.

     It is not surprising that pessimist views sliould sometimes prevail, and that
expressions should pass current such as the one which I quote from the public

press : ' Some attempt should be made to strike at the over-pressure of population

in Loudon, which is, of course, the root of the evil. ... It obviously is the evil

which we have got to face. The tendency to drift into cities is one of the curses
of all civilised communities, of whatever social stock they may be.' ^ For myself I

am not prepared to admit that a tendency which is indisputable, and which is dis-

played in ever}' nation in proportion to its enjoyment of peace at home and abroad,

has laid the world under so widespread a curse. It is a tendency that is as well

marked in nations that are among the least progressive in point of population as in

those of most rapid growth. In France, whose population is practically stationary,

the rur.il population, which forty years ago constituted three-fourths of the total

inhabitants, is now but two-thirds of the whole, showing a transfer or balance of

four million souls (including, however, one million of immigrant foreigners) from

the country to the towns.- On the other hand, in the United States, whose popu-

lation is expanding with a rapidity tliat is proverbial, and whose numbers are
doubling themselves every twenty years, as as-ainst an estimated period of two

hundred and seventy-one years in the case of France, the increase of urban popu-

lation is still more strongly marked. The official figures of 1840 show that in the

United States one-twelfth of the population lived in cities of 8,000 and over ; in

1850, one-eighth ;  in 1860, one-sixth ;  in  1870,  a  little  over  one-fifth                                          in 1880, not
                                                                                                                      ;

much less than one-fourth.'

In England the same process has been going on simultaneously with the

great stream of emigration which has transferred millions of our population to

other countries. The phenomenon is too familiar to be insisted on, though the

exact extent to which it has been displayed is less clear. The distinction between
an ' urban ' and a ' rural ' district is, and perhaps must be, arbitrary, and in many

cases unsatisfactory ; it is not always easy to decide, officially or otherwise, who is

a townsman, aud who is a peasant. But it is roughly estimated ^ that whereas

thirty years ago the population of England supported by agriculture was alx)ut

equal in number to that supported by manufacturing industry, the proportions

are now approximately as to two-thirds manufacturing, and as to the remain-

ing one-third agricultural. Passing over the fact that in many cases a manu-

facturing population does not cease to be rural, and bearing in mind that the

question is as to the comparative welfare of townsman and peasant respectively, a

comparison of the birth-rate and death-rate in town and country does not show so

Apreponderating a balance as is usually imagined to exist.            net normal increase

in the English agricultural population of 14'1.35 per thousand as compared with

an increase in the towns of 14-030, or a balance in favour of the former of one per

thousand, is but a narrow margin of advantage. Nor is it the largest cities that are

the most attractive to new immigrants, since we find that the rate of increase

varies inversely with their size, and that during the last ten years the population

of towns of under 20,000 inhabitants has increased almost exactlj' as fast again as

that of towns of 50,000 and over. On the other hand, it is precisely during the evil

 times of 1841-51, the evil days of 'Sybil,' of 'Mary Barton,' of 'Sartor llesartus,'
 recently quoted by Mr. Giflen,^ when the increase of the population was the
"slowest, that the proportion of the population supported by agriculture reached its

 highest point. And if we compare the vital statistics, as a whole, of our present

 town- dwelling population with the more rural one of 1838-54, as presented to us

 by Mr. Noel Humphreys in a recent paper read before the Statistical Society, we

 do not find tliat the conditions of town-life have told adversely on the population

 of the country as a whole. Mr. Humphreys answers the question, ' Do we have a
 greater enjoyment of life as the result of a decline in the death-rate, or are we

 only a little slower in dying ? ' by demonstrating that ' although a large proportion
 of people cease to be dependent before twenty, and a large proportion of people do

 not become dependent at sixty, we shall not be far wrong in classing the forty

 years from twenty to sixty as the most useful period of man's life. Of the 2,009

 years added to the lives of 1,000 males by the reduction of the death-rate in
 1876-80 (as compared with 1838-54), no less than 1,407, or 70 per cent., are
 lived at the useful ages of between twenty and sixty.'

      Nor did the Anthropometric Committee, appointed on the recommendation of
 this Section in 1875, and which carried on its work until 1883, verify by its obser-
 vations the generally prevailing notion that the population of the kingdom is
 degenerating. The observations of the Committee were on a comparatively small
 scale, but as far as the opportunities and resources of the Committee enabled thera

 to be carried out, they showed that although in average height and weight the

 peasant in this country is superior to the artisan, as might be expected from the
 conditions of an outdoor as against a mainly indoor life, the stature and weight of
 factory children has decidedly increased. ' The increase in weight amounts to a

 whole year's gain, and a child of nine years of age in 1873 weighed as much as
one of ten years in 1833, one of ten as much as one of eleven, and one of eleven
as much as one of twelve years in the two periods respectively.' ^

      I have dwelt briefly on the subject of vital statistics, as being perhaps the most
important subject of inquiry that can come under the consideration of the statistician
or the economist. * That which does no harm to the State does no harm to

the individual ; we may state conversely this maxim of Marcus Antoninus, and
                                                                        '

claim that that which is beneficial to the individual is beneficial to the State ; and if

the prolongation of life be, and be rightly, an object of universal aim, it is especially

desirable that we should inform ourselves accurately as to whether we are living
under conditions favourable to its prolongation. And if we can prove to demon-

stration that thi.'s is the case, and that the average duration of life at the period

when life is most useful and most enjoyable has increased, we shall have made one
step necessarily preliminary to the inquiry, how far this has been due to the common-
sense of the community rightly left alone, and how far to regulation by the State

of man's apparent inclination to choose the evil rather than the good.
      I do not propose to discuss here the precise extent to which the Factory Acts,

Sanitary Acts, the greater recognition of the necessity for providing open spaces in
large towns, or playgrounds and recreation for their children and inhabitants, have
contributed to the results which have been obtained. I would rather limit myself
to pointing out how, in such an all-important subject of inquiry, the utmost dili-

gence is necessary if we would escape dangerous error. The population of a great

city is not a mere inert mass of units, to be counted and compared with other simi-

lar aggregations, as we count and compare tons of iron or bales of cotton in stock.
Before we can arrive at any pronouncement as to its welfare or otherwise, we must
take into consideration many factors besides its actual population at successive
periods, or its birth-rate as compared with its death-rate. I may cite, for one or
two instances of these disturbing causes, the admirable essay by Mons. E. Oheysson,
to which reference has already been made. He shows clearly how in the case of

births there are remaining but 421 of between one to two years of age, while

there are 465 of two years and over. Again, the various motives which have

their expression in attracting a vast immigrant population to Paris, place the city

in some respects in the position of a new colony ; the immigrants are of the age of

the greatest vigour and energy, and consequently the population of Paris between

the age of fifteen and twenty-tive years is greatly in excess of that at even the

earliest years of life. The disturbing influence which this state of things must

exercise on the birth- and death-tables is obvious, and should serve to warn us how

careful we must be in arriving at what on a previous page has been referred to as

a * primary statistical quantity ' in matters of vital statistics, before applying to it

the ' scientific procedure involving the employment of statistics,' of Professor

Ingram.

It is therefore satisfactory to know that at the first meeting of the International

Statistical Institute it will be proposed that the first work of the Institute shall be

to consider what are the points in regard to vital statistics that it is most essential

to be informed upon, and how far it may be possible to assimilate the returns in

such matters of the civilised countries of the world. No better or more useful con-

tribution to economic knowledge could be made by the distinguished statisticians

whom the formation of the Institute has brought into relation with each other.

I cannot conclude the remarks which I am on this occasion permitted to make

without reference to another subject which must be one of engrossing interest in a

commercial centre such as Birmingham. The subject of currency and prices seems

to me to be one as to which the economist, whether orthodox or latitudinarian, is

distinctly waiting on the statistician. Has the currency of the world fallen, through

interference here, and non-interference there, into a condition that has told adversely

on the commerce of the world ? In what year, or during what period of years,

were prices at the normal level which may serve as a starting-point ? Have prices

since then fallen all round, and if so, by how much ? or if they have not generally

fallen, to what extent have they fallen in the cases in which the I'all is admitted ?

These are clearly questions that should be definitely answered before we can discuss,

except as a matter of speculative opinion, whether that fall has been to the advan-

tage of the community as a whole or otherwise. But statisticians are not only

divided in opinion as to the answer to the preliminary questions, it may be

almost said that the opinion of no two are in accord. It is true that the investiga-

tion of the variation of prices by means of an ' index number,' seems to ofler a

means of forming some definite conclusion; but it must be admitted that the

attempts to arrive at anything like a satisfactory index-number have as yet been

very far from satisfactory in their result. It cannot be maintained that any com-

parison of the fluctuations in price of a selected number of principal articles of

export or trade, or even of the ratio to the whole volume of foreign trade of all

articles dealt with in the ' Statistical Abstract' can ever furnish a measure of the

many sources of expenditure that make up the total cost of living. The inquiry

is one that seems  at  the  first  blush  attractive almost to fascination                                                                                                                                             and it is one
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

that has for many years past exercised the ingenuity of careful thinkers. Mr.

Joseph Lowe ~ more than sixty years ago devised a plan to which Mr. Poulett

--Scrope, writing ten years afterwards, appears to refer in the following passage :

* It has been proposed to correct the legal standard of value (or, at least, to afford

to individuals the means of ascertaining its errors), by the periodical publication of

an authentic price current, containing a list of a large number of articles in general

use, arranged in quantities corresponding to their relative consumption, so as to

give the rise or fall from time to time of the mean of prices ; which will indicate,

with all the exactness desirable for commercial purposes, the variations in the value

of money, and enable individuals, if they shall think fit, to regulate their pecuniary

engagements by reference to this Tahdar Standard.' '^

   Mr. Poulett Scrope, holding alarmist views as to the appreciation of gold, as

shown by the tables of average prices drawn up by the Board of Trade for 1819-

1830, cordially approved such a plan ; it was also shadowed forth by G. 11. Porter

and Thomas Tooke, the first part of whose ' Histoiy of Prices ' appeared almost simul-

taneously with Poulett Scrope's book. The name of Thomas Tooke and his work

win always be associated with that of the late Mr. Newmarch, by whom the idea

of an index-number was further developed. The late Professor Jevons applied to

the same subject his iisual painstaking skill,'- and it has only the other day been

brought rmder the notice of so practical a body as the London Institute of Bankers

Anby Professor Marshall,^ in the discussion of a recent paper by Mr. Gifien.        ideal

index-number is not inconceivable ; if attained it would give us not only the ratio
between commodities so called as among themselves, but also the ratio between

commodities generally and the precious metals which serve as the medium of barter

between them. But the attempt to arrive at it is attended with infinite difficulty
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

the almost innumerable total of commodities is not, even when ascertained, a number

of articles to be measured in height by an arithmetical scale, but rather a series of

circles, sometimes concentric, at others mutually intersecting to a greater or less

degree until the space left to each is a matter of the most elaborate and intricate

calculation. To take an apparently very simple instance, if we would attempt to

investigate the fall in the price of pig-iron, we may find ourselves involved in the

consideration of an antecedent fall in the freight-charges on Spanish haematite ore,

no less than in that of a simultaneous fall in wages, consequent on a reduction in

cost of food-products consumed by the wage-earners at the iron-works ; or we may

have to take into account a decreased demand coincident with the development, of a

more economical and safer system of coal-mining. The complexity of the conditions

has led French statisticians to regard with very great suspicion the system of index-

numbers, if not to reject them as altogether misleading. I cannot myself share

this scepticism. Without expressing an opinion on the economic effects that might

arise from the establishment of a 'Tabular Standard of Value,' I cannot but

think that from a patient investigation of this arduous subject good results may

follow, and that to the elaboration of some such common measure as an effective

index-number we must ultimately look for the determination of the degree of pro-

sperity or otherwise of trade at any given period of time. The valuable paper con-

tributed by Mr. Stephen Bourne to this Section at Aberdeen * has served to show
what has been done in this direction ; and still more recently Mr. Palgrave '" has

constructed index-numbers for England and France, extending from 1865 onwards,

in which the relative importance of each commodity included is estimated and a

value put on it ; thus meeting the objection of the French economists, that in our

index-numbers we do not sufficiently distinguish the importance of each article.

I cannot imagine any greater service that this Section could render to economic

science than an elaboration of this most valuable adjunct to statistical and economic

inquiry.

     I do not venture to avail myself further of the licence as regards time which is

accorded to me by custom in addressing you. The address of a Sectional President,

in this cliaiv a lii^h standard of excellence. Of the difficulty of maintaining this

standard I am only too sensible. The conception and elaboration of the obsei-va-
tions which I have laid before you have been attended with grave doubts on my
own part whether I should not have done better in working up some point of
economics or statistics that has either come directly under my own observation

and attention or that would have been of immediate interest at this present time
and in this particular place. Of such there would have been no lack, and for taking

such a course there would have been ample precedent. But it appeared to me that

the address of a President to the Section should, unless there be some special
reason to the contrary, be something more than a Sectional paper, emancipated
from the ordinary restrictions as to length, and by courtesy almost equally sheltered
from the fi'ee criticism to which Sectional papers are subjected. I have preferred

to attempt, inadequately though it may be, to show how narrow are the limits
which divide economic from statistical inquiry, how inseparably associated tliey
must ever be, how wide is the sphere of their joint action, and how cognate in

their method they are to other branches of research which are inclined to arrogate
to themselves exclusively the prerogatives of science. In selecting for special,
though cursory, mention two points of particular interest to the economist and
the statistician, namely, vital statistics and that fluctuating basis for the estimate

of wealth which we call the standard of value ; in pointing out how specially these

are subject to those disturbing influences which Professor Caimes has carefully
taught ' us always to reserve in matters of economic speculation ; and in admitting

how tentative have been, and still are, our efibrts to grasp the complexity of their
conditions, I trust that I have not in any way derogated from the dignity of the
cause which we are here assembled to advocate and to advance. The formulae of
economics and the lessons of statistics may not in all cases have been universally
received or practically laid to heart ; the ever-varying conditions of society may
enforce a constant change in the appearance of social phenomena, and may lend an

appearance of uncertainty to our conclusions, but it is not in this place, nor is it at

the present time, that we need fear to meet the question. What has the science

which you are investigating done for tlie good of mankind ?

     The following Papers were read :

                1. On Manual Training.'^ By Sir Philip Magnvs.

     Sir Philip said that this subject had been carefully considered by a Committee
appointed to continue inquiries relating to the teaching of science in elementary
schools. They had reported to the Council of the Association that it was desirable
to make representations to the Education Department, and suggested that the
encouragement for the teaching of handicraft work might take the form recom-
mended by the Commission on Technical Instruction, so that the use of tools in
boys' schools might be placed in the same position as practical cookery in girls'
schools. It could not be too often repeated that tlie object of workshop practice,
as a part of general education, was not to teach a boy a trade, but to develop his
faculties, and give him manual skill, and to familiarise the pupil with the properties

of such common substances as wood and iron, to teach the hand and eye to work
in unison, to accustom the pupil to exact measurement, and to enable him by the
use of tools to produce actual things from drawings that represent them. The

author pointed out the collateral instruction that could be given in connection with
the teaching of handicrafts, and showed that wliile the faculties of the children
were being usefully exercised, and the area of their knowledge was being extended,
they were at the same time acquiring manual skill which could not fail to be useful
to them in every trade. It is often assumed that school time should be utilised
for teaching a child those things he is not likely to learn in after-life, whereas the

Review, November 1886.

real aim of school education should be to create a desire to continue in after-life

the pursuit of the knowledge and skill acquired in school. He explained the

method of teaching which should he adopted in order to make the instruction

a real educational discipline. He believed that the stimulating effect of the in-

struction on the intelligence of the children would be such that their progress

in literary studies would be in no way retarded bj^ the time given to practical

work. Experiments of introducing workshops iu elementary schools had been

tried in this country, with results sufficiently encouraging to justify the ex-

tension of the system ; and on the Continent and in the United States much

was done in technical teaching. An enthusiasm was spreading among Americans

in favour of workshop instruction, which was likely to have an important

influence on the industrial progress of that eminently practical and inventive

people. As a general rule, he suggested that children should be required to

have passed the fifth standard before being admitted into the workshop. As

regards the expense, he stated that three items had to be considered : 1. Cost

of erection and equipment of workshops ; 2. Cost of material ; 3. Cost of actual

teaching. Considering these items separately, he showed that the introduction

of workshop teaching would not materially increase the Scliool Board rate. It

might involve some slight addition to the Government grant. He estimated

that not more than 30,000 boys would be ready to receive workshop instruc-

tion in this country, and the additional grants required would be about 5,000/.

For this comparatively small expenditure about 30,000 boys might be annually

sent out into the world from elementary schools with practical skill at their

finger-ends, imbued with an aptitude and taste for the real work of their life,

and so educated as to be able to apply to their work the results of scientific teaching

and scientific methods. The importance of practical teaching, of studying things

before words, had been many times urged, but as yet, such had been the inertia of

school authorities and teachers, and such the force of tradition, that we were only

now beginning to employ the methods of instruction that had been preached for

years by the most eminent educational reformers. It was hoped that the com-

mittee of the Association would persevere in the representations it had already

made on this important subject, and that the labours of the Royal Commission

might result in making our elementary school teaching more practical, less verbal,

--and less mechanical. In any new Code it should be provided (1.) That the subject

2. Technical Instruction in Elementary Schools. By William Ripper.

Attention has been frequently called of late to the importance of technical

education, but hitherto with comparatively little practical result. With a view to ·

progress in this direction it is important to inquire whether suitable foundations

Weare being laid in the public elementary schools.                                                                                                                             are entitled to expect from

the schools substantial help towards the future industrial, as well as social, progress

of the country, and we should know whether anything more can be done than is

being done to accomplish this object. Manufacturing processes are becoming more

and more scientific, and the commercial value of the manufactured article more and

Wemore dependent upon artistic and tasteful design.                                                                                                                            believe that the early training

of the children will have much to do with our future national progress and, while
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

admitting the many points of excellence, we have to regret the total absence in

elementary schools of instruction specifically bearing upon industry, an omission

which a manufacturing community would do well to remedy. The energies of

--teachers and children throughout the country to-day when not engaged on the
--three R's are being expended on much that is unintelligible and useless to the

children, such as nice verbal distinctions, elaborate parsing of parts of speech, and
750 REPORT-- 1886.

the intricate analysis of complei and compound sentences ; or on cramming long

lists of capes, lakes, rivers, and mountains. Sucb information may be good in itself,

but is it of more importance to the artisan's child than the power to draw, which

is the very foundation of all manual skill ? And yet no child may be taught
Wedrawing unless he first learns parsing and grammatical analysis.
                                                                    are often told

that the school curriculum is an overcrowded one, but when the overgrown subjects

of the Code have undergone a useful pruning process, it will be possible to make

room for drawing as a compulsory class subject for experimental instruction in

science, and for manual instruction in school workshops. Drawing is admitted on

all hands to be of supreme importance as a subject of school instruction, and yet

the regulations with regard to it as they at present exist are extremely unsatisfac-

tory, their tendency being to seriously diminish, rather than increase, the number

of children under instruction. If the class subject now called 'English' were

made of practical use by being limited to the correction of provincialisms and

common errors of speech, and drawing made a compulsory subject, some valuable

work would be done.
     Experimental science is almost unknown in our schools, and, as a consequence,

the children go out into the workshops and factories crammed with information
about moods and tenses, but absolutely ignorant of the elementary principles which
would enable them to reason intelligently upon the physical facts and phenomena

by which they will be continually surrounded. Systematic science instruction is
being given in the Board schools of Birmingham and Liverpool, and with excellent

results ; the children are interested in their school work, they acquire information
which no amount of mere book-reading woidd give them, and the advantage of
such instruction will be reaped not by the children alone, but by the whole com-

munity.

Manual instruction in school workshops for boys should occupy a similar place in

the Code to needlework for girls, though it would not be convenient to take it, except

Awith the highest classes, in ordinary schools. good school workshop system should

include arrangements for working in wood and in metals, fitted with benches and
supplied with the more ordinary tools. The course of instrufiion should be purely edu-
cational, and the exercises therefore properl)^ graded as in any other subject. There
should be no idea of teaching any trade, nor of making articles for sale or profit. The
higher the grade of the school the more complete should be its fittings. The idea
in the minds of many people has been that education was going to save their
children from hard work, and the present system of instruction is still in danger of
encouraging this notion and of creating habits and tastes which may unfit the

mind for the work before it, instead of fitting and aiding it. There is a disposition
among the sharp, clever lads of the schools to leave the ranks of labour in which
their fathers have served before them to seek situations in any capacity where a
black coat can he worn rather than a canvas jacket. They are conscious of skill with
the pen, but they feel no aptitude nor desire for working with their hands, and they
will escape manual work if they can. There can be no greater fallacy than to
imagine that any boy is too good for the workshop. The workshops need, and
"urgently need, these very boys, and if the public elementary school is not helping
to enHst its best talent on the side of skilled labour we fa-e not on the right course.

Manual training will provide the connecting link between the theory of the school
and the practice of the workshop, between books and tools, and between abstract
rules and phrases and the reality of things. It will teach the dignity of labour
by example rather than by precept. It will help to form industrious, useful habits
early in life, and give a taste for doing useful work with the hands which thousands
never acquire. It will be a valuable relief from the sedentary, inactive life of the
school, and so counteract the present tendency to develop a race of dyspeptic,
pale-faced, small-limbed individuals whose goal is passing examinations, and whose
ambition is to be somebody's book-keeper. It will cultivate a respect for the worker
and an appreciation of the worth of his work, and it will provide a positive power
to work in wood and metals with more or less precision, which will be a valuable

aid to many a lad who is destined afterwards to be thrown on his own resources in

our large towns and cities, or in some of our far-oif colonies.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  751

     Manual training is being carried on with much success in France and America.

A more practical system of instruction is destined to grow and to occupy an important

place in our educational methods of the future, the aim of which will he, while
sacrificing none of the present advantages, to enable the schools to render more

efficient help than in the past to the nation's industrial progress.

                   3. Technical Education,. Bij the Rev. H. Solly.

     The author stated that preparation for technical training in handicrafts must
begin in the Kindergarten and be continued by instruction in drawing, decimal
arithmetic, and the elements of geometry in the Ijoard schools and be completed in
the "workshop and class-room.

     The apprenticeship system having for the most part broken down, the practical
training of the workshop must be supplemented by the combined practical and
scientific teaching which can be given only in the class-room. Systematic and
scientific instruction in the principles which underlie all manual industries, and the
application of those principles to the material of each handicraft (wood, iron,
sheet-metal, chemical combinations, textile fabrics, &c.) is essential for thorough
technical training, and can be given only by class teachin(j, not in the workshop.
Illustrations of this statement were given from various facts and instances. At present
it is apparently no one's interest, nor legally anyone's duty, and certainly no one is
in general qualified to give this instruction to apprentices or youths ; while it too
often appears to be the employer's interest to keep the lads in particular grooves of
work from which they learn nothing but very limited routine dexterity. Other

nations have long since acted on a wiser system, and we are feeling the conse-

quences.

     The remedy is to secure systematic and thorough technical training for the
rising generation of artificers, by returning to a regular system of ' indentured
apprenticeships,' whereby the employers, if they take lads at all into their work-
shops, shall be bound to see that they attend technical trainmg classes for a certain
number of hours in the week during the first three years of their apprenticeship.
The increased value of the services of the apprentice during the remainder of his
term, and in some cases money premiums, should recoup the employer. The

apprentice to be required to pass certain examinations, at the last of which, if passed
satisfactorily, the indentures to be given up to the apprentice, constituting thence-
forward his certificate of competency. Employer and apprentice to have legal
remedy for neglect of obligations on either side.

     Technical classes to be taught by men who, to practical knowledge of their trade,
add scientific or artistic acquaintance with its principles. Teachers to show students
how such principles are to be applied to manipulation of material. Advanced
technical training to be carried forward by professors and college teaching. Repre-
sentative working men agreed as to necessity of compulsory teaching for apprentices
on plan now described and in force on the Continent. Legislation in this matter

quite as important as in the case of ' half-timers.' First three years of apprentice-
ship to be regarded as a time not for earning monej^, but for learning a trade

efficiently. Hours for attending classes, when possible, to be arranged for two after-
noons in the week instead of evening classes. The interests alike of employers and

the lads themselves, as well as the whole manufacturing and commercial prosperity

of the nation, largely depend on these arrangements.

   4. Economic Value of Art in Manufactures. ^ By Edward R. Taylor.

    The lack of beauty in many English manufactures arises, not so much from
bad taste on the part of the purchaser as from the producer's want of artistic
culture. In this case supply must precede demand. Instances are given of this.

Manufacturers too often ignorantly regard art as an adjunct, instead of an essential,

to their wares. Art, on the contrary, should he studied with as much daily care

as the other branches of the manufactory. Facts are adduced to show that it is
only when such care has been devoted that the work will live and be most pecu-

niarily profitable ; and the attention which in former times was given in this

direction is contrasted with the comparatively small amount of thought now, in

several instances, devoted thereto. The designer employed, being insufficiently

appreciated by his master, often either takes to some other branch of art or leaves

England to seek more remunerative employment. This statement is confirmed

by personal experience, and it is also borne out by the recent Eeport of the Tech-

nical Commissioners. Three ways in which artistic manufactures may be ad-

vanced :  (1) By the  encouragement of all hand manufactures and decoration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   (2)

by counteracting the apparently natural tendency of machinery and other inven-

tions to vulgarise art by the inordinate use of ornament of a poor character; and

(3) by making the training of the eye and of the hand by the use of tools an

essential part of education from the beginning of school-life. Each of these sug-

gestions is given in detail. The paper concludes by an allusion to the satisfactory

influence which architects and architecture may have on art manufactures.

          5. Imperial Federation, or Greater Britain United.

               By Robert Grant Webster, LL.B., M.P.

In this paper the author set forth with a declaration that it was not his intention

to place before his hearers anything in the nature of a schenle of his own for the

accomplishment of Federal Government. lie pointed out difficulties in the way of

developing a solution of the question capable of practical adaptability, and said his

desire was rather to put before them one or two prominent aspects of the great

question with a view of inducing discussion that might bring it a little nearer pro-

bably towards consummation, and to suggest what he considered might be a neces-

sarily first step towards the desired end. Starting with the declaration that the

absolute advantage of the closer and more real union of the diff'erent parts of our

vast empire was generally conceded, he claimed that not one of the various sugges-

tions that had hitherto been made bore the faintest chance of being practically

worked out. In his opinion the federation of the empire, if it was ever to be

accomplished, could only be brought about on lines completely new to those

hitherto advanced. Discussing the chief points on which it was desirable that the

empire should be brought into closer union, he placed first that of defence against

internal and external attack, which was only to be attained, he believed, by a quota

of both arms of the service being recruited and quartered in, and paid for by the

important dependencies. Secondly, he believed a thorough intercommunication of

the various parts of the empire would do much to solve the question ' how to

utilise the surplus population in any one portion of the empire by developing the

resources of the other parts;' for to him the keeping in the empire of the tens of

thousands of emigrants who now quitted our shores to swell the prosperity of other

countries was a matter for deep consideration. The question of paramount

importance, however, seemed to him to be the further consolidation of the commer-

Hecial relations of the British Empire.  believed it to be practicable to unite the

whole British Empire for commercial purposes. With regard to the means to this

--end, he deprecated radical changes in the Constitution the starting of bran new

constitutions. Eather let them work on old lines and proceed by gradual and

tentative measures, substituting improvements for old systems. The ' High State

Councd ' system of federal government advocated by Sir. Staveley Hill was un-

practicable, and he believed the Imperial Parliament and the legislative bodies of

the Colonies would never consent to place the great Imperial questions of the day

in the hands of the body suggested, which would be less in touch with the actual

existing feeling of the countries concerned than they themselves now were. In his

view the only true course open to this country was to make an endeavour to place

the matter within the range of practical politics by the appointment of a Royal

Commission, composed of representatives from all parts of the British Empire,
                          TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                753

elected directly from the respective legislative bodies, whicli should sit continuously

in London and report. On the other hand, if it was considered that the question

·was not yet ripe for so decisive a step, he suggested whether an impetus might not
be given to the development of the germ of federation by summoning to England

from the great representative colonies iniluential men who should be consulted
by the Colonial Office in matters requiring colonial opinion. As a first step, this
would foster and strengthen the undoubted link which bound together in love and

unity the English-speaking race, and might, at no distant date, result in the con-
summation of a mutual determination to embrace federal government upon that

wider and more comprehensive and practical basis upon which they all so much

desired to see it established.

The following Papers were read :

    1, Boardtng-out as a method of Pauper Education and a Check on

Hereditary Pauperism.^ By Miss Wilhelmina L. Hall, F.B.Met.Soc.

The object of this paper is to put forward the claims of boarding-out as the most

natural and economical system of pauper education, and the only one by which they

are entirely/ severed from pauperising influence.

--Pauper children are of two classes permanents and casuals.
--The various methods of educating them are (1) Workhouse Schools; (2) Dis-
       (3) Cottage Homes ;                                                (4) By Emigration ; (5) By Boarding-out.
--trict Schools
                                                                       ;
I. Workhouse Schools. -Children reared in a workhouse are acknowledged to be

below the average of the working-classes both in physical and mental attainments.

Educated away from the surroundings of family life, forced to associate with chil-

dren of tramps and bad women, they are sent out into the world wholly untrained

to resource, thrift, or self-dependence. They are frequently sickly, stunted in

growth, and constant victims to ophthalmia and skin disease. Their education even

is at a disadvantage owing to their indescribable apathy and dulness, and to the

few points of illustration from the outside world available to the teachers. There

are 52,000 children (1885) in receipt of indoor relief, ·3-3,000 of whom are orphans

or relieved without their parents. Some 8,000 of these are educated in district

schools, 26,000 in workhouse or union schools, and 3,000 are boarded out ; in 300

unions children attend Board Schools. Some 30,000, at the least, are still subjected

to the pernicious influence of workhouse life, and ' have a distinct tendency to swell

the crowd of pauperism.' Is it not a State duty to set them on new ways, and to

take them from an institution rightly described as ' half penal, half charitable, and

in its results whoUy demoralising ' ?

   --II. District Schools. -This system, in operation since 1847, though a distinct

improvement on workhouse training, has been well described as ' a gigantic mistake.'

Apart from the evils of large institutions, its cost is enormous, varying from 26^. to

^0^. per head per annum.
--AIII. Cottage Homes.
                                                                          method used to a limited extent only by Poor Law

authorities. The attempt to imitate family life is admirable, though not always

successful. The cost, however, is excessive, the Banstead Cottage Homes of the

--Kensington Union costing 36^. 14s. Qd. per head per annum.
    IV. By Emigration. Most excellent in its results when care is taken to

emigrate suitable children under due supervision.

  --V. By Boarding-out. Boarding-out in England is carried on under two 'orders '

--of the Local Government Board : that of 1870, known as ' Boarding-out without

the Union,' and that of 1877 ' Boarding-out luithin the Union.' Compared with

                          ' Published by R. Clark, Dorking.

1886.                                                                     3C
754 EEPOKT-- 1886.

the order of 1870 tliat of 1877 has considerable drawbacks, most notably the want
of help from certified voluntary committees, and consequently continued subjection

of the children to pauperising connections. There are (1886) 102 certified com-

mittees, under the order of 1870, ha\'ing charge of 1,022 children ; under the order

of 1877, 1,962 are boarded-out in 148 unions.

     The advantages claimed for boarding-out as against other systems are :

  --I. JEconomy of Cost. The maximum cost of boarding-out is 13^., and the average

11/. per head per annum. Speaking generally the cost of a child educated in district
schools varies from 9s. to 16s. lOd. weekly ; in the workhouse from 4s. Sd. to 9s. 5d.

--(all charges included) ; and boarded-out 4s. 3d. per week.
    II. No Freliminary Outlay required. No enormous buildings, necessitating

raising of  large  loans, are required                                                                         merely the utilisation of                                                                                                                      an     already existing
                                                                                                            ;

simple village home.

  --III. Entire Severance from Pauper Associations and the consequent Check given

to Hereditary Pauperism. Placed in an ordinary village home the child forgets it
is a pauper, and eventually becomes absorbed into the general population. Sir J.
McNeil and the Scotch Inspectors unanimously testify that it is of the rarest

occurrence for a boarded-out child to return on the rates.

  --IV. Restoration to Family Life. Amidst the duties and responsibilities of family

life children acquire that spirit of self-dependence and energy which enables them
early to become self-supporting. They are moreover insured a home in after-life,
when otherwise their only available refuge would be the able-bodied ward of the

--workhouse.
     V. Improvement in Hecdth. ' Boarded-out children,' to quote Mr. Henley,
' acquire a more robust constitution and greater mental activity than children

--reared in a workhouse, and these two points strike at the very root of pauperism.'
     VI. Greater Success at School. Set free from the sole companionship of the
pauper class, and subject to the healthy variety of influence in village life, pauper
children quickly lose their dalness and often attain even higher percentage of passes

--than the ordinary scholar, owing to enforced regularity of attendance.
     VII. Deterrent to Desertion. Deserting parents strongly object to the removal

of their children beyond their ken, and often return and claim them when likely to

be boarded-out.

There are two absolutely indispensable conditions to the success of the system:

(1) Efficient  and systematic inspection and supervision                                                                                                                                                                                                      (2) Well-chosen foster
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

homes

     Boarding-out in Scotland has been for forty years the adopted method of
pauper education. During twenty years 14,000 children have been boarded-out ; and

out of 9,500 reported on, 2| per cent, only turned out doubtful or bad. The

Secretary of the Poor Law 13oard says, ' Its success has been growing and un-

interrupted.'

In Ireland since 1862 boarding-out has been practised                                                                                                                                                                                                         2,549  out  of  8,462 (of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

aU classes) chargeable are now boarded-out at a cost of from 81. to 101. per annum.

In South Austraha boarding-out was adopted in 1872, and has superseded

industrial schools ; 1,219 children are so placed (1885), at an average of 5s. per
week. The system has saved the colony 36,000/. since its introduction.

     In Victoria boarding-out was commenced in 1873, and has entu-ely superseded

industrial schools. In 1885 2,105 children were boarded-out, and 639 ' Ucensed to-
service ' = 2,744. They are protected by Government till the age of 18.

    In New South Wales the ' States Children Pielief Department ' commenced

boarding-out in 1881, and by 1885 1,175 children had been withdrawn from insti-

tutions and placed out at an average cost of 5s. per head. The average cost in
industrial schools was 24/. per annum, 7iot including rent ; that of boarding-out is
15/. 8s. 4d. (in 1885). The Chau-man of the Board considers that the system has
secured a saving of 25 per cent, to the country.

     In all three colonies the authorities consider that the assistance of ladies' com-
mittees and systematic supervision are indispensable to success ; with these they
are unanimous in their conviction of the immense superiority of boarding-out over

institutional training.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  755

                2. Small Moldings and Allotments} By F. Impet.

     The author entered into the history and condition of the English rural labourer,

and pointed out that from the time of Elizabeth till our own times practically no-

thing had been done to help the labourer, and the system by which ten million

acres of common lands had been enclosed and taken from the poor was the key
to most of what was deplored in the condition of the labourer. He claimed that
the facts met with established an unanswerable reason for interference with the
land system on behalf of the class who hPvd suffered most from its effects. Instances
without number existed of exorbitant rents being demanded for allotments, and
only public opinion and the growing force of the movement in favour of allotments

at a fair rent could at present be brought to bear in bringing about a reduction.
* Three Acres and a Cow,' which he wrote, describing the arrangements on Lord

ToUemache's estate, by which labourers to the number of 300 were allowed to have
three acres of grass and keep a cow, besides encountering much misrepresentation,
had called forth statements of similar advantages enjoyed by labourers elsewhere.
The Allotments and Small Holdings Association had been accused of desiring to
cut England into three-acre plots, and expecting everyone to get a living from
them. Nothing was farther from the truth, but experience showed a man could
do his duty to an employer, and benefit himself and family by hiring three acres of
grass land and keeping a cow. Numerous particulars had been supplied him of
properties on which allotments were greatly appreciated. In addition to the efforts
of individuals in establishing allotments. Parliament had in a half-hearted way

-- --been induced to work in the same direction. It was important to bear in mind

that not only now perhaps chiefly was the agricultural labourer interested in

the allotments and small holdings question, but such a state of things brought
about thriving villages, each with numerous persons following handicrafts and other
trades, in addition to cultivating their land. The last return respecting allotments

was made in 1886, and shows that there are 600,000 cottages with no ground
attached to them. Much more land was required for allotments ; and local repre-
sentative bodies should have the power to own or hire land for the purpose of
letting out to small tenants on the model of the Swiss communal system. Public
opinion required a reversal of what had been the nationaV policy for centuries with
regard to the land. The first step in the direction of placing land within reach of
small as well as large cultivators was the establishment of a national system of
allotments and small holdings ; and they need not go abroad, as had often been
the case, to find out the good results of the system. The mistaken policy of the
State had inflicted enormous and bitter wrong on a once helpless class, but what
Parliament had done it might be called upon to help in amending. Irish local
authorities were begged to apply for loans at 3j per cent, interest, to provide houses
and land for labourers, and no proposals for dealing with English rural self-govern-
ment would be acceptable which did not contain similar provisions. The breath
of popular life and power was being felt among the dry bones of the decaying
system of their present rural institutions. The future had in store beneficent and
far-reaching change, which it was the highest privilege of all who loved their

country to help in bringing about.

           3. Feasant Properties and Protection. By Lady Veknet.

     Peasant properties have grown up in curiously different ways in different
countries. In France they were found to a great extent before the Revolution.
Arthur Young says ^ throughout ' a third of the kingdom in 1789 ' the custom,
though not the law of equal inheritance existed. In Russia, created by the stroke
of the pen of a benevolent despot, twenty-five years have sufficed to ruin the

landed proprietors, while their successors, the peasants, are wretched.

      Effect of Code Napoleon in breaking up large estates only gradually felt in
Germany and Italy.

     Norway long considered a model coimtry, her laud tenure held up as superior to

--any other country comfort of the bonders. Present time official reports of the

 Prefects sadly dift'erent, ruinous sub-division of land, increase of rural taxation,
distress great, poor relief increased enormously, land left uncultivated, and a cry

for protection. This is the demand in all the reports, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia, and Switzerland.

    How' else can the small proprietors live ? ' is constantly inquired. As they buy

next to nothing, tbey care nothing for cheap imports, but require their manufac-
turing neighbours to pay dearer for their corn and meat as the price of their exist-

ence. No division of labour in production. Discomfort, misery, and ignorance
described by French writers as grievous among the peasantry.

     The population in .34 departments is diminishing. Average of three children
necessary to keep up the number is not attained. Lafargue speaks of the ' alarming
state of France, which is passing through a terrible agricultural crisis, great subdivi-

sion not allowing the use of machines,' &c.

     * Average yield of wheat in France and Germany rather less than half in
England,' says Sir James Caird. In Italy even less, Russia lowest of all. Mort-

gages oppressive everywhere. ' Getting rid of landlords and their rents the peasants
subject themselves to an invisible order, the mortgagers aud their heavier and more-

rigid rents,' says Lecouteux, ' who sell tbem up if they do not pay the interest.'

      Three million proprietors out of eight are on the pauper lists of France. In.
Prussia 82 per cent, exempt from direct taxation by reason of poverty ; 7,000,000
heads of families earn less than 9s. Id. per week.

     ' All peasants certainly are not in debt, but in many parts of Germany their
mortgages are from 54 to 94 per cent, on real property,' says the German report.

     Strange remedies proposed, as to take away the power of mortgaging either-
wholly or in part (the heaviest charges incurred being to buy off the equal portions
of the younger children), to make a majorat, i.e., to restore primogeniture.

     In Russia no labour is to be had, each man occupied on his own property,

agriculture wretched, scarcely any manure used, the produce from 2^ to 4|- of
quantity sown. (In England about 15 for winter and 20 for spring corn.) The-

land is worked out. Peasants in the hands of the Jews, who foreclose mortgages
and take possession of the land. Whole country said to be on the verge of

bankiuptcy.

      Report of Italian commission declares condition of rural population miserable,

produce of corn only 11 hectolitres, in France 15, and Germany the same. Eng-
land 32. Twenty-five per cent, of the 5,000,000 owners peasants. * Our piece-
meal agriculture without machines must fail, these impossible on such small pro-

perties.' Work entailed on the women so excessive that it is said ' women are

bargained for like cattle, and toil like Indian squaws.'
     The enormous interest paid to usurers complained of. In Apulia short loans

charged even 120 per cent.
     The account from Switzerland of agricultural population dismal, the produce

very low, the land cut up into slices, overburdened with agricultural buildings, and
heavily mortgaged. The farms so small that no machinery can be used; there is a
cry to re-create large farms, and for help from State, notwithstanding cheap
transfer of land, of property after a death, equal di-visions, free education, &c.

     British Consul at Nantes says that vines have failed, and farmers cannot com-
pete with foreign corn, there is outcry for increased protection number of peasants'

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Sir James Caird, ' has the use of his landlord's capital at a very low rate, and can

     Allotments, the number of wliich is little kno^\ai ; 242,342 in the Midland
counties alone. ' Little takes ' (and nearly three-quarters of the farms in England
·are of fifty acres and under) seem preferable to sinking money in ownership of
 land. Pasture, not arable. Labourer has fared better than owner and farmer in
the present agricultural crisis, which we share with the rest of Europe. Wages,
standard of living, education and openings to rise increased greatly during the last
20 years, while the peasant proprietors abroad have been steadily going down and
·clamouring for protection to enable them to live.

      Is it worth while to create such a class in Ireland or England at the present
anoment ?

                  4. Go-operative Farming. Bij Bolton King, M.A.

    Two forces are bringing the English land question into unusual prominence

·the economic force of foreign competition, and the movement towards a wider
diffusion of landed property. The two are to a certain extent antagonistic, and no

'Social solution will avail, unless it surmounts the difficidty of farming land at a
profit. All evidence goes to show that large farms under skilled management, or

with plenty of capital, are the only ones which are likely to pay. Hence we must

reconcile the wider diffusion of property in land with the existence of large farms.
Peasant proprietorship, therefore, will not solve the problem ; co-operative farming,

·on the other hand, possesses the conditions of economic success. It can have all
the economic advantages of large capitalist farms, and alone can realise the social
ideal given above. But is it feasible ? First, Can a body of agricultural labourers
possess sufiicient cohesion ? Such evidence as there is on this head is distinctly

favourable. Nor is there likely to be much difficulty in finding the capital. The

difficulty lies in the supply of skilled managers. For the present the scarcity of

such men will delay the extension of association farms, but as soon as we give

due attention to agricultural education a sufficient number will be forthcoming.

     Some suggestions as to the formation of an association farm may be in place.

Nothing shoidd be doup till an efficient manager has been found. The land must be
in fair order, and therb must be a proper agreement as to compensation. The men
should be carefully selected on the advice of those best acquainted with the locality.
The constitution of the society must combine popular election with a strong con-
centrated management ; the manager must be uncontrolled in the direction of the
farming operations, but the body of the associates should decide on all other ques-
tions. The association's legal status should be that of a limited liability company

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

the capital should be obtained on loan, so that creditors have no control over the

--internal affairs of the society. In apportioning the profits a large amount at
--least 40 per cent. should go to a reserve fund ; 5 per cent, should be appro-

priated to educational purposes ; and of the residue half should be paid down
in cash to the association, and half go towards redeeming the loan capital.
Should several association farms be started in the same neighbourhood they should
federate for common purposes, such as selling their produce direct to the con-

sumer.

     The evidence of the association farms in Warwickshire tends to show that
with average agricultural labourers the scheme is perfectly feasible. The abnormal
·condition of the last two years has made it impossible for them to make a profit,
and the system has thus had no fair test on this score. The chief factor in their
economic success or failure is the economic value of high farming. As far as its
social aspects go, the results have been thoroughly satisfactory.

      In 1884 the acreage of wheat in Australasia was one-third greater than that in
 the United Kingdom. But the acreage of barley was only one-seventeenth, and
 that of oats one-seventh, of the corresponding acreages of the United Kingdom.

    A comparison of the number of live stock in the whole of the Australasian

 colonies in 188-4 and in 1873 shows that horses had increased 50 per cent., cattle
 42 per cent., sheep 28 per cent., and pigs 28 per cent.

      In 1884 the horses of Australasia numbered two-thirds of those of the United
 Kingdom, cattle were four-fifths as many, and pigs were only one-fourth as nume-
 rous. Sheep, on the other hand, were two and a-half times as many.

       Concerning Cape Colony there are not available any agiicultural statistics of
 more recent date than 1875, and those are somewhat meagre.

      The present position of agriculture in Canada can only be vaguely estimated.
 There is a Dominion Department of Agriculture, and most of the provinces possess
 a Board or Department of Agriculture, but with one or two notable exceptions no

 attempt is made to collect statistical information in a systematic manner. Among

 the older provinces Ontario is the only one whose system of collecting and collating

 agricultural statistics is in any way abreast of the times, and the work of this
character now in progress under the Ontario Bureau of Industries deserves mention.
 But of all the provinces of the Dominion, the young province of Manitoba is dis-

 tinctly in the van as regards the administration and efficiency of its Department of
 Agriculture, the periodical bulletins of which are as admirable as they are useful.
The export trade in living animals and dairy produce constitutes probably the most
powerful incentive to the further development of Canadian agriculture. Taking
 the twelve years 1874 to 1885 and comparing the last of these years with the
first, it is shown that the export of horses from Canada has more than doubled,

that of cattle has more than trebled, and that of sheep has increased one-third.
The extraordinary precautions taken to keep their live stock free from disease are
highly creditable to the Canadian authorities ; without such precautions, however,
this very large trade in live stock would be quite impracticable. The Canadian

export of cheese in 1885 was three and a-half times as great as that in 1874; this
trade, which has now attained such enormous dimensions, is the growth of only
a quarter of a century, for in 1859 the Dominion imported 857,951 lbs. of cheese,
whereas in 1885 it exported eighty-six and a-half million lbs. In the export of
cheese, Quebec and Ontario are the only provinces which figure largely, but the
former alone supplies quite three- fourths of the total export ; Ontario, however, is
rapidly diminishing the inequality between herself and Quebec in this respect. The
total butter export of last year was only two-thirds of that of 1874, but Canadian
dairy-farmers have in their own hands the remedy for this diminution.

     Of the markets in which the home producer has to meet his colonial competitor,
those of wheat, live stock, fresh meat, dairy produce, and wool are the most im-

portant.

      During the three years 1881 to 1883, the import of wheat from Australasia
into the United Kingdom was between two and three million cwt. annually. In
1884 it reached nearly five million, and in 1885 over five and a quarter million

cwt. From Canada the import in 1881 and 1882 was over two and three-quarter

million cwt. per annum, whereas during the last three years it has been about one
and three-quarter million cwt. annually. Meanwhile, the import of wheat from
the United States, though still our chief one, is declining, even if the import of
wheat meal and floui* from the same source be also taken into account. Viewing

the subject from an imperial standpoint, British India has during the last five

years sent us annually much more wheat than Australasia and Canada together.
The ratio of the import of wheat from all parts of the Empire (Australasia,
Canada, India) to the total import into the United Kingdom has, during the last

five years, 1881 to 1885, shown the following increase : 0-23, 0-21, 0-25, 0-31, 0-31,
Simidtaneously, the ratio of the import of wheat from the United States to the
total import into the United Kingdom has declined thus : 0-63, 0-65, 040, 0-48,

0-40.

    As in the case of wheat, our largest supply of horned cattle comes from the
United States, which sends us nearly two-fifths of the total number imported.
760 EEPOBT-- 1886.

Denmark ranks next, and Canada third. It is significant, however, that -whereas,

in 1885, our import of cattle from all other soiu'ces fell off, the import from Canada

increased fully one-eighth on that of the preTious year.

The fresh meat trade is of recent but rapid growth. Excluding Australasia,

Holland is the only country which has hitherto sent fresh mutton in any quantity

into the United Kingdom, but the import from Holland last year was less than

one-fourth of that from Australasia. Taking the last four years, 1882 to 1885, the

ratio of the impoi-t of fresh mutton from Australasia to the total import from aU

sources exhibits the following rapid increase: 0-19, 0-40, 0-60, 0-59. Australasia,

therefore, now sends us more than half the total import, and the actual quantity

derived from this source last year was 336,495 cwt., the total import being 571,646

cwt. Most of the Australasian export is from New Zealand.

Of dairy produce, nearly the whole of the cheese, and moi'e than three-fourths

of the butter, exported from Canada, enter the markets of the United Kingdom.

Cheese also comes in large quantity from the United States and Holland, and

butter from HoUand, France, Denmark, the United States, and Belgium, in the

order named. Canada, however, has taken a firm hold on our cheese markets, and

owing to the superior and uniform quality of her produce is likely to maintain and

even to increase it. Were the Canadian butter as well manufactured and as reli-

able a product as the Canadian cheese, our imports of butter from Canada would

probably be far larger than they are. Canadian dairy-farmers are looking into this

matter, but they must not delay, for a new competitor in this industry is arising in

the Southern Seas. The enterprising colony of Victoria, encouraged by the satis-

factory results flowing from the British trade in fresh meat, is bent on tempting*

the English markets with fresh Australian butter. It is argued that the system of

refrigeration, by means of which meat is kept fresh during the long voyage to

England, will serve equally well in the case of butter, and it is pointed out that

butter produced during the early part of the Antipodean summer would reach the

English markets in time to command a ready sale during mid-winter. When it

is borne in mind that the little kingdom of Denmark sent us, from 1872 to 1882,

between one and two million pounds worth of butter every year, and during 1883

and 1884 over two million pounds worth per annum, the ambition of Victoria does

not seem altogether hopeless.

. Coming lastly to wool, many English farmers who are now struggling with

adversity can remember the time when the wool of their sheep would pay the

rent. Those palmy days have gone, never to return, for the United Kingdom now

imports over 500 million lbs. of wool per annum, most of which comes from Aus-

tralasia and Cape Colony. Arranging these colonies in the order of their wool-

exporting capacity, they stand thus: 1. New South Wales; 2, New Zealand;

3, Victoria ;  4,  Queensland                                                 5,  South  Australia ;  6, Cape  Colony ;  7,  Tasmania
                                                                           ;

8, Western Australia. But New South Whales produces more than New Zealand,

Victoria, and Queensland together, whilst Tasmania and Western Australia col-

Howlectively produce less than one-tbird as much as Cape Colony.                                                             veiy im-

portant to the colonial farmer in the Southern Hemisphere is the price of wool on

the English market may be judged from the fact that a difference of only one

farthing per lb. in the selling value of the wool exported ?u a single year, 1883,
would make a difference amounting to nearly half-a-million sterling in the aggre-

gate value. The total value of the wool imported into the United Kingdom fi-om

our colonies of Australasia and the Cape since 1831, estimated at the average

selling price in London of the last twenty-five years, is 421,121,192^,, of which

77,416,721^. represents the South African exports. This splendid creation of

wealth can be better appreciated when it is stated that the total value of all the

gold found in Australasia has not yet reached 300 millions sterling.

In each of the three great departments of his industry, whether it be the grow-

ing of corn, the raising of meat, or the production of cheese and butter, the British

farmer is called upon to face severe colonial (and foreign) competition. In the case

of cattle and cheese from Canada, and in that of wheat and fresh meat from Auij-

tralasia, this competition is rapidly assuming greater proportions. This, however,
IS no matter for regret, for since the mother-country is quite incapable of satisfying
TEANSA.CTIONS OF SECTION F.                                 761
                                                                                                                  .

"her own requirements in agricultural produce, it is rather a subject for congratula-
tion that she is every year becoming a better customer of her colonies. It has,

moreover, been demonstrated in the case of Australasia, and it is probably true also

of Canada, that the capacity for agricultural production is increasing at a greater
Howrate than the population.  the home farmer is to continue his struggle agamst

such heavy odds is a problem that yet awaits its final solution, and one which it

would be outside the scope of this paper to discuss.
Finally, it is asked, what means exist whereby the agricultural production of the

Empire may with fair accuracy be currently estimated, and, what is equally im-
portant, in what direction the agricultural practices of each province of the Empire
We^re tending? The answer is that there are no such means.
                                                            can only judge

of these things by their effects : we have little means of anticipating them. At

any time there may be a ruinous glut of one kind of produce and a simultaneous

disastrous deficiency of another. The great centres of production in the South,_in

the West, and in the East, all look to the heart of the Empire as the centre of in-

satiable consumption, and year after year their surplus production is landed at the

ports of the mother-country. Then, and not till then, does the stern arbitrament of

the markets difl'erentiate between over-production in the case of one commodity, and,

possibly, of under-production in that of another. But the lesson is learnt too late,

for by this time preparations have already been made for another year's production.
     Bound together by a common language, and employing the same systems of

weights and measm-es, it woidd surely be not only possible but practicable for
every province of the Empire to officially collect and annually publish compre-

hensive agricultural statistics, which, to facilitate comparison, should all be

-arranged on one uniform plan. It may fairly be urged that ,the mother-country

.should lead the way, but, unfortunately, our own Department of Agriculture has

not yet begun to discharge many of the functions which pre-eminently appertain to

it. To cite only one example, no official return is made of the produce of crops in
the United Kingdom, and until 1884 no such return was made for England and

Wales. Our methods of collecting agricultural statistics, particularly such as relate

to the yield of crops and to the relation between crop, soil, and climate, require
Werevision, and demand improvement.
                                     can point at home to no organisation

qualified to rank alongside the Department of Agriculture, Statistics, and Health

of Manitoba, or capable of doing such valuable work as is performed in the Office

of the Government Statist of Victoria. Agriculture, the primal art, the pioneer of

our colonial affluence, and still associated with enormous interests and great re-

sponsibilities at home, has always been neglected by the State. But an Imperial

nation has its duties as well as its rights, and when we have a Departruent of

Agriculture, one branch of which shall be devoted to the collection, assimilation,

and prompt pubhcation throughout the Empire of reliable agricultural statistics,
not of the United Kingdom alone, but of the whole realm, there will remain to

this nation one duty the less unfulfilled.

      In an appendix are collected the following tables :-- Agricultural statistics of '
the Australasian colonies ; comparative agricultural statistics of the United King-

dom and the colonies; average yield per acre of wheat, barley, oats, and hay inthe

United Kingdom, the colonies, and the world ; agricultural progress in the Province

                   7. The PvMic Land Policy of the United States.
                               By WORTHINGTON C. FORD.

      The author sets forth in some detail the manner in which the public domain of

-the United States has been disposed of since the treaty of 1783. He shows how
762 REPORT-- 1886.

one iDarrier after another to the acquisition of the land by individual settlers has
been broken down, until there is no civilised country in w^hich a more liberal land

policy exists. In fact, if the rapid disappearance of the public domain may be

taken as a proof of the success of such a policy, it would be difficult to instance
another case where the fiat of the legislator has worked such wondrous results.

     The author describes the most important features of the existing public land

--system of the United States the pre-emption and the homestead laws. He ex-

presses the opinion that those laws sadly interfere with each other, and that with

the passage of the latter, the former should have been repealed. He proceeds to

show that as soon as the available supply of food began to fail the expediency of
continuing existing methods became a serious question. If the land reached the
actual settler, complaint would be less loud ; but, as it is, there is every reason to
believe that the bulk of the lands disposed of reaches the hands of speculators and

land-grabbers.

     The cheapness and abundance of land have been said to result in the premature
diifusion of population and loose and insufficient methods of cultivation ; but in

the author's opinion these evils are self-correcting.
      In spite of the outcry against the waste of the public lands, the underlying

-- --principle of the land laws that the land should belong to the actual settler has

never been questioned. The theories of Henry George, however popular they have
become among a certain class, have not created any feeling against the cession by
the Government of a full and free title to public lands, where, if anywhere, a

 favom-able field is offered for a trial of his scheme.

      The paper concludes by stating that three policies have been suggested and

--require to be considered (1) That the land laws be changed and honestly

 administered, so as to favour the settler. (2) That a restriction be placed upon
immigration so as to decrease the demand for land. (3) That a career of conquest

or acquisition be entered upon, by which new and unoccupied territory can be

 secured.

      The old land policy is still working out its ends ; as to the future policy, ten-
dencies only can be noted and conclusions drawn. Just now it is sufficient to say
whether the existing system is to be commended or criticised.

         1. Worhing Men's Co-operative Organisations in Great Britain.

                              By A. H. Dtke Acland, M.P.

      This paper deals not with so-called civil service co-operative societies, nor
 directly with the question of industrial partnerships.

      The question here considered is as follows :

    How far does the development of the working men's co-operative organisations,

 especially during the last twenty years, throw light on
      I. The possibility of the accumulation of large sums of capital by working men.

     II. The possibility of the successful utilisation of such capital by working men

 in industrial enterprise.

      III. The improvement of the position of the worker, or the lessening of the-
 antagonism of employer and employed in consequence of such successful utilisation

 of capital.

      I. The main source of savings is to be found in the co-operative stores or distri-
 butive societies, which do a business of considerably over 20,000,000/. a year.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  .  763

       Method adopted by these stores :
      Anyone may join on depositing one shilling. The ordinary prices of the district
  are charged. Ready-money payment only is allowed. The profits of the business
  are allotted to members in proportion to their purchases, quarterly or half-yearly.
  The sums so allotted must remain in the society till a share of 1/. has been made
  up. The result is a gradual saving of capital, till there is often much more than
  can be employed in the business. The difficulty with many societies is too much

  capital, not too little.
       Increase of business of these societies between 1865 and 1885 from about three

 millions per annum to over twenty millions per annum. Large sums now lying

  idle at the banks.

      II. At the present time from three to four millions a year of productive or
  manufacturing business, on a large or small scale, is carried on, the capital of which
  comes mainly from the distributive or retail societies.

       There are several forms of this :
       (1) Manufacturing by the wholesale societies of England and Scotland annually
  about 200,000^.
       (2) Tailoring, dressmaking, corn-milling, baking, &c. by distributive stores,

  2,000,000/.

       (3) Manufacturing by independent societies unconnected with the wholesale

  societies or distributive stores, 1,500,000/.

       (1) The two wholesale societies are the property of the retail stores, which have
 created them for their own convenience for the supply of articles direct to their
 shops from England and abroad.

      The English wholesale society (like the retail societies) has had to refuse capital
 which its members (that is, the retail stores) would willingly have deposited
 with it.

      It has adhered mainly to the work of merchant, and has done comparatively

 little in the way of manufacturing.
      It has two manufactories of boots and shoes, which do a business of 150,000/.

 a year. It also manufactures soap, biscuits, and confectionery.
      Reasons for not extending manufacturing more rapidly :
      Difficulty of locking up money in plant and buildings.
      (2) Some of the large stores have erected large corn-mills and large butteries,

 and many societies employ tailors, dressmakers, and the like, and some are now

 beginning to rent farms.

      In the large stores there is a great demand for milk, butter, and agricultural

 produce.

     Many of these societies, like the wholesale society, might, if they would, retain
much larger sums of savings deposited with them by members at five per cent, than
they now have.

      (3) The productive societies' business, position, profits, and various methods

of working.

     The Manchester Printing Society does 35,000/. a year. The Hebden Bridge
Fustian Company, 25,000/. a year. Both these give the workers a share of the

profits.

starting.

   --The Oldham joint stock companies how far they have utilised the capital of

     in. C'o-operation is sometimes defined as being only truly so called when the

worker has a share in the profits.

      This limitation is not adopted here.

     The Scottish wholesale gives a share to workers ; the English wholesale does

not.

    Some of the distributive societies give a share to workers ; the great majority

do not.
     The independent productive societies do so in most cases.

     Conclusion :
     The great value of tlie work as it is to one-sixth of the working classes of Great
Britain. Remove its influence during the last forty years and England would be very
different frona what it is.

society, managed by labourers, with 700 members, with a business of 18,000/, a year,
of which nearly 2,000/. a year is saved, and owning freehold land and buildings
(including twenty cottages), worth nearly 4,000/.

     Take a large town. Consider the educational work done, the hopefulness on
the part of the worker who is encouraged, and the value of the savings during a

time of depression.
      Industrially it has more influence than is perceived. It is a great educator to

the working classes in the methods of handling capital. It trains many able men,
and labour becomes less and less looked upon as a ' commodity ' only.

     Much of the best side of human nature is called out in this associated work.

It is the development of this throughout business life, without impairing efficiency
and promptitude in management, which is needed.

     The capacity which has been developed by the movement was dormant and un-

suspected forty years ago.

                              By Professor Sidgwick, Litt.D.

     Political economy, as commonly understood, includes a general argument show-
ing how wealth tends to be produced most amply and economically in a society in
which Government confines itself to the protection of person and property and the
enforcement of contracts not brought about by force or fraud, leaving individuals
free to produce and transfer to others whatever utiUties they choose, on any terms
that may be freely arranged. The argument is, briefly, that in a society so consti-

tuted the regard for self-interest on the part of consumers will lead to the efiectual

demand of the things that are most useful ; and regard for self-interest on the part

of producers will lead to their production at the least cost.

     It is, however, now generally held tliat the broad rule of leave alone ' to which

this argument points must in practice be limited by various exceptions.
      The aim of the present paper is to distinguish clearly between two different

classes of these exceptions to laisser faire, viz., (n) those exceptions which are due
to tbe limitations under which abstract economic theory has to be practically
applied in the art of government, owing to the complexity of the ends at which
government has to aim, and to the fact that actual human beings only partly con-
form to the type usually assumed in abstract economic reasoning ; and (b) those
which it is the more direct business of economic theory to analyse and systematize,
since the reasons for them apply to the state of things assumed for purposes of
abstract reasoning, no less than to the actual facts of existing societies.

     In class (rt) may be distinguished

           (1). Governmental interference to regulate the education or employment of

                            children.

            (2). Interference for the promotion of health, or morality, or culture.
           (3). Interference, not with a view to the more economical production of

                      wealth, but with a view to its more equitable distribution.
                            (This is often spoken of as 'socialistic,' or ' semi-socialistic.')

           (4). Interference on the ground that certain industrial classes are found by
                       experience not to take sufficient care of their private economic

                              interests.

                           (This is sometimes spoken of as 'paternal' legislation; e.g., re-

                    strictions on freedom of contract between landlord and tenant. The
                     same phrase is also applied to (2).)

As leading cases of class {b) may te noted

     (1). Where, for the production of a certain utility, or avoidance of detriment,
               a combination is required of which the value largely depends on its

              universality.                                        E.g., protection of lands against flood protection of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

              useful animals against certain diseases.

     (2). Especially where the combination of a large majority increases the
                interest that the minority have in standing aloof. E.g., abstinence

              from certain times, places, or instruments in fishing or hunting, for

              the sake of future supply.

     (3). "Where a branch of industry, for technical or other reasons, has a ten-
               dency to fall under the conditions of monopoly (total or partial).

              E.g. provision of gas in towns.

     (4). Where, from the nature of the required utility, its producers could not

              be remunerated adequately in the ordinary way by free exchange

              of theii- commodity.                                            E.g., utility of  forests  in  relation  to climate
                                                                                                                                                              ;

              scientific discoveries.

     (5). "Where the process of exchange which would be required to remunerate
               a certain social service would seriously detract from its utility, from

               waste of time or otherwise. E.g., provision of roads and bridges.

     (6). W^here Government is peculiarly adapted to produce the kind of utility
               required. E.g., if what is required is security, as in the case of

              savings banks ; uniformity, stability of value, as in the case of

              currency.

     It is not argued that Government necessarily ought to interfere in all
        cases that come under these heads ; only that the general economic
        argument for laisser faire falls away in such cases, wholly or to a

              great extent, or is balanced by strictly economic considerations on the
              other side ; and that it is important to bear this in mind in discussing-

              any particular practical case.

              3. On Allotments. By Lord Onslow.

The author pointed out that it was unfortunate this subject should have formed

matter for political controversy. It was astonishing how little appeared to be

known on the subject by those who were not directly connected with the land. It

was unnecessary to dwell at any length on the advantages accruing to labourers

from the occupation of a small plot of ground, as all interested in the question

admitted this. The supply of laud for the purpose appeared to be greatly regu-

lated by the demand. In the North, where wages were high, the allotment system

might be said almost not to exist, while in the purely agricultural counties the

practice prevailed extensively. The Voluntary Allotments Association, of which

he was hon. secretary, had publicly announced its desire to be informed of any

unsatisfied demand which might exist ; but these appUcations might be counted on

one's fingers. Even where land was let on lease, and possession could only be

obtained with difficulty, the local committees of the association expected at

Michaelmas next to be able in most cases to satisfy the demand. The points chiefly

in dispute were : (1) Whether there was a sufficient supply of land for labourers

who  desired  allotments                                           (2)  what  was  the  size    of allotment which     a labourer
                                                                ;

could cultivate without  interfering with                                          his regular wage-earning  hours                          and  (3)
                                                                                                                                         ;

what should be the rent and conditions of tenancy. On the first point, the recently-

issued Government return showed that allotments had increased from 242,000 in

1873 to 356,458 in 1886, while the number of laboui-ers had only increased from

746,918 to 766,712. If to these they added the potato-ground, cow-runs, and

cottage-gardens, of over one-eighth of an acre, they found there were no less than

708,712 plots of land cultivated by labourers, which, if held each by separate men,

would leave only 58,000 labourers unprovided. In Wiltshire allotments exceeded

the number of labourers by 460. Arranging the counties in the order of the

labouring population, of the number of allotments, and of the number of cottage-
766 BEPOET-- 1886.

gardens, they found that the provision was nearly, though not quite, adequate. For

instance, Suffolk is fifth, both in labourers and allotments, and fourth in cottage-

gardens. Lincoln was first in population, and though only tenth in allotments, was

second only to Norfolk in cottage-gardens. AViltshire, which came only tenth in

labourers, was first in  allotments                                            but  Kent  showed a bad                                               record, coming           second
                                                                            ;

in population, but was twenty-sixth in allotments, and only eighteenth in cottage-

gardens. As to the size of the allotments, all parties agreed with Mr. Arch that it

should be in accordance with the ability to stock and cultivate it. The real point

to bear in mind was to endeavour to give the labourer an opportunity to rise from

his position to something a little above that, as was done by Lord Norton, Lord

Henniker, and Mr. Goring, who endeavoiu-ed to give the industrious labourer a

means of adding some other employment to that of a day labourer ; and, finally, to

become a small farmer. As to rent, the proper charge appeared to be that which

the land would fetch, if  let for other pui-poses                                                                                                    and it must be borne in  mind that
                                                                                                                                                  ;

to rent must be added all outgoings and also cost of collection, though as compared

with land let in farms there were no buildings to be erected or kept in repair.

Another important point was to afford .security to the tenant that he would neither

be capriciously evicted, nor evicted at all, without adequate and complete compen-

sation, so that every inducement might be offered to the occupier to bestow his

money and labour on the allotment. What was still sadly lacking in this country

was an adequate supply of milk for young children. The efforts of philanthropists

might with great advantage be devoted to promoting this consummation. Nothing

tended to attach a man so deeply to his country as an interest in its soil, and it

should be the object of statesmen and philanthropists alike to do all in their power

to give the cultivator of the soil a personal and pecuniary interest in it.

                             MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.

      The following Papers were read :

               1. One-pound Notes. By Professor J. S. Nicholson.

      The object of this paper is to discuss the effects of introducing with as little
disturbance as possible into the present system of currency in England one-pound-
notes. The subject being thus limited, it is necessary to assume that the pi-inciples
of the Bank Act of 1844 remain imdisturbed. Banknotes, according to that Act,
are regarded merely as a convenient form of currency, and not as a form of bankers'

credit. Why, then, should the English public not have the option, open to the

people of Scotland and Ireland, of using one-pound notes in place of sovereigns ?
The preference for these notes in Scotland is so strong that it must rest on a solid
foundation. The authorised issues of the Scotch banlts are about two and three
quarter millions, but the actual issues are about six millions, of which four millions
are one-pound notes. There is no gain, but some loss, on all issues beyond the
authorised maximum, so that there is no inducement for the banks to force their

issues. Still it may be admitted that in matters of currency the maxim quieta
non movere has much force, aud merely for convenience the adoption of one-pound

notes by England might not be advisable. But a stronger practical argument is
found in the state of the gold currency, which is notoriously under its nominal
value. Unless something is done, in a short time, we are threatened with a relapse
into a rudimentary system of currency by weight. The expense of restoration
might be met by issuing one-pound notes. There would be no danger of inconver-
tibility if all the gold withdrawn were used as a reserve after allowing for the
expense of restoration and meeting the gold coins at their real value. The only
change necessary in the Bank Act would be an extension of the limit of issues not

against gold. If, as the experience of Scotland renders probable, the notes issued
remained to a large extent in circulation, the wear and tear of coins would for the

future be much less, and it would be more easy to keep them up to the standard.

--Answers to Objections. (1) There is the fear that the gold withdrawn would,

after a time, not be kept in reserye, and that the money market would become more

sensitive. But the practical question is, would the security be less than at present ?

For at present the gold in circulation is absolutely unavailable for banking; purposes,

and to meet a foreign drain. Besides this, the whole force of the objection lies in

the assumption that the Act would not be enforced. If, however, the Act were only

suspended, as before, in cases of real need the position of the Bank of England

would be much strengthened.

(2) The fear of an internal drain and a run on the bank does not seem war-

ranted by the experience of Scotland. In any case, so long as the Act as amended

is enforced the issues are safe.

   (3) The danger of forgery is not great, as shown by the fact that in Scotland
spurious sovereigns are more common than forged one-pound notes. The art of

--engraving has made much progress since such notes were used in England.
    Conclusion. The reform suggested in this paper, though not extreme itself, is a

step towards a better system                                                                                                                but the only practical question ofl'ered for discussion
                                                                                                                                         ;

is whether it is worth while adopting one-pound notes on the same footing as other

notes, simply on the grounds of convenience and the facilities offered for restoring

and maintaining the coinage.

2. The Causes affecting tlie Beduction in the Cost of Producing Silver.

                                 By Htde Clarke.

Mr. Clarke stated his object was to continue the course of his former papers on

the depression of prices, and to examine whether there was a reduction in the cost

of producing silver. It was very difficult to collect the facts, as several inquirers

had found, and thus the subject had remained obscure. He had considered that

Newthe fall in the price of quicksilver, consequent on the introduction of the

Almaden quicksilver, to a certain extent afforded a criterion of the influences in

operation. Although in later years there had been an occasional spurt, quicksilver

rising to 4s. Sd. in 1875 and to 5s. lOd. in 1874, yet during a long period quick-

silver which forty years ago was from 10s. 6d.Jo 7s. 6d. had been as low as Is. lOd.

To these prices had to be added carriage and local charges, in Mexico for instance,

greatly raising the cost in some mining localities. The value of quicksilver with

some classes of ore might not be more than ^d. to Id. per oz, of silver, but as com-

pared with the former range of prices the difference on some ores was equivalent in

some instances to 6d. per oz. of silver, and was to be estimated as an appreciable

reduction of charge. Amalgamation with quicksilver only applied to some ores,

but other ores, as silver lead ores, were reduced by the ancient processes and by

Pattinsonising and other processes for the better extraction of silver. The zinc pro-

cess, sodium amalgam and the Agostin process have also been brought to bear on

various ores. One of the best proofs of the more economical reduction is the con-

version of the desmontes, refuse or slag heaps of South America, and those of the

Athenian silver smelters at Laurium. The production of more powerful stamping

and milling machinery, and the conveyance of this and of steam engines by rail-

way, instead of by mules, llamas or bullocks to the mining districts, had also mate-

rially assisted economical working.

With regard to the quotations for silver a distinction must be made of two

markets, one a coin market and the other the jewellery market. So long as the

coin market was not overstocked a price of five shillings per ounce could be main-

tained, and the  fall  in the  cost of                                                                                                      producing  silver was masked or  concealed                                        but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

now a variety of operations have contributed to bring about a heavy decline in the

price of silver and a falling market. With regard to silver mining the cheaper

production has allowed a lower class of ores to be raised and worked and thereby

augmented the supply. The Indian Government has continued to coin silver, to

disturb the market and to disturb prices. The United States Government has

coined large amounts of dollars, which remain in stock. While gold was coming

into favour in India and the prices of commodities and wages were risino-, the
Government did not adopt a gold mohur or sovereign, as was strongly recommended,
--768 EEPORT 1886.

but continued to coin silver rupees. With regard to the tendency of the market
there was no evidence that the lowest rate for the rupee or silver ounce had been-
reached, for the downward influences are still in operation. The chief causes which

have operated on the silver market have been, 1st, reduction of cost of metal; 2nd^
over-production of silver ; 3rd, over-coinage of silver ; 4th, over-stock of coin and
other silver.

3. On some Defects in English Railway Administration} By J. S. Jeans.

One of the most remarkable and serious features of English railway economics

was the enormous increase of exj^enditure that hud been incurred within recent

years on already existing lines. The average capital outlay per mile of line open in

the United Kingdom rose from 35,900^. in 1872, to 42,500/. in 1885. During that

interval the mileage of line open had been increased by 3,553 miles, and the capital

expenditure by about 247,000,000/., so that we had expended about 73,000/. per

mile of new line open. Between 1862 and 1872 the increase of railway mileage

was 6,263 miles, and the increase of capital outlay 184,000,000/., representing
rather over 43,000/. per mile of new line. In both cases the additional expendi-
ture was, however, by no means entirely expended on new mileage, although it was
impossible to say how much bad been spent upon that item, and how much had

been expended on already existing lines. Since 1872 the average capital expendi-

ture on English lines alone bad increased by 7,500Z. per  mile                     and  as  the  mileage
                                                                                ;

at the end of 1885 was 13,612 miles, it would appear as if during this interval

102,000,000/. had been expended on already existing lines, since the cost of con-

structing new mileage in later years could hardly be greater than in the earlier
years of the railway system, when prices of materials took a much higher range.

    The author next proceeded to refer to the possible sources of this expenditure,

and referred incidentally to the fact that the L. & N. W. Railway Company alone

had expended in the ten years ending 1885 something like 4,000,000/. in additions

and improvements to their terminal stations at Loudon, Liverpool, Birmingham,

and Manchester. It was probable that the cbief source of the increased outlay on

existing lines was the furnishing of .additional terminal and other facilities for

traffic : and the public, perhaps, required to be reminded that they could scarcely
expect to possess at the same time magnificent stations and the same low range of

rates and fares as obtained in countries where such facilities were not so abundant.

It was time for the British public to determine that their railways should not be
encouraged in this prodigal expenditure on lines the capital account of which ought
to have been closed many years ago. Such a system of mortgaging the future was
not creditable to our appreciation, either of what was best for our present needs or

most likely to advance the interests of posterity.

Remarking on the enormous differences that are found in the construction

cost of different English railways, it was remarked that this item varied from a

maximum of over 500,000/. to a minimum of less than 2,000/. per mile. Four

--railways the Metropolitan, District, North London, and L. C. & D. had each cost

over 140,000/. per mile. Seven others--the M. S. & L., L. & Y., S. E., W. Lan-
cashire, L. B. & S. C, L. & N. W., and Midland--had cost between 55,000/. and

82,000/. per mile, and all the others were under 50,000/. per mile. The cost was

increased the nearer the railways approached the metropolis, a fact that might be

attributed to the more expensive works involved, and the higher price of the-

land required.

English railways have at command the largest volume of traffic relatively to their

extent, and even to their capital expenditure, of any system in the world, so that,

notwithstanding their enormous cost, they might and should be worked so as to

produce a higher average range of dividends with the same range of rates and fares

than the railways of any other country ; but this had not hitherto been the case, in

consequence of grave defects in their administration, and especially the cardinal

     ' The complete paper has been published as a chapter in a work entitled Railway
Problems, published by Longmans.

defect of running only partly filled trains where full train-loads might and should
be adopted. There were, no doubt, certain descriptions of traffic more or less
perishable in their character that could not aiford to wait to be made up into full
train-loads but this did not apply to the great bulk of the goods traffic on English

                                                              ;

railways, and especially not to mineral traffic, which forms nearly 70 per cent, of
the whole. It was not only that the train-loads, as such, were light, but it seldom

-- --happened at any rate in the case of ordinary merchandise that the waggons were

loaded to more than one-half of their capacity ; and as the cost of working goods
traffic decreases in an almost direct ratio with the weight of the ' live ' or paying
load, the effect of adopting fuller waggon-loads would obviously be the establish-
ment of a much higher range of receipts in relation to the ordinary working

expenses.

     Specific reference was next made to the improvements that had been effected
within recent years in the systems and costs of transport on American railways,
whereby the working expenses had been enormously reduced relatively to the gross
earnings. The author attributed this improvement to the increase of capacity in the
goods waggons employed, to the running of larger train-loads, to the adoption of a
better permanent way, and to the use of more powerful locomotives ; and he showed
that, relatively to the weight of the train, the principal railways were now carry-
ing a much greater ' live ' or paying load than they did some years ago, while the
total weight of the train had in many cases been increased by nearly 100 per cent.
On the principal American lines the average train-load was more than twice that of
English railways, and in Continental countries there was also, generally speaking,
a considerably larger train-load than in England, where the average train mile
receipts were lower than in any European country, except Luxemburg, although
the average range of rates and fares was considerably higher.

     The special circumstances of the passenger traffic on English railways next
claimed consideration ; and the author dealt at some length with the relation of
passenger vehicles to the number of passengers carried, and to their average gross
earnings from year to year, showing that the tendency within recent years had
been to provide a larger number of carriages than was necessary, and so to diminish
the average annual gross income per carriage, which had fallen from 888Z. in 1874
to 774^. in 1885. The average receipts per passenger carriage were still higher in
England than in most Continental countries, but that was probably due, not so
much to the greater amount of work got out of English carriages, as to the higher

range of passenger fares.

     The same want of economy was traced in the working and the earnings of the
locomotives employed on English railways. Within the last twelve years there had
been a decrease in the annual income per locomotive of 570Z. This decrease was
certainly not due to any corresponding reduction of rates and fares, but could
easily enough be traced to the practice of running trains that were only partially
full. On the Continent the average earnings of a locomotive generally, took a
higher range than in England, the only exceptions to this rule being Germany and
Belgium, where, however, the traffic rates were very much lower than on English

 lines.

     The eifect of the element of speed in railway working was nest considered, and
it was pointed out that, in England, both goods trains and passenger trains were
worked at a much higher average speed than in Continental countries. The English
railways were also distinguished for the larger number of express trains that were
run between the principal centres of population. There were no official data to
show how much it cost to carry on this express train traffic pei- se, but it was
probable that when the wear and tear of the railway stock and permanent way
were considered, together with the cost of shunting, and the delay occasioned to the
slower traffic, the express train service was not adequately remunerative, if indeed

it did not entail an absolute loss.

     On a survey of the whole matter, there was too much reason to believe that the

financial position and prospects of English railways were going from bad to worse.
Our railway Boards had not as yet apparently realised this great fact, and had
consequently done little or nothing to stem the tide of reduced dividends that

threatens to overtake tbem. On English lines in 1885 about 36,500,000Z. of

ordinary railway stock received no dividends whatever, and 14,500,000/. received
less than 2 per cent. These two items together make up 20 per cent, of the total
ordinary capital of English lines. This was certainly not an adequate result for a
system that had the largest volume of both gross and net receipts, the cheapest
materials of construction, and nearly, if not quite, the highest range of rates and

fares.

     In conclusion the author referred to the following as among the sources whence
economy of working and consequent increase of dividends, or reduction of rates, or
both together, may be expected in the future :

     1. The adoption of a slower average rate of speed for goods trains.
     2. The reduction of tare, so as to allow of a greater ' live ' or net load being
carried relative to the weight of the vehicle employed.
     3. The adoption of heavier loads, or, in other words, the running of fewer
empty waggons and carriages, and possiblj- fewer trains.
     4. The avoidance of duplicate trains from practically the same termini, for
practically the same destinations.

    5. An endeavour to redress the differences in the balance of goods sent in

opposite directions.

     6. The transfer of a great part of the heavy traffic to the canals, or an increase
in the number of special lines provided for such traffic, so as to get rid of the loss
of time and capital involved in shunting to make way for passenger traffic ; and

     7. The publication of railway accounts on a principle that would allow of the
ton-mile rates being ascertained as regards both cost and profit.

     Importance to commerce of means of intercommunication. Increasing
necessity for economies in transit. Altered conditions which manufacturers are
compelled to recognise. To-day when production is not confined to England alone,
and when supply overtakes demand, the cost of carrying raw material from the
seaboard to the manufactory and of the manufactured article back to the seaboard
has become so vital a factor as to change the possibility of profit into the impos-
sibility of competition. Impracticability of suggested movement of manufacturers

to the seaboard.

     Such a movement of English industries would scarcely stop at the seaboard
but extend to lands over the seas, tempted by cheaper labour, cheaper transit, and

the protection of tariifs hostile to English manufactures.
     Maintenance of commercial status of England depends largely on provision of

facilities at least equal to those enjoyed by competitors.
     The method of the development of the English railway system has led to the

crippling and practical strangulation of the essentially cheaper canal system.

                  5. Canal CommiiniGation.^ By Samuel Llotd.

     The author maintained that the continued unsatisfactory condition of many

canals, especially of the 1,306 miles under the control of railway companies, led, in
 1883, to the appointment of a Select Committee on Canals. It sat for four months,

and much valuable evidence was brought forward, which was published in a Blue
Book of 331 pages. It showed that while a laisser faire policy respecting canals
had prevailed in England, the Governments of France, Germany, and Belgium,
aware of the importance of water communication, had acquired, and were improving
their principal water routes with very great advantage. There was a virtual
monopoly on the part of the railway companies of the canals, and in October last,
in answer to the question issued by the Royal Commission on Depression in Trade,
' Are there any special circumstances affecting your district to which the existing
condition of trade and industry there can be attributed ? ' the Birmingham Chamber
of Commerce replied : ' The exorbitant cost of carriage of goods from Birmingham
to the seaboard, which has placed inland districts at a great disadvantage compared
with maritime towns.' Birmingham and South Staffordshire objected to pay higher
Tates than any other district, and to enforce them might not prove to the perma-

nent advantage of the railway companies, as it tended to cripple trade and seriously

lessen tlie carriaa'e of goods. The evidence brought before the Select Committee

on Canals ia 1883 proved conc-lusively that goods might be conveyed as cheaply in
Eno^land by water as on the Continent ; for instance, on the Weaver, in Cheshire,,

salt was conveyed a distance of thirty miles for Gd. a ton, equivalent to a rate of one-
fifth of a penny per mile, which was even lower than that between Liege and
Antwerp. This was not a solitary instance. It was also known that goods
could be transported from Birmingham to London by an improved canal system at
a wharf-to-wharf rate of 4s. 6d. a ton. The improved canal would deprive the
railways of some heavy traffic, but their general traffic would increase with the

prosperity of the district. "When canal routes were handed over to railways, in

1846, much of the foreign trade of the country did not exist. In 1840 the export

of British produce only amounted to 1^. 18s. 9d. per head, while in 188.3, after

making due allowance for population, it was 61. 14s. Sd. per head, an increase of

370 per cent. If Mid-England was to enjoy the advantages of cheap water com-

munication to the ports, and thus be enabled to send its manufactures abroad at a

cost that would leave a margin of profit beyond the cost of production and delivery,

it was essential that a trust under Parliamentary powers should be obtained for
Athe purpose.
               joint-stock company would not avail, as its aim would be to exact

the highest tolls possible, and it would soon act in compact with existing railways.

The estimated cost of improving the Severn route was 600,000^., and merited

attention, especially on account of the rising importance of Cardiff and Newport

as great shipping centres. The improvement of the route to London should be first

carried out : there were no engineering difficulties that could not easily be over-

Acome.  trust should be formed by the towns of the district, and the State

should be asked to advance the money at a moderate rate of interest to the local

authorities ; if at 3 per cent, this would leave the Government a margin of i per

cent, beyond the interest paid to savings-bank depositors. The canal rates should

be fixed so as to yield a clear i per cent, after payment of the interest on the

Government loan and the expenses of working and  maintenance                                                   this  ^  per cent.,
                                                                                                            ;

if invested by the trust at 3 per cent, per annum compound interest, would in a

period of sixty-six years extingaish the loan, and the whole undertaking belong to

the towns and district represented by the trust. Interest was felt at the present
time in the creation of village industries. The improved canal, with dwarf walls

on both sides, would form along its entire distance an almost continuous wharf, and

thus provide numerous favourable sites. It was strange that England, so far

surpassing every other nation on the seas, should have so totally disregarded the

national importance of inland navigation. Surely it was time to give the subject

the attention it deserved.

                    6. The Birminghavi Canal. Bij E. B. Marten.

     The district around Birmingham abounds in canals ; and as some of the engi-

neering works are important and interesting, mention of them may be useful to

\'isitors.

     The Act was obtained in 1766 and the canal was made by Brindley, the
celebrated engineer, and completed from Birmingham to Autherley in 1772, and
connected with canals to London in 1783. In 1824 the canals had become so out of
order as to be little better than ' crooked ditches,' when Thomas Telford, also a
well-known canal engineer, made a vast improvement by straightening and deepen-
ing, so as to reduce the length from twenty-two to fourteen miles, and, after expend-
ing much capital, produced what was considered a perfect specimen of a canal.
The supply of water to the canal was also much improved by the large reservoir at
Edgbaston, with a good system of feeders for economising water. In 1835 the
Acts were consolidated, and subsequently arrangements completed with the London
and North Western Railway. The group of large works at Smethwick still forms
a striking feature, with canals on two levels, railways also one over the other, and
railway and road bridges over both canals and railways. In 1850 the splendid
Netherton Tunnel was made under the Rowley Hills by James Walker, another
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                   773

·engineer well known as a canal-maker, to relieve the Dudley Tunnel under the
Castle Hill, which is still maintained in use and is a most interesting work.

     The numerous pumping engines are interesting as giving specimens of the
progress of such machines, and the chief station at Ocker Hill contains a row of six
large engines, all lately put in good order under one roof.

      The working of the mines, especially the thick coal (30 feet), caused very great
injury to the canal, but conjointly with the South Staffordshire Mines Drainage
Commissioners both canals and basins have been so much repaii-ed that the canal
works were perhaps never in more efficient condition.

7. The Stourbridge Canal. By E. B. Makten.

This canal forms an important link between the Birmingham Canal Navigation

·and the Severn and Bristol Channel, and is the water-outlet for the Black Country

in that direction. It was made in 1778, and as an engineering work it has points

of interest in its twenty locks and two large reservoirs, with a good system of

feeders to gather a supply of water, so important for working the locks. It also

receives water from a level about four miles long, cut from Coalboumbrook to ' The

Level ' near Woodside Dudley, to drain a large tract of mines, which was itself a

very clever piece of engineering for that time. Some wooden pumps of curious

construction were lately found in the level. The canal gathers toll at the locks as

road trustees did at turnpikes ; and as the through traffic has been much diverted

by railways, and the traffic on the level part pays no toll, there is not much more

than will pay the cost of maintenance.

 The diificidty is increased by a branch called the  Stourbridge  Extension  Canal

_

being now owned by a railway company, and used, like the older canal, to collect

traffic for the railway without paying toll to the canal. The traders on the level

parts also have the use of the canal without toU or contribution towards its
maintenance.

2. The Character and Organisatimi of the Institutions for Technical Education

          required in a large manufacturing town. By Dr. Ceossket.

     The phrase ' technical education ' requires strict definition, being employed in
various senses. Technical education must be distinguished from general scientific
study in its abstract methods; and also from the definite teaching of a special

handicraft or trade.

     It may be defined as education in the scientific principles which underlie manu-

facturing processes, those manufacturing processes themselves being employed as
illustrations of the scientific principles they involve. In a large manufacturing

--town the requirements of several classes of the population have to be considered.
     Class A. The children of the great mass of working men who are compelled to
earn their living at the earliest possible age. No higher gi-ade school will meet

their wants, and yet they ought to be scientifically prepared to take advantage of
technical evening classes on leaving school. The mass of our people need technical

education, and not merely a few exceptional scholars. To secure this the rudiments
of science must be taught in all public elementary schools under the following

--conditions: (1) it must be taught experimentally this is essential; (2) experts
774 KEPORT-- 1886.

must be employed with command        of well-appoiuted laboratories                                                                                                                                                                                 (3) scientific
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

instruction must be made a part of the ordinary curriculum of the school.

The experiment carried on by the Birmingham School Board has proved that

thoroughly soimd instruction may be given by observing these conditions. The

Enghsh ' code,' however, acts against the development of this system. Managers,

as a rule, are protected in teaching the subjects which pay best and cost least.

Two Agreat difficulties exist. 1st.  scholar, after receiving ' object lessons ' as a

child, may reach the fourth standard in the upper school without any training
whatever corresponding to that received in the infants' department. What is

called ' elementally science ' in the lower division of the school should be made as

compulsory as ' object lessons,' of which it should be the natural continuation

taken out of the regidatious limiting class subjects to three, and paid for by a

grant. 2nd. In the upper division of a public school, as our system now is, the

school may be classed as ' excellent ' without one single scientific subject being
studied. No school ought to be classed as ' excellent ' unless some branch of
science is experimentally studied. Special grants should be made for instruction in

the use of tools in wood or iron. The building of laboratories and provision of

apparatus should also be aided by the State.

   --Class B. iV second class of the population consists of those able to stop at

school for two or three years after having passed the ordinary sixth standard.

For these, special technical schools should be opened, at a low fee, in which there

should be a well-arranged two or three years' course of scientific instruction.

The Birmingham Board has established a school of this character, which has

met with striking success.

    The present state of the law, however, throws unnecessary obstacles in the way

of the development of these schools. They have to work under the code as weU.
as under the regulations of the Science and Art Department, and many practical
difficulties inevitably result. The only way to secure proper provision for the

technical education of our artisans is to authorise school boards to establish schools

giving a two or three years' technical course to those who have passed the seventh

standard, and received a preliminary scientific training during their ordinary school

career, and to connect these schools directly with the Science and Art Department.

The mass of the people being taught the rudiments of science in the elementary

schools, and a technical training lasting over two or three years being provided in

special schools, at a low fee, for those not forced to go to work at the earliest
possible period, evening technical classes for working men coidd be far more
systematically managed than they now are, and would be attended by students

--prepared to profit by them.
     Class C. The last class comprises those able to give whatever time may be

needed for the perfecting of their technical education. To supply their wants

every large manufacturing town reqiihes a school or a college in which the

technical training should be as complete as the classical training in the old

grammar schools. Voluntary contributions aflbrd far too uncertain a support for
institutions of such supreme importance. Two sources of income present them-

selves: (1) the old endowments which have hitherto been devoted to classical

schools ought to contribute their quota                                                                                                                                                                                 (2)  grants from the State  should  supple-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

ment any deficiencies. Regarding management, every district understands best its

own wants. The great centres of manufacturing industry differ widely in their

specific requirements. Technical schools and colleges ought therefore to be

managed by local representative bodies.

4. Sliding Scales and Hours of Labour in the Northumherland Goal Industry.

                                      By Ralph Young.

The Northumberland Slidin;^ Scale was established in 1879. Dui'ing the pre-

ceding years an important rise occurred in the price of coal, and from 1871 to 1873

it advanced 200 per cent. Three general advances were conceded in wages, and

these advances with special local advances amounted to 74 per cent. When the

price of coal began to fall the mine-owners claimed a reduction in wages, and in

AApril 1874 the men agreed to a reduction of 10 per cent.  second reduction of

A20 per cent, occurred in October.  third reduction of 20 per cent, was demanded

in 1875, but was strongly resisted by the miners, and a strike was only arrested by
a reference to Sir Rupert Kettle, who awarded a reduction of half the amount

claimed. Further arbitrations in January and October 1876 resulted in a reduction

of 16 per cent., but in 1877 Lord Herschell decided in favour of the miners. Three

months later the owners gave notice of a reduction, and an eight weeks' strike fol-

lowed, but in the end the miners submitted to a reduction of 12^ per cent., and ten
mouths later the owners again demanded and enforced a reduction of 10 per cent.

The irritation and disturbance in trade produced by these constant disputes

about wages led to the appointment of a committee of miners and mine-owners to

consider the possibility of framing a sliding scale; and eventually a scale was

framed, of which the chief features were (1) that when the average price of all
coal raised was the price realised in November 1878 [5/1*28] the wage of hewers

was to be the average wage earned after the last 10 per cent, reduction, i.e., 4/y|.

    (2) An advance or reduction of 2^ per cent, was to take place for every rise or

fall of 0/4 in the price of coal, with an extra 2^ per cent, when the price readied

6/4, and S3 on, every 1/4 carrying an extra 2^ per cent.

     (.3) The ascertainments of price to be made four times a year.

     (4) The scale to remain in force for twelve months certain, and after that from

year to year, unless terminated by one month's notice.

In 1882 the standard price was reduced from 5/1-28 to 4/8, and it was arranged

that wages should rise or fall 1^ per cent, for every rise or fall of 0/2, and that an

extra 1^^ per cent, advance should be given when the price of coal was 6/0, 6/4,

7/2, 8/6, and 9/0.

    The adoption of the scale led to a great improvement in the coal trade. From

1874 to 1879 the output in Northumberland gradually declined 14-.35 per cent.,

though the output for the rest of the country had increased 7 per cent. The first

year the scale was in operation the outpiit in Northumberland increased 23 per

cent, as compared with an increase of 9 per cent, in the rest of the countr)'.

From 1879 to 1884 the output increased 3579 per cent, as against 19'55 per cent.

for the rest of the country.

The sliding scale is a much more effective method of settlmg wages than arbi-

tration. The defects of arbitration are :
    1. There can be no agreement as to how long prices are to rise or fall before

arbitration is resorted to.

2. There can be no agreement as to what advance or reduction is to take place

for a given rise or fall in the price of coal.

The sUding scale avoided both difficulties, and greater continuity of employ-

ment was worth at least 10 per cent, to both miners and mine-owners.

     The hours of hewers are 6| at the coal face, or 7^ from bank to bank; of other
undergroundmen 8 from bank to bank ; and of boys under 16 years, 10 from bank

to bank.

    The 7^ hours system was introduced between 1852 and 1856, when the process
of getting coal by wedging gave way to blasting, the hours previous to that year

being 9 to 12 hours per day. The produce per man per shift of 7^ hours under the
new system was as great as the produce under the old system of an average 10
hours' shift. The 7| hours' shift continued until 1873, when the Mines Regulation
Act came into force, and the restrictions placed by that Act on the employment of
boys (10 hours being a maximum) led to the hours of hewers being reduced from

7^ to 6^ per shift ; but in 1878 the depression in the coal trade led to an increase of
776 EEPORT-- 1886.

half an hour iu the length of the shift. This additional half-hour represented an
increase in the hours of lahour of 8"3 per cent., hut the corresponding increase in
production was only 5'1 per cent. It was therefore extremely doubtful whether
an economic advantage would result from an extension of the hours of hewers.

                                  By Hyde Clarke.

The author dealt with the development of our colonies and India by the

application of credit in the shape of loans for the construction of railways,

irrigation, and other public works. He stated that in order to equip itself a new

country must begin in debt, and that this condition is not, as it has been made by
some, necessarily a cause of reproach to the colonies. The borrowed moneys have

in most cases been applied to the provision of railways and works producing an

equivalent revenue. Thus in the end the debt, as in the case of New South Wales,
becomes a property. He objected to indiscriminate application of debt totals,

debt per head, taxation per head, &c., as fallacies and real abuses of statistical

methods. He maintained that the comparisons must be equal, and that a debt

incurred for public works cannot be set off as equal to a debt incurred for

deficits and war, or with a case of the railways being formed by joint-stock

capital. He pointed out the confusion between capital and current expendi-

ture, which had embarrassed the financiers of India and injured the develop-

ment of the empire. This, he said, was partly caused by the neglect of a

national balance-sheet at home showing the capital stock of the nation. Approxi-
mations to such a cadastre were to be found in the Domesday Book of 1086, and
the census of the United States, showing the resources of each State. The agri-

cultural returns are an approximation to this. The first requisite of a colony, as

of all countries, is means of transit and transport iu the shape of railways such as

can compete with other districts in the conveyance of goods to market. It is in

this way alone the wilderness can be made a fertile and a productive land. Rail-

way material, not being of local supply, can only be obtained from abroad and from

borrowed means. With regard to such cases he took that of New South Wales

Aaccording to the budget of July 1886.  debt of 30,000,000^. had been, or was

being, contracted, and of this 2o,000,000Z. had been applied to railways, besides
what has been applied to other work and what remains to be applied to railways.

The net railway revenue for the year amounted to 1,000,000/., equivalent to 4^
per cent. (4'48) on the loan monej-s, and leaving a small surplus of profit, after

payment of working expenses and interest as loans. The debt of New South

Wales per head was only for public works, while the home debt of England is

wholly um-epresented by assets. Mr. Clarke then considered the market price of

colonial securities, which was high for the old 6 and 5 per cent, loans, and has

enabled these to be replaced by 4 per cent, loans, the Government of New South

Wales having lately placed five millions at 3^ per cent., a rate towards which

colonial securities are approximating. In the case of New South Wales the saving

in interest gives the colony a further power of borrowing and of creating assets

without increasing the fund for interest. Mr. Clarke showed also that English

figures were fallacious as a standard for the cost per mile and rate of earnings.

English railways are trunk lines, and many are suburban lines with heavy pay-

ments for land, for tunnels, and underground lines, and with large stations, more

engines, carriages, waggons, rolling stock and appliances than on the light colonial

lines with land free. Where a line is constructed by the State, as it has supple-

mental resources from increase of taxation, it can even afford to make a loss in its
railway charges for pubUc purposes. He then referred to the low price of rails,

steel, and iron caused by the inventions of Bessemer, Siemens, &c., and the

advantages thereby conferred on the colonies, which can now obtain their extensions
at reduced rates of cost. At the same time he pointed out that this low price of

material had opened up all the land in the world capable of producing wheat,

maize, sugar, and coffee, and given cheap steel ship ocean freights. The increased

supply of perishable food articles had aggravated the differences of prices, and it
 would be dangerous for India and the colonies to depend on increased food .exports,

but they must extend other branches of trade. He pointed out that India and
the colonies required an immense extension of railways and waterworks. As to

India, he said there was one mile of railway to 20,000 people with a revenue of
about Is. 6d. ner head per annum, and with the Government expending about as

much on extensions. In connection with colonial development he advocated repro-
ductive emigration, that every man who had a free passage should be taxed for its
repayment, so that the fund should constantly be employed in sending out more

emigrants,

6. The Mathematical Theory of Banking.

By F. Y. Edgewoeth, M.A., F.8.S.

--The higher mathematics make two contributions to social economy the cal-

·culus of probabilities and what we may, after Jevons, call the calculation of utility.

Of these branches the former is more fruitful ; and, as it has been cultivated by the

most distinguished mathematicians, so it appears at first sight to belong to the

same genus as physics. But, when we examine the root and ground from which

it springs, the science whose object is the calculation of credibility is found to be
nearly as speculative as the other branch of mathematics applied to human affairs.

They both are developed from somewhat conjectural first principles, and they
Weyield, for the most part, very hypothetical conclusions.
                                                            gather from them,

rather appropriate general ideas, than results immediately applicable to practice.

I. Probability is the foundation of banking. The banker contracts liability to

pay amounts which he never could pay if all his creditors should at the same time

demand full payment. His solvency and profits depend upon the probability that

he will not be called on to meet at once more than a certain amount of his lia-

--bilities. There is involved not only the calculation of averages which is an affair

--of arithmetic but also the doctrine of deviations from an average, of errors, which

iias exercised the ablest mathematicians. The general theory is that, when any

quantity fluctuates under the influence of a number of independent causes, the

values assumed from time to time by the variable quantity occur each with a fre-

--quency which fulfils a certain mathematical law the so-called Imo of error.

The following experiment, which the writer has partially performed, illus-

trates the principle. Take at random a hundred digits from the pages of a

mathematical table or statistical journal, and add them together. This aggi'egate

may be regarded as formed by a hundred independent agencies. Accordingly,

sums thus formed will fluctuate about their mean value (450) according to the

normal law. The probability of any such sum deviating in excess or defect

to the extent of 42 from the mean 450 is about ^. The probability of a devia-

tion twice as great is about ^^o' ^°^ the odds are about fifty thousand to one that
the limits 576 and 324 will not be passed. It is upon this principle that the

·anthropologist, armed with the formulae of Quetelet, could, by inspecting some

samples of a new race, determine the probability that there should be found

·among a thousand taken at random from them a single six-footer or a dozen

whose average height is six feet. Now the variables with which the banker is

concerned, such as the amount of notes remaining out in the hands of the public

and the demands on the reserve, depend in ordinary times upon a multeity of causes,

the fortunes and actions of the bank's numerous customers. Accordingly the

theoretical banker, interpreting experience by mathematics, can calculate with

nicety the chance that the demands on him in the immediate future will ex-
ceed a certain extent. Ideally in the planet Saturn, the banker may determine the

probability of demands of different extent, and make such arrangements, that to

-demands of different probability may correspond different degrees of facility in

meeting them. The use and beauty of this ideal arrangement are somewhat marred

when we descend to the affairs of Earth. The fluctuations of banking business

are not entu'ely subject to the rules of chance. They have been partly reduced

to law. There is a tide in the affairs of business men. There are periodical
778 EEPOBT-- 1886.

variatious, which have been calculated by Jevoiis. But when we have taken
account of these regular disturbances, when we bave ' eliminated ' the ' tides/

there still remain undvdations which are amenable to the principles of prob-

ability. It may be objected, however, that the irregular variations most important

to the banker depend, not on a number of small agencies, but on a few great causes,

such as weather destroying harvests, war, or adverse exchanges. It is submitted,

however, that such great causes, being themselves the results of a multiplicity of

varying conditions, may, to a considerable extent, and with due reservations,

be reduced imder the tlieory of errors. Proceeding upon this hypothesis the

·writer attempts to determine, by the formulje of Laplace and Poisson, the

amount of Bank of England notes which may be regarded as certain to remain

out in the hands of the pubUc. The reserve of private banks in ordinary times

may be similarly treated. The I'eserve of the Bank of England presents pecu-

Weliar difficulties.  may at least obtain from the rules of probability a presump-

tion in favour of an increased reserve. This indication is agreeable to the opinions

of many high authorities. But there is one argument frequently employed by

practical sagacity for which mathematical theory does not vouch. It seems to

be generally assumed that, if the volume of banking business increases, the

reserve should increase proportionately, if safety is to be maintained. But the

Ad priori presumption is the other way.  banker may be compared to the

manager of a club who undertakes to have dinner ready for auj' number of
members who may present themselves any evening. Suppose (as in a case with

which the wi'iter is conversant) the average attendance is 18; and suppose that

--deviations in excess from that mean to the extent of 8 and 16 that is, attendances

-- ~of 26 and 34 correspond to diflerent degrees of improbability ( j^ and respectively),

and different arrangements, such as keeping provisions in the house or sending out

to borrow them. Suppose, now, that two or three such clubs amalgamate. The

~deviations (of probability and j~) for which provision as before must be made

will not be two or three times the deviations found for the single club. The

theoretical ratio will be not 2 or 3, but the square root of 2 or 3. Similarly

if the liabilities of the Bank of Saturn should double, while the ratio between the

liabilities to the reserve should diminish from 52 to 41 per cent, (as here in Eng-

land between 1844 and 1873), this circumstance ^jer se would not there cause any
alarm. The same principle is applicable to the theory of banker's balances. If

several Saturnian banks should be subordinated to one bank of banks, with whom

they all keep their reserves, in estimating the safety of the system it would be

improper to deduct en bloc the balances of the bankers, and to be alarmed if the

remainder was inadequate to meet the liabilities of the prime bank, or even less
Athan nothing.
                smaller reserve is required for a consolidated system, not only
--in so far as the demands upon one bank correspond to payments into another the
--principle of clearing which is admitted but also, what is less evident, in so far as

the demands upon one bank are independent of the demands upon another. How

far this condition is ftilfilled, or how far ' other things are equal,' in particular

whether the presumption raised by increased volume is counteracted by the in-

creased rapidity of drains upon the reserve, the writer does not pretend to decide.

The mathematical method supplies to practical men rather general ideas than exact

propositions.

     II. The mathematical theory of exchange, constructed by Gossen, Jevons,
and Walras, applies to the money market, at least as well as to the other bargains,
which are the subject of economics. From the abstract point of view may be dis-

cerned an unobvious, perhaps unimportant, reason why the money market should be

particularly sensitive, more so than the labour market. In an" ideal market, con-

sisting in its simplest type of two sets of dealers and two kinds of commodities

exchanged, each individual belonging to one of the sets should be free to enter

into contract at the same time with any number of dealers belonging to the other

--set. But the workman cannot, or does not often, at the same time contract with

different employers sell on the same day this week's work to one employer, and
next week's work to another. Accordingly, if the balance of supply and demand

should be turning in a sense unfavourable to the workman, a new equilibrium will

he reached, not by the workman huying up the aid of several employers (at a rate

slightly below that hitherto prevailing, so as to cut out his competitors), but solely

by the employer refusing to buy at the existing rate as many workmen as he has

hitherto done. The resilience of the money market is not impeded by any similar

defect. Another subject which may le usefully contemplated by the aid of mathe-

matical conceptions is the efl'ect of a quasi-monopoly, such as the Bank of England

used to enjoy. However interesting such inqviiries, we must always remember

that they are at an enormous height of abstraction above ;"real life. It has been

well said of the economical theorist that he has a key which has unluckily been,

left within the chamber which is to be opened. Yet though we cannot determine

the exact shape and number of the wards, it is something to have a general know-

Weledge of the difficulty to be resolved.  can at least confute the charlatan when

he offers his patent picklocks. It is melancholy to contemplate the waste of

emotion and errors of conduct following upon the bogus theory of value which a

certain sect of Socialists has adopted. The Jevonian theory may not enable us to

predict what will be the price of money or any other article to-morrow, but at

least it helps to dissipate the sophisms incidental to a subject whose natural obscu-

rity is darkened by interest and passion.

     This paper showed that about 1 ,000,000^. per year less was spent on the navy
in each year (1869 to 1872) than before or since; that the plant, buildings, and
machinery of the dockyards were better kept up then than before or since ; that if
since, up to 1884, as much had been expended on such plant, &c., 3,655,000L more
would have been expended ; and that, nevertheless, the warships built in H.M.
dockyards and bought were many thousands of tons yearly more in 1869 to 1872
than before or since, as the table below will show :

opinion that there was no sufficient reason for the present great excess cost, and that
much more tonnage of new ships ought to be produced for the money expended.

    He pointed out that it had been decided, after great inquiry and deUberation,
that at least 20,000 tons of new war shipping ought to be added yearly to our nav y

under normal circumstances to keep up its strength properly, that in 1869 to 1872,
under the administration of Mr. Childers, carrying out the recommendations of
Mr. Seely's Committee of 1868, 22,387 tons (of which 17,114 tons were iron-

clad) had been yearly added at a much less cost than a smaller tonnage before or
since ; and that he (the author) never could discover sufficient reason why these

data resulting in the decision as to 20,000 tons yearly, were departed from, and only
about 17,000 to 18,000 tons yearly added.

   --The consequence was panics arose, and our navy had to be suddenly increased

at an enormously excessive cost indeed, at any cost almost that those who had war-

ships chose to ask.

    He concluded by stating if he had carte, hlanche he believed he could again bring

about similar results to those of 1869 to 1872.

   1. Proportional Mortality. By Baldwin Latham, M.Inst. C.E., F.G.S.

     The author of this paper describes a method of very correctly arriving at the
proportional death-rate of a district with great facility by the use of ' constant ' or
basic numbers. These ' constant ' numbers were obtained at census periods by
ascertaining the average death-rate at such periods, and then adding a quantity
equal to ten times the proportion of births to one death found in the same period.
As one example he gives the case of the combined disti'ict of Birmingham and
Aston, where the average death-rate at the census periods of 1861, 1871, and
1881 was 22-.31, and the average proportion of births to deaths in that period,
when multiplied by 10, was 17-69, giving, when added together, a constant number
of 40; so that if ten times the proportion of births to deaths was deducted
from 40 it would show the proportional death-rate in any period as compared
with the average at the last three census periods. There might be cases in
which a modification in procedure would be necessary in arriving at the propor-
tional death-rate, as in those places and years when the deaths exceed the births,

in order to arrive at a result in such a period, which now fortunately seldom occurs
in this country, but which was common years ago. When the births and deaths

were equal it was equivalent to deducting 10 from the constant number. If there-
fore when the deaths exceeded the births 10 was deducted from the constant num-
ber, and the remainder multiplied by the ratio by which the deaths exceed the
births, it would give the proportional mortality.

   A second and more correct method was described in this paper, in which the

constant number was exactly equal to twice the average death-rate at the census
period, the proportional mortality being arrived at by deducting a quantity equal
to the proportion of births to one death when multiplied by a number obtained
by dividing the average death-rate by the average proportion of births to deaths.
Under this system, in Birmingham and Aston districts, the constant number became

44-62, and the multiple 177^0 = 12'6; so that the proportion of births to one death

multiplied by 12'6, and deducted from 44-62, would give the proportional mortality
in this district at any time.

condition of labourers from 1760 to 1790 was better than it had ever been before ·

to raising wages. Expedients resorted to to cope with the distress. The
allowance system by scale, resulting in early marriages, idleness, and loss of inde-
pendence. Workhouses mostly hotbeds of vice, and extravagant in diet. Poor
when unemployed by parish, idle and vicious. Jobbery caused by payment of
cottage rents out of rates. Paupers were purposely dirty and ragged to extort
relief; children and sick relatives neglected. Pauperisation spreading towards the
middle classes. Reformation efiected by enforcing labour from the able-bodied
and rent and rates from the cottagers. The flourishing condition of the unsettled
and the independent labourer, and general improvement in the condition of the
working classes. Wages in 183.3 similar to those in 1886.

a typical case the needlewomen of East London, a vast class of London's regular
industry, estimated to number over a quarter of a mdlion, and to averao-e, from a
long day's work, an earning per liead of only one shilUng a day. Now" probably
no man, certainly no woman in any way possible to her respectabihty, can live in
London on a shilHng a day, or 6s. a week. Then how does all this class live from
day to day and year to year ?                                                                                              Why, sad to say, they

morally and physically. But quickly as the way is ever thus cleared, it is ever
refilled by the fresh _tide of victims. The ranks of these needlewomen are probably
the main source of London's great social evil, and a social revolution would result
from solving their problem.

Well, if we cannot help them to a greater money earning, we may help to make
the little money they do earn go further. This is to be done by means of co-opera-
tion and the wholesale scale. The author went into this question, looking on the
one hand at all the possibilities of the cheapest housing and dieting, and consider-
ing, on the other hand, the habits and wants, and even the prejudices, of those we
aim to help, in case we attempted plans which, however economical, would not
practically work. Experience tended to abolish bedrooms in which individuals
or families were huddled together day and night, and to substitute sleeping
berths, somewhat as in ships' cabins, with their common saloon as the day accom-
modation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "^
--782 REPORT 1886.

Taking this fundamental idea, to which he was also guided by the form which

cheap lodging took in East London, the author could furnish a marvellously cheap
estimate of living, to include, besides sufficient food, a home that was comfortable,

cheerful, and respectable, and all well within the 6s. a week of wages. He would
rear a building for the purpose, with its great common hall in the centre, and its

successive floors of sleeping accommodations, accessible from the hall by stairs and
balconies, the latter wide and roomy, so as to increase and vary the sitting area.

He would institute a ' house diet,' the result of science and experience in cheap,

wholesome, and palatable food, but the tenants must be free as to their custom, nor

would they be bound in partnership arrangements. He would, however, make a

redemption fund by a small addition to rent, so that in twenty or forty years the

edifice would fall to the tenants. There was social difficulty and danger in
Abrino-ing, for instance, many young women under one roof.
                                                                                                            matron was insuf-

ficient. He would seek the intervention of a committee of benevolent ladies, each of

whom might take charge, say, of twenty young women, and thus make an approach
to a family influence. He estimated the ' house diet,' or minimum cost of food-

finding, at 2d. per day, the sleeping berths at 9d. per week, the redemption at the

same, and all costs of hall and management, together with 6 per cent, on capital, at

2s. 6d. He would have a minimum of tidy and suitable furnishing as fixtures,
instead of tenants' furniture, and this would add Id. to 2d. to weekly rent. He

would have an entrance deposit of 5s. to 10s. to begin the redemption fund, which

the tenant might afford by help of the furnishing convenience. There must be

strict selection to ensure success to first experiments. He supposed a scale of
1.000 to 2,000 tenants, whose minimum of expenses, clothing excepted, would fall

within 5s. M. per week. But by larger numbers, say of 5,000, and consequent

economising in hall and management, the cost to each might be brought substan-

tially under 5s. So great a number, with their great edifice and large and lively

hall, might resemble a street, a well-ordered and pleasant street, we may hope,

with the occupants sitting out in the genial air, to pursue their work under cheer-

ful circumstances or to enjoy the sociabilities. The poor young needlewoman's
·dream, when she left her country home for golden London, might thus be even

more than realised.

4. London Heconstruction and He-Housing. By William Westgarth,

The author introduced his subject by alluding to the heritage of debt usually

left to the ratepayers, as the result hitherto of urban sanitation and reconstruction

undertaken by the municipality. He proposed to reconstruct ill-conditioned

areas  of central  London  as  a  self-remunerative  business                                          and  he  explained  how
                                                                                                    ;

the recoupment of cost was to be effected by what he called the ' natural in-

crement' of site value (using that tsrm in place of the invidiously so-called 'un-

earned increment ' of the economists), besides the increase of value due to the

improvement itself. He meant to do this by means of a joint stock company or

trust, and there were certain facilities and privileges which the trust would

reasonably ask of the Government, in return for the sanitation and reconstruction

the trust contemplated, all of it cost free to the ratepayers.

    He then explained natural increment as simply the result of the increase of

population, commerce, and wealth upon and around sites or areas which were
themselves inextensible. It was the feature in common of all progressive countries,

and especially of their larger towns, and had been markedly the feature of London,

and of central London particularly, whose natural increment during the last thirty

years might have availed for an entire systematic reconstruction. Such a con-

siderable term of years must be dealt with, because natural increment, like other

things commercial, is subject to sub-waves of excitement and depression, as illus-

trated by the excitement and site-value increase between 1870 and 1878, as com-

pared with the eight subsequent years of depression, or comparative depression.

He went on to allude to the great Paris reconstruction, where, by the immediate

re-sale in fee simple of the expropriations, after clearing, realignment, &c., all the

natural increment had been abandoned to the private investors and speculators,
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                      783

leaving therety an enormous debt upon the city. But so enormous also had been

the subsequent value-increase that he was warranted in saying that Paris could

have been successfully reconstructed as a private enterprise by holding for an

adequate term to the sites, much in the way he now proposed for London.

Having stated principles, tlie author then passed to details. In the first place

he must be helped by a special Act of Parliament, to enable the Government to deal
with and authorise a trust when of adequate resource and responsibility. With-

out this special facility no body of responsible and busy men would attempt such a
work, and this Act, whUe they were about it, he would make general and not

merely for London, so that public-spirited persons elsewhere might institute similar

trusts. The proposed trust to be upon a scale of adequate resource, should have ten

millions of capital to start with ; but this could take the convenient form of a

small paid-up, and a large liability, capital. The advantage of this form, as much
successful experience had shown, was that, while a dividend might be large and

satisfactory as compared with the paid capital, it yet weighted the concern with

only a small charge as upon the whole capital. This plan answered well where

there was confidence in the undertaking. And responsible shareholding would

still be secured by making the shares of exceptionally large amount.

But this form of the capital would involve large borrowing from the public, and

in order to do this cheaply (for it was everything to tide over, at lowest cost, the

considerable interval till natural increment became effective), the trust would

claim a contingent rating liability as additional security for its loan issues. The

ratepayers, protected by the trust's capital and judicious business procedure, would

have only a nominal liabihty. Under this concession the trust's dividends must be

by agreement with the Government.

     Then followed conditions or limits to the full powers of action given to the

trust. No step could be taken without approval, or in face of the veto of Govern-

ment or municipality. Hostility on their part was not to ba even dreamed of in

this beneficial work. The Board of Management would include a representative of

Athe Government, of the Corporation, and of the Board of Works.       further con-

dition would be that, in its possibly large expropriations, the trust should, as far as

practicable, offer siteholders, on fair agency terms, the option of co-operation

instead of expropriation. This seems only fair, where the object is not such dis-

turbing expropriation, but improvement.

Finally, Mr. Westgarth, in commending his project to favourable attention,

said that he was ambitious to invite the help of the very highest London names in

forming his Board, and thus alike to inspire public confidence in an enterprise

somewhat novel in character, and to do full justice to a project which contained all

the possibilities of the grandest and most beneficent of business enterprises.

             6. On the Application of Physical Science to Economics.
                                    By Patrick Geddes.

     The present isolation of economic from physical and biological studies, in spite of
the clear dependence of the social sciences on the preliminary ones, is to be accounted
for, not on rational, but simply on temporai-y grounds, that of the press of detailed
labour upon every specialist. Yet these sciences are needed on every hand. The
population question is a strictly biological one ; so too that of competition, and even
of individuahsm vejsus socialism, which largely comes down to a dispute between
the advocates of natural and artificial selection respectively. Progress especially

needs interpretation in terms of evolution i.e., the popular idea of progress as lyincr

essentially in quantity of wealth and in number of population needs thorough re-
placement by the scientific one, that of the improved average individual quality of
the organisms composing the society, and of the material surroundings upon which

their evolution depends.

    Foreign though such views may nowadays seem to economists, it was in this
way that the science actually arose : the original French ' Physiocratic ' school was

one of naturalists and physicians, and the subsequent character of political economy
--784 REPORT 1886.

is to he rather accounted for by tlie passage of the science out of the hands of
scientific men into those of scholars and business men alone.

     The view of industry as a physical process ' in which the energies of nature are
applied was next discussed, and the bearing of the physical doctrine of energy upon,
the subject outlined. Interest, for instance, is thus viewed, not simply as 'reward
for abstinence ' or the like, but as resting fundamentally as the surplus of income

over expenditure in the year's struggle to seize the energies of nature ; like the
enero-y of coal, in short, it comes primarily from the sun. Money, of course, being

a mere mode of notation of material realities, we must distinguish between apparent

saving and real storing.
     The highest aspect of production is thus seen to be not in simply individual

--effort for personal gain, but in the resulting sum of such efforts in the accumula-
--tion and handing on of the total results of industry in other words, in the col-

lective energy, or synerc/t/, of the community.
      Finallv, the supposed opposition of economics to morals is thus seen to lie

essentially in a too narrow definition of the aim of production, and disappears in

--proportion as the individual increase of often imaginary wealth mere claims upon,
--the labour of the future becomes subordinated to the accumulation of the only
--real and intrinsic wealth the permanent apparatus of general well-being. Such

a city as Birmingham exhibits a typical example of such a change, showing clearly
the new city, rich in permanent dwellings and in treasure for the commonweal,
in the heart of the older city of merely individualistic production around it. It

is in this way that the reconciliation of political economy with morals is to be
effected and the good of the socialistic movement retained while avoiding its

dangers.

6. The Hesources and Progress of Spain during the last Fifty Years of

     Me-presentative Government, in connection with the British Empire. By

     Don Artuko de Marcoartu.

     The author said that the population and the wealth of Spain has increased
lately, in spite of wars and political disturbances, more than her national foreign
debt ; that the value of the railways alone, which will revert to the State, is equal
to her foreign debt at par ; and that Spain has sufficient assets and means to
develop her public works by making a loan of forty millions without increasing
her present budget of expenses, and without selling her forests ; that Spanish
 ao-ricultural products will supply a great deal of the wants of Great Britain ; and,
in the mining wealth of Spain, the United Kingdom can find the basis of her
 metallic production ; that between 1853 and 1883 the degree of activity of con-
 struction of Spanish and British railways was quite equal ; that the total trade
in the last twenty-five years (1860-1884) between England and Spain was
 288,252,347^., or nearly 296,000,000/., although there was no treaty to favour
 commerce, and although Spain was disturbed by revolutions.

      British capitalists and British industry made enormous profits from the
 Spanish mines by selling to Spain steamers and railway plant, although British
 capital was not employed in the Spanish railways.

      The new Anglo-Spanish treaty is most favourable for England, but unfortu-
 nately has not settled some important claims on the part of Spain, inasmuch as the

 sherry and Tarragon wines will pay 100 per cent, and 175 per cent, of their value
 ia duty, the Spanish di-ied fruits still pay 35 per cent., and the smuggling at
 Gibraltar has not been extinguished.

       Per head of population, the Spanish Peninsula is the most highly taxed ex-
 porter to this country, while the Spanish treasury is most seriously defrauded by
 Gibraltar ; British produce commands a greater consumption per head in Spain
 than in France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Austria ; the total commerce of Spain

       1 See the writer's analysis of the Principles of Economics, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin»

 1885 ; and Williams & Norgate, 1885.
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.      785

with the United Kingdom is double the total commerce of Italy with the United
Kingdom.

     Diversity of production and the short distances between Great Britain and
Ireland and the Spanish Peninsula in Europe, between Canada, and Cuba, and
Porto Rico in America, and between the Philippine Islands and the British pos-
sessions in the East, must help the natural stream of trade between the British
and Spanish Empires all over the world ; but in order to attain this end it would

be necessary to append to the new commercial convention a clause of international
arbitration, such as was agreed upon by England and Italy in the last treaty of
commerce between those countries, and such as has been introduced into over
twenty other international treaties, namely, a clause for the settlement by arbitra-
tion of all controversies which may arise on the interpretation or the execution of
the largest commercial treaty which has ever been made ; and lastly, that in order
to difl'use in both countries the knowledge of each other's resources it would be
wise to create Spanish Chambers of Commerce ki the British Empire, and British
Chambers of Commerce in Spain and her colonies, and to promote an Anglo-

Peninsular delegation of these corporations.

           Section G.--MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

--President of the Section Sir James N. Douglass, M.Inst.C.E.

         THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2.

The President delivered the following Address :--

The present occasion is one of special interest to the members of this great

Association, this being the first instance of their holding a fourth meeting in any

Antown.  opportunity is thus afforded me of referring briefly to the principal

Gsubjects dealt with at the previous meetings of Section in this important centre

of mechanical industry, and the good work done in their advancement.

At the Birmingham meetings in 1839, 184-5, and 1805 the following papers,

special to this Section, were read and discussed, viz., 1839, Testing Iron by long-

continued strains ; Proportion of Power to Tonnage in Steam Vessels ; and Wood

Paving with Vertical Blocks. In 1845, Machine Ventilation for Coal Mines

Centrifugal Pump (improved principle) ; Balancing Locomotive Wheels ; Oil

Testin"- by Mechanical Means ; Chemical Copying Telegraphs ; and Macadamised

Roads (superiority). In 1865, Bessemer Steel Manufacture as substituted for that

of Wrought Iron; Siemens' Regenerative Furnace and Gas Producer; Hot Blast

for Furnaces at very High Temperatures ; Compressed Air Machinery for Trans-

mitting Power; Weldless Tyres; Gitfard's Injector; Covering of Deep-Sea

Telegraph Cables. I need not remind the members of Section G of how great

value in the progress of mechanical science these subjects generally have proved,

and how their beneficial influence is now being felt throughout the whole world.

With these preliminary remarks on the past good work of GSection at Birming-

ham, and which I have no doubt will be ful]y maintained at this meeting, I pro-

pose to address you on a subject with which I have been practically connected for

nearly half a century, that is, the development of lighthouses, light-vessels, buoys

and beacons, together with their mechanical and optical apparatus.

Such a subject being of the first importance to this great maritime country, her

colonies, and generally to the whole world, appears to be particularly fitting on this

occasion, when we are favoured with the visit of so many eminent Colonial and

Indian brethren from various portions of this great Empire.

It is also to be remembered that in the immediate neighbourhood of Birming-

ham are situated probably the largest works in the world for the manufacture of

lio-bthouse apparatus ; indeed, the only establishment in which the glass portions are

cast, ground, polished, and finished on the same premises, and where many of the

most perfect optical apparatus for lighthouse illumination have been produced.

Samuel Srniles, in his * Lives of the Engineers,' writes : ' Our lighthouses are

among the youngest triumphs of modern engineering.' Ancient lighthouses were

erected on prominent parts of coasts beyond actual attack by the sea, and in many

instances they were at considerable distances from navigable water, and thus, with

their feeble and uncertain wood or coal fires, they were far from efliicient as aids to

mariners. So slow was the development in lighthouse illumination for many

centuries that, so recently as 1822, the last beacon coal fire in this country was
                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                                                                                                                  787

Teplaced by catoptric oil light apparatus at Saint Bees Lighthouse on the coast of

Cumberland. With Winstanley's structure on the Eddystone in 1696 may be said
to have commenced the modern engineeiing efforts *in directhig the great sources

of power in nature for the vise and convenience of man ; ' ' efforts which, followed

up by Rudyerd, Smeatou, the Stevensons, and others, have since been so successful

in converting hidden dangers into sources of safety, and ensuring the beneficent

guidance of the mariner in his trackless path. These works of modern mechanical

science are now to be found around all the nautical centres of civilisation and com-
merce, and are so numerous that time will not permit of my referring, except
incidentally, to any of them at home or abroad. I will therefore proceed to the

particular branch of mechanical science to which I desire to invite your attention,

viz. lighthouses, light-vessels, buoys, and beacons.

During the last century a very considerable increase has occurred in the number

of lighthouses and light-vessels on the various coasts of the world, which have

been required to meet the rapid growth of commerce. Only during the last

twenty-five years can accurate statistical information be obtained, and it is found
that in the year 1860 the total number of coast lights throughout the world did
not exceed 1,800, whereas the present number is more than 4,000.

     The relative progress of each of the chief maritime countries, in the extension

of their system of lighthouses and light-vessels between 1860 and 1885, is shown

approximately in the statement on the nest page, from which it will be observed that

Japan, which had not a single coast light in 1860, has now fifty-seven, eight of these

being lights of the first class ; while China, which had only four secondary coast
lights in 1860, has now fifty-five lights, fourteen of these being of the first class.
The greatest increase, however, is found in British America, where in 1860 there

were only ninety-one coast-lights, whereas in 1885 there were 636.

Concurrently with the enormous increase in the number of coast lights during

the last fifty years, very great improvements have been effected from time to time

in their efficiency. In 1759 Smeaton's lighthouse on the Eddystone was illumi-

nated by 24 tallow candles, weighing | lb. each. The intensity of the light of
each candle, I find, from experiments made with similar candles prepared for the

purpose, to have  been about 2-8 candle units each                                                                                                                             thus the  aggregate intensity of
                                                                                                                                                                            ;

radiant light from the 24 candles was only about 67 candle units. No optical

apparatus, moreover, was used for condensing the radiant light of the candles, and

directing it to the surface of the sea. The consumption of tallow was about 3-4

lbs. per hour ; therefore, the cost of the light per hour, at the current price of
tallow candles, would be about Is. 6ff/., sufficient to provide a mineral oil light, at
the focus of a modern optical apparatus, to produce tor the service of the mariner

a beam of about 2,400 times the above-mentioned intensity-

      Tlie uitroduction of catoptric apparatus for lighthouse illumination appears to

have been first made at Liverpool, about 1763, and was the suggestion of William

Hutchinson, a master mariner of that port. The invention by Argand, in 1782, of
the cylindrical wick lamp, provided a more efficient focal Uiminary than the flat
wick lamp previously employed, and was soon generally adopted, for both fixed and

revolving lights. In 1825 the French lighthouse authorities effected another very

important improvement in lighthouse illumination by the introduction of the diop-

tric system of Fresnel in conjunction with the improvements of Arago and Fresnel
on the Argand lamp, by the addition of a second, third, and fourth concentric

wick.

Coal and wood fires, followed by tallow candles and oil, have been referred to

as the early lighthouse illuminants. In 1827 coal gas was introduced at the Troon

Lighthouse, Ayrshire, and in 1847 at the Hartlepool Lighthouse, Durham, the

latter for the first time in combination with a first-order Fresnel apparatus. The
slow progress made with coal gas in lighthouses, except for small harbour lights,

where the gas could be obtained in their vicinity, was chiefly due to the great cost

incurred in the manufacture of so small a qu'antity as that required and at an iso-

lated station. In 1839 experiments were made at the Orford Low Lighthouse,

Suffolk, with the Bude light of the late Mr. Golds-worthy Gumey. This light was
produced hy throwing- oxygen gas into the middle of a flame derived from the
combustion of fatty oils. The flame was of the dimensions of that of the Fresnel
four-wick concentric burner. An increased intensity over that of the flame of the
large oil-burner was obtained, hut it was not found to be sufficient to justify the in-
creased cost incurred. In 1857 a trial was made by the Trinity House, at Black-

wall, under the advice of Faraday, with one of Holmes' direct current magneto-
electric machines for producing the electric arc light for a lighthouse luminary, and
the experiment was found to be so full of promise for the future that a practical
trial was made during the following year.

     At the South Foreland High Lighthouse, on December 8, 1858, the first im-

portant application of the electric arc light, as a rival to oil and gas for coast light-

ing, was made with a pair of Holmes' machines, and thus were steel magnets made
to serve not only, as in the mariner's compass, to guide him on his path, but also
to warn him of danger. In 1859 the experimental trials at the South Foreland
were discontinued, but they were sufficiently encouraging to lead to the permanent

installation of the electric light at Dungeuess Lighthouse in 1862. In 1863 the

electric arc light was adopted by the French lighthouse authorities at Cape La

Heve.

     In 1871, after practical trials with a new alternating current machine of
Holmes, two of such machines were supplied to a new lighthouse on Souter Point,
coast of Durham, and in the following year the electric arc light, with these

machines, was established in both the High and Low Lighthouses at the South

Foreland, where it still shines successfully. The early experience with the electric
light at Dungeness was far from encouraging. Frequent extinctions of the light
occurred from various causes connected with the machinery and apparatus, and the
oil light had, at such times, to be substituted. As no advantage can counterbalance
the want of certainty in signals for the guidance of the mariner, no further step in
the development of the electric light was taken by the Trinity House until the
latter part of 1866, when favourable reports were received from the French light-

house authorities of the worldng of the Alliance Company's sj'stem at the two
lighthouses of Cape La Heve. Complaints were also received from mariners, in
the locality of Dungeness, of the dazzling effect on the eyes when navigating, as
they are there frequently required to do, close inshore, thus being prevented from
rightly judging their distance from this low and dangerous point. Therefore, in
1874, the electric light was removed from Dungeness, and a powerful oil light sub-
stituted. In 1877 the electric arc light was installed at the Lizard Lighthouses

on the south coast of Cornwall, and arrangements are now being made for
establishing it at St. Catherine's Lighthouse, Isle of Wight, and at the High Tower,

-on the Isle of May, Frith of Forth. I have mentioned that the first machines of
Holmes at the South Foreland were direct current, the machines provided by him
for Dungeness being also of the same type. The French lighthouse authorities,

however, adopted for their lighthouses at Cape La Heve the ' Alliance ' Alternating

IJurrent Magneto-Electric Machines, and, in consequence of the less wear and tear
of these machines with greater reliabiUty through their having no commutator,
Holmes was required to supply alternating current machines for Souter Point and
the South Foreland. Those machines have been running at these stations fourteen
years and fifteen years respectively. They have during this period required only
a very trifling amount of repair, and are still in excellent order, but the time must
-soon arrive for replacing them hy more powerful machines.

     In 1876 a series of trials was made by the Ti-inity House at the South Foreland,
with various dynamo-electric machines, for the purpose of ascertaining the then
most suitable machine for adoption at the Lizard. The results were decidedly in
favour of the Siemens direct current machine, and machines of this type were

accordingly installed at the Lizard Station in 1878. In consequence of irregularities
in their working, and because, at the time, Baron de Meritens, of Paris, had per-
fected a very powerfid alternating current machine, it was resolved to send one of
the latter machines to the Ijizard for trial, where it has worked most satisfactorily

for several years. The experience gained at the Lizard suggested that, for the
--790 REPORT 1886.

St. Catherine's Station, wliere it had been resolved to adopt the electric arc light,
the De Meritens machines should be employed, and they were accordingly ordered ;
but, as arrangements were then being made for experiments at the South Foreland
for testing the relative merits of electricity, gas, and oil as lighthouse illuminants,

it was determined that these machines should first be sent there for the experi-
ments. In 1862 a practical trial was made by the Trinity House at the South

Foreland of the Drummond or lime light, but the results were not so satisfactory,

after experience with the electric arc light, as to encourage its adoption. In the

meantime the successful development of the electric arc light for lighthouse illumi-

nation very soon acted as a keen stimulus to inventors of burners for producing gas

and oil luminaries    for the purpose                                                                         in ISGo the attention of lighthouse authorities

was directed to the gas system of Mr. John R. Wigham, of Dublin, which system

was tried in that year by the Commissioners of Irish Lights at the Ilowth Bailey
Lighthouse, near Dublin, and in 1878 he introduced at the Galley Head Lighthouse,
county Cork, his system of superposed gas burners. At this lighthouse four of his

large gas burners and four tiers of first-order annular lenses, eight in each tier, were

adopted. By successive lowering and raising of the gas flame at the focus of each

tier of lenses, he had previously produced the first group flashing distinction. This

light shows, at periods of one minute, from ordinary annular lenses, instead of the
usual long flash, a group of short flashes, varying in number between six and seven.

The uncertainty, however, in the number of flashes contained in each group is found

to be an objection to the optical arrangement here adopted. In the meantime the

attention of the Trinity House, the Commissioners of Northern Lights, and the

French lighthouse authorities was being directed to the question of substituting

mineral oil for colza as a lighthouse illuminant. In 1861 experiments were made

b}" the Trinity House for the purpose of determining the efliciency and economy of

mineral oils in relation to colza for lighthouse illumination ; but, owing to the

imperfectly refined oil then obtainable and its high price, the results were not found

to be so satisfactory as to justify a change from colza oil, at that time generally

used. In 1869 the price of mineral oil, of good Ulumiuating quaUty and safe

flashing point, having been reduced to about one-half the price of colza, the Trinity

House determined to make a further series of experiments, when it was ascertained

that, with a few simple modifications, the existing burners were rendered very

efficient for the purpose, and a change from colza to mineral oil was commenced.

It was found, during these experiments, that the improved combustion effected in

the colza burners, in their adaptation for consimiing mineral oils, had the eSect of

Aincreasing their mean efficiency, when burning colza, 46j per cent.                                          further

advance was made during these experiments by increasing the number of wicks of

the first-order burner from four to six, more than doubling the intensity of the

light, while effecting an improved compactness of the luminary per unit of focal

area of 70 per cent.

With coal fires no distinctive characters were possible beyond the costly ones

of double or triple lighthouses. There are at present not less than 86 distinctive

characters in use throughout the lighthouses and light-vessels of the world and,.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

as their numbers increase, so does the necessity for giving a more clearly distiiictive

character to each light over certain definite ranges of coast. This important ques-

tion of affording to each light complete distinctive individuality is receiving the

attention of lighthouse authorities at home and abroad, and it is hoped that greater
uniformity and consequent benefit to the mariner wUl be the result.

During the old days of sailing vessels, when the duration of voyages was so

uncertain, sound signals, as aids to the mariner, were but little demanded. The

seaman on approaching the coast in fog trusted entirely to his lead, and, when he

found circumstances favourable for doing so, he anchored his vessel until the atmo-

sphere cleared. But, since the application of steam to navigation, with keener com-

petition in trade, these conditions have been entirely changed. The modern steam

vessel is expected to keep time with nearlj^ the same degree of precision as a railway

train, and it is evident that, even with the utmost care and attention on the part of

her commander, this requirement cannot possibly be fulfilled, and collisions and

strandings must occur, unless efficient sound signals for fog be carried by each
                  TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  791

vessel, and powerful signals of this class be provided at lighthouse and light-

vessel stations.

These circumstances have led to a rapid development of fog signals, both ashore

and afloat, there being now about 700 of these signals, of various descriptions, on
Wethe coasts of the world.
                            therefore find, as might naturally have been expected,

that coast fog signals have been made, by lighthouse authoiities, the subject of

careful experiment and scientific research ; but, unfortunately, the practical results

thus far have not been so satisfactory as coidd be desired, owing, 1st, to the very

short range of the most powerful of these signals under occasional unfavourable

conditions of the atmosphere during fog, and, 2nd, to the present want of a reliable test

for enabling the mariner to determine at any time how far the atmospheric condi-

tions are against him in listening for the anxiously expected signal. In 1854 some

experiments on diflerent means of producing sounds for coast fog signals were made

by the engineers of the French hghthouse department, and in 1861-62 MM. Le

Gros and Saint Ange Allard, of the Corps des Fonts et Chaussees, conducted a

series of experiments upon the sound of bells and the various methods of striking

them.

     In 1863-64 a Committee of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House made
some experiments at Dungeness upon various fog signals. In June 1863 a Com-
mittee of the British Association memorialised the then President of the Board of
Trade, with the view of inducing him to institute a series of experiments upon fog
signals. The memorial, after briefly setting forth a statement of the nature and
importance of the subject, described what was then known respecting it, and
several suggestions were made as to the nature of the experiments recommended.
The proposal dees not appear to havebeenfavourably entertained by the authorities

to whom it was referred, and the experiments were not carried out.

     In 1864 a series of experiments was undertaken by a Commission appointed by

the Lighthouse Board of the United States, to determine the relative powers of

Tarious fog signals which were brought to the notice of the Board.
     In 1872 a Committee of the Trinity House visited the United States and

Canada, with the object of ascertaining the actual efficiency of various fog
signals then in operation on the North American continent, about which very

favourable reports had reached this country. Among other instruments, they
witnessed the performance of a siren apparatus, patented by Messrs. A. & F. Brown,
of New York. One of these instruments was, in 1873, very kindly sent to the

Trinity House by the United States authorities, and tested with other instruments

in the experimental trials at the South Foreland in 1873-74. This investigation

was carried out at the South Foreland by the Trinity House, with the object of

obtaining some definite knowledge as to the relative merits of diiferent sound-pro-

ducing instruments, and also of ascertaining how the propagation of sound was

aifected by meteorological phenomena. These experiments were extended over
a lengthened period, in all conditions of weather, and the well-known scientific

and practical results obtained, together with the ascertained relative merits of

sound-producing instruments for the service of the mariner, are of the highest

scientific interest and practical importance.
     The investigation at the South Foreland was followed up by the Trinity House

by further experiments, in which they were assisted by the authorities at Wool-
wich, with guns of various forms, weight of charges, and descriptions of gun-

powder. The powders tested were (1) fine grain, (2) larger grain, (3) rifle
large grain, and (4) pebble. The result placed the powders exactly in the order
above stated ; the fine grain, or most rapidly burning powder, gave indisputably
the loudest sound, while the report of the slowly-burning pebble powder was
the weakest of all. Experiments were also made with the object of ascer-

taining the relative value of the sound produced by the explosion of varying

quantities of gun-cotton. Here again the greater value of increased rapidity of
combustion in producing sound was clearly demonstrated. It was found that

charges of gun cotton yielded reports louder at all ranges than equal charges of
gunpowder, and further experiments proved that the explosion of half-a-pound of gun-

cotton gave a result at least equal to that produced by 3 lbs. of the best gunpowder.
--792 REPORT 1886.

These results led the Trinity House to adopt this explosive as a fog signal for
isolated stations on rocks or shoals where previously, from want of space, nothing

better than a bell could he applied. It is also applied with success to light-vessels.
But, wherever the siren can he installed, it is found to be the most efficient fog

signal yet known, chiefly in consequence of the prolongation that can he given to its
blasts, and the ease with which it can be applied, with any amount of motive power
available, to the production of any desired combination of high and low notes for dis-
tinctions corresponding with those of white and red, or short and long, flashes of
light, and thus affording the required individuality of each station. The experience,

however, with the most ^Dowerful fog signal is not at present to be considered

altogether satisfactory. With siren blasts absorbing about 150 H.P. or nearly

5 millions of foot-pounds per minute during the time they are sounding, the signal
is occasionally not heard, under some conditions of fog and wind, beyond one mile,
while at other times it is distinctly heard above ten mUes.

For marking shoals, channel fairways, and landfalls, in positions where it is

found to be impossible to erect a permanent structure, important service is
rendered to the mariner by light-vessels. The first of these aids to navigation was

moored at the Nore in 1732. ller illuminating apparatus consisted of a small

lantern provided with flat wick oil lamps, the latter unaided by optical

apparatus of any kind. In 1807 the late Mr. Robert Stevenson, the eminent

engineer of the Bell Rock Lighthouse, designed a larger lantern to surround the
mast of the vessel, capable of being lowered down to the deck for trimming the
light, and raised when required to be exhibited. With the introduction of the
catoptric system of illimiination on shore, these lights were improved by the intro-
duction of Argand burners, aided by paraboloidal silvered reflectors, each reflector
and lamp being properly gimbaUed to insure the horizontal direction of the beam

during the pitching and rolling of the vessel.
     In 1872 the Trinity House increased the dimensions of their lanterns and reflec-

tors for floating lights, the lanterns from 6 feet to 8 feet in diameter, with cylindrical
instead of polygonal glazing, and the reflectors from 12 inches to 21 inches aperture,

which improvements effected a tenfold increase in the intensity of these lights.
The present 8-foot cylindrical lanterns are just large enough to admit of the lamp-

lighter entering them to manipidate the lamps. Further improvements have lately
been made in the lamps, and some of these lights have an intensity in the beam of

about 20,000 candles. In 1875 the first group flashing floating light, showing three
successive flashes at periods of one minute, was exhibited from a new vessel

moored at the Royal Sovereign Shoal, oft" Hastings. Since the above date this

class of floating lights, showing two or more flashes in a group, has been consider-
ablv extended with advantage. In connection with this class of distinctive lights,
I V70uld here remark that, in the following year, a 1st Order Dioptric Double Flash-

ing Light Apparatus, designed by Dr. John llopkinson, F.R.S., for the Trinity
House, and intended for the Little Basses Lighthouse, Ceylon, was exhibited at

the Special Loan Exhibition of Scientific Apparatus at South Kensington. In a

few cases the dioptric sj'stem has been adopted for light-vessels ; but, so far, the

catoptric system has been found to be most efficient for the special cu'cumstances

Upof a floating light.  to the present, neither electricity nor gas has been tried as

an illuminant for light-vessels, but an interesting experiment is now being made by

the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, with the electric arc light on board one of

the light-vessels at the entrance to the Mersey.

The difficulties attending the maintenance of an efficient floating light in some

of the most exposed positions are great, and at times the service is a very arduous

one to the men on board, yet any failure whatever is of very rare occurrence, and

there is no instance on record of a British light-vessel having ever been deserted
by her crew during a storm. Collisions, which unfortunately are of frequent

occurrence, are probably the greatest source of danger to these vessels and their

crews.

As it is a necessity that light-vessels remain at their stations with safety and

efficiency as long as possible, usually seven years, they are generally built of wood,
Aor are of composite construction, fastened and sheathed with Muntz metal.
                                                                            few

Tessela have been built of iron, but these are found at the end of one or two years

to require removal from the station, docking, and the external submerged portions

of the hull cleaned and painted.

Chinese gongs about two feet in diameter, sounded at short intervals, have been

for many years the recognised standard fog signal of light-vessels, owing probably

to their peculiar characteristic sound. This signal is undoubtedly distinctive and

serviceable at very short distances, but, like the sound of a bell, is soon dissipated

after leaving the immediate vicinity of the instrument.

Many of the light-vessels of this country and other maritime nations are now

provided with powerful sirens or whistles, sounded by compressed air or steam.

Then" positions (generally at considerable distances from the shore, and in some

instances in fau'way channels, where the sound is radiated on all bearings) are,

from the imcertainty of the range of fog signals, found to be more efficient aids to

navigation than those installed at shore stations.

The question of utilising lighthouses and light-vessels as signal stations in tele-

graphic communication with each other, and connected with a central station for

reporting arrivals, departures, casualties, and meteorological observations, has,

for some time, received the consideration of lighthouse authorities generally, and

among the foremost in this direction as regards lighthouses may be mentioned

Canada, which has a large proportion of them so arranged. In Ireland the experi-

ment is being made at Fastnet, a well-known exposed rock station off Cape Clear,

where considerable difficulties have been experienced in defending the cable from

the enormous wear and tear to which it is subjected at the submerged side of the

rock.

During the past year experiments have been in progress by the Trinity House,

and I believe also by Germany, in the more difficult task of establishing telegraphic

communication between a light-vessel and the shore. Oft" the coast of Essex the

Sunk light-vessel has been so connected with the Post Office at Walton-on-the-

Naze, through nine miles of cable ; and, although many difficulties are being ex-
perienced, and the system must prove costly, ultimate success is expected.

Very important accessories to lighthouses and light-vessels are buoys and

beacons. Besides indicating the navigable channels on the coast, in estuaries, and

in rivers, in positions where the erection of permanent beacons is frequently im-

practicable, they mark the position of rocics and shoals. History appears to be

silent as to the origin of the first buoy. Probably the piece of wood or cork for
buoymg and marking the position of the fisherman's net led to the primitive rude

buoy for marking a dangerous shoal. Buoys built ^\·ith staves of wood, and banded

with wrought iron hoops, have been adopted for probably over a century, and are

still used by all maritime nations ; but they are being rapidly superseded lay buoys

constructed of iron or. steel. In 1845 the first iron buoy was submitted to the

Trinity House by the late Mr. George W. Lenox, and since that date very great

improvements have been effected in the forms and construction of buoys generally,

owing to the ease with wliich any desired forms and dimensions can be produced

Ain iron and steel, as in shipbuilding.  very important improvement was intro-

duced in iron buoys in 1853 by the late Mr. George Herbert, of the Trinity House,

who suggested the raising up and hollowing out the bottom of buoys to about the

level of the plane of flotation, and the attachment of the mooring chain at a point

very near,  but just below,  the centre  of gravity                                                  he  thus secured a more  uniformly
                                                                                                  ;

erect position of the buoy in a seaway and strong tidal current. The Herbert form

of bottom is now generally adopted. Water-tight bulkheads were early employed

Awith iron buoys for ensuring their safety.  modern ii-on or steel buoy may be,

and often is, cut into by the stem of a steam- vessel, or by her screw-propeller, but

is seldom caused to sink, its flotation being maintained by an uninjured water-tight

compartment. The immunity from sinking, under such circumstances, of these

ii'on or steel floating bodies, with their heavy iron mooring chain attached, is

suggestive of an important requirement of the present day, viz., an unsinkable

passenger steam-vessel. In the interests of humanity, no more important question

than this could engage the attention of engineers, and certainly none more deserv-

ing of the best efforts of modern mechanical science. With the rapid increase in
794 EEPOET-- 1886.

the number of buoys throughout the world, it has been found desirable, if such a
result could possibly be accomplished, that something approaching to a universal
system of distinctive individuality in these sea-marks should prevail ; and, in 1883,
a Conference was held at the Trinity House, under the presidency of H.R.H. the
Duke of Edinburgh, K.G., Master of the Corpoi'ation, at which were represented
the Board of Trade, the Commissioners of Scotch Lights, the Commissioners of
Irish Lights, the Admiralty, and the local authorities of the Tyne, Tay, Clyde,
Mersey, Thames, and Humber. The Conference met on several occasions for
deliberation, and for obtaining evidence from witnesses serving in various capacities
in the royal navy, mercantile marine, and lighthouse and pilotage service. Valu-
able information was also obtained from all the principal maritime States. Inas-
much as the need for uniformity of system was found not to be particularly pressing
until the number of buoys had become considerable, its adoption became, by the
same fact, more difficult, owing to the number of changes it would involve. The
first conception of the object to be attained by a buoy was one rather of warning
than of guidance, to indicate the hidden danger rather than to point out the path
of safety. Both these services to navigation are at present very efficiently rendered.

     Originally, one buoy to a shoal was thought sufficient ; by degrees a second and
third was demanded and laid, until each danger became hedged round with buoys
whose names denoted their positions with refei-ence to it. The Committee arrived
at the conclusion that, if practicable, a uniform plan was to be desired, and they
considered its application first in regard to harbours, rivers, and estuaries, and,
secondly, to general coast navigation. As a preliminary, it was found to be necessary
to determine the nomenclature of the various shapes and features common in all
our buoyage services, so that the same thing- should not be called by different
names in different parts of the kingdom, as had previously been the case. The
process of deliberation and inquhy led to the issue, that, with a uniform system, its
fundamental principle must be that one certain shape shall be used for starboard
and another for port invariably. The two forms most convenient for adoption as
contrasting shapes were found to be the ' conical ' and the ' can ' ; and, further,

that middle grounds occurring in a channel, or which may divide two channels,

should have at each end a spherical buoy ; also that outlying dangers or positions
requiring an extraordinary mark should be indicated by pillar or spar buoys. Con-
sidering, first, the application of a system to harbours : if all were approached by
a single deep-water channel, the adoption, 8ay, of ' can ' for starboard and ' conical'
for port, would appear as simple and practicable, but when large estuaries having
four or five channels of approach have to be dealt with, some distinction other than
mere shape is necessary. Important evidence was received by the Committee on
the wider question of coast buoyage in outlying roadsteads, highways of navigation
rather than approaches to any port, where warning is the first necessity, then
guidance, and where the limitations of shape acceptable in the case of harbours
might prove an injurious restriction unless a conspicuous mark in the open sea
were required.

     The primary distinction of form having been determined, the Committee pro-

ceeded to the deliberation of the subordinate or particular distinctions of colour,
surmounting beacons, names, numbers, letters, &c.

     With the uniform system, which is now being rapidly adopted throughout

England, Ireland, and Scotland, an important step has been taken towards identity
of practice throughout the whole maritime world.

     In 1878 the successful illumination of buoys was accomplished by Messrs.
Pintseh, with compressed oil gas, and since then the system has been very
considerably developed in this country and abroad, and thus these important aids to
navigation are being rendered eflicient by night as well as by day, thereby becoming
more perfect accessories to lighthouses and light-vessels. The Pintseh gas buoys
now in use are found to burn continuously for three to six months, according to
size, without any attention. Neither oil nor electricity has yet been successfully

applied to the lighting of buoys, but there now appears to be no reason why elec-

 tricity from storage batteries should not be found efficient for the purpose, at a
 reasonable cost.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  795

      Automatic bell buoys, of various designs, and tbe Courtenay automatic whistling
 buoy are found to render important aid to navigation in fogs, but, unfortunately,,
 none of these apparatus have at present that reliabilitj^ which should be charac-
 teristic of a coast signal, and all such buoys should be used with caution, owing to
 their action being dependent on the motion of the sea surface. The remedy for this
 defect is a problem which has yet to be satisfactorily worked out.

     Until very recently a beacon was known to the mariner as a day signal only.
 Numerous structures, varying in form and dimensions, have for many years

 occupied prominent positions on shore and on rocks and shoals at sea, in all the
 maritime countries of the world, and some of these have been the work of con-

 siderable labour and cost. The iron beacon on the Wolf Rock, off the west
 coast of Cornwall, completed by the Trinity House in 1840, and which in 1870
 was replaced by the present lighthouse, required, before the days of steam tenders,
 five yeai-s to erect, and cost nearly 11,300/. The recent successful lighting of bea-
 cons with automatic apparatus, in occasionally inaccessible positions, by electricity,
 compressed mineral oil gas, and petroleum spirit, forms an important epoch in the
history of lighthouse illumination. In 1884 an iron beacon, lighted by an incan-
descent lamp and the current from a secondary battery, was erected on a tidal rock
near Cadiz. Contact is made and broken by a small clock, which runs for 28
days and causes the light to show a flash of 5 seconds, followed by a total eclipse of
 25 seconds. The clock is also arranged for eclipsing the light between sunrise and
sunset. The apparatus is the invention of Don Isas Lavaden.

      In 1881 a beacon, lighted automatically by compressed oil gas, on the Pintsch

system, was erected in the river Clyde, and many other such structures have been

erected in this country and the United States. In 1881-82 several beacons, lighted
automatically by petroleum spirit on the system of Herr Lindberg and Herr Lyth,
of Stockholm, were established by the Swedish lighthouse authorities, and are
reported to be working efficiently. Last year a beacon lighted on this system,
and another lighted by Pintsch's compressed gas, were erected by the Trinity
House on the banks of the Thames, near Erith, and are found to be very
efficient aids for the navigation of the river by night as well as by day. The

petroleum spirit lamp burns day and night at its maximum intensity, and shows a

white light with a short occultation at periods of five seconds. The occultations
are produced by a screen, rotated around the light by the ascending current of
heated air from the lamp acting on a horizontal fan. As there is no governor,

the periods of occultation are subject to slight errors, but the gas beacon,
which shows a white flashing light at periods of two seconds, is provided
with a clock (specially designed for this beacon), which not only regulates
with precision the flashes and eclipses, but also extinguishes the light a few
minutes before sunrise and re-lights it just before sunset, a very feeble pilot light

being left burning during daylight. Arrangement is made in the clockwork for a
bi-monthly adjustment to meet the lengthening or shortening of daylight. These
two lighted beacons are in the charge of a boatman, who visits them at least
once a week, when he cleans and adjusts the apparatus, and cleans the lantern
glazing. These systems of lighted beacons are not yet sufficiently matured for
forming a decided opinion as to their relative efficiency and economy, but it maybe
considered certain that they will both be extensively adopted, because, in numerous

cases, for the secondary illumination of ports, estuaries, and rivers, automatic
lighted beacons can be installed to meet fairly the local requirements of navigation,
at a fraction of the first cost and annual maintenance of a lighthouse with its
keepers and accessories.

     In 1881 it was considered by the lighthouse authorities of this country that the
time had arrived when it was absolutely necessary that an exhaustive series of
experimental trials should be made, on a practical scale, for the exact determination
of the relative merits (both as regards efficiency and economy) of the three Ught-
bouse iUuminants, electricity, gas, and mineral oil, which, by the process of

natural selection, may be regarded as the fittest of all those at present knowi to
science. After many unforeseen difficulties had been overcome, this question of

universal importance was, in July 1883, referred by the Board of Trade to the
796 EEPORT-- 1886.

Trinity House, who accepted the responsibility of carrying out the investiga-

tion.

   A Committee was formed of members of the Corporation, who secured the

friendly co-operation of the Scotch aod Irish Lii^hthouse Boards, and many dis-

mytinguished scientific men at home and abroad. I had the honour of acting, in

official capacity as Engineer-in-Cliief to the Trinity House, in making the arrange-

ments for exhibiting the experimental lights, and in reporting to the Board from

time to time, as in all other matters referred to me professionally.
     These investigations were carried out in full view of all who were in any way

interested in the subject. The whole arrangements were open to public inspection,

and, in their desire to arrive at a wise and just decision on so important a question,

the Trinity House Committee courted the fullest inquiry. Many members of

scientific societies, especially those connected with engineering, were invited, and

visited the station. The French lighthouse authorities, who rendered much kind

assistance in obtaining observations, sent tlieir representatives to view the arrange-

ments, and ofiicers from the lighthouse services of Germany, Denmark, Norway aud

Sweden, Russia, Italy, Spaiu, Brazil, the United States, and Canada visited the

station and witnessed the experiments.

     In order to obtain, with uniformity and method, a consensus of comparative

--eye-measurements in addition to the measurements of the Committee and their

officers at their different stations ashore and afloat, to those of the coastguard men
at nine stations between Dungeness and the North Foreland, and to the more pre-

--cise scientific measurements of the experts special observation books were prepared

and widely distributed to shipping associations and port authorities, with a view to

their securing the co-operation of masters of vessels, pilots, and others navigating in

the vicinity of the South Foreland.

The South Foreland Station is especially adapted for lighthouse experiments

generally, because of the existing facilities for observations on land and sea. The

land in the neighbourhood has no hedges and few trees, and affords facilities for

observations at distances of between two and three miles. The station is provided

with surplus steam power for driving experimental machines for electric lights, aud

it is easily accessible from Loudon.

Three I'ough timber towers of su^fficient strength to withstand, witliont tremor,

the effects of heavy gales were erected at the rear of the High Lighthouse, 150 feet

Aapart. These towers were marked in large letters A, B, and C.  tower was

Bdevoted to electricity, to the gas system of Mr. Wigham, and C to such gas or

oil lamps as might be proposed to, and approved by, the Committee for trial

Aduring the experiments.  lantern of the usual first-order dimensions, but with

an additional height in the glazing for the passage of beams from superposed optical
apparatus of the first order, was provided for each tower. The optical apparatus

in each lantern was, in the outset, special in relation to the illuminant to be used
for producing fixed and flashing lights. For the electric arc lights, optical apparatus

of the second order of Fresnel was adopted, the apparatus having a focal distance of
700 '"/m. The dimensions of this apparatus are greater than optically required for
the largest electric arc light yet tried for lighthouse illumination, but the internal

capacity is found to be only just sufficient for the perfect manipulation of the light
by a lightkeeper of possibly robust build. For the large gas and oil flames in the

A and C lanterns the apparatus adopted was of the usual first-order size, having a

focal distance of 920 TM/,,.
     The lanterns were partially glazed on opposite sides, north and south, the

southern arc being chiefly for observation from the sea. To the northward the
land is better adapted for observations on shore, and here three observing huts
were erected at the respective distances of 2,144, 6,200, and 12,973 feet ; each hut
was provided with accommodation for two watchers, and a chamber fitted with a
large plate glass window in the direction of the experimental lights, and special
apparatus for their photometric measurement. The third hut proved to be practi-

cally of but little value for photometry, the distance being too great ; it, however,

afibrded an accurately Icnown distance for eye-measurements, and a barrack and

starting-point for watchers endeavouring to determine the vanishing distance of

each light during hazy weather. la this they were further assisted by white

painted posts, placed throughout the whole track to the experimental lighthouses,

at distances of 100 feet apart, the distance of each post from the. lights heincr

plainly marked on it in Mack figures. For the more exact examination and

measurements of the intensity of each luminary and that of the beam from each

optical apparatus, a photometric gallery was erected in a convenient position, 380

feet long by S feet wide, and provided with all the necessary appliances.

During a period of over twelve months the experimental lights were exhibited,

and watched by numerous observers, trained and untrained, scientific and

practical. During that period a vast amount of valuable evidence was collected
                                                                                                 ;
by the aid of which the Committee  were  subsequently enabled to state     their
                                                                                  con-

clusions with definiteness. During these investigations intensities were shown in

a single oil and gas luminary about three times greater than the electric arc

luminary first adopted at Dungeness in 1861, while, with a single electric arc

luminary, there was shown a practically available focal intensity about fifteen

times greater than that of the Dungeness luminary, and the highest yet shown to

be practically available for the service of the mariner.

With gas and oil the highest intensity of a single luminary and optical

apparatus was tripled by the use of three superposed luminaries and optical

apparatus, and although optical arrangements were made for triple electric lumi-

naries, and experiments were carried out with these at comparatively low in-

tensities, it was soon found that all the electro-motive force available at the station

could be conveniently applied with efficiency and permanency in one compact focal

luminary, and its optical apparatus. This fact demonstrated that the electric arc

has the most important requisites of a lighthouse luminary ; viz., maximum
intensity and minimum focal dimensions, and in all states of the atmosphere, from

clear weather to thick fog, an incontestable superiority over the utmost accumu-

--lative efforts of its rivals gas and oil. It was therefore considered to be un-
necessary to incur additional cost for exhibiting the electric arc light, under the

same conditions of accumulative powers as its rivals, for showing a maximum

intensity. "With the best gas and oil luminaries it was found that, where gas of

the ordinary commercial quality is employed, there is no appreciable difference,

either in the intensity or focal compactness of the luminary, but when the richest

gas, from cannel coal, and mineral oil are used, there is found to be a superiority in

the maximum intensity of this luminary over oil of about 45 per cent., and in focal

compactness of about 10 per cent. ; but in haze and fog, when the maximum

intensity only is required, this diflerence was found to effect no appreciable gain in

penetrative power, therefore the question of merit between these illuminants was
found to resolve itself into one of economy only, and in this respect mineral oil at

the present market prices was found to have a considerable advantage.

     The relative penetrability per unit of light of the best gas and oil flames in haze
and fog is so nearly identical that the question is of no practical importance in

lighthouse illumination. But, with regard to the relative atmospheric absorption

of these lights and the electric arc light in certain impaired conditions of the atmo-

sphere, the electric arc light is found to compare somewhat unfavourably. The

general result of the photometric measurements of the three illuminants showed

(1) that the oil and gas lights, when shown through similar lenses, were equally

affected by atmospheric variation; (2) that the electric light is absorbed more
largely by haze and fog than either the oil or the gas light ; and (3) that aU three

are nearly equally affected by rain. Experiments, made in the photometric gallery

at the South Foreland with the electric arc light, have shown that the loss by
atmospheric absorption is by no means so great as was previously supposed. It
would have been most interesting and instructive to have obtained data for exactly

determining the relative coefficients of atmospheric absorption of the electric arc,
gas, and oil luminaries, but the necessary observations and measurements for

effecting this would have prolonged the time too much, and added too much to the

cost of the investigation, especially when it is remembered that with the electric

arc light there is for coast illumination such an enormous preponderance of initial
798 EEPORT-- 18H6.

intensity at disposal that a small percentage of penetrating efficiency is of no prac-

tical importance.

     In 1836 Faraday showed by actual experiment that the penetrating power of a
light in atmosphere impaired by such obstruction as fog, mist, &c., is but very
slightly augmented by a very considerable increase in the intensity, and M. Allard,

late Engineer-in-Chief to the French Lighthouse Board, has more recently shown,

after long experimental and practical research, that, in an atmosphere of average

transparency, a beam of hght equal to 6,250 bees (Carcel) would penetrate
53 kilometres, yet when augmented to twenty times that intensity, or 125,000 bees
(Carcel), it would only penetrate 7,540 kilometres ; showing that, in the average

condition of atmospheric transparency, 2,000 per cent, of increased intensity only

gives 42 per cent, longer range.
     The South Foreland experiments have demonstrated that, while with both gas

and oil an ordinary intensity of light can be adopted for clear weather sufficient to

reach the sea horizon with efficiency for the mariner, a maximum light can be shown

with impaired atmosphere fifteen to twenty times this intensity, and that in these

respects both illuminauts are practically on an equality. This maximum light of

gas and oil is considered by the Committee to be sufficient for all the ordinary pur-

poses of navigation, and, for this, mineral oil is the most economical illuminant

but for some special cases, where the utmost intensity and penetration are demanded,

these results can only be attained by electricity, and by this agent an intensity more

than ten times that of the maximum of either oil or gas is found to be practically

available.

With regard to the gas and oil lights, the report of the Committee states that

' It appears from the direct eye observations, made at distances varying from 3 to

27 miles in clear weather, that through annular lenses, light for light, there is

practically no difference. Both reach the horizon with equal effect. In weather

not clear the records indicate practically the same relation. In actual fog, again,

the records indicate a general equality of the lights. Both are lost at the same

time, both are picked up together: and although here and there a very slight

superiority is attributed to the gas, this superiority is of no value whatever for the

Apvu'poses of the mariner.'  point referred to in favour of gas is the well-known

one of greater handiness and ease of manipulation than oil, which is of importance

for small beacon lights, where a constant attendant is not provided ; but this does
not apply to a coast light, where a light-keeper is always required to be on the

watch in the lantern from sunset to sunrise. With oil the great advantage, in

addition to economy, lies in the simplicity of its application to a coast light-

house in any part of the world, however limited the space the hghthouse

is necessarily required to occupy. The final conclusion of the Committee on the

--relative merits of electricity, gas, and oil as lighthouse illuminants is given in the

following words : ' That, for ordinary necessities of lighthouse illumination,

mineral oil is the most suitable and economical illuminant, and that for salient

headlands, important landfalls, and places where a very powerful hght is required,

electricity offers the greatest advantages.'

    In conclusion it may safely be asserted, now that the relative merits of electri-

city, gas, and oil have been accurately determined, that these investigations of the

Trinity House Committee will, for many years to come, furnish to the lighthouse

authorities of all maritime nations of the world, and their engineers, very valuable
data which cannot fail to assist very largely in the development of lighthouse illu-
mination, and thus tend very materially to the present aids to navigation, and to a
consequent reduction in the loss of life and property at sea.

                      2. Louisville and New Albany Bridge.
                         By T. C. Clakke and C. Macdonald.

   The paper confined itself mainly to a consideration of novel features in the super-

structure of this cantilever bridge recently built by the Union Bridge Co. of New

York over the Ohio River.
     The structure consists of two main cantilever spans, 480 ft. and 483 ft. long

respectively, from centres of piers, joined by a continuous span of 360 ft., two

anchor spans of 260 ft. each, a swinging span 370 ft., and a fixed span at the New

Albany end 240 ft. long, making a total length of 2,453 ft. between centres of
abutment cylinders.

     After describing a number of accompanying photographs, mention was made of
the fact that, in consequence of the current in what is known as the ' Canal Chan-
nel ' which passes under the 483 ft. span being at an angle of 60° to the axis of the
bridge, it was thought necessary to construct skew piers for this span, with their
faces parallel to the direction of current, the details being thereby much com-

plicated.

     Normally all river traffic passes under this span, but at high water the 480 foot
span is use4.

     The several dimensions of the bridge, total width of which is 49 feet, were then
given. Open hearth steel was employed in its construction, and, for compression
members, sample bars f in. in diameter were required to show an elastic limit of
not less than 50,000 lbs. per sq. in., an ultimate strength of 80,000 lbs., elongation
of 15 per cent, in 8 inches, and reduction of area at point of fracture of 35 per
cent. The carbon ranged from 0-34 to 0'42 per cent., and phosphorus was under
O'lOO. Full-sized bars were allowed an elastic limit of 35,000 lbs., and ultimate
strength of 65,000 lbs. The wrought iron plates had an elastic limit for standard

sample bar of 24,000 lbs., ultimate strength of 47,000 lbs., elongation of 10 per
cent., and reduction of area of 15 per cent.

     The structure is designed to carry 1,200 lbs. per foot on the roadway and side-

--walks as well as the following load on the railway a train weighing 2,240 lbs.

per foot drawn by two locomotives and tenders, weighing 356,000 lbs, together.
Wind strains resist a force at right angles to the axis of 450 lbs. per foot of span on
lower lateral system, and 150 lbs. on the upper.

     In connection with the work of erection it was pointed out that the Ohio River is
subject to extraordinary floods, when quantities of ice and drift are carried down by a
current of more than six miles per hour. On one occasion during erection the river
rose 57 feet in six days, and frequently to a height of 25 or 35 feet.

     The work was commenced in the spring of 1885, and after a satisfactory series
of tests had been made in June last the bridge was thrown open to the public.

     The total weight of metal in the bridge is 6,000,000 lbs., or at the rate of

1'09 tons, or 2,446 lbs., per lineal foot.

3. Freezing as an Aid to the Sinking of Foundations. By 0. Reichenbach.

After referring to the extended use that has been advantageously made of

caissons as a means of founding the supports of bridges at great depths, especially

in India over the Sutlej and Ganges, the author referred to the difficulties experienced

when, adopting this method, obstructions or boulders are met with far below the

surface, or where the piers are finally founded on rock of an imeven surface.

Whereas piers have been founded at depths of 140 feet below water-level by this

method, the pneumatic method, to which preference was given in the case of the

St. Louis Bridge over the Mississippi, is limited in its application to depths of

about 120 feet. An instance of well-sinking in 1862 by freezing the ground was

Amentioned.  method of sinking foundations was patented by Mr. F. Poetsch in

1883. It consists in freezing the water contained in the siuTounding groimd, and

thus providing a watertight lining, which enables the necessary excavations to be
--800 REPORT 1886.

carried out without difBcuIty. The author proceeded to give au account of the
manner iu which the process is carried out, by passing a freezing liquid down
numerous bore-holes surrounding the ground to be excavated. After the freezing
has been effected, the excavations are commenced and secured in the ordinary

manner.
      Several shafts through water-bearing strata, extending to a depth as great as

76 metres (250 feet), are enumerated as having been sunk in this manner ; the cold
is usually obtained by means of a Kroppfs (Carr(5) ammonia machine. The system
is readily applicable in bridge-construction, and will at times obviate the necessity
of using very large spans.

     After discussing many practical points in regard to the application of the

system, the author considered the question of cost, and gave a mathematical inves-
tigation of the cooling effect and time required for the operation, &c. Calculation
shows that, to take an imaginary case, the freezing of the ground to sink a pier
60 metres below water-level, and 40 metres below the river-bed, and having a base
18 by 8 metres, would occupy 2,250 hours and require a cooling effect equivalent
to 2,230 cubic metres (or tons approximately) of ice. About 2,900 cubic metres of
ground would be frozen in the operation, the wall attaining a mean thickness of
2 metres.

                  4. On the Laffitie Process of Welding Metals.
                         By William Anderson, M.Inst.G.E.

     The author pointed out that in order to make a sound weld it is necessary that
the surface of iron be free from oxide, and that the usual mode of approximating to

--this condition is to heat to the ' welding ' heat about 2,800° F. Such a high

temperature, however, impairs the quality of iron and, to a far greater extent, of

steel. Many qualities of steel cannot be welded.

      In order to overcome these difficulties, powders, with borax as a basis, are
generally employed.

     With a view to overcome the difficulties experienced in spreading these
powders evenly over surfaces, often irregular and of considerable extent,
M, Laffitte has invented plates, usually consisting of very pliable wire gauze, on
both sides of which the flux, being vitrifipd, is evenly spread. Paper may also be

used as a support, and in the case of small surfaces it is often sufficient to form a
sheet of the flux and metal filings agglomerated together.

      After describing the method of preparing these plates and various modes of
applying them, the author mentioned that they have a very extensive use in France
for all branches of metal work, including fancy iron-work, and in the arsenals,
gun factories, and on the railways, &c.

     Tables were given showing the satisfactory results of severe tests made both in
this country and on the Continent.

                                             John 'Head, F.G.8.

     The author first referred to the simple furnaces formerly used in the manufacture
of glass and iron, to the special facilities of Birmingham in the possession of clay
beds, iron and coal mines, as a manufacturing centre, and to the surrounding dis-

                        * Published in extenso in Industrieg, September 1886.

trict bein^ known as the Black Country, on account of the wasteful manner in
which fuel was burnt. Of the many forms of furnace employed attention is mainly
drawn to those of the reverberatory class, and figures illustrating the old forms

used for melting, puddling, and re-heating iron and steel, and for the production
of glass, were given.

     The Rev. E.. Stirling was mentioned as having originated, in 1817, the idea of a

regenerative furnace when describing his regenerative caloric engine. He was

followed by Mr. J. Slater in 1837, and by Mr. R. Laming in 1847, the former two
employing solid coal and the latter gas made from coke. Mr. F. Siemens's in-

vention, in 1856, differed from the suggestions previously made in the novel

principle of heating both gas and air previous to combustion in the furnace, an
arrangement that had never before been adopted or even proposed. Another

feature introduced by the late Sir William and Mr. F. Siemens was the employ-
ment of a separate gas producer.

   A reference was next made to the calorific power of carbon and carbonic oxide

respectively, showing a loss of 30 per cent, by the employment of the latter, and
to the composition of gases made in a gas producer, from which the author deduced

the necessity for the use of gas regenerators in gas furnaces when economy and
maximum temperature are desired.

    The various types of the Siemens gas producers were next described and illustrated.
In the earlier forms the gas evolved by distillation of coal passes at once through

cooling tubes to the furnace ; in the later forms the gas passes through heated chan-

nels, and is thereby rendered more permanent than before. One of these arrange-

ments, moreover, may be modified, if desired, for the extraction of tar and ammonia

from the hydrocarbons, which are for that purpose treated separately from the

other gases leaving the gas producer.

     The old form of regenerative gas furnace was illustrated and described ; it was
so arranged that the flame came into intimate contact with the materials on the

bed of the heating chamber.

     Before proceeding to a description of Mr. F. Siemens's radiation furnace, the
method of making steel on the open hearth and glass-melting are described. The
furnace being at steel-melting temperature, pig iron and scrap steel are charged,

and, when melted, iron ore is added in small quantities until the metal boils, or,

hi other words, the ore reacts chemically upon the pig metal, some gases being
thereby liberated. Afterwards it is tested for carbon, and when in a fit condition
it is tapped, spiegel-eisen or heated fen-o-manganese being added in small pieces
while it is being run into the ladle.

     Sand, lime, and alkalies, well mixed and pulverised, are employed in various

proportions in the manufacture of glass. The ' batch,' as it is called, is melted in

pots or tanks, fresh batch being added as required ; a large proportion of gaseous

matter is contained in the batch, which is liberated from the metal when 'fining'
takes place, or when the metal is fused without contact of flame.

     The continuous method of making glass invented by Mr. F. Siemens was described
and illustrated. It allows of batch being charged and glass gathered simul-

taneously, the gathering being effected by means of floating vessels, containing two
compartments, in the first of which the glass raised from the lower part of the
mass becomes heated, and, increasing in density, sinks to the bottom and enters the
second, from which it is gathered.

     The author, having observed that more or less ' seedy boil ' (or gaseous blow-
holes) were found in glass gathered at difl'erent gathering holes in a semicircular
furnace, showed the plan of the furnace to Mr. F. Siemens, who at once inferred

that the * seedy boil ' was due to the flame striking the ' metal.' He made experi-

ments with a view to removing the defect, and eventually brought out his radia-
tion furnace, described by him at the Chester meeting of the Iron and Steel

Institute in 1884.

Id this furnace the gas and air ports open at some distance above the materials

to be treated, so that the flame does not come into contact with them or with the

walls or roof of the furnace. In this way there is free development of the flame,

resulting in great economy of fuel, an increased life of the furnace, improvement of
                                   ^

the product, and a diminished loss of material. The author also referred to the im-
portance of this mode of applying heat as preventing blow-holes in steel and ' seedy-
toil' in glass manufacture ; a subject which he treated in detail in his paper before

the Iron and Steel Institute in May last.

2. On American and English Railways in reference to Couplings, Buffers, and
      Gauge, ivith a suggested Improvement in Couplings. By William P.

       Marshall, M.Inst.C.E.

     The railways of North America are of particular interest on account of their
Tery great extent, amounting to nearly one half of the total railway mileage of the
world. Their standard gauge is the same as in England, but there were formerly
five other gauges in extensive use in North America, three of them larger than the
standard, 5 ft., 5 ft. 6 in., and 6 ft., and two smaller, 3 ft. 6 in. and 3 ft.

     In England two other gauges laesides the standard 4 ft. 8^ in. were formerly in
use, namely, 5 ft. and 7 ft., but the necessities of traffic, requiring through transit
for passengers and goods without change of vehicle, have gradually led to the

standard gauge being adopted all over the country (excepting a short length of

7 ft. gauge still remaining unaltered) ; and as much as 2,300 miles of railway have
accordingly been altered in gauge in this country for this purpose. The same ex-

perience has been gone through in America, but on a very greatly increased scale,

about 20,000 miles of railway having been altered at different times to the standard

Agauge ; which is an amount as great as the total railway mileage of this country.

very remarkable case was that of the Southern States railways, which were origin-
ally all made 5 ft. gauge for the purpose of causing a break of gauge at the frontier
of the Slave States ; and the whole of these, amounting to 13,000 miles length, were
altered simultaneously to the standard gauge on June 1st of the present year, the
work of change having been in preparation for some years previously.

     The standard gauge has now become so far universal as to include about 80 per

cent, of all the railways of the world, the exceptions being about

6 per cent, of 5 ft. 6 in. gauge in Spain, India, and part of South America.

                            with some smaller amounts of other exceptional gauges.

     The present general adoption of the standard gauge has been brought about
simply from commercial reasons, and from the traffic objections experienced with
break of gauge ; but it has also to be noticed that this gauge, 4 ft. 8^ in., has the
advantao'e of being applicable both to the cases of main lines with first-class traffic,
and of light lines with inferior traffic or mountain character of line. Where, as in the
case of India, a wider gauge has been adopted for the main lines, it has been found
ultimately requisite to supplement this with a narrow gauge for the lines with in-
ferior traffic, thus involving the serious evil of break of gauge ; and the alternative
view is strongly forced into consideration, that, if the standard gauge had been
originally adhered to, it would have answered for both sets of lines, as the ' happy

medium ' for universal application.

     In Australia, a country as large as the United States, there is a still worse case

of break of gauge ; one colony having the standard gauge, another 5 ft. 3 in. gauge,
and the others 3 ft. 6 in. gauge ; and the American experience forcibly suggests

that the ultimate bringing of the whole to uniform gauge may be only a question of
time. At aU events, the striking fact stands that in America there has been
already altered in gauge, for the purpose of obtaining uniformity, nearly as much as

the whole present railway mileage of Australia and India added together.

     In reference to buff'ers, on the American railways the striking difference is seen

of single centre-buffers universally used, instead of the double side-buffers of this

country and the Continent ; and this is a point that calls for special consideration,

because although centre-buffers are so unfamiliar in this country, they are really in

the majority, as regards the length of railways upon which they are used, which

include North America, great part of South America, Australia, and part of India.

The double side-buffers of this country are intended to transmit the shocks of

buffing to  the  side sole-bars of  the underframes                                                                   but in practice,                          on account of the
                                                                                                                   ;

frequent curves on the railways, the shocks of buffing are received mainly upon

one corner only of the frame, with a tendency to strain the frame ; with centre-

bufiers, however, the shock is always received at the same point of the frame,

whether on a straight line or a curve. Any steadying action to the carriage in

running derived from the contact of buffers at both sides, is also materially inter-

fered with by the   difference in pressure of  the two buffers when upon curves                                                                                                                                    but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

with centre-buffers the hold of the buffer-faces for steadying action is continuous
Aand independent of curves.
                                    very important advantage in working is gained with

centre-buffers, in the open and safe access to the couplings that is afforded, thus

getting completely free from the obstruction of side-buffers which is so serious a

source of accident  to  the  men  in  the  present  English                                                           system                               and  this  point  is                                    now
                                                                                                                                                        ;

made of still greater importance by the extensive use of continuous brakes, which

require the coupling of brake air-pipes in the centre, in addition to the draw-bar

couplings.

     In the English carriage couplings there is not any provision against the tele-
scoping of the carriages in a collision, which is the great source of inj ury in train

collisions, the coupling being flexible vertically as well as horizontally ; but the
American carriage coupling most extensively used is rigid vertically, preventing

displacement beyond a limited range, and it forms a provision for preventing one

frame mounting upon the next one in a collision, and the consequent telescoping of

the carriage bodies ; this coupling has a strong metal bar projecting from the end

of each carriage frame under the next carriage, which must be broken away before

either carriage can mount. This coupling is automatic, and is worked by bumping

the carriages together ; the coupling jaws are wedged apart horizontally by the

striking together of the projecting tapered ends, and then engage together by

springing back to the central position. There is, however, no means of tightening

up this coupling beyond the original compression of the buffers in bumping up ; and
although the carriages are usually held very steady in running, it happens not

unfrequently, with the extra stretch of the draw-springs in a heavy train, that the

buffer-faces get slack or even separated, allowing a side oscillation of the carriages,

which cannot be checked, and which is a serious defect in this coupling. The

very severe bumping blow that is required with this coupling is also particularly

objectionable to the passengers.

The American wagon couplings are made by a link with a drop-pin, the link

passiT> · through an opening in the centre of each buffer-head, and the link is long

enough to allow the required amount of slack between the buffers; the buffers
are made with a combined buffing- and draw-spring. The great defect in these
American couplings is that the carriage and the wagon couplings, instead of

being completely interchangeable, as in English practice, are so entirely different

that the coupling of a carriage to a wagon is only effected by an unsatisfactory

make-shift; the projecting end of the carriage coupling-bar has a slot and pin-
hole for attaching the wagon coupling link, but the only buffing provision then left

is the pointed end of the carriage coupling-bar striking against the curved wagon

buffer-face, the carriage buffer being at a different level above.

The English screw-couplLng seems the most efRcient means of tightening up the

couplings of carriages, as it provides for giving an equally tight coupling with
variations in the length between the carriages ; but this efficiency only lasts complete

whilst the train is standing, and in running it is seriously impaired by the stretch-

ing of the draw-springs, which is often so great in the forward portion of a heavy

Atrain as to leave the buffer-faces quite slack or separated.                                                                                                   perfect coupling

requires to be quite independent of the pull, and to retain its original tightness under

all circumstances ; and this is only practicable with a solid coupling having no draw-

Nowspring.  the present carriage draw-springs have really but little action in easing

                                                                                                                                                                      3F 2

the starting of a train, beinor screwed up so tight that the whole train is started
practically"simultaneously ; but with goods trains the case is different, the weight

there to be started is so iinuch greater that slack couplings are required in order to
enable the engine to start the train in successive portions, and then draw-springs

are requisite for easing the snatch upon each slack coupling-chain. The use of

carriages without draw-springs and with centre-buffers has been already effected
in this country, having been introduced on the Brighton line, and been worked

satisfactorily there for many years on suburban trains that are not required to

couple with ordinary carriages.
      Automatic couplings of different kinds with centre-buffers are used in several

countries, and various modifications of what is known as the ' Norwegian hook *
are extensively used, in which the coupling-hook moves vertically, instead of
horizontally as in the American carriage coupling, and on bumping the vehicles
together the hook rises, and falls again into place by its weight. These couplings
have, however, the defect of not ha\ang any means of tightening up to steady the-
carriage against side oscillation ; and this objection has been met by introducing a
cam movement on a tightening lever, and by a screw to tighten up the pin upon
which the hook catches ; but these plans involve the objection of not being in dupli-

cate at the two ends of the carriages to allow of coupling indiscriminately.
      Automatic coupling, although at first naturally appearing the most correct

system, is found to involve in practice the sacrifice of other points that are of im-
portance ; and it has to be borne in mind that the desire for automatic couplings
has arisen in this country mainly from the existence of the side-buffers and the
dangerous obstruction that they cause in the access to the couplings. It becomes
then a question for consideration whether an automatic coupling is really required,
or whether a satisfactory solution of the question can be obtained by other means

and with the view of aiding in this matter the following suggestion is now offered for

an improved coupling :
      In the proposed carriage coupling a screw-coupling is used as at present, but is-

attached to a rigid draw-hook on each carriage without any draw-spring, and
placed just below the centre-buffers. The buffer-heads are coupled together by a
link with drop-pin, in the centre of each buffer-face (as in the American wagons) ;

and this link, which is of a strong square section, prevents either buffer rising
beyond the limit allowed for variation in height of the carriage frames, and pre-
vents any mounting of one frame upon the other, and telescoping of the carriages.
 In the act of coupling up, the screw-coupling is first hitched on to the draw-hook
as usual and screwed up, and the buffer-link is then coupled, and takes the place

of the present safety-chains.

      In the proposed wagon coupling the coupling-chain is hitched on to a draw-
hook as at present on running the wagons together ; but this draw-hook is rigid
 without any draw-spring, and takes the place of the present safety-chain. The
 centre-buffers above this coupling-chain are then coupled by a link with drop-pin

 as in the carriages, only this link is made long enough to allow the required extent
 of slack between the buffer-faces ; the buffers are made with a combined buffing
 and draw-spring as in the American wagons. In the proposed arrangement both
 for carriao'es and wagons, the two ends of each vehicle are kept duplicates, as in
 the present English practice, so that either end of any carriage can be coupled to

 either end of any other carriage or wagon.

      In conclusion, it was suggested that the objects to be aimed at in the couplings

 and buffers of railway vehicles, are
       Central position for all connections between the vehicles.

       Prevention of telescoping by having a rigid connection vertically.
      Exact correspondence between carriages and wagons for mixed coupling.

       Duplication of both ends of the vehicles in the couplings.

      Avoidance of the shock of bumping carriages together for coupling.
       Second safety coupling besides the main coupling for all vehicles.
      It was suggested that these objects can be best obtained by a combination of
 the English and the American systems, selecting for this purpose the best points of
 each ; this has been attempted in the plan here proposed, which can be applied as

an addition to the present English stock, and worked in combination with the
present couplings and buffers.

      3. Hydraulic Attachment to Sugar Mills} By Duncan Stewart.

     The object of this paper was to explain the application of hydraulic pressure to
the rollers of sugar-cane crushing mills and their connection with a loaded accu-
mulator giving the power to the planter or his manager to regulate the crushing of
the canes to a pressure which will be known to him or them. In this arrangen^nt
the percentage of juice can be extracted equal on all the canes passing through the
mill, whether the feeding be regular or not.

     It will also act as a safety-valve on the working of the engine, gearing, and mill,
and will not only allow the engineer to proportion the various parts of the plant to
certain strains, but to scheme mechanical arrangements for feeding the mill which
have hitherto been done by manual labour.

     It will crush with such regularity that the megass may be used as fuel at once.
The saving in money, besides the freedom from liability to breakage, has been
reckoned at 20s. per ton of sugar made, and it is now at work in more than fifty

sugar estates and factories.

4. Forced Draught. By J. R. Fotheegill.

     Forced draught, or mechanically supplying air above atmospheric pressure to

the furnaces of steam boilers, has been the subject of many patents during the last
fifty_ years, but it is only within the last two or three years, particularly in its

application to merchant steamers, that practical success has been achieved.
     The writer views the 'closed ash-pit' system as the best for merchant

steamers.

     After reviewing the chemical composition of average British steam coal and the
oxygen required for the chemical combustion of its consumable constituents, the wi-iter
gave the quantity of air required at 62° Fahr. for 1 lb. of coal as follows :

For the volatilised gases   50 cubic feet.
For the fixed carbon        90

or a total of 140 cubic feet, equal to 10-7 lbs.

      In actual practice 22 to 24 lbs. of air are required, but with forced draught
judiciously applied 16 to 18 lbs. prove sufficient ; therefore the reduction of furnace
temperature and loss of heat carried away by the use of 24 lbs. of air are avoided
and a saving effected in proportion.

     By the use of forced draught we are enabled to regidate the distribution of the
air at will andby supplying the requisite quantities to the gases and fixed carbon
we readily bring about the chemical union of tl:e oxygen vfith the carbon to

produce carbonic acid, giving 14,500 heat units, instead of only 4,400 by the
 formation of carbonic oxide.

     The writer then proceeded to show in what manner and how the air supply should

take place, pointing out the defects and difficulties in the regulation and distribution

 of air to the furnace under the ordinary conditions of natural draught.
      In September 1884 the writer applied forced draught to the boiler of the s.s.

Marmora, which steamer ran eleven consecutive voyages of sixteen days' steaming per
-voyage before she was wrecked, with a saving per voyage of 33/. 16s. 7d., equal to
43 per cent, in the cost of the bunker coals, as compared with eleven voyages prior

-to the alteration.

     Drawings in plan and section illustrating the arrangement fitted to the Marmora
were shown and a general description given of the arrangement, indicating par-

ticulars as to the air admission and distribution, water-gauge pressure, grate area,
.and the necessitj'- of a damper in the funnel, &c.

supplied to the furnace unquestionably is a distinct saving, but tbe writer is of the

opinion the cost of fitting an arrangement for such purpose when altering a boiler

to forced draught will exceed the saving gained. When new boilers are supplied

the increased cost will, however, probably be only small.

     The application of forced draught to the Marmora proved so economical that
it was decided when ordering the s.s. Stella, a steamer of 3,800 tons, having triple
expansion engines, to apply forced draught to the boilers, which are subject to a

pressure of 143 lbs.

    Messrs. Wyllie & Morison's patent system was applied and the results have

proved most successful.

    The writer believes the Mannora was the first instance in which forced draught
on the ' closed ash-pit ' system was applied to a boiler which had been for some
time in use under the ordinary conditions of natural draught, and ran the same for

eleven consecutive voyages with considerable success, and he likewise believes the
Stella is the first instance of a triple expansion engine having the boilers fitted with

forced draughts.

            5. The Domestic Motor. By Henry Dayet, M.Inst.C.E.

     The Domestic Motor is really a steam engine working with negative pressure
only, and therefore explosion is impossible. It is automatic in all its functions,

and may therefore be left without an attendant for a considerable length of time.

   --There are two forms of the motor one in which the engine and boiler are

on one casting, the other in which the boiler is separate and made to contain from
six to eight hours' supply of coke. This latter form has been specially designed

for electric lighting purposes.

     The engine part of the motor consists of a cylinder, piston and slide valve,
similar to those of an ordinary steam engine.

     The exhaust from the cylinder is discharged into a surface condenser consisting
of a series of wrought-iron tubes. The condensed steam and air from the surface
condenser are withdrawn by means of an extremely simple form of air-pump,
discharging into a small water pocket, from which the water again enters the
boiler, so that the water used for raising steam is used over and over again, thereby

preventing a deposit in the boiler.

     Any waste arising from leakage is automatically supplied from the condenser.

      All the functions of the motor are automatic, except the firing, and the fire
in the separate boiler type only requires attention once in from six to eight hours.
The fuel used is gas coke. It has been found by careful experiments with the
motor that the consumption of coke is from 6 to 7 lbs. per brake horse-power per

hour in the self-contained type, and very much less in the separate boiler type.

In general construction it is very similar to the boiler sometimes used for heating
conservatories. The boiler contains a large vertical column of coke, which burns

at the bottom, the coke above falling down by its own weight. As the bottom

portion is burnt away, the weight of the column crushes the ashes through the
spaces between the fire-bars, and the combustion 13 thereby maintained con-
tinuous. The column of coke is made sufficiently large and sufficiently high to
keep up a constant rate of combustion for, say, six or eight hours.

      It will be interesting here to notice that the total efficiency of the heating

surface of the boiler is greater with this mode of firing than with any other.
It has generally been well known that the fire-box of a locomotive boiler
does by far the greater portion of the work in raising steam. The boiler under

notice has no heating surface, except that of the fire-box, but the fire-box is so
constructed that a great portion of the heat of the spent gases is trapped by the
green fuel which is approaching the condition of combustion in the fire-box. So
completely is the waste heat utilised that it is possible to put one's hand into the

top of the boiler and take out lumps of coke, even when the coke is nearly half
way down in the fuel space.

     The author has not had time to make careful quantitative experiments as to the
value of the heating surface and the economy of this kind of boiler, but he is con-
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  807

Tinced from general observation that it is far more efficient and economical than the
ordinary form. One great reason lies in the fact that the heat is all imparted to
the boiler surfaces by direct contact of solid fuel, or radiated from the solid fuel
which is almost touching the plates. It is the author's intention to carry out
careful experiments with this form of boiler.

           6. The Compound Steavi Engine.^ By J. Richaedson.

     After a brief introduction defining what is meant by a compound engine, and
stating how the economy of one kind over another should be measured, the paper
dealt with the various steps in the development of the steam engine so far as
steam economy is concerned, and traced its progress up to the present date, giving
illustrations of engines using low pressures non-expansively and expansively, high
pressures non-expansively and expansively, and showing the use and value of the
steam jacket and separate condenser. It was stated that though there is no
theoretical limit to the economy to be obtained by extremely high degrees of
expansion, yet there are practical limits which are soon reached for non-condensing
engines. In these the steam must not be expanded below the atmospheric pressure,
or back pressure and waste of power is the result. To prevent this a very high
initial pressure must be used, and as with 140 lbs. boiler pressure, or 155 lbs.
absolute, steam expanded ten times leaves only half a pound pressure in the
exhaust, this is fixed upon as practically the most useful degree in non-condensing

engines.

   --Reference was made to the use of steam at much higher pressures 500 lbs. and
--upwards and used in three or more cylinders yet the difficulties attending the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

production of steam at these high pressures and temperatures and the maintenance
of the working parts of the steam cylinders are stated to be such as more than
counterbalance the advantages to be obtained from their use.

     It could be shown that expansion could be carried to such an extent that
while the efficiency of the steam, considered merely as steam, would continue to
be increased, a point would be reached at which it would be barely able to move
the piston it was intended to propel, and when, therefore, the engine in which it
worked would be practically useless.

   A comparison was instituted between the single cylinder expansive engine

and the various classes of compound, namely, those which have the. low-pressure
cylinder parallel with the high as in the Woolf engine, on the same centre line as
in the tandem, and those with cranks at right angles, tlie advantages and dis-
advantages of each type being pointed out. The proportions to be maintained
between the two cylinders were next considered, and the advantage of the inter-
mediate receiver and heater were referred to ; the advantage of expansion gear
to the low-pressure cylinder, not merely for the purpose of securing greater
economy, but also for the sake of securing uniform distribution of the load be-
tween the two cylinders, was pointed out. Illustrations and diagrams of the earlier
types of engines were given, and indicator diagrams .showing different methods of
distributing steam, together with large diagrams showing modern tandem com-
pound horizontal engine, coupled compound horizontal, and coupled compound
with locomotive boiler combined, as well as details of the valve gear of each, and
the method of automatically regulating the supply of steam.

    The compound engine as now constructed is claimed to be the most perfect

form of steam motor, comparatively small engines under 100 H.P., and without
condensation, giving a horse power for somewhat under 20 lbs. of steam per hour,
while large engines when fitted with condensers have been shown to use no more
than 12 lbs. of steam per horse-power per hour ; at the same time the construction
of compound engines has been so simplified that they have no more parts, and are
no more difficult to manage, than ordinary double-cylinder high-pressure engines.

7. On a New High-speed Steam or Hydraulic Engine. By Arthur Rigq.

     This paper described a new construction of high-speed engine, differing fi-om all

of the rotary types, inasmuch as it employs cylinders and pistons of ordinary con-

struction. These cyHnders are all arranged to revolve in the front of a fly-wheel,

which is overhung on its bearings, much like the face-plate of a lathe. The

pistons are connected to crank-pins projecting from the face of this fly-wheel, and

the cylinders revolve round one centre, while the pistons revolve round a different

centre, which is that of the fly-wheel. These centres, being in parallel lines and

apart from each other, have a certain eccentricity, corresponding with half the

stroke of cylinders and pistons.

    The original crude idea of a revolving engine may be traced as far back as

1815, but little attention seems to have been given to its value, when developed

into a workable engine. After discussing the insuperable difficulties against the

attainment of very liigh speeds in ordinary engines, because of the reciprocations

of their moving parts, and after showing how these difficulties are more masked
than removed in three-cylinder engines of the triangular type, it is shown how

the new revolving engine evades these difficulties altogether.

     This is accomplished by a velocity being continuous in one direction, for the

cjlinders aud pistons partake of a continuous revolution, each round its own

centre : and the reciprocations are relative as between themselves, not absolute in

relation to the earth.

     In this construction a perfect statical balance is provided at first, and this

becomes an equally perfect balance from a dynamical point of view ; and, as a

consequence, this engine requires no more foundation than suffices to carry its own

weight, and it maj' be fixed upon upper floors, running even at very high speeds,

when so required, without shock or perceptible vibration.

     But economy in the production of power is a matter of prime necessity, and it was
shovsTi how easily this engine may be controlled by an automatic variable expan-
sion governor, and how it may be driven by very high-pressure steam expanding in

one or more cylinders successively.

     But it is when arranged as a hydraulic engine that this type of construction

possesses advantages even more conspicuous than those already described ; for, be-
sides being able to run much faster than has hitherto been considered possible, it is

the only engine hitherto invented which can be governed at a regular speed,

using only that amount of water which is required to produce the power given

out. Hydraulic engines, it is well known, consume just as much water per

revolution whether running empty or doing their full work, and it has long been

a desideratum to discover a water motor that can run smoothly, and be governed

in an economical manner.

     Governing an inelastic fluid engine can only be accomplished by determining

the total travel of its piston per minute, and this can be done by varying the rate

of revolution with a stroke constant, or by varying the stroke with a rate of

revolution constant.

     It was shown by a model, and by diagrams, that the length of stroke is always

twice the eccentricity, or the distance between those two centres around which the

cylinders and pistons respectively revolve ; and it is easy to alter this distance

while the engine is running, so that the stroke of all the cylinders is under perfect

control ; and it may be changed either by hand or governors, the latter action being

automatic. It is thus that a hydraulic engine of this type is under perfect control,

and runs at a regular speed, however greatly the demand for power may vary.

     Engines of this revolving type have been constructed and worked both by steam

and  water power                                                    they run  quietly and  well, and  seem to realise  all  the expecta-

        A8. new Method of Burning Oil for Lighthouse Illumination.

                                   By John R. Wigham.

     The author, with a view to avoid the breakage of glass chimneys, and the
obstruction of light caused by their use, has adopted for oil lamps an arrangement
analogous to that he previously applied to gas burners, the ordinary glass chimney
being in both cases dispensed with. In the oil lamp described and exhibited a
current of air is brought through orifices in the burner, and deflectors are so
arranged as to oxidise the smoky oil flame, using an overhanging flue as in the gas
burner. The flame is thus surrounded with a cylindrical wall of air in place of
glass. The author referred to a somewhat similar lamp designed by Mr. Ross, of

Dublin.

      A9. new Form of Light for Lighthouses. By John R. Wigham.

      This paper described a special form of group-flashing light. Instead of the
lenses revolving round the central hght two or more lights are caused to revolve
with the lenses. It is claimed that by such arrangement, while tlie full power of
each light is taken advantage of, the cost of the optical apparatus is materially
Teduced. The author uses two instead of six or eight lenses, and by intermitting
the lights obtains a combination of a novel and striking character.

       10. A new Uluminant for Lighthouses. By John R. Wigham.

     After discussing the relative advantages of gas and electricity as a means of
illuminating lighthouses, the author described the arrangement he has adopted for
securing, when occasion requires it, a light having an intensity of illumination
comparable with that of the electric light, but of much larger size. This consists
in using, in connection with his multiple-jet gas burner, a solid carbonaceous body
converted into vapour and made to produce intensely white light by compressed
oxygen. It is claimed that the naked light of a triform on this principle would
have an illuminating power quite equal to that of a powerful electric light, in.
·addition to certain advantages arising from its larger size, wMle the cost would
be little in excess of that of an ordinary gas light.

11. A new Method of Arranging the Annular Lenses used for Revolving

                Lights at Lighthouses. By John R. Wigham.

The object in view in devising this new arrangement was to render the rotation

of the lenses unnecessary, as by doing so the apparatus would be simplified and

certain other advantages secured. Instead of superposing the burners and lenses

in the same vertical plane, as in the ordinary triform aud quadriform lights, the

author proposed to place the lenses obliquely to each other, but in their focal

position with regard to the illuminant ; the beams of light emerging from each tier

of lenses will thus overlap, illuminating the whole horizon, so that there will be

no occasion for the lenses to revolve, while the increased amount of light trans-

mitted by the annular lens compared with that by the refractiag belt of the or-

dinary fixed light apparatus will be secured.

The paper further points out how, by automatically cutting ofl" the gas at

stated intervals, intermittent or flashing lights could be secured and a considerable

A·economy of gas at the same time eSected.     further advantage is claimed for the

·system in the fact that the full power of the Hght is available at any given point

<of the horizon instead of waxing and waning as in the revolving system.

     The following Papers were read :

        1. On the Manufacture of Metal Tubes. 5?/ James Robertson.

     This paper described a novel method especially applicable to the manufacture
of seamless copper tubes, which has been recently invented by the author and

brouo:ht into practical use by Messrs. Ralph Heaton & Sons, of Birmingham.
    By revolving a smooth steel rod, on which a gland was fitted that could be clamped

more or less tightly and drawn along the rod by a weight passing over a pulley, it
was shown that, whereas a weight of 60 lbs. was required to move the gland while
the rod was in a quiescent state, on revolving the rod a single pound sufficed to
produce this result. This circumstance depends on what the author calls the
' cross surface motion frictional contact of solid bodies,' and it was shown that by
increasing the velocity of revolution the weight required to produce this end-

movement may be still further reduced as compared with that in a state of rest,

the practical limit being about one-eightieth.
      In applying this principle to the manufacture of copper tubes a revolving

mandrel (corresponding to the steel rod in the experiment described above) is

forced by hydrauhc pressure into a copper billet fixed coaxially with it. Round

cast billets of 4, 5, and 7 in. in diameter and about 2 ft. 4 in. in length are
employed, and, although not essential, it is found most economical first to pierce a
hole \\ in. in diameter the entire length of the billet. This is done without removing

metal, for it is ' laved ' aside as the mandrel forces its way through the billet. On

passing a three-inch mandrel through the billet in this form it is elongated to a

length of about four feet, when it is known as a ' shell,' and passes to the draw-
bench. The primary object of the initial hole is in order that the mandrel may be

lubricated. This is done with oil so efl'ectively that the mandrel never gets over-
heated, and the shell can be handled immediately after the operation.

     The necessary end pressure of from 40 to 150 tons is given by a ram, and the
water within the hydravdic cylinder is at the same time used as a back centre, thus
avoiding excessive waste of power from friction. The ram, carrying the mandrel
attached to its front face by a clutch-plate, is caused to revolve by gearing, the
driven spur-wheel being also fixed to the front end of the ram.

     The copper billet is held in a pair of half-round dies, while end-traverse is pre-
vented by steel holding-dogs fitted in the front end of these dies. The mandrel ia
enlarged at its extremity in a bulbous form, having a sharp point and three cam-
shaped inclined working edges on its surface. Each inclined edge as it revolves
spirally causes a wave of metal to roll before it, and thus widens out the hole and

elongates the billet, the direction of rotation being, of course, the converse of that

which would be adopted in drilling. The mandrel revolves at a rate of about
twenty revolutions per minute in making a hole three inches in diameter, and the
traverse endwise is from six to ten inches in the same interval according to the
temper or ' pitch ' of the copper operated upon.

                      By Baldwin Latham, M.Inst.G.E., F.G.S.

      The author in this paper shortly described a method of transmitting power from
a central point by the use of high-pressure water, and using such power as a con-

venient mode for automatically raising sewage in any district. Two machines were

placed vertically in one chamber, and so arranged by means of floats that when.

one machine was overpowered by the volume of sewage, the second machine would
come into action. By this method power could be transmitted more economically
than by any other mode at present in use, and with the additional advantage that

the water after use can be applied for flushing purposes.

The following Papers were read :

                   1. Electric Illumination of Lighthouses.

                    By J. HoPKiNSON, M.A., D.Sc, F.B.S.

The paper related to the cost of the electric light in lighthouses, and suggested a

method of reducing the same. It has hitherto been supposed that it was not pos-

sible to establish and maintain an electric lighthouse at anything like the expense

of a first-class light in which paraffine is used in the ordinary way. The high

expense of the electric light arises in a great measure from the fact that the

machinery is placed at a distance from the lantern, so that two attendants are

always required on duty. The author suggested that a small gas-engine and dynamo

machine should be placed in the room immediately below the lantern, and arrange-

ments should be made whereby the lightkeeper, whether he is in the lantern or

in the engine-room, could ascertain at a glance whether the arc is in its proper

position. The attendance on the lamp, rotating apparatus of the lens (if a revolv-

ing light), engine and dynamo would be easy when the whole is brought together

so as to be under observation at once ; in fact, the gas-engine, dynamo, and lamp
would constitute together a gas-burner, which, though consisting- of many parts, is

automatic throughout, and when at work requires nothing but the constant

presence of a custodian, exactly as a gas lamp in a lighthouse requires a custodian

as a guarantee against failure.

The plant would consist of a Dowson gas-producing apparatus and gas-holder,

the generator and superheater being in duplicate, each capable of making 1,200

feet of gas per hour, the gas-bolder having a capacity of 3,000 cubic feet ; an

eight-horse (nominal) Otto gas-engine and series-wound dynamo machine, placed

in a room near the base of the tower and copper conductors to the lantern,

the dynamo having magnet coils divided into sections so as to supply a small
current when required ; a one-horse (nominal) Otto gas-engine and dynamo machine,
placed in the room immediately beneath the lantern floor, with gas-pipe from the

gas-holder ;  one  spare  armature                                        the  electric  lamps to  receive  either carbons of

focal distance. The cost of this apparatus would depend upon the character of the

light it was intended to exhibit. Provision would be made in the optical apparatus

for giving the horizontal and vertical divergence desired by the methods suc-

cessfully used in the lighthouses of Macquarie and Tino. Two focussing prisms

would be fixed to form magnified images of the arc on pieces of obscured glass, let

into the pedestal floor, so that the keeper, whether in the lantern or in the engine-

room, could see at a glance the state of the arc, and observe whether it is of proper

length, with the carbons in line, whether it is of exactly the right height and in the

centre of the apparatus. An error of one millimetre would be glaringly apparent,

and call for immediate adjustment, although its effect would only be a displace-

ment of the beam five minutes of angle. The lantern would be 10 feet diameter,

with bent plate glass. The cost of the whole described would be materially less

than the cost of a first-order light and lantern with oil lamps and large burners.

In fine weather the small engine would be used. Its effective power on the brake

-- --is
considerably over 800 watts say, 800 watts in the arc itself, or 28 amperes,

through a fairly long arc of 40 volts. Of course the value of this in candles

depends upon the colour in which it is measured and the direction in relation to

the axis of the carbons. In red light the mean over the sphere would certainly

exceed 1,200 candles. In clear weather, or in slight haze or in rain, the beam

of this light through the lenses would be much more powerful at the horizon and

on the distant sea than any single-focus light in oil or gas, or at least would be

fairly comparable with anything yet exhibited in oil or gas, whether triform or

quadriform. But on the nearer sea the illumination would be reduced, so that no

annoyance would be caused by dazzling flashes. In really thick weather, or, in-
deed, in any weather when there was a doubt as to the visibility at the horizon of
the lower power, the larger engine would be used, under the superintendence of the
second keeper. This engine will give 10 horse-power on the brake, and there is
difiiculty in getting 85 per cent, as useful electrical energy outside the machine
that is, 6,340 watts. From this deduct 10 per cent, for the leads and the lamp and
for steadying the arc, leaving 5,710 watts in the arc itself, or 114 amperes, with
a diiference of potential of 50 volts. It hence follows from the South Foreland
experiments that in any fog whatever, the flashes would penetrate farther than any
existing gas or oil light. The increased size of crater compared with that produced
by the current of 20 amperes will give increased vertical divergence, and so

cause the maximum illumination to be attained at a less distance from the light-
house. The attendance of two men would sufiice for all the duties of a lighthouse,

because, under ordinary circumstances, one only need be on duty, excepting whilst
gas is being made. The usual course would be that, with the exception of from
two to three hours at the beginning of the night, the gas-producer would be

damped down, and when the small engine was at work the supply be taken from

the gas-holder.

The consumption of coal would be 4 lbs. per hour of lighting, of water about

half a gallon, of carbon about 4 inches per hour, allowing for ends wasted.
Comparing with a first-order light illuminated with parafBne, the total charges

for maintenance would not dirt'er materially. The substantial advantage resulting
would be that, at a trifling cost per hour, there is available at any moment a light of

the greatest penetrative power.

             2. Multiplex Telegraphy. Bij W. H. Pkeece, F.B.8.

    The enormous increase of telegraphic business in England has necessitated new
modes of working to increase the capacity of wires for the conveyance of messages.
Delany's system enables six messages to be sent on one wire between London and
Birmingham at the same time. It is based on a system of distributing the use of the

wire for a very short interval several times a second to each telegraphist, so that the

currents sent to each, though they are intermittent and very much broken up, are
practically continuous. The distributors are maintained in absolute synchronism
by a very ingenious system of correction. The instrument used for telegraphing

--is the ordinary apparatus already in use in England the sounder. It is not a

long-distance system, for the introduction of disturbances due to underground
wires reduces its efficiency. Only four-way working is practicable between London
and Manchester at present. It will be very extensively used by the Post Ofiice.

         3. A portalle Meciric Lamp. By W. H. Preecb, F.B.S.

    The demand for a new safety-lamp in mines has directed many minds to the
application of electricity to this purpose. Some have proposed to use primary

batteries; others utilise secondary batteries or accumulators. One of the most
portable, compact, and convenient forms is that of Mr. Pitkin. It occupies a
cubical space of 59 cubic inches for two cells, and 86^ cubic inches for three cells,
weighing 5 lbs. 8 oz. and 7 lbs. 3 oz. respectively. The three-cell battery gives a
light equal to 2'5 candles immediately after removal from the charging source,

and lasts for nine or ten hours. It may also be used for other purposes that will

readily suggest themselves, and makes a very convenient reading lamp for railway
travelling, in conjunction with a small candle-power Edison-Swan lamp that
concentrates upon a book all the light required. The lamp is fixed in the focus of a
reflector whose surface is enamelled dead-white, instead of being bright-polished.
The light is thus much more uniformly distributed. It is, moreover, soft, absolutely
steady, and free from smell, or annoyance to one's fellow-passengers. It is lighted
instantly without any match, and can be rapidly replaced by a small coil of fine
platinum wire which, being raised to incandescence, serves for lighting a cigarette.

4- On Improvements in Electric Safety Lamps. By J. Wilson Swan, M.A.

                                              See Reports, p. 496.

                   5. Primary Batteries. By A. Rene Upward.

After briefly reviewing the forms of primary battery from the simple elementary

cell to those of Daniell, Grove, Bunsen, &c., the author pointed out that the quantity

of current given by the combustion of a given weight of zinc is the same in all

batteries, but not the work done by the battery. The E.M.F. is proportional to

the net gain of power in the chemical reactions.
    The difficulties in the way of obtaining a perfect battery having been recapitu-

lated, the author's battery, the chief characteristics of which are the use of free

chlorine gas and the absence of polarisation in consequence of hydrogen not enter-

ing into the reactions, was described. The zinc being always in a solution of zine

chloride, no local action  occurs                            there  is no fear of  mixing of  liquids, as only one
                                                          ;

liquid is used. The further advantages of this form of cell were enumerated as

follows

No fall in E.M.F., due to the solution becoming weaker, as the outer cells are

always full of practically pure chlorine gas ; no acids used in the cells (only pure

water added) ; no liquids to remove ; absence of smell or fumes ; no amalgamation of
the zincs ; no destruction of the terminals ; economy.

     The chlorine generator and gasholders were described, as well as the chlorine

cell itself, the battery, and the arrangements for the continuous automatic supply of

gas to the cells.

                     6. The recent Progress in Secondary Batteries.^

                By Bernard Drake and J. Marshall Gorham.

     This paper gave an account of the various difficulties that existed some time
back when the writers first became connected with the Electrical Power Storage
Company, and dealt with the practical solution in each case. The writers stated

that the three most common sources of trouble were, first, the destruction of the

lead grid or conductor ; second, the buckling or warping of the plates ; third, the
falling out of the active material, the above being almost entirely confined to the
peroxide plates. The destruction of the grid both by local action and oxidisation
could easily be prevented by overcharging the cells in the first instance, whereby a
fine protecting coat of peroxide was formed on the surface of the conductor. If
this coating were reduced by the total discharge of the cells, a fresh surface of the
conductor would be attacked. The authors' experiments have shown that the life of
the lead grid is not proportional to the ampere-hours either put in or taken out of

                       ' Published in extemo in Engineering, vol. xlii. p. 302.
814  REPOET- 1886.

a cell, but is dependent on the treatment the cell receives in use and the extent to

which the ahove action is appreciated. The buckling of the plates was stated
to be due to insufficient charging, which allowed a hard enamel of sulphate of lead
to form on the surface of the active material. It was also found that charging
tended to soften and remove this enamel. The falling out of the active material
was generally due to the hard sulphate mentioned above, which caused the plugs
of active material to split and come out of the plates entire. If, again, the dis-
charge was too rapid there was a tendency for the active material to scale off, and
a fine disintegration of the oxides showed that the plates contained insufficient
sulphate, which acted as the binding agent. Some curves were exhibited showing
the result of recent tests made with standard type 15-plate boxes, which gave a
commercial efficiency of 90 per cent, in ampere-hours and 80 per cent, in watt-
hours, allowing throughout the experiment about an hour's charge after gases were
given off, so as to keep the plates in order. These figures were the mean of six
consecutive charges and discharges at a constant current. It was found that with
a drop of 10 per cent, in E.M.F. the capacity was over 400 ampere-hours, and a
discharge of 9 hours at a rate of 25 amperes showed a drop of only '02 of a volt.

The maximum capacity claimed for these cells by the maker was found to be

reached with a drop of E.M.F. of under 5 per cent, in the case of the cells under
test. The instruments used were carefully calibrated, the amperes being measured
by frequent readings from a Siemens dynamometer checked from time to time by a
voltameter, which agreed within 1 per cent. The volts were taken with a high-
Tesistance reflecting galvanometer calibrated by standard Olark ceUs and freshly

made Daniel cells.

     7. Electric Lighting at CannocJc Chase Collieries. By A. Sopwith.

     This paper must be considered as merely introductory to a visit which was pro-
posed to be made by members of the Section to the Cannock Chase Colliery, and
dealt in a general way with some special advantages and economies in connection

with the electric lighting of collieries.
     The author pointed out the convenience and economy in utilising the ventilating

fan engines for working dynamos, on account of the regularity of speed (which
apart from the requirements of an installation is kept within a limit of from 1 to 3 per
cent., such variation being a gradual diminution or increase) and the fact that such
engines run continuously night and day. The fan itself acts to some extent as a

regulator, as the tendency to run away on switching out of lights is modified by

the increasing resistance of the air ; vice versa the putting on of load and consequent
tendency to slacken speed is reduced by the diminished work done by the fan at a
few revolutions less ; again the comparatively small proportion of power required for
working the dynamo, amounting to from 7 to 12 per cent, of the usual working

power of engine, may be considered an advantage.
     Tbe addition of counter-shafting in cases of slow running fans, or single pulleys

in case of quick running fans, is an easy and inexpensive matter.
     Allusion was made to the small extra consumption of coal in practice, and the

merely nominal value of the slack which is consumed. In further connection with
the working expenses, viz. replacement of lamps, it was mentioned that the under-
ground workings in vicinity of shafts (extending to 200 or 300 yards) admit of lamps
being worked considerably below power with sufficient effectiveness, and actual
lives were given (including breakages) showing at one pit an average of 2,270 hours.

The men who are required to act as examiners of machinery, and have no specifically
regular work to do otherwise, replace lamps, andean attend to any occasional work
connected with installation. As a matter of fact the three installations now

working at Cannock Chase have not necessitated the employment of an extra man.

   -- --The only original feature at least the author presumes it to be so is the

utilisation of old iron and steel pit ropes for main and branch cables. From four
to five miles of rope are worn out annually, varying from |"to 1^" diameter and over,
and the conductivity of this has been proved to be about one-seventh that of a

copper cable (of high conductivity) of similar dimensions. In the case of shafts,

in order to avoid the injurious effects of water, the ropes are encased in wood boxes
strung down the side of the shaft and roughly insulated on hrackets. Underground,
one of the ropes is simply wrapped with old brattice cloth or tarpaulin. On the
surface the ropes are laid in brick channels filled in with gas tar and coal dust, but
it appears from the last trials that it is sufficient to lay the ropes side by side in the
same material ; there is no appreciable loss of current. The fact that old ropes are
only worth a few pounds per ton enables a profuse use of cables to be made, and at

one of the installations the current is conveyed a distance of nearly 1,300 yards
(double distance) with a resistance of only -05 ohm, nearly one-half of which is

--due to the insertion of a length of high conductive copper cable.

   A --brief description of the last installation which includes lighting of all surface

works (extending over five acres), the underground workings in vicinity of the shaft,

--and, at a distance of 620 to 700 yards away, the church, schools, and houses was

given.

     The author remarked upon the practicability of economical extension of installa-
tions by utilising old material such as ropes, old rails, water and gas mains, and
gives the resistance of the latter as tried in one case, and concluded with a few

general remarks.

8. Dynamos for Electro-Metallurgy. By Professor George Forbes, M.A.

     The author wished to draw the attention of manufacturers and others to the
enormous importance and the large field for new applications of the art of electro-

metallurgy. The cost per pound of copper of finished articles, such as kitchen

utensils, &c., neglecting cost of material, when these are electro-deposited instead

of being manufactured as at present, is generally only 15 per cent., often 5 per

ent., of the present cost of manufacture. When we possess machines capable of

producing large currents of electricity at low pressure, an enormous industry will

be immediately opened, and nearly all manufactures will be benefited by the new
Aeconomical process.
                      few branches need alone be mentioned to show what may

be hoped for, such as the production of sugar pans, copper fire-boxes, copper tubes,

and even the coppering of ships' bottoms. These startling applications involve no

new principle. The processes are as old and sure as could be desired. It is only

the magnitude of the operation which is startling. The only cause of delay at

present is the want of a suitable machine for supplying a large current.

    It is now three years since the author realised that most dynamos as at present

supplied have complications introduced with the one object of getting a hio-h

electric pressure. This is not required in electro-metallurgy, and for this purpose

we can revert to the simplest modes of generating electric current. The author

believes that the machine he has constructed is the most perfect, electrically and

mechanically, of any that could be devised. The first large-sized machine con-

sisted of a disc of iron capable of revolving on a spindle. Round its circumference

are rubbing contact springs attached to a ring-casing which contains a coil of in-

sulated copper wire. This casing, with the contained coils, is concentric with the

disc. The whole is now encased in an iron mass, to which are attached the bear-

ings. Contact makers or brushes are also attached to the ends of the spindle.

These form, say, the positive terminal. The ring-casing thus forms the negative

terminal. Independent excitement is given to the insulating coil of wire.

The advantages of such a machine are (1) its simplicity; (2) no wasted power

in reversing the magnetism of the revolving part                                                                                                                                                                                            (3) no reversal of current, as in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

currents.

     The author made a machine, like the above, but double, with discs llj inches

diameter. Its output was 18,000 watts, the energy required to magnetise it was

200 watts. Such a result has never been obtained with any other dynamo. Two

difficulties were encountered. Firstly, the end-thrust was apt to be very great if

the disc were not properly central. This was overcome by giving up the disc form
and using a solid cylinder of iron, going right through the machine, for the arma-
ture. This had the further advantage of diminishing the internal resistance. The
816 REPORT-- 1886.

Asecond difficulty was to prevent heating at the circumferential contact.  whole

year was wasted in experiments on carbon contacts, which led' to no results, and
the author now proposes to run at a low speed and to use several brush contacts

on the circumference, so arranged as to be easily accessible. This will surmount

every difficulty.

    In conclusion the author drew attention to the fact that the only reason why

electric lighting is not cheaper than gas is that the machines, plant, and attendante
are in use on an average only three or four hours per day. The electricity at any

moment which could be generated, but which is not used, is a waste product. If

this were used for the production of copper utensils, and the reduction of argenti-

ferous copper ores and such purposes, the electric light could be supplied from

central stations at less than the cost of gas and return a handsome dividend to the

undertakers.

                9. Ow Distributing Electricity by Transformers.
                             By Charles Zipernowsky.

     Aftr a brief reference to the several attempts that have been made to over-
come the difficulties in the way of lighting a considerable area by means of

electricity since the subdivision of the electric light has become an accomplished

fact, the author pointed out that a practical system of distributing electric energy

over a large area can only be based upon the use of high tension currents for

conveying the energy from the generating centres, in combination with some mode

of reducing the high tension to the limits of diiierence of potential which can be
made use of without danger or difficulty. This limit is at present about 100 volts.

Many methods have been suggested for meeting these conditions.

Thus a counter electromotive force can be introduced into the high tensioa

circuit, as in the case of accumulators, and the terminals of such a device connected

with the lamps, &c. The cost is, however, a grave defect of this system, and the

high tension current which exists at each lamp might lead to fatal consequences.

After referring to the electric transmission of power as another means of over-

coming the difficulty, the author discussed the use of induction coils or 'trans-

W.formers ' in some detail, tracing their use in the first instance to C.  Harrison.

in 1857. Among subsequent workers Jablochkoff, C. T. Bright, Fuller, Varley,

Haitzma Enuma, Gaulard, and Gibbs were mentioned ; and he pointed out that the
want of success was in great part due to the fact that the transformers were con-

nected up in series, an arrangement which is only suitable for use with an invariable

number of lamps in any one secondary circuit, or when each transformer supplier

only one lamp.

Besides considerations in regard to cost, the conditions to be satisfied by a

system of electric distribution were stated as follows :

(1) Perfect independence of the several consumption devices.
(2) Absolute and relative economy so that the consumption of energy is in

        proportion to the number of lamps in use.

(3) All regulation to be concentrated at one central station.

     The author then proceeded to describe the method he has devised in conjunction

with M. Max D4ri, and, with the assistance of M. O. T. Blathy, to satisfy the above

conditions.

     This is based on the fact that, with a constant primary tension, the secondary
one will vary only in proportion to the internal resistances of the coils ; and as the
resistance of each coil is less than 1 per cent, of the external resistance, the
secondary tension will not vary more than 2 per cent., whatever be the intensity
of current supplied to the consuming device. Constancy in the primary tension
at the transformer terminals is secured by connecting them in multiple arc with
the main fine, and the arrangements are such that current and tension are distri-

buted in the primary circuits, much as in a low tension direct supply system, the

transformers simply acting as tension-reducing devices.

     Instead of the old Euhmkorff coil pattern of transformer a form is adopted
                                                                        TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                 817

such that the lines of magnetic force circulate entirely in iron, or as nearly ao as
possihle, by which arrangement a considerable economy of magnetising force is

effected and other advantages are at the same time gained. Two forms of trans-

former made on these principles were described, as well as the self-regulation of

alternating current machines, which is especially valuable in installations of
moderate size.

     This system is at present in use in Gerona in Spain, Lucerne, Cologne, Berlin,
Eome, Milan, Turin, and other towns, and has been temporarily erected for the

Exhibitions in London, Budapesth, and Antwerp. The arrangements for Rome

were explained in detail and illustrated by a diagram, and the author concluded
by pointing out that, although tlie last word has not yet been spoken in relation

to the distribution of electricity over large areas, the above system is the only
one with which he is acquainted that approximates to the fulfilment of an ideal

distribution.

3. The Manufacture of Slack Barrels by Machinery on the English and

                    American Systems. By A. Ransome.

The paper confined itself to such cask-making machines as have been most

successfully applied to the production of slack barrels for holding dry goods, and
as all the more satisfactory machines for this purpose are of English or American
origin, the different systems of manufacturing slack barrels at present in use in this
country and America were alone discussed.

     The English cement barrel is made from fir staves sawn to length and parallel
widths and thickness. The heads, which are also made of fir wood, are simply
rounded, and held in place between two wooden hoops nailed inside the ends of

the cask.

                                                                                                    ^

     In the Universal Stave-jointing Machine a sufficient nimiber of rough staves
to make one cask are cramped side by side in a travelling box, and passed over a
horizontal cutter, which rises and falls as the staves pass over it, and the amount of
bilge given to the stave is governed by a template.

     The staves, after being fired on a hot plate, pass to the trussing machine. This
consists of a cast-iron cone, the inside of which corresponds with one half of the

finished barrel                                                         it has recesses turned  in  it to take the truss hoops, and is made  in
                                                                     ;

halves, hinged on one side, to facilitate insertion and removal. Immediately below
the cone is a cast-iron table, caused to rise and fall by hydraulic pressure, applied
through an accumulator. The attendant arranges a set of staves in a circle within

the bilge truss hoop, which, for this purpose, is laid upon the rising table, the
upper ends of the staves resting against a bevilled flange, formed on the lower edge
of the trussing cone. The truss hoops being inserted in the recesses in the cone
the table is raised, and thus the upper ends of the staves are pressed tightly

together in the cone, and the partially trussed barrel is withdrawn with two truss

hoops driven firmly on it. Two more truss hoops are then inserted in the cone, and
the cask is placed with its trussed end downwards, when a second rising of the table

completely trusses it.

                                                                        · Published in extenso by the author.

' REPORT 1886.

     The barrel is next taken to the chiming machine, where, while it is held in a
horizontal position between two cones mounted on a lathe bed, cutters mounted on
poppet heads and revolving at a very high speed are made to act simultaneously

on both ends of the cask.
     The heads are rounded on a special machine; the boards, havir.g been first

crosscut to length, are placed side by side between two circular cramp plates

revolving at a high speed, a fixed cutter being made at the same time to act on

the periphery.

     The practical result of the introduction of the machinery above referred to is

that a cement cask, which the hand cooper was formerly paid 8^d. for making, can
now be produced for a total outlay in wages of about 2ld., of which 2d. represents

the cost of hooping and headino- up after leaving the machines, and it is now

probable that, by an invention just patented by Mr. Hewitt, foreman cooper at

Messrs. Bazley, White & Bros.' extensive cement works at Northfleet, the cost of

hooping and heading will be reduced by fuUy one half This invention consists in

trussing the barrel in its permanent hoops, which are of steel, and four in number,
Aleavino- nothing to be done by hand but to fix the heads in place.
                                                                     sample barrel

trussed in this manner is exhibited.
    The American slack barrel, a sample of which is also exhibited, is usually made

of elm or some other comparatively hard wood, the staves being cut in such a

manner as to make them, in section, curved to the approximate curcle of the barrel.

This is done by means of a slicing machine, in which the block, after being well
steamed, is forced against a fixed knife, the wood being caused to describe a short

arc of a circle as the knife passes through it. For stouter descriptions of casks

the staves are sawn with a curved section by a cylinder saw, while for the lighter

and smaller slack barrels a bilge saw is used, which not only cuts the staves to a

curved section, but saws them curved in the direction of their length to the bent

form which they would assume wheu made up into the cask. For flour barrels,

however, the slicing machine is almost exclusively employed.

The staves for American slack barrels are jointed by two distinct kinds of

ma<;hines. In one of these the joints are formed by a fixed knife being brought

down upon the edge of the stave by a guillotine motion. In the other the stave,

being bent over a horizontal saddle, is presented to the face of a disc armed with

flat plane irons and running at a very high speed.

The staves, after being jointed, are set up in a circular form, and the open end

is drawn together by means of a windlass.

    As this operation tends to draw the cask out of truth, it becomes necessary to

level it by compressing it endwise between two tables at right angles to its axis.
     The barrel is then heated, and the remaining truss hoops lightly di-iven on by

hand ; it is then passed to the trussing isachine, acting upon an entirely difierent

principle from that already described.
     These barrels are chimed and crozed at one operation : the barrel, being cramped

between two chuck rings, is made to rotate, while rapidly revolving cutters of the
requisite form for bevelling the ends and cutting the head grooves are brought into

contact with its two ends.
     The mode of manufacture of the heads of American slack barrels difiers from

that adopted in England mainly in the use of a dished saw, of a sweep correspond-

ing to the diameter of the head in place of a fixed cutter.

6. On a new System of Mechanism for Imparting and Recording Variable
               Velocity. By W. Worby Beaumont, M.Inst.G.E.

    In this paper the author described a new system of mechanism for imparting

variable velocity to the recording parts of speed- and work-measuring instruments
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                       819

and to machinery. In the first part he described a new principle in the mechanical

adaptation of a hollow cone mounted upon a revolving spindle with its centre at the
smaller end coincident with that of the spindle, hut with its axis incHned from
that of the spindle, so that one side of the periphery of the cone remained con-

tinuously parallel to the axis of the spindle.

     In the second part he described a new system of variable velocity gear in which
motion was imparted or controlled by a conical roUer or disc running upon this
cone, or by a cylindrical roller or disc. To this is adapted a reducing gear, the
wheel in which (carrying the idle pinion) is permissively rotative at a velocity
variable by the longitudinal movement of the cone one way or the other so as to

bring the disc in contact with a larger or smaller part of the cone.

     The author also described the exaxial cones as a means of transmission of
different velocities by means of belts which would run upon them much as they
would upon cylinders.

6. On Balanced Locomotive Engines. By T. R. Crampton.

     The engine is driven by two paii-s of adhesion wheels worked independently

dispensing with coupling rods or balance weights. It can be designed for ordinary
high-pressure or compound. The four adhesion wheels are worked in pairs, two

on each side (which may be made radial if desired), each pair being driven sepa-

rately from one end of each axle only, by a pair of cyhnders workino- on return

cranks, attached close to the outside of one wheel as convenient ; the crank pins
being opposite each other, or 180° apart. The pistons, working in opposite direc-

tions, require no balance weights; the axles transmit the power to the wheels by
torsion in one direction, there are no balance weights, in consequence there is no
power generated in the working to produce oscillation. The axle-box guides receive
no horizontal strains from the pistons, which amount, in an ordinary engine of
the same dimension, to from 16 to 18 tons at each stroke, tending to break the

frames.

The cylinders are placed so that the centre of the slide bars are nearly in a line

--with the centre of gravity of the engine. The connecting-rods are seven times the

length of the crank the vertical thrust, over the leading wheels, as in the author's

original engine, is reduced to one-fifth of the ordinary system. There are large

numbers of engines of the ordinary type having inclined cylinders at the smoke-box
end, where the vertical action at each stroke of the piston varies the weio-ht on
                                                                             "^
the leading wheels three or four tons.

     The whole of the working parts being outside the boiler, and nothing underneath
it, as suggested by the author in 1846, enables the marine boiler to be used, which in
his opinion, is, under certain conditions, better adapted for locomotives than that
in ordinary use ; it is cheaper to make and more easily repaired, having no stays in

the fire-box. Ordinary boilers can be used.

The total weight of engine is reduced, and greater heating surface obtained in

a given distance between the axles. The absence of strains mentioned enables the
Awhole structure to be made much lighter.
                                           simple apparatus is employed for

forcing the cranks off the dead centres when desired, which is appHcable to all
engines. Any known apparatus for manipulating the brakes can be placed on the

foot-plate, the cylinder of such apparatus being utUised for moving the cranks off

the dead centres if required. The tyres are formed to wear parallel, reducino- the
wearimmensely as well as that of the rails. The details of the engine may be varied

to suit circumstances. The position of the cylinders having no tendency to produce
oscillation, they may be placed at any convenient position, consequently should

assist in settling the vexed question of inside and outside cylinders.

When engines have all the moving parts on the outside, and are worked lono-

distances by change of driver, the one driver, on giving up charge, can explain and

point out to the one taking the engine on anything requiring attention, which is not

so conveniently done when the machinery is underneath the boiler. The importance

of locomotives constructed on the above principles may be shortly stated : the results
of experiments made under precisely the same conditions with the ordinary loco-

                                                                        3aa

motive gave the pressure of the steam in the boiler, on starting the improved engines
from rest on a level, to be 30 per cent, less, and on severe curves 50 per cent, less--
than was required by the ordinary engine. This system is peculiarly suitable for

colonial locomotives.

      1. On recent Improvements in Sporting Ouns and their accessories.
                                   By Samuel B. Allpoet.

     The writer justified the introduction to the Association of the subject of the
manufacture of sporting arms, on the ground of the importance of the trade to the
town of Birmingham, and further that the durability and performance of the guns
produced depends largely on the application of scientific principles to their construc-
tion, to a knowledge of the theory of projectiles, and of the composition and force of
explosive compounds. The danger and clumsiness of loading guns at the muzzle
have given way to the safety and convenience of using cartridges composed of defi-
nite charges of powder and shot, made up in a portable form and containing their
own means of ignition.

     The safety and shooting power of the sporting breechloader are mainly conse-
quent on the judicious design of its breech mechanism and the perfect fitting of
the surfaces in contact when the barrels are closed. The method of tQting the
breech ends of the barrels upwards on a hinge is most convenient to open them for
loading, and for firmness when closed the original fastening principle of Lefaucheux.
has not been excelled. The ' snap bolt ' system is, however, for home use, gene-
rally adopted, being more quickly manipulated and fairly durable when perfectly
fitted. (These systems were illustrated by drawings.) The self-acting mechanism
for forcing out the cartridge case was also explained.

     The safety arrangement exhibited, known as 'the rebounding lock, 'which, after
the gun is fired, automatically restores it to a position that renders it absolutely
safe from accidental discharge, was a marked advance in improvement.

     External hammers were subsequently found to be needless, and to interfere with.,
a free aim, and hence the so-called ' hammerless ' gun was invented, wherein the
hammers are concealed within the gun, and the mode of working simplified.

     The ' Anson-Deeley,' and the ' Scott ' hammerless guns are perhaps the best
and most successful types of these guns. They possess special but different merits
in their mechanism and automatic safety appliances, and the disposition of their
moving parts is very judicious. The varieties of hammerless guns can only be
glanced at, as so many patents have been taken out for them in the last ten

years.

     In noticing the performance of shot guns it has been found that by contract-
ing or coning the bore of the barrel a little behind the muzzle, technically called
' chokeboring,' a direction of convergence can be conferred upon the charge of shot,
whereby it can be concentrated upon the mark, and the tendency of the shot to
spread, as compared with firing it from a true cylinder, is greatly restrained. The
forces tending simultaneously to converge, and to disperse the charge of shot, are

intricate and interesting. Much of the desired effect depends on the length and

shape of the internal coning, for studying which the writer invented an expanding
micrometer for minutely measuring the variations in the boring of tubes, whereby
differences of calibre of half a thousandth of an inch are felt and visibly recorded.
This instrument was exhibited and explained.

     Latterly new gunpowders have been invented, having for their object the ob-
taining quickly a clear aim with the second barrel of a gun unclouded by the
smoke from the first barrel which arises from using ordinary black gunpowder.
These new powders are known as Schultze and E. C. (Explosives Company). They
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  821

^flFect their purpose as they are nearly smokeless, and have been successful im-
 provements. In their early manufacture they were imperfect and irregular in
 their force, and if heated to 80° Fahrenheit acted with great violence. Hence

 many guns were broken by them at first, and the need has been felt of some

 reliable instrument to measui-e the force which powders exert and its rate of de-

 velopment.

      One of these, the Bouleng^ chronograph, indicates the velocity of a bullet
 during its flight between two targets 60 feet apart. These are respectively con-
 nected with suspended weights by an electric current. On the bullet piercing the
 targets the current is broken, the weights are set free, and hence the velocity and
 the projectile force employed are deduced. The gauze targets, however, appear
 likely to interfere with the velocity of small shot, and to aflect the calculation for

 them.

      The instrument known as the ' crusher gauge ' is a cylindrical nozzle having an
 external screw to screw into any powder chamber. It is bored at one end to
·receive a perfectly fitting piston. On exploding powder in the chamber the piston
 delivers an impact upon a loose copper disc placed inside the crusher gauge, of
which the rate of compressibility is ascertained previously. By carefully measuring

 the thickness of the copper disc before and after the experiment, the compression
the disc has sufiered is observed, and the powder force is deduced. Since the
thickness of the barrel of a gxm from breech to muzzle should diminish proportion-

 ally to the progressive decrement of gas pressure the lightest safe section can thus
he found. This instrument has been screwed at equal distances along large guns
for that purpose, and the principle seems capable of application to sporting guns.

The paper then dealt briefly with the subject of impact.
     The author exhibited a test gun of j~ of an inch calibre, designed for testing

the pressures exerted by difierent powders upon the barrels of guns. The upper
side of the baiTel is pierced with six tapped holes, into which gun-metal stop-screws
are screwed. On removing either of these, an instrument for measuring the pres-

sure may be screwed on. The stem of the piston in this instrument extends to

the inner surface of the barrel, and its outer extremity carries a toothed rack.
This engages with a pinion, the axis of which canies an index finger ranging over
a graduated arc.

     On firing the gun, a gas-check wad upon passing the end of the piston-rod

exposes it to the pressure of the gas then generated, forcing the piston upwards
against a spiral spring and compressing it. The compression is automatically re-

corded on the graduated arc in tenns of hundredths of a ton per square inch. By

interposing a different piston the gun becomes a crusher gauge at the same places
along the barrel, whereby a second test is established.

      m2. Recent Improvements the Manufacture of Rifle Barrels,

                         By Arthur Greenwood, M.Inst. G.E.

      The introduction of steel rifle-barrels some five and twenty years ago, and the
gradual substitution of that material in place of welded wrought iron for the barrels
 of military rifles and arms of precision, have caused great changes in the machinery

A·employed in their manufacture. short description of such machinery may not be

without interest in this great centre of firearms industry.

     The barrels generally used for military rifles are made from mild steel rolled
·solid and the bore drilled out. This is necessarily a costly operation, and numerous
attempts have been made at hollow rolling to avoid the expense of drilling.

     To effect this barrel * blanks ' or short pieces of steel have been drilled and
·afterwards rolled on a mandril to the desired length, and many thousands of
harrels have been made on this plan. Of late years, however, the military
 authorities have insisted upon barrels being first rolled solid to the desired form
And afterwards drilled. At the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield a system
 of continuous rolling has been established, whereby the barrel has been rolled
to its exterior form at one heat by passing it through a number of rolls placed
822 BEPORT-- 1 886.

Aone after the other.  barrel is thus rolled in about half a minute, which gives a

great saving in time and cost of production, and the material is not harmed by
re-heating, as was often the case in the old system.

    When the rolled barrel has become cold it is passed through a straightening-

machine, which takes out any short bends, or ' kinjjs,' and is thus made ready for

drilling.

Before going to the drilling machine the barrel goes to a machine which ' faces

or squares up the ends, and prepares a bearing at each end of it upon which it will

rotate in the barrel-drilling machine.

The barrel-drilling machine has been specially designed to drill a perfectly true

hole through the ban-el, and to avoid straightening by means of external hammer-

ing, which is extremely harmful to the barrel. Three barrels are operated upon

at one time and drilled simultaneously from both ends. The machine is horizontal,

alid the barrels rotate at from 700 to 900 revolutions per minute.

    The drills are of the form technically known as D, or half-round bits, and are
fed up automatically, a heavy pressure of water being injected up the barrels so as
efl'ectually to wash out the cuttings or ' swarth,' and thus ensure the free action of

the drills.

About thirty barrels can thus he drilled in the working day by one attendant.

This system reduces the cost of drilling to Uttle more than an eighth of the

former system employed at Enfield, the results as regards excellence of work being

at least equally good. The barrels are then rough or ' draw ' bored, and then ' spilled

up ' or fine bored in horizontal machines by means of square bits : this system is
well known and has undergone little change during recent years.

     The exterior of the barrel is next turned, and ingenious arrangements have been
made to secure the exterior being turned true or concentric with the bore.

     The system at present at work at Enfield eflects this with admirable precision,

a ' bush,' or temporary bearing, being fixed to the barrel concentric with the

bore.

     This bush revolves in a stay, and steadies the barrel until ' spots ' or bearings

have been turned upon it, and from these spots the barrel is rough turned. It is

mafterwards finished a copy turning lathe to the desired form, the result being a

barrel with its exterior practically concentric with its bore, which is absolutely

necessary for good shooting. In rifling, Uttle change has been made in the system,
but much attention has lately been given to reduce the cost of this delicate opera-
tion. The automatic rifling machine is coming generally into use, and now, with

the automatic machine which rotates the barrel after each cut, gives the feed to

the cutters, and finally rings a bell to summon the attendant when the barrel is
completed, one man can attend to a number of machines producing as many as

sixty or seventy barrels per working day, whereas on the old system one attendant
was required for each machine producing on an average twenty barrels per day.

   3. The Birmingliam Compressed-air Power Scheme.^ By J. Stukgeon.

     After pointing out the objects of the scheme, and showing that the large num-

ber of engines of moderate size used in Birmingham, often intermittently, renders
some such system peculiarly applicable to the town, the author points out that,

although each 1 ,000 horse-power at the Central Station may only produce 500 effec-

tive horse-power at the users' engines, it will displace considerably more than
1,000 horse-power of small boiler plant, furnaces, chimneys, &c., and the same
engines can be used with compressed-air as with steam. The centralisation principle
enables engines and boilers to be used of large power, with all the modern improve-

ments, such as high-pressure triple expansion, gas firing, &c. At the pressure

proposed (45 lbs.) the air-driven engines will indicate from 32 to 84 per cent, of
the power developed at the main engines, according to the mode of using the
compressed air. According to the investigations of Sir F. Bramwell and Mr.
Piercy, on behalf of the Birmingham Corporation, the present consumption of fuel

       ' Published in extenso by the Birmingham Compressed-air Power Company.
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  823

in small engines of from foiu- to twenty-five horse-power varies from 36 lbs. to
8^ lbs. per horse-power per hour, and, as it is estimated that compressed-air power
would reach the consumer at an expenditure of from 4-7 lbs. to 1-77 lbs. fuel per
horse-power per hour, a savinof of from 750 to 480 per cent, is effected.

      The works will be situated on land fronting Garrison Lane. The first portion

is laid out for the erection of fifteen engines of 1,000 horse-power each, to be worked

by Lane's patent boiler and Wilson's gas-producers. As the Company have

already received applications for over .3,600 horse-power, they have entered into

contracts for the completion of 6,000 horse-power at the Central Station before

May 31, 1887. The mains will all be of wrought iron, laid in concrete troughs

near the surface of the road, so that they can be easily got at for examination and

repairs. They will vary in size from twenty-four down to seven inches. Valves
will be provided, by which, in case of damage to any portion of main, that

portion will be automatically stopped off from the rest of the district, so as not to
interrupt the general service. The compressed air will be sold to users at a price
per 1,000 cubic feet of air of a standard pressure of 4.5 lbs., measured by a meter so
constructed as to register the volume delivered at the value of the standard pres-

sure, independently of any variations there may be in the main pressure. The

meter consumption of the various users will be registered in the gross on a dial at
the central works by electric apparatus, so that any waste or misuse of the air can
be at once discovered and prevented.

     The paper concludes with a discussion of the various economical aspects of the

question, pointing out that compressed air can be used for all purposes for which
steam is employed, except heating; air, on the other hand, has the advantage
over steam that it is available for refrigeration.

             4. Tlie Welsbach System of Gas-lighting hy Incandescence.

                               By Conrad W. Cooke.

     "This system, which is the invention of Dr. Carl Auer von Welsbach, of Vienna,
consists in impregnating fabrics of cotton or other substances, made into the form
of a more or less cylindrical hood or mantle, with a compound liquid composed of
solutions of Zirconia and Oxide of Lanthanum (or with solutions of Zirconia with
Oxides of Lanthanum and Yttrium), which mantle, under the influence of a gas
and air flame, is converted into a highly refractory material capable of withstanding
for long periods without change the highest temperatures that can be obtained
from the most eflicient form of atmospheric burners, and which, under the influence
of such temperatures, glows with a brilliant incandescence, very white and perfectly
steady, retaining, moreover, its woven or reticulated character ; the organic volatile
and carbonaceous matters being entirely burnt out and replaced by an incom-
bustible and highly refractory residual skeleton, which becomes by its brilliant

incandescence the source of light in the burner.

     The light emitted is, at a distance, hardly distinguishable from a twenty-candle
incandescence electric lamp, and by a modification of the composition of the im-

pregnating liquid a yellower light is obtained, resembling that of the best gas lights,

but much more brilliant, and wich a saving of gas of from fifty to seventy-five per

cent., and, being perfectly smokeless, it is incapable of giving ofi' solid carbon,

whereby ceilings or internal decorations are blackened.

     The illuminating power of the lights may be taken at about ten candles per

cubic foot of gas consumed per hour, and the mantles last from 800 to 1,500 hours.

     After mention of the work of the British Association as to this subject at the
Norwich, Exeter, Liverpool, Edinburgh, and Brighton meetings from 1868-1872,
and also the Parliamentary Committee of 1860-1871, a paper by the writer at
Liverpool in 1870 was quoted, recommending inquiries, independent of coroners'
824 REPORT-- 1886.

inquests, by competent engineers, whose published reports would probably be more
useful than the verdicts of juries on such a complicated subject.

     This scientific investigation is now undertaken by the Board of Trade, under
the Boiler Explosion Act of 1882, who have already held 179 preliminary inquiries,

with such useful result as to preclude the need of further legislation.
     The work of the Midland Steam Boiler Inspection and Assurance Co. since

1862, chiefly among the hard-worked boilers in ironworks and collieries, was then

described, the general result having been to lessen the frequency of explosions.

   A table, abstracted from the writer's ' Annual Records of Boiler Explosions,'

showed for twenty-four years 1,228 explosions (killing 1,476 and injuring 2,261 other
persons), and was so arranged as to show at a glance the kind of boiler, and the cause
of explosion, under the heads of Faults of Manufacture, Inspection, and Working.

     Numerous sketches, photographs, and models illustrating some of the most
important explosions were exhibited.

                            6. South Staffordshire Mines Drainage :

                        (1) Surface Works. By E. B. Marten.

     After reference to a paper by the writer on the ' Drainage of the South Staf-
fordshire Coal Field ' at the last meeting in Birmingham in 1865," which led to
the obtaining of the South Staffordshire Mines Drainage Act, 1873, the works
under that Act were described.

     The area dealt with is 60 square miles, with 500 miles of streams passing over
it, nearly all of which have been repaired where injured by mining. Also the
100 miles of canals have been repaired. Low-lying areas have been dealt with by
surface pumps, so that the 50 million gallons per day of water found in the mines
in 1865 has been reduced by about half.

     For underground pumping the area was divided into six districts. The Bentley
district in the north is not to be dealt with until the water finds its way through

 the Bentley Great Fault.
      In the Bilston district pumping nearly ceased, and the water ran over into the

Tipton district, so that they were afterwards dealt with as one, and all called
Tipton. The struggle to overcome the difficulties in draining it forms the subject
 of the following paper by Mr. E. Terry, the mining engineer.

      In the Oldbury district the mineowners voted themselves out of the under-
ground clauses of the Act, so that the injustice remains that a few do the pumping

whUe others get the coal unwatered. In the Kingswindford district the owners

 did the same without foreseeing that it would prevent the carrying out of arrange-
 ments by which one part was to be drained by a private individual, but he has
 erected a pumping-engine and drained mines which others work.

      In the Old Hill district the system commenced by a private company has been

W.successfully completed under the Act, as detailed in a paper following, by Mr.

B. CoUis, mining engineer.

             (2) The Drainage of the Tipton District. By E. Terrt.

      The arbitrators under the Act wished the surface works to be finished before
the underground case was dealt with, but the Commissioners in the Old Tipton
district urged that they should be allowed to work some of the engines lately
 stopped, which was done, and the arbitrators suggested putting up two new engines
 and temporarily working 38 others, with a capital expenditure of 70,000Z. This
 was not accepted, and as an alternative owners were paid for pumping at the rate
 of 6id. per lock (25,000 gallons) for each 100 feet raised, equal to about 20^. per
 annum per horse-power, but it resulted in the Commissioners being obliged to take
 most of the engines into their own hands.

     In the Old Bilston district in the same way the arbitrators advised the erection
 of four new engines and the temporary working of 44 others, with a capital

expenditure of 46,000^., making 116,000^. for the two districts; but this suggestion
was not followed, and the Bilston water overflowed into Tipton, so that the Tipton
peoplehad to work the Bilston engines to save themselves, without rates for the

coal raised there. In 1880 the districts were practically joined, and the arbitrators

suggested a scheme for the whole, now called Tipton district, including the almost
complete renewal of Stow Heath engine and putting down two large engines at
Bradley and Moat, which are completed. The final result, as was shown in a table, is

that the surface works have reduced the water to less than half, and the number
of engines has been reduced from 77 to 12, and the annual cost from 76,000Z. to

i9,000/., or ^, and wiU this year be fui-ther reduced to 7 engines, and 7,000Z., or of

what it was formerly, with a capital expenditure of 83,000/., instead of the 116,000/.

originally contemplated.

(3) The Drainage of the Old Hill District. By W. B. CoLLis.

The drainage of this district in 1871 was attempted by nineteen firms raising

AIf million gallons per day, besides much water within 70 yards of the surface by
small pumps.  limited company was formed for joint action, and when the Act

passed, in 1873, their system was adopted. They took several old engines and put
them in good order, and erected a very large one in the deep of the district, which

has been at work for some time, and such levels are being driven as will soon

enable it to do nearly all the pumping needed in the district. Interesting par-

ticulars of the engines were given. That at the Old Buflery had a wooden beam so

trussed with iron that 3^ tons were taken from it when a cast-iron beam was sub-

stituted. Another old engine at Windmill End has balloon boilers, the steam
being very low pressure, and always on one end of cylinder. An engine used at
the Fly (so called from a quick working whimsey once there) was a dii-ect-acting

bull engine, but is superseded by the new one at Waterfall Lane, an inverted
^Cormsh, with beam below instead of above the cylinders.

                     Section H.--ANTHROPOLOGY.

--President of the Section Sir George Campbell, K.C.S.I., M.P., D.C.L.,.

                                                           F.R.G.S.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2.

The President delivered the following Address :

     I feel much diffidence in taking this chair, for, though in former days I used to

pay a good deal of attention to what was then called ethnology, I have heen for

many years immersed in perhaps more exciting but, I am afraid, less satisfactory
occupations ; and I feel that I am very far behind in scientific knowledge and
scientific methods. I only venture to address you because I take for my subject

practical, rather than scientific, anthropology ; the study and cultivation of the

creature man as he exists, rather than that branch of the subject which seeks to

inquire into his origin and development. Intensely interesting as are inquiries into

the origin of man, it must be admitted that our knowledge on the subject is still

very limited and our progress slow ; that we have not yet got hold of the missing

link, and scarcely know whether the flint implements are the work of man or of

Wesome earlier intelligent creature.  are hardly on firm ground till we come to

man very much in the form in which we now have him, and even already divided

into the principal varieties which exist to this day. I now then invite you to

approach the subject rather as practical agriculturists deal with the subject of

horses and cattle than as scientists who trace these animals to very ancient pre-

historic types ; and in dealing with man from this point of view I am emboldened

by the consideration that here also science has not yet completely conquered the

field, and that very much is open to those who bring to it only a quick eye and

careful observation. I think it can hardly be doubted that, in distinguishing well-

marked types of humanity, the eye is after all the easiest and perhaps the safest
guide. With that alone one can recognise the unmistakable differences of colour,
size, facial features, set of the eye, character of the hair, and one or two other

features by which the physical characters of different types of humanity are varied.

On the other hand, when we come to nicer and more subtile distinctions, especially
among the mixed races which occupy most of the world, we must confess that

anthropometric science as applied to craniology, &c. gives us results only partially

concliosive. I have an unusually narrow head. I can hardly be fitted with a hat

without making the hatter elongate it ; my next brother has so remarkably broad

a head that he cannot be fitted without altering a large hat the other way : and
so I think it is in many families and races, as anyone who tries to puzzle out

craniological results will find.

     So again as regards other guides to race. It is admitted that language is not

always a safe guide, but still it is a very important element in ethnological inquiries,

myespecially among primitive races. I have paid some attention to that, and

impression is strong that language tests of race are to be found in the few simple

elementary words and forms which any observer can easily master and examine,

and not in the higher developments of the language, which are generally much.
              TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                                      827

intermixed with and influenced by foreign elements. I rouglily put together a few

dozen test words, &c. which we found very efficacious in India.  Take EngUsh, too
                                                                                                                                                      ;

the origin of the race is found in the lower and monosyllabic words, though the

majority of the English words in a dictionary are Latin and French.

There is another race-guide which requires much care and some scientific

--accuracy, though not of what we should call a properly anthropometric character
   I mean laws, customs, and habits. Like language these too may be varied by

foreign influences, but I incline to think that they are more important for our

purposes than has always been recognised, and are at least as persistent as,

perhaps more persistent than, language. At any rate, they are certainly most

important as  affecting the modern  history  and  cultivation    of  man                      and while
                                                                                           ;

some laws and customs require scientific study, many habits and practices are on the

surface, and open to the observation of every intelligent observer. I might class food

and drink among such habits, as being those which bear most directly of all on

physical development. For instance, one scarcely realises till one goes to China

how important is the cow as pre-eminently an Aryan animal, the early sacredness

of which was formded upon uses almost ignored by other gi-eat races such as the

Chinese. The Chinese, again, who will not touch milk, and reject some other food

which we think among the best (pheasants, for instance), make constant and large

use of food which we reject, such as puppies and rats. It is most interesting to

inquire whether there is any foundation for either class of prejudices.

Among other habits and institutions well worthy of observation I might cite

marriage and the family, descent through the female or through the male, the

forms of small self-governing communities, and the tenure of land. Animals of

nearly allied species seem to be divided by curiously sharp lines into polygamous

and monogamous races. It is hard to understand why hares should be strictly

monogamous, rabbits polygamous, partridges monogamous, pheasants polygamous,

Wegeese monogamous, ducks polygamous.        have yet to discover to which class

man belonged before laws divided the race into two opposite camps in this matter.

When we come to institutions and land tenure we approach the region of politics,

but for my part I must at once say that, if we avoid mere party in politics, we

anthropologists are called on to perform most important functions in the social

politics of the day. What can be more important than to ascertain the effect, on

the race, of modern urban life, of the increased use of meat, of the diminished use

of milk, of the enormously increased consuaaption of tea, of the more constant

use of the eyes and the brain, viewing these subjects in then- broad general results,

rather than from a merely medical point of view ?

    My view of the good work that may be done by the more popular methods in

anthropology may be somewhat consoling to our countrymen generally, for they

seem as a whole to be too busy for much science, and to be deficient in it. I see

it was stated that we have to get anthropometric instruments from abroad. But

on the other hand our opportunities for observation far outrival all others. In our

vast empire we have every race and every shade, every stage of progress, from

the lowest to the highest; every institution and every method of living. As

rulers, as explorers, as merchants, as employers of labour, as colonists, we come

into the nearest contact, and have the most intimate relations with almost every

Wepeople and every tribe on the face of the earth.  are indeed a people who, if

we make but the most moderate use of opportunities, may bring together such a

mass of knowledge of mankind as to leave nothing wanting. Surely then in this

country anthropology is no mean subject.

Both in regard to the greatness of our dominion, the vastness of the population,

and its infinite variety, India is by far the greatest of our fields, as it is that in

which we have the most complete and efifective official machinery. India is

remarkable not only for its many countries, climates, and races, but also for the

division of the populations into what one may call horizontal strata. There, under

the caste system, eveiy rank, occupation, and profession represents in some sort a

race, and that in enormous variety. "^'Tiatever infiltration of blood there may be,

every caste in India is at least as much a peculiar and separate race as were till
lately Jews or gipsies in our own countiy, and more so. Every one of them
828 REPORT-- 1886.

has, too, its own institutions, its own rules of marriage and inheritance, its own

laws and customs ; and I need scarcely add that outside this Hindoo agglome-

--ration of many races there are the various aboriginal races also in great variety,
--and in a state of excellent preservation tribes not of one family of the human

race, but of almost every great family, from the purest Aryans of the north-west

to what I may call extreme Mongolians in the east, and primitive blacks in the

centre and south.

    In truth, my experience of that great anthropological field India is my excuse
for sitting here to-day. It has been my fortune to serve in very many parts of that
great country, and, so far as my scanty acquirements permit, I have always taken

great interest in, and inquired much about, the races and varieties of the peoples
and I think I may claim this, too, that ever since I have been a good deal
absorbed in politics, in all the travels I have made in several parts of the world, in

Eastern Europe, in America, and elsewhere, I have never wholly forgotten my

ethnological proclivities, and have pried about a good deal to pick up information

regarding the various races and tribes.

     As India is in some sense an epitome of the world, so I may also say that the last
provinces I administered, those forming the Government of Bengal, are or were an
epitome of India. At that time the whole of Assam and the eastern frontiers
were under Bengal, and we certainly had a very much greater variety of races

--than any other province in India perhaps I may say than any other country in

the world. Among the more advanced races, besides the whole of the well-
marked Bengalee nationality we had some twenty millions of Hindustanis on the

north, the Ooryahs on the west, and the Assamese on the east ; then of the Indian

aboriginal races, while in other provinces they have but scanty hiU tribes, counted

by thousands, we have in the western districts of Bengal many millions of these

aborigines, settled, comparatively civilised, a fecund, colonising, and migratory

people ; we have them in endless variety of both the gi-eat aboriginal families,
the Dravidian and that now generally known as the Kolarian. Partly in the
Central Provinces and partly in Bengal, it has indeed been my lot to administer the
whole of what I may call 'aboriginal India.' I may here mention that the

several aboriginal Dravidian tribes of this tract speak languages clearly Dravidian

in their roots and yet for the rest so distant from the cultivated Dravidian languages

that the common origin must be very ancient indeed. But no one who sees these
people can doubt their non-Caucasian character ; and that may go far to settle the

question whether the Dravidians of the Peninsula are of Caucasian origin, or non-
Caucasians overlaid by an Aryan over-crust.

    Again, on the north and east we have some forest tribes which may or may not
be related to the aborigines of the ulterior of India. But as soon as we get into

--the hill country we meet with every form of what may be called the Indo-Chinese

type all the way from the frontiers of Nepal on the north, along the Eastern

Himalayas, round both sides of Assam, and then on to Maneepore, the Chittagoug

hills, and the Burmese country. Here and there in this great extent of country we
have many unclassed races with peculiar languages and institutions of their own
some very savage, others far advanced in civilisation. Among the latter I might

mention, for instance, the Khassyahs, a very peculiar people with highly developed

constitutional and elective foi-ms of government, and also specially interesting as
exhibiting far the best specimen of which I have anywhere heard of the matriarchal,

or perhaps I should rather say matri-herital system fully carried out under recog-

nised and well-defined law among a civilised people. The result of observation

of the Khassyahs has been to separate in my mind the two ideas of matri-heritage

and polyandry, and to suggest that polyandry is really only a local accident, the

result of scarcity of women ; as, for instance, in some parts of the Himalayas,
where the hill women are in great demand in the adjoining plains, and the hUl men
are obliged to be content with a reduced number of women. Among the Khassyahs,

on the other hand, there is no polyandry (so far as I have been able to learn)
though there is great facility for divorce ; and heritage through the female be-

comes quite intelligible, I may say natural, when we see that the females do not leave
the maternal home and family and join any other family, as do the Aryans. They are

-- --the stock-in-trade of the family, the queen hees as it were ; they take to them-

selves husbands only one at a time and if he is divorced they may take another

but the husband is a mere outsider belonging to another family. The property of

the woman goes in the woman's family, the property of the man in his own maternal

family. It should be added, however, that in these maternal families, though the

heritage comes through the female, the males rule, as they ought to in all well-

ordered communities.

    When I administered the government of Bengal I did the best I could to obtain

a classification of our many races, and a comparison of the languages brought

together under my system of test words, and officially published in a large volume.

We owe to the unrivaUed experience of the late General Daltou a mass of informa-

tion regarding the western aboriginal tribes, comprised in his great ethnological

volume  and many other  publications                                                 and  more  recently that  very distinguished

Indian officer, Mr. A. Mackenzie, partly a Scotchman and partly a Birmingham

man, has brought together in his ' North-east Frontier of Bengal ' a full and most

interesting account of the eastern tribes. Now I am happy to say that one of my

old fellow-workers in Bengal, who at present most worthily and well administers

the government of that province, has undertaken, through Mr. Risley, a much

greater work than any of us have yet attempted, viz., a general survey of the whole

people, not only as regards their physical characteristics and languages, &c.
but also (and this is the newest and most important part of the undertaking) as

regards their institutions, laws, and social rules. It is hoped that, by obtaining

accurate information of this kind regarding the many races, tribes, and castes of
these great provinces, a flood of light maybe thrown on the social history of the human

race. It is a very great undertaking, but successfully caiTied out must have very
great results. I can conceive nothing more important and interesting, and only hope

that something of the kind may be attempted for India as a whole. Some of the

most important castes, the Brahmins for instance, are so widely spread that we can

hardly realise their position without extending the survey over India. In Bengal

I think they are little agricultural, while in some provinces they are among the best

of the agriculturists.

    I could well wish that we had systematic inquiries of this kind nearer home,

Europe is almost as good an anthropological field as India, and in our islands there

is still very much room for investigation. In my own country of Scotland, after

much asking, I have never been able to get any information who the Aberdoniana

are, and what is the language they speak, so dliferent in its forms and intonations

from the rest of Scotland. In England some most interesting maps might be

made if it were only to trace the letter A, sho'wing where it begins and where it
ends. I have a belief that though languages may be changed and cease to indicate

races, there is a great racial persistency in the letter h or the absence of it. The

Scotch and the Ii-ish have adopted the English language, but no Scotchman or

Irishman was ever in the smallest degree wanting in aspirates--an Englishman

might perhaps call them hyper-aspirators. The greater part of England, on the

contrary, is equally persistent in the dropping of A's. The whole subject is most

interesting, not only in regard to the use or omission of the h by various races, but

-- --also on account of the very singular I may say phenomenal tendency of so

many of the English neither to maintain nor to albandon the h, but simply to-

reverse the written language, omitting the h where it is written, and putting it in

where it is not, in a peculiarly aggressive manner. It has been noticed, with

truth, that we seem legitimately to drop the h in almost all words that come direct
from the Latin, as ' hour,' ' heir,' ' honor,' yet in the Latin we pronounce the h
fully. Is the spoken language the true tradition ? Can it be that, while the
Greeks spoke in aspirates which they did not write, the Romans clipped those

which they did write, and that the modern Englishman combines the practice of
these two famous races ? Or is there any foundation for what I can caU no

more than a conjecture, viz., that the real English is that spoken by the Scotch,

and that the corruption of the A's is French brought in by the Normans ? If a
language map showed the clipping of Ks, to be coincident with large Norman

settlements, that might be so. Perhaps a few hundred years ago it was the
830 BEPOKT--1886.

aristocratic thing to clip the h's, and the fashion may have gradually gone to the

lower classes like the swallow-tailed coat worn by the typical Irish peasant, while

--the upper classes have been partially reformed back to true English by contact

with the Scotch only partially, though, for they still say ' wen ' and ' wale

instead of ' when ' and ' whale,' to say nothing of ' idear ' and ' Indiar.'

This, however, is a digression. I am afraid I have been long in coining to the

main object of this address, viz. to recommend the systematic and scientific

--cultivation of man what I may call ' homi-culture,' in the same sense as ' oyster-
--culture,' ' bee-culture,' or ' cattle-culture ' and that with a view both to physical

and mental qualities. It seems very sad, indeed, that, when so much has been

done to improve and develop dogs, cattle, oysters, cabbages, nothing whatever has

been done for man, and he is left very much where he was when we have the first

authentic records of him. Knowledge, education, arts he has no doubt acquired            ;

but there seems to be no reason to suppose that the individual man is physically or
Wementally a superior creature to what he was five thousand years ago.
                                                                              are not

sure that under very modern influences he may not retrograde. No one doubts that,

by careful selection and cultivation, cattle, vegetables, and many other things have

been immensely improved. In regard to animals and plants we have very largely

mastered the principles of heredity and culture, and the modes by which good

Whyqualities may be maximised, bad qualities minimised.  should not man be

similarly improved ? It is true that the mind has a larger share in that which

--constitutes a man ; but after all this is only a question of degree the cultivation

of the mind does enter very largely into animal-culture. I apprehend there is no

doubt that the superiority for our purposes of shorthorns, black-poUed, and other

famous breeds of cattle is very largely due to placid and well-regulated minds,

which enable them to take calmly a short and happy life, and to assimilate their

food, differing in this very much from their restless and often vicious ancestors.

Surely, then, if we only had the requisite knowledge, and, taking a practical view

of life, could regulate our domestic arrangements with some degree of reason, rather

than by habit, prejudice, and the foolish ideas cultivated by foolish novelists, man

too might be greatly improved.

It may be admitted that we are not in a position to begin confident man-

culture at once. Much study is first required and much knowledge must be accu-

mulated before we can be confident in practice. The first thing that most strikes us

ia man, as compared with all domesticated and even most widely-spread wild animals,

is the extremely small variation in man all over the globe. There are diflerences

which seem large to us, but are extremely small from a more enlarged point of

Howview.  enormous are the diflPerences between difierent breeds of dogs, horses,

and cattle ! When we come to man the diflPerence of which we make most is that
-- Whoof colour a feature which we think quite trivial in animals.
                                                                              thinks very

much more highly of a white than of a black cow, of a grey horse than of a black

one ? Our skilled eyes recognise variations of human feature, but they are so slight

that the inhabitant of another planet would see no more diflerence than in the

countenances of a flock of sheep. In size, compared to other animals, the diflrer-

ences are but slight. Probably there is no race whose average height really

approaches six feet, and I doubt if any are on the average so small as five feet. In

other physical features there aie no considerable differences of formation whatever.

Then as regards the mind we have yet to learn that there are very wide differences

--of mental capacity between different races. Very likely probably, I may say
there are considerable variations, but they are not so wide as to be apparent with-

out careful and accurate study. With the superficial knowledge we have, no one

can say that Europeans, Hindus, Chinese, are born with brains superior or inferior

to the other ; and even ia regard to the negro I do not know that it is yet shown
that with equal advantages negro babies might not grow up nearly or quite as in-

telligent as Europeans. I do not say that it is so, but only that the question has

not yet been sufficiently worked out. The difference is not so radical as to be self-

evident from the first. Still, such experience as we have and the analogies derived

from domesticated animals both tend to the belief that there are considerable,

if not excessive, variations in the qualities and capacities of different races of men.

It seems to me, then, that the first object to which observation and experiment

should be directed is to ascertain how far the qualities which distinguish diiferent

races, peoples, castes, and families are congenital and hereditary, and how far the

result of education and surroundings. The distinguished President of the Anthro-

pological Institute, Mr. F. Galton, has done much to make a beginning of the

study of hereditary qualities in man, but there is still much to be done. To begin

with very rudimentary facts we hardly know whether courage in man and absence

of courage in women are natural or     artificial  qualities                                   whether right-handedness
                                                                                            ;

is natural or a very ancient fashion. Coming nearer to modern variations we do

not know how far energy, enterprise, constructive power, and all the rest of it are

qualities appertaining to particular breeds, like the qualities of pointers or grey-

hounds                                 or whether they are more the result of education and surroundino's.
                                    ;

What is the effect on mind or body of vegetable and animal food respectively, and

Whyof the use of one stimulant and another ?       do particular races affect par-
Whyticular stimulants?
                                       is the Northern European more especially given to

spirits, and the Chinese and Indo-Chinese races to opiiun ? Is there anything in

the breed that enables Britishers to rule over Hindus, or is it only education ?

Why has a Chinaman some virtues which an Irishman has not, and vice versa ?

All through the most important inquiry is to sift out those qualities in regard to

which we must look to improvement in the breed, and those which more depend
on education, so that power may not be wasted by efforts in the wrong direction

by breeding for qualities which already exist or educating where the breed renders

a particular education hopeless.

   We must try to learn the direction in which we are to work first, and then the

methods by which we may effect improvements in the ascertained direction

whether it be in the direction of breed or in that of education.

    Now to come to the practical modes by which effect might be given to some

such ideas as I have ventured to suggest.

To begin at the beginning, I think that, while so much effort and so much science

lave been expended, perhaps not very fi-uctuously, in inquiries into the origin of

man, too little systematic attention has been given to the radical differences between

the modem man and modern animals. For instance, in the matter of speech no

one can doubt that dogs and elephants and seals understand a great deal of lan-
guage. One cannot see the individuals of a pack of hounds answer to their names

without being satisfied that they not only attach a meaning to a few rude sounds,

but can distinguish niceties and refinements of language. Again, we know that

parrots and other creatures can speak our language ; but I have never seen the

question whether any one creature can both speak and understand thoroughly
worked out. Has it been carefully and thoroughly ascertained whether any animals
xeaUy cry or laugh ? Sir John Lubbock and others have given attention to the

question whether, in habitation-building, and the like, bees and ants exercise an

intelligent discretion or follow one unvarying hereditary instinct ; but I do not

think any distinct conclusion has been arrived at. Can any monkey or other

creature be educated up to the point of putting sticks on a fire and cooking chest-

nuts ? I am afraid that on all these subjects there has been nothing but very

desultory individual effort.

Then as regards man-breeding. Probably we have enough physiological know-

ledge to effect a vast improvement in the pairing of individuals of the same or allied

races if we could only apply that knowledge to make fitting marriages, instead of
^ving way to foolish ideas about love and the tastes of young people, whom we can
hardly trust to choose their own bonnets, much less to choose in a graver matter in
which they are most likely to be infiuenced by frivolous prejudices. As I am

--Dot preaching I need say no more on that all that I could say is self-evident.

But when we come to the very important question of the crossing of races there is

very great need of scientific observation and experiment. Both the general
knowledge that we have of humans and the analogy of animals tend to show the

great benefit of the crossing of breeds. Anglo-Saxon is an awkward term. I do not

stop to inquire whether it represents two races ; whether the peasant of the Lothians

is an Englishman and the peasant of the south of England a Saxon, or why one is
--832 EEPORT 1886.

superior to the other ; but using the word English for the Teutonic inhabitants of

these islands I think one can hardly doubt that the English breed crossed with

a dash of Celtic blood produces a better aninaal than either of the parent races.

Witness the people of many parts of Scotland, of Ulster, and, I believe I may also
say, of Cornwall. It is the use of the Celtic blood as an alloy that makes me

specially unwilling to see Highlanders, and even wild Irishmen, exterminated from

these islands. It may be worse for all of us if that comes to pass.
     There is a popular belief that the cross between an Englishman and a Hindu

produces a race inferior to either. I very much doubt the fact. Owing to the
caste system (and it prevails with us almost as much as with the Hindus) half-

castes are placed at a very great disadvantage, but I doubt if they are naturally

inferior ; at any rate, the question requires to be worked out. I think we have the
means of doing so if we systematically went about it. So again as regards the cross-
breeds between whites and negroes. There is so much prejudice on the subject in
the United States that it is very difficult to arrive at the truth. Some people^
think that the stimulating climate tends to make the white race in America wear

itself out, and that (apart from the present great immigration from Europe) it

would be a real improvement to the American race if the whites were crossed with

the more phlegmatic blacks, say, in the proportion of six or eight of white to one of

black, which now exists in the States. However, that is their aiFair, but a very

important question for them.

    And this brings me to the eifect of climate. Is it the fact that in course of genera-

--tions settled in America the climate alters the British race or perhaps I should say

European races ? What is the tendency of the very peculiar Australian climate ?

It has passed into a popular proverb that the European race cannot survive irt

India beyond the second or third generation ; and the result of that belief has been

of euormous practical importance, for no sort of colonisation has been attempted.

Yet I whoUy doubt if the belief can be supported by any facts whatever ; it is one

of those things that are universally believed because they have never been tried,

and therefore cannot be contradicted. Till little more than fifty years ago Euro-

--peans were not allowed to settle in India. To this day opportunities for education

and good up-bringing are very much wanting the surroundings are most unfavour-

able  to  European children                                                                       yet  a  good  many  instances  could  now  be  quoted  of  Euro-
                                                                                               ;

peans brought up in India who are physically just as good as their parents. The

mortality in the European orphan asylums is extraordinarily low. It is not at all

certain that the race might not be adapted to the climate, especially as the cool

hill regions are those least occupied by the natives, and most fit for many lucrative-

industries introduced by Europeans.

Coming to physical and mental education, I have already alluded to some

of the subjects which urgently require attention, the most important of which is,

I think, the efiect of what we call civilised life, and especially urban life. It ia

impossible to see the crowded and inferior dwellings in wbich so vast a population

lives in towns, without room for the gardens which their fathers had, and without

the space and recreations natural to man, and not to fear for the result on the

race. I might also say more on the question of physical education and on that of

a mental education so general as to leave no mere primitive jungle plants as a stock

on which to graft improved varieties ; a subject which is already engaging anxious

attention. On many other questions to which I have briefly alluded I might

enlarge, but I have detained you so long that I think you would prefer to get to

business ; and so I will conclude by recommending practical anthropology to your

earnest attention.

allied to the Foggara Abahdeh, but are a very mixed people, with much Arab blood,

Bir Gamr. They are nomads of fairly pure blood, and related to the Huv^eir of
Lower Egypt. Divided into several clans and number 2,000 men.

     The Shagiyeh, partly nomad, partly agricultural, on both banks of the Nile
from Korti to Birti, claim descent from the Beni Abbas, but are of mixed blood from

intermarriage with the Nuba, whom they dispossessed ; they preserve, however, their

Semitic type. They are divided into twelve clans ; language, Arabic.

     The Monassir, partly nomad, partly agricultural, on both banks of Nile in the
cataract country above Birti. They are of mLxed Arab, Nuba, and Beja blood,
and claim descent from Mausiir, brother of Abad, the grandfather of the

Ababdeh.

     The Rohatab are semi-nomads, and occupy the country in the bend of the Nile

at Abu Hamed. They are of mixed Arab and Niiba blood, and claim descent from

the Beni Abbas.

the clans have largely intermarried with the Nuba. The Semitic type is clear,

though different from the Shagiyeh. They are divided into a large number of

clans. The Jailin and Shagiyeh have adopted the non-Semitic custom of cutting

the face.

     The Battahin, on the Blue Nile near Khartiim, appear to be of mixed Arab and

Nuba blood.
     The Shukriyeh are nomads between the Atbara and the Blue Nile, and

apparently of Arab origin.
     The Baggara tribes of Kerdofan are true nomad Arabs ; the date of their

arrival in the Sudan is uncertain, but they appear to have gradually drifted up the
Nile valley. They are little known, but amongst the tribes are the Duguaim,
Jawameah, Hamr, Jalaydat, Hawazim, Bedayriah, Kenana, Howara, and Beni

Gerar.

     The Niiba are an essentially agricultural people and indigenous to the country.
They form the population of the Nile valley from Assiian to Korti, and are widely
scattered over Sennar, Kordofan, and Darfiir. They speak a language called
Rotana. In Kemis they are much mixed with Arab blood, and some families claim
descent from the Koreish. The purest Niiba blood is found in Jebel Daier, Jebel
Takalla, and Dar Nuba, where the people have maintained their independence.

         3, On the Celtic and Oermanic Besigns on Runic Crosses.
            By Professor Boyd Dawkins, M.A., F.E.S., F.S.A.

In dealing with the ornamentation of Runic crosses it is very generally assumed

by archaeologists, that the early Irish MSS., such as the Book of Kells and the

illuminated gospels of St. Guthbert and St. Chad, are of pure Irish art, and that

consequently the interlacing ' rope ' or ' basket ' work pattern is distinctly Irish and

Celtic. It is, however, an assumption which may readily be disposed of by an

appeal to the distribution of the designs on ornaments and monuments in the
WeBritish Isles, and in France, Scandinavia, and Germany.
                                                                                                                                                                                                        will consider them

under two heads. 1st. The scroll, spiral, and flamboyant work, consisting of

--graceful combinations of curves ; and, secondly, the interlacing work, more or less

square and angular the ' rope ' or ' basket.' The first of these two styles first
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  835

appears in the British Isles, Scandinavia, France, and Germany, in infinitely

remote Prehistoric times, in the Bronze Age, and suhsequently became more and
more elaborate in the Prehistoric Iron Age, constituting the late Celtic art of Mr.

Franks. This may be proved by the examination of the various collections in those
countries. This art was probably ultimately derived from the centres of civilisa-

tion in South Europe, principally Greek and Etruscan, and has clearly been proved
by Chantre to have been introduced into France from Italy.

     From its prevalence among the Celts of the British Isles and of France it is
justly termed Celtic, and it was dominant in these regions down to the time of the
retreat of the Roman legions before theu- Germanic foes. I do not know of a single

case of its association with the interlacing pattern in those regions in any design

of a date before the time of the Germanic invasion.

     The interlacing pattern of Class II. is conspicuous by its absence from Irish art
until the days of early Irish Christianity. It may be traced far and wide over
Europe, and among warriors who owed nothiug to Irish art. It occurs in finds
proved beyond controversy to be Germanic or Teutonic, using the term to include

also the Scandinavians. In Britain it is the ruhng design, in Anglian and Saxon
finds, in cemeteries and in barrows, such, for example, as that recently explored at
Taplow. In France it is associated with the remains of the Germanic invaders,
Merovingian, Frankish, and others. It has been met with both in Switzerland
and Italy, and generally on the Continent in those regions into which the German
tribes penetrated. It does not occur in France or the British Isles in association
with any remains of a date before the Germanic tribes had begun to move to the

attack of the Roman Empire. From these facts it may be concluded that it is
distinctly Germanic, and not Celtic, and stiU less ' pure Irish.' Whence it was

ultimately derived is a question which need not be discussed in this place.
     The association of the Celtic graceful spiral and flamboyant with the Germanic

design, not only in the early Irish MSS., but in Irish chalices and ornaments, may

readily be accounted for by the influence of the Germanic tribes (including

Scandinavians) not only in Ireland in the eighth and following centuries, but in those
parts of Europe traversed by the Irish missionaries. It is only reasonable to suppose

that the men who introduced Christianity into Scandinavia and North Germany,
and foimded the great abbey of St. GaU in Switzerland, should have fallen under the

influence of Germanic art, and have combined the native Celtic with the foreign

Germanic designs. As a matter of fact the two styles were so combined not only

in Ireland but in Scotland and England, and generally on the Continent wherever
the Celtic and Germanic peoples lived side by side. It may, therefore, be concluded
that the Irish illuminated MSS. cannot be taken as the tests of pure Irish, or even
of Celtic art, but that a large part of the ornamentation is due to contact with
Germanic art.

        4. Notes on Natives of the Kimherley District, Western Australia,

                         By Edward J. Hardman, F.E.G.S.I.

     During two visits to the Kimberley District in the years 1883 and 1884 the
author had opportunities of studying the characteristics and customs of the
Aborigines. The district is in the extreme tropical portion of Western Australia.
The natives, however, differ but little in appearance from other tribes of the
Australian continent, except that they are somewhat superior in physique, and
appear to be, on the whole, rather more intelligent than the southern races. The
initiatory rites of the young men and the marriage laws are peculiarly interesting,
and exhibit many differences from those hitherto observed upon. Circumcision
and other similar but more severe operations are undergone by the youths, and the
females in some parts al^o submit to painful initiatory rites. There are four mar-

-- --riage sects Paljari, Kimera, Bannighu, and Boorungoo and no member of any

one of these sects can marry into it. He or she must marry into another sect

concerning which there are rigid rules laid down. Thus Paljari marries Kimera'
Bannighu marries Boorungoo, and in both cases the children belong to one of the'

                                                                                                               3H2

other sects, not those of either of the parents. These matters were entered into in
some detail, together vnth a description of general habits and customs, native
weapons, implements, &c. The author exhibited some photographs of the native

men and women, and also four skulls of the KimlDerley natives, which he had

brought home, and which have been measured and described by Dr. Phin. S.
Abraham, F.E,. C.S.I.

5. Ohservations on Four Crania, fromKimherley, West Australia (Mr. Hard-

  man's Collection). By P. S. Abraham, M.A., M.D., B.Sc, F.RC.S.I.

     For convenience of reference, the specimens are marked A, B, C, and D. The
measurements have been taken in accordance with the rules laid down by Broca,

Flower, Topinard, and other modern anthropologists. In estimating the capaci-

ties, with Xo. 8 shot, I had the kind assistance of Mr. Oldfield Thomas, cf the

Natural History Department, British Museum.

The skulls present many of the typical Australian characters : they are dolico-

cephalic and micro-cephalic, and with prominent supra-orbital ridges in the males ;

they are remarkable, however, in being by no means prognathous or platyrhine.
       Dare without doubt the crania of adult males, and is the skull of a
A and

female, probably past middle life. In its slight development of supra-orbital and

Bmuscular ridges, has a strong resemblance to a female skull ; but from the fact

that its last molars have not yet appeared, and that the cranial sutures (except the

basilar) are not united, it may possibly have belonged to a young male. This is
Athe more likely, for, as in the case of the undoubtedly male skulls and 0, one or
Amore of the incisor teeth have been removed.
                                               and B have thus had the two inner

incisors, and C only the right inner incisor, extracted in early youth. The corre-

sponding alveoli have, in consequence, so closed up that the basi-alveolar length in

A Band could not be taken with accuracy. It is clear, however, that C is, for an

DAustralian, remarkably orthognathous, while is mesognathous.

    As in the skulls of other low races, the cranial sutures are in all the specimens

Acomparatively simple. Wormian bones are present in and C, and an epipteric

in A. In B, on the right side, the frontal and squamosal bones nearly meet at the

pterion. The nasal indices are all mesorhine, while the orbital index is mesoseme-

in A, B, and D, and microseme in C.

    The forehead in A, B, and C is low and very receding, and the brain-case is-

arched and very narrow above, so as to be actually scapho-cephalic. In D, on the

other hand, the forehead and the vault of the cranium are of a much higher type.

In the smallness and flatness of its nasal bones, however, and in some other facial

D Anpoints, exhibits lower characters than the others.  imperfect lower jaw

     Experimentally hy such conditions I have produced the disease. Wherever
these conditions are, there consumption is found : wherever these conditions are
absent, there the disease is unknown : and upon the introduction of the former into
the latter the disease makes its appearance. Evidence given to prove these points.

     The causal conditions are those that habitually tend to disuse of the lungs and
those that habitually compress or inflict direct injury upon the lungs. Examples

given.

     There are therefore two distinct objects to be accomplished in the prevention

of consumption. On the one hand we have to secure an adequate amount of

breathing capacity in proportion to the rest of the body, and on the other to
prevent either compression of the chest or injury to the lungs. This can be done
by adopting those measures that tend to the development of the breathing capacity
and suppressing or obviating those conditions that compress or injure the lungs.

By adopting measures is meant placing men, women, and children under conditions

of habitation, clothing, education, and urging upon them habits that tend indi-
Andually and collectively to develop the lungs. Some details on these points and
on the prevention of inhalation of small particles of various substances and com-
pression of chest were also given.

      Diagrams showing the effect on the proportion of the chest to the rest of the
body due to various conditions from health to consumption were shown.

7. Dragon Sacrifices at the Vernal Equinox. By George St. Clair, F.G.S.

The object of this paper was to show that human sacrifice, which prevailed

extensively in early times, was a custom connected especially with the Vernal

Equinox, and that the offerings were made to appease a mythical dragon which

made its demand at that time. The Dragon of mythology is identified and defined,

and it is shown in what sense he opened his jaws at the spring season of the year.

    Human sacrifices have been ofiered from motives which ought to be respected.

In Egypt they had been abolished at an early period ; but in Greece we have his-

torical instances. By-and-by substitution came about, and took various forms,

one form being to ofier one victim when danger threatened (and the gods demanded)

a multitude. Death or the Grave was propitiated in this way, and it came to be

symbolised by Darlmess, because the heavenly bodies went down into darkness in

the course of their revolution. The Darkness was symbolised by a Dragon. In

eclipses the darlmess devours the sun  or  moon                       nocturnal  darkness  swallows  the
                                                                   ;

sun and stars ; but the chief antitj'pe of the Dragon is the winter half of the great

year of the precession cycle. By the rule of reversal which belongs to the great

year the darkness encroaches on the eastern side of the heavens, and the dragon

opens its jaws at the vernal equinox.

    Human sacrifice was practised more especially at the spring of the year, or (in

other instances) in honour of deities who once presided over equinox constellations.
Artemis and Cronus, to whom this homage was chiefly shown, were both connected

with the zodiacal sign Scorpio : and, according to M. Ernest de Bunsen, Scorpio

was the starting-point of the primitive calendar. If the festival of Saturn did not

--get displaced or misplaced through the precession movement, it was still a festival

in honour of the god of the under world and that meant death and the gi'ave.

    Tradition says that human sacrifices were abolished by Hercules. As Scorpio

rises with Hercules, and ceases to be a dark sign, the mythology is consistent with

itself.

     The paper might end here, but a paragraph is added to show that the Hebrew
Passover may be explained as an equinox festival, at which a lamb was offered as

a substitute mercifully provided in the later legislation, in place of an earlier sacri-
fice corresponding to that of PhcEnicians and Greeks. But the tradition of child-
sacrifice was kept up by the enemies of the Jews, and is the origin of the false and
cruel blood-accusation made so often in the Middle Ages, and occasionally still on

the Continent.

1. Evidence of Pre-glacial Man in North Wales.
           By Hexey Hicks, M.B., F.B.S.

The author described the conditions under which some flint implements had

been discovered during the researches carried on by Mr. E. B. Luxmoore and him-

self in the Ffvnnon Beuno and Cae Gwyn caves, in the Vale of Clwyd, in the

years 1884-86. These caverns were explored by them for the first time in 1884,

and some of the results were given by the author in a paper at the last meeting of

the British Association. The facts then obtained had led him to the conclusion

that Pleistocene animals and man must have occupied the caverns before the glacial

drifts which occur in the area had been deposited, as it had been found that, although

the caverns are now 400 feet above ordnance datum, the materials within them had

been disturbed by marine action since the Pleistocene animals and man had occupied

them. Moreover, glacial deposits, with foreign pebbles, wei'e found in the caverns

overlying the bones. Last year a grant was made by the British Association for

the purpose of carrying on the explorations, chiefly with the object of obtaining

further evidence as to the age of the deposits in the caverns. The results obtained

this year are highly confirmatory of the author's views, and have a very important

beaiing on the antiquity of man in Britain. It was found that a hidden entrance
to the Cae Gwyn cave had been blocked up by a considerable thickness of glacial

deposits which must have accumulated subsequently to the occupation of the cave

Aby the Pleistocene mammals.  shaft was dug through these deposits, in front of

the entrance, to a depth of over 20 feet, and in the bone earth which extended

outwards under the glacial deposits on the south side of the entrance a small

well-worked flint flake was discovered, its position being about 18 inches beneath

the lowest bed of sand. It seems clear that the contents of the cavern must have

been washed out by marine action during the great submergence in the glacial

period, and then covered by marine sand and an upper boulder clay. The author

-- --beUeves that the flint implements lance-heads and scrapers found in the caverns

are also of the same age as this flint flake, hence that they must all have been the

work of Pre-glacial man.

2. On the recent Bxploration of Gop Cairn and Cave.
   By Professor Boyd Dawkess, M.A., F.B.S. , F.S.A.

The exploration of Gop Cairn and Cave near Gop Hall, Newmarket, St. Asaph,

now being carried on by Mr. Pochin, Mr. P. G. Pochin, and Professor Boyd

Dawkins, has up to the present time yielded the following results :

The cairn commonly known as ' Queen Boadicea's Tomb,' and commanding a

magnificent view over the Vale of Clwyd, and to the Snowdonian range, over

the Irish Sea, and the plain of Lancashire and Cheshire, is composed of blocks of

Welimestone, and is about 40 feet high and about 300 long and 200 broad.  sunk

a shaft near the centre 26 feet deep, down to the limestone rock, and drove an adit

from the bottom in an N.E. direction and 30 feet long, both of which had to be

heavily timbered, and carefully carried out by experienced miners. In following

--the surface of the rock the only remains met with were a few refuse-heap bones of

hog, sheep, or goat, and of ox or horse too fragmentary to be accurately deter-

mined. These are, Irowever, of the usual kind found almost universally in Britain
840 KEPOET-- 1886.

in burial-places of the Neolithic and Bronze ages. The cairn itself is similar in
character to that near Mold in the same district, in which a skeleton was discovered
in 1832, lying at full length, clad in a golden corselet, now in the British Museum,

and adorned with 300 amber beads. An urn, full of ashes and other remains, was

also met with. Its large size implies that it was raised in honour of some chieftain
conspicuous above his fellows. The trifling results of this exploration, carried on
at the cost of Mr. Pochin, are due to our not having as yet hit upon the interment,
which we hope to do by further operations.

     AVhile the cau-n was being attacked Mr. P. G. Pochin discovered a cave 141
feet to the south-west of Gop Cairn, which Iiad been known many years as a fox's
earth, and the entrance of which was completely blocked up with earth and stones.

On digging it out we found it to consist of a rock shelter, ending in two hoi-izontal

passages blocked up either completely or within a few inches of the roof. In the
lowest strata of red and yellow claj's, mixed with stones, some of which were
derived from the boulder clay of the district, were the gnawed and broken bones
and teeth of the woolly rhinoceros, bison, horse, reindeer, stag, roe, and cave-
hysena, which belong to the Pleistocene ."Vge, and are similar to those which have
been discovered by Dr. Hicks, Prof. Hughes, myself, and others in various caverns
in the Vale of Clwyd.

     Above this was a deposit containing fragments of charcoal and large quantities
of broken bones of animals wild and domestic, comprising the badger, fox, marten,
the sheep, or goat, the Bos longifrons, horse, and the hog. These were mingled
with round stones which had been used as pot-boilers, and a few flint splinters.
Near the entrance of the rock-shelter the charcoal was very abundant, and slabs of
limestone, burned on their upper surfaces, pointed out the position of the fire-places.
This upper accumulation is mainly an old refuse-heap, and its date is fixed by
some of the fragments of pottery, one of which bears the rim and ornamentation
so commonly met with in pottery of the Bronze Age. This refuse-heap may, there-
fore, be referred to a period of occupation by them during the Bronze Age.

     Besides the above-mentioned remains in the refuse-heap, there were human
bones, which increased in number as we dug our way to a square sepulchral

 chamber, 4 feet 10 inclies x 4 feet 10 inches x .3 feet 10 inches, three sides of which
 were formed of walls of slabs of limestone, the fourth by the inner side of the rock-

shelter, and the top by the limestone roof of the cave. It was packed with human

 skulls and bones of all ages, in the greatest confusion, and evidently interred from

time to time. From the association of the bones, however, it was clear that it had

 not been used merely as an ossuary, but that the bodies themselves had been placed
 there with the bones in their proper positions, those of the ankle, for example.
 Along with these were two jet liaks, shaped like gimblet-handles, a beautifully
 polished flint flake, ground down to the thinness of ^o of ^^ inch, and with the edges
 carefully bevelled ; and some fragments of rude pottery, ornamented with chevrons,
 and with the moulding round the rim of the pattern usually met with in sepulchral
 urns of the Bronze Age. The sepulchral character may, therefore, be referred to the

 same relative date as the refuse-heaps, and we may conclude that caves were used

 in North Wales for habitation and for sepulture in the Bronze Age, as I have already
 proved them to have been so used in the Neolithic Age in this district.

      The numerous human remains throw great light on the ethnology of this
 district in the Bronze Age. The sepulchral caves near Ruthin, and the sepulchral
 caves and tombs of the Vale of Clwyd prove, as I pointed out many years ago, that
 in the Neolithic Age the population of this part of Wales was of the Iberic type
 so widely spread through Europe. In Gop Cave the oval-headed Iberic type is
 traceable in all the skulls but one. This exception, from its compactness and
 absence of strong muscular ridges, may be inferred to have belonged to a woman.
 It is round, prognathous, and with largely developed cheek-bones, and presents all

--the characters which are usually found in the round-headed Celt a race which

 invaded Gaul and Spain in the Neolithic Age, but which was unknown in Britain
 until the age of Bronze. It is interesting to note that men of the Iberic race were
 greatly preponderant in the Vale of Clwyd in the Bronze Age. The presence of
 one Celtic skull in their sepulchre marks the beginning of the fusion of the two
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  841

--races in tliis district a fusion which has heen going- on ever since, and by which the

Iberic type is at the present time being slowly obliterated. The Iberic type still

lingers in the Vale of Clwyd, but even within my memory it has become rarer

than it formerly was.

   3. On the recent Exploration of Sowls's Barroiv. By W. Cunnington.

     Mr. Cunnington described some further explorations he and his brother have
recently made of Bowls's Barrow, near Heytesbury, in South Wilts. The re-
searches have been made at the east end of the barrow, where the original cist has
been found empty, but with a skull near it ; several other skuUs were also found in
a more or less broken condition. Facing the floor of the barrow, near where the
skeleton was found, was a black unctuous earth which, on recent examination, has
been found to contain a large quantity of ammoniacal salts. Separated from the cist,
at the east end of the barrow, several horns of oxen have been found, in addition to
those already found some years ago. The skulls and other human remains which
have been found are primary burials, and were covered by large blocks of Sarsen
stone, some weighing from 200 lbs. to 300 lbs.

     The skulls recently obtained by Mr. Cunnington from Bowlss Barrow are of
large size, and long and narrow in form. The average proportion of the breadth

of the skulls to their length is as 72'1 to 100. Two of the skulls are hyper-

dolichocephalic, that is to say, they have a cephalic index laying from 65-70 ; three
are dolichocephalic, 70-75 ; and one is mesaticephalic, 75-80. In general outlines they
present two distinct forms, namely, elongated oval, and what is called coffin-
shaped. The ridges above the nose and eyes are fully marked and the»skulls have

generally a smooth appearance. The nose is straight and the teeth are much worn.
They also conform in every respect to the Long Barrow type, and are all those of
adult males. Many of them bear the marks of sharp-cutting instruments. These

circumstances seem to point out the probabiUty of the barrow being the burial-

place of those who have fallen in war. Besides the skulls there were numerous

bones of the extremities found. These were generally strong, and the muscular
ridges well marked, showing the people to have had good muscular development.
Of the existing inhabitants of this country the Iberian race inhabiting parts of
Wales and the West of England seem to be the descendants of this Long Barrow

race.

5. On a Scrohicularia Bed containing Human Bones, at Newton Ahbot,
                 Devonshire. By W. Pengellt, F.B.8., F.0.8.

     This communication consisted of a description of a bed of fine sandy mud,
11 feet thick, crowded from top to bottom with shells of Scrohicularia piperata,
and recently discovered near the head of the tidal estuary of the River Teign,
Devonshire. Its top was 1 foot above the level of the highest spring tides in the
estuary, and its bottom 3 feet above the level of low water. At a depth of 10 feet
in the bed were found the following human bones : a skull, part of the left superior

--maxiUa containing two teeth, a right scapula, and a right femur all believed to be

of the age of the deposition of the part of the bed in which they lay. There is
apparently no doubt, from the presence of the Sa-obiculari<e, that since the era of
the deposition the entire district has undergone an upheaval not less than 14 feet,
nor more than 27 feet ; the same upheaval, in all probability, which elevated the

-- --raised beach of Hope's Nose about 7 miles S.E. of the Scrohicularia bed as well

as those extending thence, at intervals, to the Land's End of England.

      6. Papuans and Polynesians. By the Rev. G. Brown, F.B.G.8.

     After more than fourteen years spent in the Samoa Group amongst a true Eastern

Polynesian people, the writer resided for some years in the New Britain Group,
amongst a pure Melanesian or Papuan people. There was no white man in the

group at the time of his arrival, and the people were quite unailected by foreign
intercourse. Whilst engaged in reducing this language to a written form, and
studying its grammatical construction, Mr. Brown was led to alter or very much
modify his previous opinion that the Polynesian and Papuan languages were radi-
cally separate and distinct from each other, and to conclude that they are both of
one common origin, the Papuan representing now the more archaic form. Mr,
Brown, in his paper, gave a detailed account of the principal theories on the subject
of the origin of the different Polynesian tribes, as advanced by Messrs. Wallace,
Vaux, Ranken, Keane, Fornander, Staniland Wake, and other writers, and ex-

pressed his own opinion that the Papuans and Polynesians were of one common

stock, of which the former was the least affected by immigration from the main-
land. This opinion the writer attempted to justify by a comparison of the two
languages and the manners and customs of each race. The customs at birth, the
class relationships of the Papuans, and the survival of them in Eastern Polynesia,
the marriage customs, etiquette, the social and religious customs of both peoples,
were compared, and in the opinion of the writer the comparison justified the
opinion which he had formed.

     The following Papers and Reports were read :

          1. What is an Aryan ? By Sir George Campbell, E.G. S.I.

   --The question is What are the traits to distinguish an Aryan ? He is seldom

pure. He seems to have been a sort of monster, developed in comparatively recent
times, who has conquered and absorbed older races. He is easily distinguishable

from Turanians and Negroes (e.ff., a Constantinople Turk is an Aryan), but it is very
difficult to distinguish between Aryan and Semitic, craniology notwithstanding.

  --Let us deal with 1, colour; 2, features.

   --There are two great branches of Aryans dark branch in India ; fair branch in

Europe, including Asia Minor. Part of Western Asia (e.*;., Hindoo Koosh) may

be classed as intermediate. Seeing various castes of Hindoos and Aborigines to-
gether, one cannot doubt that besides climate Hindoo Aryans get dark colour from
the Aborigines. So also the Celts have derived a dark tinge from the Iberians,

&c. The fairest Aryans are in north of Europe, but they also are not pure. Was

the original Aryan white, or has he been blanched in the North ? I incline to think
that he was light brown in his original state, and has been blacked or blanched
in the South-east and North-west.

     Next as to features. What are the true Aryan features ? God finished the
Celt by running His hand up the face ; the Teuton by stroking him down. That

means that the Celt has lost some of the high, prominent features of the purer
Aryans. The idea is, the large high features are the real Aryan. But the
greatest development and exaggeration of that sort of feature is found in the races

-- --of Western Asia notably the Jews whom we deem Semitic where flux and

reflux of conquest have mixed Aryans and Semitics ; but high featui'es prevail
among Jews and Syrians, Northern Arabs, Persians, Affghans, and Kaffirs of the

--Hindoo Koosh. The Southern Arabs are very different small, dark, more snub-

featured men ; and the Arab language has more African than Aryan affinities. I

suspect these are true Semitic, and not the Northern Arabs of Persian affinities.
     I incline to believe that what we call Jewish features as seen in Persians,

Affghans, &c., are the real Aryan features, and that they have been toned down by

intermixtures in India and Europe. ^
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                              843

   We find a remarkable similarity of feature in the fair and dark Aryans if

we compare European and Indian features. But I confess that the subject is very
puzzling. I should be glad of light on the questions: What are the true Aryan

features ? What the Semitic ? And how are we to distinguish between the two ?

2. The Influence of Canadian Climate on European Baces.

        By Professor W. H. Hingston, M.D., D.G.L.

A few preliminary observations were made on the physical geography of Canada

and its influence in controlling climate. Its extent was shown by its boundaries :

the Arctic Ocean on the north ; Baffin's Bay and Davis' Straits on the north and

north-east ; the Atlantic on the east ; the Pacific on the west ; and line 45° and
the Great Lakes on the south. Of the interior valley of North America Canada

--occupied the greater part a valley which passes through the entire northern zone.

The contents of this valley, and it contains the St. Lawrence basin, were described

--the watersheds of which cover 130,000 square miles. The Lawrentides on the

north, and the hills of Isotre-Dame on the south, were alluded to, and their mode-

rating influence on climate, their extent, the form, extending from the coast of

Labrador to the Arctic Sea, and varying in height from 1,000 to 4,000 feet. The

low altitude of Canada (300 to 500 feet) greatly modified its climate, and gave to

Canada a great range of animal and vegetable life.
AThe climate of Canada is regular and is influenced by position alone.
                                                                        know-

ledge of the climate of two distant places led to a knowledge of the climate of in-

tervening places. Its dryness was proverbial, but more rain falls usually than in

Great Britain, but at longer intervals, and more at a time. The different seasons

were described their great regularity, and the regularity of advent and departure
                                                                                     ;

of animals and birds. The difference in vegetation was hastily considered ; and

lastly, the influence of the climate on man. The effects of heat and of cold were
according as they were immediate, remote, or continued. Heat was much more

easily and comfortably borne than the same temperature in Great Britain, as the

dryness of the atmosphere favoured evaporation from the surface of the body and

produced sensible coolness. Cold in winter is stimulating, and Europeans become

quickly inured to it without suffering inconvenience in the meantime, provided

they took indigenous customs as their guide in the selection of food and clothing.

The tables of mortality were considered. The death-rate was not large, except

in early life ; but the death-rate among children is high because the birth-rate is

enormous. The natural increase is the best proof of the healthiness of the climate.

There are 7io diseases indigenous to Canada, but diseases of all kinds, as met with

elsewhere, are considerably modified in course and duration. Deaths from re-

mittent fever are less frequent than in any other portion of America. The ephe-

mera are trivial, and intermittent fever, which is almost unknown in the eastern

portions of Canada, is becoming rapidly dissipated in its more western parts.

Great stress was laid on the importance of Canada to the consumptive and the

dyspeptic, and a few remarks on the habits of the people were made, and ex-

periments were alluded to which went to show that in height, weight, and lumbar

strength the residents of Canada had given unmistakable signs of advancement

over the peoples from which they are sprung.

        3. Traces of Ancient Sun Worship in Hampshire and Wiltshire.

                              By T. W. Shore, F.G.8.

     The outlying stone towards the north-east from the so-called Altar Stone at
Stonehenge has long been considered to have been so placed to denote the line of
the midsummer sunrise. If a tangential line be supposed to be drawn from the

northern part of the outer circle of stones to the outlying stone above referred to,

this line will denote the line of sunrise at the beginning of May. The three chief
Celtic festivals were those of the Summer Solstice, the Winter Solstice, and that
of Spring, from which the comparatively modern May-day festival is a survival.
«44 REPORT-- 1886.

Another outlying stone at Stonebenge marks tlie line of the mid-winter sunrise along-
a tangential line drawn to it from the outer circle of stones.

     Some ancient Celtic earthwork lines in Hampshire and Wiltshire are in the
same directions, and in some instances as many as three sides of such earthworks
are in lines which mark the lines of sunrise or sunset at the dates of the Celtic
festivals. The gates in some of the Celtic oppidi in these counties are also situated
on the same lines. The same reverence for the east-north-east line, or about
20° N. of E., seems to have prevailed in Romano-British time. At Itchen Abbas
there is a pavement having on it a figure, considered to be the head of Osiris, the
Sun God, the line of which, drawn through the head of the figure parallel with the
sides of the pavement is to the E.N.E. The sun reverence of the Celts appears to
have been transmitted to Anglo-Saxon times in Hampshire. There must have been
a very gTeat intermixture of race in this part of Britain after the Saxon Conquest, as
IS shown by the survival of a large number of Celtic place and water names, and also
by the existence of a large number of slaves through the period of the West Saxon
listory down to the date of the Domesday Book, at which time the proportion of
slaves in Hampshire was as one to five of the population. As many as 132 churches
in Hampshire are mentioned in the Domesday Book, and a few of these buildings
survive in whole or in part. As many as from eighty to one hundred of the ancient
churches in Hampshire have. an orientation closely approaching the E.N.E., gene-
rally 20° N. of E., and two of the undoubted Saxon structures still remaining in
part have this orientation. No church which was built in Norman time has any
orientation towards the E.N.E. , the general line of the Norman buildings being

E. and W. The reverence for the E.N.E. line appears to have disappeared in

Hampshire at the time of the Norman Conquest.

4. The Life History of a Savage. Bij the Rev. George Brown, F.B.O.S.

Commencing with the birth of the child, when a warm banana leaf was placed

against him, and he was fed with the juice of the cocoa-nut, and left to be ever after

' dressed in pure sunshine,' the author described the games of his boyhood, his ini-
tiation into certain secret rites, the ceremonies at the feasts particularly at the one

-- --at which he was taught to curse his enemies and his marriage. At that time there

was an interchange of goods and a distinct payment for the wife. Presents were

ulso given by the woinen to the bride, and by the men to the husband, and after a

spear bad been given to the latter, and a broom to the former, a stick was given to

the husband. The spear meant that the husband was to protect his wife, and the

broom that with that the wife was to do her household work, and the stick was a

--symbol of his authority or, in plain English, ' here's the stick with which to

whack her if she does not.' At the time of death the cries of the friends were very

piteous and touching. The dead was cried to to come back, was expostulated with

for having left his friends, was entreated to say how his friends had offended him,

and so on, the mourners seeming to be speaking in the very presence of the spirit oJF

the dead person. Among these black races he had many dear friends, men who

could be talked to with pleasure, and from whose conversation benefit could be

got. The more they studied the life and character of these people whom they

thought so degraded, if they would only come down to their level, talk to them,

and try to get out of them what they knew, the more it would be found that there

was more poetry and common sense in their ideas than they had been given credit

for. They had intuitive perceptions of right and wrong according to their lights
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

many of the things which his hearers would call good they called good, and they

--had a definite idea of a future state, and also of a definite punishment, for one

offender the niggardly man. When the old man came near death he was put

 upon  a  litter  and  carried  round  to  see  the  old  scenes  amid                                                                      which  he    had  passed  his

,

life,  his canoe, the sea, all  the    old  familiar subjects                                                                               and then he  was taken back
                                                                                                                                         ;

to wait his time. After death, he was placed in a sitting posture, and taken into

the public square, with his weapons by his side, and before him the people placed

offerings of their valuable goods and money. The idea was that the spirit was

near, but about to go, and that he must be provided for his journey ; aud here they
found something like the old Greek practice of placing a coin in the hands of the
dead to pay the ferryman.

5. Note on Photographs of Mummies of Ancient Egijptian Kings, recently
       unrolled at BoulaTi. By Sir J. William Dawson, C.M.G., F.B.S.

     These photographs, representing the mummies of Seti I.,Eameses II., andRa-
meses III., have been kindly communicated by Dr. Schweinfurth, of Cairo. They are

of great interest as enabling us to see the actual features of these ancient Egyptian
kings, and to compare them with their representations in the monuments, and with
modern Egyptians. It appears that the features of Seti are scarcely of Egyptian
type, as represented either by the monuments of the older dynasties or by the
present Egyptians ; though, as Dr. Schweinfurth shows in a drawing accompanying
the photographs, a similar style of countenance still exists among the Copts. It
also appears that the features of Rameses II. strongly resemble those of his father,
and are very like those on some of his statues. Both Seti and Rameses have narrow

and somewhat retreating foreheads and strongly developed jaws, indicating men of
action rather than of thought, and both were men of great stature and bodily

Aigour, and seem to have lived to advanced ages.

     Dr. Schweinfurth, in a letter accompanying the photographs, invites especial

attention to the fact that mummies when unrolled speedily decay, and thinks that

the Association should exert its influence in behalf of the preservation of these

precious relics, either by restoring their wrappings or by placing them in air-tight

cases, so that they may escape the destruction which has fallen on so many
mummies in European museums.

7. Notes on a Tau Gross on the Badge of a Medicine Man of the Queen
                      Charlotte Islands. By R. G. Haliburton.

The author said this badge was interesting, as Queen Charlotte Island is one of

the most isolated of the Northern Pacific islands. It lies off the west coast of

British Columbia. This symbol was used by the Indians on large sheets of copper,

to which they assigned a high value, and each of which they called a ' tau.' The

Tconnection of that name with the symbol is world-wide. Our        is simply the

tau symbol, and is called ' tee ' or ' tau.' The medicine men represent the tau

sometimes on the forehead. The ancients used to mark the captives who were to

be saved with a tau or cross. Ezekiel refers to this, and the word he uses for ' the

sign ' to be marked on the foreheads of them that are to be saved, really is ' the

tau ' or ' cross.'

No one has divined why the scarab was so sacred. He was led to a solution

by seeing an exaggerated tau cross on the back of a scarab. On looking into the

Egyptian name for the scarab he found it to be tore, and that the sutures on the

beetle form a tau cross. But the same name is applied to the same beetle by our

--peasantry, ' tor-beetle,' or ' dor-beetle.' Wilkinson represents a god with a scarab

for a head and one of the names of which was tore. The use of the prehistoric

or pre-Christian cross ia world-wide, and a puzzling problem which he would not

enlarge upon.

                   8. Remains of Prehistoric Man in Manitoba.
                             By Charles N. Bell, F.B.G.8.

     The author in this paper announced the existence in the Canadian North-west
of sepulchral mounds, and pointed out the hitherto unknown fact that there is a con-
846 REPOET-- 1886.

tinuous line of mounds from the mound centres of the Mississippi River down the

Red River to Lake Winnipeg. Human remains, much decayed, are found in the

mounds, all buried by being placed on the surface under heaps of earth in which

patches of charcoal and ashes frequently occur, though no remains of funeral feasts,

as bones, &c., are met with. Indians, when first met with, buried weapons with

warriors, but none are found in these mounds, though implements and ornaments

of shell, bone, and stone are common, as well as pottery, which last was unknown

to Indians of North-west Canada on arrival of whites. One mound has burnt clay

and boulder floor similar to the ' Sacrificial Mounds and Altars' of Ohio. Orna-

ments of sea-shells, which must have been carried fully 1,200 miles from their

native waters, have been found by the author and others in the mounds. Traditions

prevalent amongst Indians were given and proved to be not founded on fact. An

ancient camp site had been discovered and explored by the author on the bank of Red
ARiver, near the group of mounds.
                                   description was given of burial customs of

North-west tribes as practised when first visited by whites, and comparison drawn

between those customs and the mound form. Moimds from Lake Winnipeg to the

Gulf of Mexico have been found of the same character, and were probably made by

one race, though the whites found great diversity of mortuary customs prevailing

amongst Indian tribes inhabiting this great tract of country. Little exploration

has yet been made in the Canadian North-west, which offers a wide and productive

field to archaeologists. The mounds are very ancient and are situated in what were

the best game districts.

           1. The Sea-Coast from Westgate to Margate, Kent.

                        By EiCHARD B. Grantham, M.Inst.C.E., F.G.S.

                                                     Northumberland Chambers, Northumberland Avenue, London, W.C.
                                                                                             August 1886.

      In continuing the Keport of the Committee of the British Association on the
 ' Erosion of Sea-Coasts ' for this meeting, I have selected a part of the coast of
 Kent which is remarkable for the manner in which it has been affected by the action
 of the sea, namel}-, the Chalk Cliffs between Westgate-on-Sea and the Infirmary at
 Margate.

      The country inland is composed of clay and loam overlying the chalk formation,
 and the line of cliffs referred to is about a mile in length, and, as shown on the
 diagram on page 8.50, runs east and west from the roadway at Westgate on the
 west to the Infirmary at Margate on the east.

     My object in selecting this line of coast is to show the peculiar manner in which

 the sea has eroded it. The cliffs vary from 25 to 40 feet in height above the shore, or
 a mean of 30 feet, and average about 35 feet in height above ordnance datum, and
 they are based upon the chalk rock of the shore. The sea has perforated them in
 places by excavating caverns in the manner shown on the enlarged portion of the
 plan, some being as much as 20 to 25 yards in depth. The sides of these caverns are
 generally perpendicular, supporting the roofs, the height varying from 12 to 25 feet,
 but diminishing very much at the backs. They decrease in width from the entrances.
 The direction of the caverns is generally N.W. to S.E., but some are N.E. to S.W., and
 two, which take these different directions, sometimes meet. They are generally at
 an angle of 30° with the coast line.

      The prevailing winds are from the N.E. and S.W., but the N.W. wind here causes
the highest waves, and is the principal cause of the perforations of the cliffs.'

      The assumption is that the velocity of the waves is increased as they enter the
caverns, and thus strike the sides and roofs with great force, excavating the softest
portions of the chalk. The chalk is bedded horizontally in places, and is inter-
spersed by beds of rubbly chalk which is not stratified, and appears to have been
thrown in or forced between the solid beds, and the washing out, as above described,
loosens the solid chalk, and finally brings it down in masses. The enlarged plan
shows how projecting points are cut through and detached from the mainland,
becoming islands, which are, however, soon washed away.

      Thelines on the enlarged plan illustrate the extent of the erosive action on the
whole line of the cliffs, the fine lines showing the top and bottom boundaries as they

e.xisted in 1880 when a survey was made, and the thick lines the boundaries at pre-
sent existing, as found by a re-survey. In places upwards of 20 feet in width of cliff

have been lost in this period ; the average loss, however, over the whole length is not
so much.

    A sea-wall was built in 1878 at the Westgate end as a commencement of a terrace-

road under the face of the cliff, and another was built in 1884 to protect the portion
near the Infirmary at Margate, and further works of a similar kind are in progress.
The main object of these walls is to prevent the wearing away of the cliffs and loss
of land, but they will afford the means of constructing sea-terraces both under and
upon the cliffs.

     The whole shore consists of chalk with masses of rocks covered with sea-weed in
places, the remainder being open stretches of chalk covered more or less with sand.
There are no groynes and no shingle, so that there is no protection against the
erosion. The sand is shifting in nature, and the quantity varies at different seasons.

     The tides recede from the cliffs at low spring tides from 800 to 1,000 feet. At
Margate the tides rise 13 feet at neaps and 15^ feet at springs.

852 EEPORT-- 1886.

X3t a. A considerable quantity of shingle has been taken from the beach at Clacton,

          at about high-water mark, for road-making, and for concrete for building.
          d. It is said that some forty or fifty years ago cement stone was dredged and
          otherwise removed in front of Felixstowe, which removal had an injurious
          effect upon the coast, but the practice has long been discontinued.
1ft. Yes. a. At Felixstowe, between the ' Lodge Point ' and Martello Tower P. At
          Walton-on-the-Naze and Frinton. b. At Felixstowe the greatest loss was
          where there was ' flat ' ' Benthill " at the foot of cliffs. At Walton and Frinton,
         London Clay cliffs 40 to 68 feet above high water, c. In places as much as
          100 feet in ten years, but a fair average would be about half that amount.
          The loss at Felixstowe is practically slopped by groynes on beach, d. The tithe
         maps of the parishes in question should be compared with the ^J^ Ordnance
          Sm'vey of 1874. e. At Walton and Frinton it is, practically. The existence
          in the cliffs of potholes of sand and gravel containing water is also a cause
           of subsidence ; the water breaking out on the base, carrying the sand with it,
           loosens large masses of the upper part of cliff.
15. The loss of land at Walton and Frinton has gone on from time immemorial ; but
          it has been noticed that since the construction of the Harwich Harbour Con-
          servancy Board's works at Lnndguard Point there has been a greater scarcity
          of shingle on the beach at Walton and Frinton.
16. No.

17. Part of Landguard Common and the land at the mouth of the Deben is formed of

          ' blown sand ' covering the top of a shingle beach, a. Locally called ' Bent-
         hills.' !>. From 3 to 10 feet above high-water mark. d. That at Landguard
         Point is increasing, in consequence of the Conservancy Board's jetty, e. No;
          prevented by the ' bent grass ' or ' marram.'
18. Tracing accompanies this paper, showing Harwich Harbour Conservancy Board's
         works at entrance of harbour, and the scouring away of Landguard Point to
         the S.W., and accumulation of beach to the N.E. of same. As to which, see
         also various Reports presented to and published by the authority of Parliament.

                    By Alfred C. Savin, Church Street, Cromer, Norfolk.

 1. Norfolk, from Weybourn to Happisburgh, a distance of about twenty-five miles.

 A2. flat foreshore, backed by lofty cliffs, a. Sand, gravel, and clay. b. (1)

          About 250 feet; (2) about 150 feet.' (?) From Cromer they decline on both
           sides until at Hasbro' and Weybourn they disappear altogetlier.

 3. South-east to north-west
 4. East and north-east.' (?)
 5. a. North-east. b. It varies, but as all the large beds of shingle are to the north

           of Cromer, a gale from that direction is the best. c. North, as the set of the
            tide is from that direction.
 · About north-west.
 7. (1) a. About 18 feet. b. About 8 or 10 feet. (2) Sometimes as great as 500
           yards, but is very variable, as it greatly depends on the state of the beach,
            the wind, &c., so that it is impossible to state correctly the distance.
 8. Shingle and sand.

--9. Shingle : a. In scattered beds, except at West Kunton, Sherringham, and Wey-

          bourn. b. From high-water mark to about half low. c. North-easterly. '(?)
          d. From the size of a goose egg to that of a pigeon. e. At Weybourn,
          Sherringham, and West Runton it is piled up in regular steps, and protects
           the cliffs from the sea ; but at Cromer and at all the villages to the east

           it occurs in small detached beds of no great size.
10. There is no perceptible decrease at Weybourn, Sherringham, and West Runton

           but at Cromer it is steadily diminishing.
11. Entirely due to artificial abstraction.
12. Yes, at nearly all the villages on the coast, a. At right angles, b. From 50 to

          100 yards, c. Some half a mile, others about a quarter of a mile, and all inter-
           mediate distances, d. (1) First built at Cromer about fifty years ago. (2)
         Sometimes about 6 feet, at another time not so much ; very variable. (3) It
          greatly depends on which portion j^ou measure, as against tlie cUff it is level
         with the top, but down by the sea both sides will be of the same level, e.
          Pine and fir. f. I think if it had not been for the groynes Cromer would have
         been waslied away years ago, for when a hole is made in a groyne it rapidly

            lowers the level of the beach.

--13. [The following statements a to c refer to Cromer. W. T.] Yes. a. From high-

          water mark to about half low- water mark. b. For road-metal and building
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

          but by far the larger quantity is sent by rail to Runcorn for china-making, &c.

         c. By men who get their living by carting shingle, sand, &c. Lord Suffield
         and B. Bond Cabbell, lords of the manor, d. Yes ; but only at Cromer and

          East Runton, as they are the only places where the beach is removed to any

            extent.

14. Yes, on the whole coast, excepting parts protected by a sea-wall. a. At Cromer,
          Overstrand, Sidestrand, Trimmingbam, Mundesley, Bacton, and Happisburgh

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

         data are chiefly confined to work on the geology of the coast, Sec. e. Yes ; for
          on the north side of Cromer the loss is comparatively small, which is no doubt
          due to the large beds of shingle which occur from Cromer through East Runton,
         West Eunton, Beeston, Sherringham, and Weybourn, where the cliffs end and
          are replaced by large beds of stones.
ISi Yes, at Cromer a bed of shingle is of rare occurrence, for as soon as it is seen it
           is carted away. a. Yes. b. I do not think that the groynes stop the shingle,
          for as soon as they are full on the north side it washes over the top and so

            travels along.

16. a. No, only now on the Lincolnshire coast.
17. Only at Hasbro', where they replace the cliffs and extend up to Yarmouth.

         a. Marram Hills, so called from the species of grass which grows upon them
          and binds the locse sand together, d. I believe they increase near Yarmouth,
          as the water is gradually receding at that place, e. They very rarely shift, and
         are kept in tlieir jDlaces by the marram grass.

                 7. Weybourn to Palling.

By Clement Reid, Geological Survey Office, 28 Jermyn Street, London.

1. Norfolk, between Weybourn and Palling (23 miles).

2. Cliffy, except about three miles of alluvium protected by sand dunes, a. Boulder

clay and gravel, but for four miles near Weybourn the base of the cliff is
chalk (soft, with many flints), b. (1) 250 feet. (2) 80 feet. (3) or 3 or 4
feet below high water at Hempstead Marshes.

3. E. and W. at Weybourn, but curving near Cromer to the E.S.E., which direction

it retains for 16 miles of the distance.

ft. South-west.

5. a. N.E. to N.N.W. b. Gentle southerly or south-westerly, c. N.N.W.

6> Flood tide strong, close in sliore, from the N.N.W. Ebb weaker and in the op-

posite direction. At Cromer there is about three hours' difference between the

time of high water and the change in the direction of the current.

7. (1) 18 or 19 feet at spring tides.

8. For about 8 miles there is a foreshore of chalk, more or less covered with shifting
        sand and banks of loose unworn flints. The rest of the coast has a foreshore

of sand, generally resting on clay. Everywhere there is a shingle beach ex-

tending from above high water to about the level of mean tide. The beach

becomes more sandy southward.

9. a. Constantly varying according to the direction of the wind and the denudation

of the coast, b. Between mean tide and extreme high water, c. To the E.
and E.S.E. d. "Very various ; they^ are stones washed out of the boulder

           clay. e. Usually in one continuous slope, but varies with the wind.
lO. Constantly shifting, and moving back with the denudation of the cliff, but no-

          where greatly accumulating or diminishing.

--12. f. Prevent the beach travelhng to the S.E. j\\B. Under the higher cliffs the

old groynes have been crushed by landslips, and it is useless to erect fresh

ones unless the  cliffs are  sloped at a very low angle                                                                                                                  the cliffs are full of land-
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

springs,

13. Only at Cromer and Runton. a. Large flints are taken, principally from the

lower part of the beach, b. and c. Building (private individuals), road-
making (local authorities), and pottery (companies). The amount removed

has as yet been too small to make any appreciable difference, especiallj- as it

is immediately replaced.

1ft. Yes. a. Along the whole coast, b. See 2. e. About 2 yards annually, d. See

Redman's paper on the ' East Coast.' e. No.

15. Yes. a. No. b. At Shcrringham there is a short space bare of beach beneath

         the new groyne, and the cliff has been denuded much faster, east of the village,

since the groyne was erected. The erection of groynes at Cromer caused the

clay foreshore and base of the cliff to be exposed for many years at OTcrstrand,
but the denudation of the clay has now allowed a new beach to form, adjusted

to the new conditions. The groynes near Eccles seem to have efEectually
stopped denudation, and do not appear ever to have caused a scour.

16. No.
17. Yes; but they are of more importance further south, at Yarmouth, &c.

a. Slarram Hills.

19. The greatest denudation is caused by N.N.W. gales. On-shore winds do com-

paratively little. The tides scour, during gales, to so great a depth that no

groynes  can  permanently protect  this  coast                      probably they cannot  even alter
                                                                 ;

                    8. The North-West Coast of Norfolk.

          By J. S. Valentine, M.Inst.C.B., 6 Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster.

  1. The north-west coast of Norfolk.
 2. The coast from King's Lynn to Wells is flat, with the exception of Hunstanton

          Cliff, which extends from the village of Hunstanton St. Edmund's on the
          south to the old village of Hunstanton on the north, a distance of about

           1\ mile.
               a. The cliff is composed of Lower Greensand and the lower beds of the

          Chalk, separated by a band of Red Chalk about 3 feet tliick. The dip of the
          strata is to the north and east.

              b. The greatest height of the clifE is 60 feet above high-water mark at
           the lighthouse, decreasing to the level of the beach at each end.

               There are dunes of blown sand at Holme, and at Holkham, near Wells.
 3. From Lynn to St. Edmund's Point about E.N.E. ; thence to Gore Point trend-

          ing towards the east ; from Gore Point nearly due east.
 4. North-west and south-west.
  5. a, b, c. North-west.
 6. The flow of the tide is to the south.
 7. Spring tides in Lynn Roads range 23 feet 3 inches; neap tides 14 feet 2 inches.

              Opposite Hunstanton Cliff the width from high- to low-water mark in

           spring tides is 600 yards.
 8. The area covered by the tide is principally sand.

              Along the base of Hunstanton Cliff, when the sand is swept away during
         north winds, the Lower Greensand (whith contains a considerable amount of
          iron) forms the foreshore. The rock is divided by joints running seawards at

           right angles to the cliff.

               The greatest accumulation of shingle is between Hunstanton Cliff and
          Wolferton Creek, seven miles ; south of which there is none or very little.
 9. a. Various, c. North to south, d. Generally small.

--10. There has been no apparent diminution during the time I have noticed it say

            twenty-five years,
11. See 13.

12. The groynes are generally at right angles to the shore ; but in some instances I
          have erected short spur-groynes on the leeward side, which have collected
         shingle in larger quantities, and so stopped the cutting away of the top of
          the beach, which occurred before these spur-groynes were erected.
             In 1862 the sea broke through the Heacham Beach. I then erected a

                                                                        TOP OF BEACH.

                   --                                               \

number of groynes, as described above, which have accumulated a strong
beach. (See examples near the Eifle Butt.)

     The groynes are constructed of timber.
--856 REPOET 1886.

13. a. The principal part of tbe shingle removed artificially is taken from Snittes-

         ham beach, about five miles south of Hunstanton. It is there that the shingle

           accumulates.

               b. For road-making in Marshland and the Fens, and for concrete for public
          works along the coast.

               c. It is sold by the lord of the manor to road surveyors, contractors, &c.
1ft. a. The coast is wasting at Hunstanton Cliff, vrhere large falls occur every

             winter.

               b. Lower Greensand capped by the lower beds of the Chalk. Height of
           cliffs vary from to 60 feet.

                c. I should say that during the last forty years from 20 to 30 feet have

      --been lost perhaps more in some places.
               e. The loss is confined to the cliff, at the base of which there is very little

             shingle.

15. No.

16. The eastern side of The Wash and the north coast of Norfolk as far as WeUs

          have generally a margin of land, of varying width, which has been gained
          from the sea, and which is retained by artificial means, such as embankments,

            groynes, &c.

        --Some enclosures are ancient. Two the Holme Marshes, north of the
      --village of Hunstanton, and Lord Leicester's enclosures near Wells have been

         made within the last thirty years. Both enclosures were made by carrying an
         embankment on the north side from the high land to the ' dunes,' which

           protected the land from the west.

17. There are ' dunes ' protecting the lands enclosed at Holme and near Wells. (See

           16.)
                b. Greatest height perhaps 20 feet.

              e. They are covered with marram grass, and do not blow over the land.

             9. The Coast of Pembrokeshire-- Southern Part.

           By Kenneth W. A. G. McAlpin, Assoc.Inst.C.E., Pembroke Dock.'

 1. The coast of Pembrokeshire and'Milford Harbour.
 2. Rocks principally, having frequent bays of sand where the continuity of the

            rock-line is broken.

              a. The cliffs are composed of Old Bed Sandstone, Carboniferous Lime-
          stone, of slate,- and anthracite coal-measures with grey sandstone.

               Tlie Old Red Sandstone, as a rule, is not in large blocks suitable for masonry,
          or even rubble-walling, and is not well able to resist the exposure to weather.
         It is much protected by the growth of lichens, mosses, &c., above water mark,
         which defend it from the rays of the sun and frost, and make the cliffs appear
          of a greenish grey colour. The hardest specimens of the red sandstone, how-
          ever, retain their redness, as at St. Ann's Head. The area between high and
          low water is greatly protected from erosion by being almost hidden by the
          numerous shells of the limpet tribe that are everywhere to be found ; also
          mussels in great abundance, and the varied forms of sea-weed.

               The limestone cliffs are light-blue in colour, like the colour of a wild
          pigeon ; the stones are in most cases of large size, great soundness and strength,

      --suitable for engineering dock or fort works for example. Notably large and

          good blocks are to be obtained from the Pen-y-holt and adjacent cliffs, Caldy
         Island, and Lydstep ; at other places the limestone is much the same in appear-
          ance, but is composed of smaller blocks and rubble, well and solidly packed
          together. These limestone cliffs form a noble escarpment against the sea; the

         same face is now presented to the weather that has borne the storms of many

          centuries, as is clearly to be seen all along the limestone coast, but most notably
          at the Elegug Stack and St. Govan's Head, where the face is weathered in a most

         remarkable manner, like a honeycomb, sometimes perforated as if by large
          boring drills, evidently the work of hundreds of years.

              The stone when burned in kilns makes excellent white lime for building
          and agricultural purposes, and there are a few quarries for these uses.

               In some places the large courses are quite horizontal ; at other places the
          beds are pitched on end vertically. They also lie at every possible angle,
         sometimes grading ofE from one angle to another, and are sometimes abruptly

           broken.

               The slate clifEs of North Pembrokeshire do not stand up bold and upright,
          like these of limestone; but at the distance look like the red sandstone cliffs,
          viz., rounder, bluffer, and more receding in figure. In colour and vegetable
         covering they much resemble the red sandstone.

               It remains to tell of the coal-measures where they meet the sea. The water
         works out the bottom, the top falls down, the loose stones make a beach
          wearing into pebbles, and the finer material becomes sand on a flat slope to
         seaward : this is the case at St. Bride's Bay, and at Amroth, between Tenby and
         Caermarthen. These coal strata are mostly mixed with grey sandstone, clay,
         and various loose materials over which the sea has made considerable advances.
         There can be no doubt but that St. Bride's Bay has surrendered much of its
         land to the water in years gone by ; but the progress of the sea appears now to
         be arrested by the rocks that take the wash at the south end of the bay, and
          also by a remarkable ridge of pebbles at Newgale Sands, which has been driven
         before the waves, and thus made a barrier against themselves. This pebble-
          ridge is of great size, about a couple of miles long, great width and height,
         the individual pebbles being of all sizes up to about 12 inches diameter,
          and of various kinds of rock

              b. Greatest height of cliff about 200 feet. Least, a wash at high water.

           Average about 150 teet.
  3. Coast line very irregular ; there is no considerable length of any given direction.
 ·1. The prevailing wind is rvesteiiy, but not due west. It varies from south-west to

            north-west.

               Storms (when it blows hard) invariably begin from the E.S.E. and work
          round by west to north-west, from which quarter they finish or blow them-
         selves out. Our principal gales always come from this westerly direction, viz.,
          from off the Atlantic, and the south-west coast bears the brunt of these gales.
 5. a. South-west wind raises high waves.

                b. West.
               c. Our shingle does not travel [beyond the baj^s in which it occurs].
 6. There is a strong tide passing the coast six hours northward and six hours
          southward alternately. As it affects the coast it is most felt at St. Govan's

         Kamsey Island and its sound. Where the current is running contrary to a
          strong wind a very heavy sea is raised : this is often the case off St. Ann's
         Head when the tide out of Milford Haven runs out against a westerly gale, and
          produces high and broken waves.

13. In general terms it may be stated that there are no removals of stone, sand, or

shingle from our coast. These when wanted are obtained from inland quarries,

            for roads, buildings, &c.                                                                  That it

able to hold their own. The same cannot be so confidently stated with respect

to the coal and shingle shores.

happens to be then a storm that washes the sand away, there have appeared

at both these places stumps and roots of ancient trees, and in the case of

Newgale Sands there have been exposed stone pavements and walls which were

witnessed by reliable men in the last century (see Fenton's 'Pembrokeshire ').

Traditions are told in the county of forests occupying these two bays. It is

obvious that the sea has not finished its advances at these parts of the coast.

that they came from the sea.

Scotch rose, is also common on the sand. The purple sea-rocket, stork"s bill,

sea-milkwort, the yellow horned poppy, and such like flowers, with wire-haired

grasses in great variety. Another reason why the sand does not blow away

is that most of the high winds are accompanied by rain, except the east wind,
so that little would blow away when wet ; and the east wind would only have
the effect in blowing the top dry grains to the westward, which would only

be a superficial action, and not go below the roots of the herbage.

19. There are pebbles at Freshwater West Baj^ about the size of those at Newgale,

but not anything like the extent or variety of stones ; when the waves are very
high these are rolled violently against one another, and produce a deafening

noise that is lost in the general roaring of the storm; but it happens sometimes

that huge waves, locally called the ' ground swell,' come in and break on the

shore, wlicn there is no wind. They are the effect of storms that have blown

themselves out at sea, and the waves rolling in break on the coast, .sometimes
with great violence, when there is no wind. These agitate the pebbles, so that

they can be heard distinctly in Pembroke and Pembroke Dock, a distance of
eight or nine miles. The attrition thus caused must wear the pebbles con-
siderably. It is probable, however, that new loose stones are being washed in
to repair this loss. In this way in low places on this coast the sea has before

it the well-assigned duty of washing up and piling up a barrier against itself.

     This report refers to that portion of the coast of Pembrokeshire situate between
Aberbach, on the northern coast, and Ricket's Head, in St. Bride's Bay.

     The clifFs in this coast line vary in height from 50 to 250 feet, with an average
height of about 100 feet. [The rocks forming the coast-line belong to the Archsean,
Cambrian, Ordovician, and Carboniferous series, with intrusive and contemporaneous

--volcanic rocks. H. H.]

     Recent sea-beaches are plentiful all along the coast, and on the upper portions
of the numerous small bays and creeks there will, generally, be found a ridge of
accumulated pebbles protecting the rocks and the alluvial deposits where sucli occur.

Whitesand Bay about 1,000 yards ; that at Aberma'5\T about 800 yards. All the other

bars are under 500 yards in length, measuring along the ridge.

There are evidences that nearly all these bars are increasing in height and base.

The pebbles are principally fragments from the local rocks, and the pebbles are

usually well rounded.

There are no groynes on this coast. Generally speaking, the shingle does not

travel in any direction except landwards. At Newgale and Whitesand Bay the

shingle travels slightly in a N.N.W. direction.

    It is a common practice amongst local farmers to take the sea-sand in large

quantities for mixing with manure for agricultural purposes. The gravel and pebbles

are also taken, where available, for road-making.

The range of tide is generally about 17 feet at spring tide, about 11 feet at

Beap tide. The tides run six knots at spring tide through Ramsey Sound with

strong eddies near all the points. Flood to the north, ebb to the south, curving

round St. David's and into St. Bride's Bay, where they get very weak.

The prevailing winds are south-west to north-west, and these are of most im-

portance in raising high waves.

  --JVbrth-east of St. David's Head. At Abermawr the sea has driven back the
Ashingle very considerably in recent years.
                                             limekiln at the eastern end of the bay

and a roadway which was carried round a point to the adjacent creek of Aberbach

have been washed away. About an acre of land, a large portion of which was under

cultivation, has been eroded in the course of 60 years. In the winter of 1885, during

a heavy gale from the northward, the sea drove back the shingle all along its

line, but chiefly in its centre, partly tilling up a roadway at the back and damming
up a stream, causing it to flood the adjoining meadows, and necessitating the closing

of the highway. Here, as at Newgale and Whitesand Bay, submerged trees have

been seen after a gale. In the memory of a resident, now about 80 years of age,

the trees thus exposed in his earlier days were used for firewood and other purposes,

and he remembers a sleigh, for use on a farm, being made from the wood. All the
wood obtained was in a good state of preservation.

The beach at Abercastle has been cut into by the sea about 50 yards during the

last 50 years.

At Abereiddy the beach has been increased to the extent of about 50 yards on the

sea side, the additional shingle having accumulated from the waste of a neigh-

bouring slate quarrj-.

     The beach at Aberpwll has been eroded to the extent of 10 yards within the

--memory of the present residents.
     Whitcmnd Bay. This bay is mainly excavated in drift, the bounding cliffs on

the north and sovith being formed of Cambrian rocks. [The drift consists of an

·earthy boulder clay containing ice-scratched boulders, mainly fragments of local

--rocks; many of these boulders lie along the shore. H. HiCKS.]

    The shingle beach is about 1,000 yards long, with a maximum width of about

SO feet, and a mean width of about 40 feet. The seaward face has many small

irregular ridges. The shingle travels slightly towards the north end of the bay, and

in this direction therefore the beach is widest.

The sand on the foreshore is 208 yards wide-- from low-water mark to the beach.
Blown sand covers the ground inside tlie beach, in little hillocks of fiom 12 to 15

feet high, each having a seaward slope of from 23° to 25°. The land thus thinly

covered with sand-hiUs rises to about 100 feet above the sea, but the sand is some-

times carried inland as far as the stream which runs to St. David's, about a mile
from the shore. This blown sand does not affect the coast-line, except in such places
where it is exposed to the direct action of the waves, by which it is easily eroded,
and is then carried out to sea (subsequently to undergo re-deposition) by the rapid

eddies formed by the swift tidal current finding its way through Ramsey Sound.

     The sea has made considerable inroads at Whitesand Bay, the shingle moving

landwards. A rock now 20 yards from the beach marks "the site of the road

forty years ago, the shingle beach being then on the seaward side of the road. The

new road, made twenty years ago, was protected by a sea-wall ; but this has been in

part destroyed and great gaps cut into the road. At the north-east corner of the
bay there is a field which has lost a width of about 34 yard's in fifty years.

In the northern part of the ba)' stumps of trees and peat are laid bare during

westerly gales, when the sand of the foreshore is cleared away.

  the main bay by cliffs about 100 feet high. The sea is encroaching here, some 40
  yards of land having been lost during the last fifty years.

   --Coast from Forth-lislty to Nemgale Sands. Porth-lisky is a small inlet excavated in

 the softer beds C'f the Pebidian series ; it is bounded by the harder beds of the
  Pebidian on the west and by the hard granitoid or Dimetian rock on the east. The
  cliffs in the bay are about 90 feet high. [ They consist of a series of nearly vertical
 beds, belonging to the Pebidian groups. Some have an ashen-like appearance ; others

 --are felsitic breccias, which decompose very readily. H. Hicks.] The shingle in the

  bay varies in size from gravel up to pebbles 18 inches in diameter. Old inhabitants
 believe that it has moved up the bay about 10 yards within their memory.

       Porth-clais Creek is the outlet of the river which drains the St. David's area. The-
 banks on each side run up from a cliffy ba.se in a sharp slope to a height of about
  100 feet.

      During the last fifty years the sea has cut away about 40 yards of the upper part
 of the harbour, and also some of the cliff on the west side. This is partly due to vessels.
 which carry away ballast, but also to the wash from a heavy run in the creek during
 S.W. gales. The pier near the mouth of the creek has been breached by the sea
 during the last few years, thus accelerating the cutting process.

      Along the cliffs from Porth-clais eastwards to Carbwddy there have been some heavy
 slips, but there is nothing to enable one to judge as to how much has fallen within
 recent years. The alterations which have been made in the pathways show tliat the
 loss must have been considerable in some places.

     In Carbwddy the shingle has moved seaward 22 yards ; the slope of the new rido-e
 is about 23°. This gain is due to the waste from a large quarry which is worked

 here. This shingle, being the recent waste from the quarry, is hardly formed into

  pebbles.

      From Carbwddy to Porth-y-rhaw the waste from the cliffs appears to be less thaa

--further west. [These cliffs consist of Cambrian rocks, chiefly sandstones and flaggy

 beds. H. Hicks.]

      In the cliffs under Llanunwas, extending from Porth-y-rhaw to Solva, there have
 been very heavy slips. In one place, between a rock called the Cradle and one called
 Gewny,the entrance of Solva Creek, the slips of the cliff have cut back fuUy 10 feet in
. gaps along a distance of 500 feet in about thirty years. Solva Creek has not undergone-
 any noticeable change in that time. To the east of Solva Creek there are heavy slips

 every winter. Between the point called Dinas Mawr and Pencwm at the north end

 of Newgale Sands the slips have been few and of no great extent.

       This bay is excavated in Carboniferous beds, the Cambrian rocks forming the

 north-west margin. At Cwy Mawr, where the Carboniferous rocks commence, about

 20 yards have been eroded during the last fifty years. The cliffs at the south-eastern
 side of the bay are also of Carboniferous rocks. Between these cliffs there is a shingle
 beach, rather more than a mile long, with an extreme width of about 110 feet and a

 mean width of about 90 feet; the landward slope from the summit is about 46 feet
 long. The seaward slope, about 64 feet long, has an intermediate full, which does not
 seem to be caused by the neap tide, as it is too wavy and irregular : it changes with
 every gale. The pebbles vary from 3 to 14 inches in diameter ; they are sometimes
 mixed with patches of small gravel.

      The spring tides range 17 feet ; neap tides 11 feet.

      Some people believe that the beach has travelled landwards to a considerable
 amount, but there seems no evidence of any important change during the last eighty-
 years. The amount of shingle is said to be increasing, and it has a slight tendencT
 to travel from S.S.E. to N.N.W.

      Behind the northern part of the shingle beach there is a marshy alluvial flat^
 about 10 feet below the summit of the shingle.

       Seaward of the shingle beach there is sand, 230 yards -wide at low water ; trunks of
 trees have been seen here when the sand has been cleared away by heavy storms.

      Giraldus Cambrensis states that in the winter of 1234, by reason of a violent storm,
 ' the surface of the earth [at Newgale], which had been covered for many ages, re-
 appeared, and discovered the trunks of trees cut off, standing in the very sea itself,
 the strokes of the hatchet appearing as if made only yesterday. The soil was very
 black and the wood like ebony. By a wonderful revolution the road for ships
 became impassable, and looked, not like a shore, but like a grove cut down, perhaps,
 at the time of the Deluge, or not long after, but certainly in very remote ages, being
 by degrees consumed and swallowed up by the encroachments of the sea.'
--862 REPORT 1886.

    Edward Llwyd, a Welsh historian, also states that the trees, 'which retained
manifest signs of the strokes of the axe at the falling of them,' were again seen and
noted in the year 1590, and the trunks of the fallen trees are said to have been seen
by various persons in recent years.

     The foregoing evidence appears to support the theory of submergence, rather
than that of simple encroachment of tlie sea.

     There is an old tradition, still current locally, that previous to the year 520 a

large tract of land existed on the present northern shore of Pembrokeshire, extending

from Ramsey Island (ofE St. David's) to Bardsey Island (ofE the coast of Caernarvon-
shire). This supposed tract of land was known as Cantref y Gnaelod (i.e. the Low-

land Hundred), and is said to have been inundated about the year A.D. 520.

   We have not been able to discover any reliable proofs that the land inundated

was ever connected with the coast to wiiich this report refers. On the contrary,

nearly all the evidence, either physical or historical, opposes the local tradition re-

ferred to. The authorities we have consulted differ very greatly in their statements
regarding the extent and locality of the inundated lowland. [See accompanying

copy of chart on previous pa^e.]

  --Theophilus Jones, of Brecon, ' a very celebrated Welsh herald,' writes : ' History

as well as tradition agree in stating that Cantref y Gwaehd, ... of which my

ancestor Gwyddno Goronhir . . . was the king or reigning prince, reached all the
way to the Irish coast ; that it was only a river that divided them till it was

inundated.'

   --Carlisle, in his ' Topographical Dictionary,' says : ' Canirrfy Gn-aelod is supposed

to have occupied that portion of St. George's Cliannel which lies between the main-
land and a line drawn from Bardsey Isle to Ramsey, in the county of Pembroke,
and the proprietor is called in ancient authors Lord of Cantref y Gwaelod. in Dyfed
Dyfed in old records always meaning the county of Pembroke. Mr. Edward Llwyd
greatly corroborates this tradition, having observed roots and stumps at a low ebb

in the sands between Borth and Aberdyfi, in the county of Cardigan. And Giraldus
says that St. David's Head extended farther into the sea, and tliat trunks of trees

with fresh marks of the axe were apparent.'

Carlisle had, evidently, no acquaintance with the coast of Pembrokeshire. In

cjuoting Giraldus' remarks it is plain that he supposes Newgale to lie to the north of

WeSt. David's Head.  cannot find that Giraldus an3'where states that St. David's

Head extended farther into the sea.

     Carlisle, in another place, says :--' History informs us that all the bay between
the Causeway [St. Patrick's Causeway] and the county of Cardigan was formerly dry

land, called Cantref y Gwaelod.'

  --In Camden's ' Britannia,' p. 632, we are informed : ' And that saying of William

Rufus shews that the lands were not here [? St. David's Head] di.sjointed by any
great sea, who, when he beheld Ireland from these rocks, said he could easily make a
bridge of ships whereby he might walk from England into that kingdom.' In the
foregoing Camden evidently misquotes Giraldus Cambrensis, who, in his 'Itinerary
through Wales,' tells us that ' in clear weather the [Irish] moxintains are visible '
from St. Davids, ' and the passage over the Irish Sea may be performed in one short
day.' Ireland is to be seen even nowadays from this coast in clear weather.

  --In Meyrick's ' History of Cardigan,' in his references to Cantref y Gwaelod, we

find: ' The boundary of this \_Cantref y Gwaelod] on the north-west was, we are

told, Sarn Badrig, or St. Patrick's Causeway, wliicli runs out to sea in a serpentine
manner, about two-and-twenty miles from the coast of Merionethshire, about half-

way between Harlech and Barmouth. The coast included between this causeway

and Cardigan bounded it on the north-east and south sides, and a supposed line
from Cardigan to the extremity of Sarn Badrig formed its western limit.'
